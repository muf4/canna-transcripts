[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Gary Corlette with Southern California
Edison I'm Brian Anderson with Anderson
[SPEAKER_04]: Porter design one architecture firm based
in Cambridge, Mass and now newly here in
[SPEAKER_04]: in Fullerton, California And I guess yeah
the interesting thing here is what is is
[SPEAKER_04]: that you know we're here at this event
talking about cannabis growing and talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about indoor indoor agriculture and how
Growers interface with utilities how
[SPEAKER_04]: architects and facility design interfaces
with the utility early, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things that we really
encourage is that Cultivators get in touch
[SPEAKER_00]: with this early on in the process get us
involved it's There's a couple of things
[SPEAKER_00]: that about the electrical system a lot of
lot of things So start with the the demand
[SPEAKER_00]: issues Yeah, all right we we operate on a
10-year planning schedule plan,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we we plan out our grid Enhancements 10
years in advance Because it takes us that
[SPEAKER_00]: long it takes if we want to relocate a
distribution line it takes a year to two
[SPEAKER_00]: years to do that if we want to Upgrade a
substation it could take us three to five
[SPEAKER_00]: years to do that or if we build a new
substation It could take five to seven
[SPEAKER_04]: years and what kind of what kind of what
kind of crimp in your city your system
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it count as a one cannabis facility
put what what what crimp in your system
[SPEAKER_04]: does?
[SPEAKER_04]: 12 or what is a hundred thousand square
feet of canopy or 200,000 square feet
[SPEAKER_04]: canopy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Affect your your 10-year planning cycle,
so let's take first off it depends on
[SPEAKER_00]: where they're at so You know in California
a megawatt of power will power about 750
[SPEAKER_00]: homes Yeah, a small facility Cannabis
facility is you know easily one to three
[SPEAKER_00]: megawatts, and it's it's in an area of Ten
to twenty thousand square feet right so
[SPEAKER_00]: now we're putting you know 750 to 2500
homes in the equivalent of 20,000 square
[SPEAKER_00]: feet our grids typically aren't Built out
to provide that type of power in that in
[SPEAKER_04]: that density, and there's no coordination
between farmers or is there coordination
[SPEAKER_04]: between farmers and planning boards and
the utility as it like because as an
[SPEAKER_04]: industry We're pushed right there's
stigma, and we're pushed into areas that
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's owned for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't go anywhere else right and but is
that coordinated with you does that help
[SPEAKER_04]: you does that hint?
[SPEAKER_04]: What does that hinder you?
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases it can hinder us yeah,
just in the in being able to to meet the
[SPEAKER_00]: demand You know we've got Cannabis in
particular has gone into Low population
[SPEAKER_00]: areas Well they're more I'll call them
underserved areas underserved communities
[SPEAKER_00]: right and so there aren't a lot of
industrial businesses in those areas
[SPEAKER_00]: they're more zone for residential or You
know small industrial And then when you
[SPEAKER_00]: bring in a Cannabis facility now you're
talking about major loads that the
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure that the infrastructure
wasn't prepared for it And had we known
[SPEAKER_00]: you know ten years ago that it was coming
we could have planned for it But it so
[SPEAKER_04]: when's the right time when's the right
time for the?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know for the farmer for the cannabis
you know indoor grower for the outdoor
[SPEAKER_04]: group not the outdoor But let's say mixed
light grower to alert you like when's the
[SPEAKER_04]: right time in their planning process?
[SPEAKER_04]: They start talking to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it you directly or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there is there a team that that that is
that yeah, so they need to contact their
[SPEAKER_00]: local planner yeah So we have planners in
each of our districts, and they take care
[SPEAKER_00]: of each of the individual cities and
counties yeah And they can look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: grid in that particular area and then
Decide what needs to be done to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: them with the capacity They may tell them
that we can't get your capacity for you
[SPEAKER_00]: know could be two or three years right But
you know always we will get your capacity,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it may not be on the time frame that
you're looking for So that's the first
[SPEAKER_00]: step and you should do that as early in
the process as possible as soon as you
[SPEAKER_00]: start thinking that that you're going to
be meeting that that load then you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the planner and Talk to them about
you need to have do you need to have a
[SPEAKER_04]: full one-line diagram?
[SPEAKER_04]: Produced by by electrical engineer in
order to begin the process, or can you
[SPEAKER_04]: just start talking in generality?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well you can talk in generalities,
but you won't get into the system until
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a one-line drawing And there's
there's fees associated with with doing
[SPEAKER_04]: that Well yeah, right so that means so you
know as an architect a one-line drawing is
[SPEAKER_04]: comes out of you know three two two months
of planning work before Before the
[SPEAKER_04]: engineer is prepared has enough basis of
design knows how many plants are going to
[SPEAKER_04]: go in knows how many lights go in knows
how much water is being used right in
[SPEAKER_04]: order from a Electrical perspective to to
say plug load light load HVAC load Here's
[SPEAKER_04]: what I need for amperage right so we've
got we you know that the Arctic and grow
[SPEAKER_04]: team and the farmer have Two two months of
work to do before we can give you what you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to drop the power Well, it's it's
it's at that point that or a service order
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a service or to get into our system
where we start really planning it yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: and figuring out how to do it now it could
be two years from that point to We could
[SPEAKER_00]: get a drop possibly wow so I mean we do
things as quickly as possible two things
[SPEAKER_00]: happen first off when they get in in line
We we operate on a first come first serve
[SPEAKER_00]: basis first one in line this first one
gets out And there's no jumping in the
[SPEAKER_00]: line, so You know basically that's one of
the reasons you want to get into the queue
[SPEAKER_00]: as soon as possible because You know they
have to work through the queue to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: your project before they can design it and
install it right and so So one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: things are you know affecting?
[SPEAKER_04]: Power delivery beyond the timing of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the other so is it location?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, location, so you have think think
about our our grid in terms of ductwork or
[SPEAKER_00]: An irrigation system so you start out with
a larger line at the very beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: because you got a lot a lot of flow And
then as you get further out onto this down
[SPEAKER_00]: it steps down to keep the pressure up Our
electrical grid is exactly the same way so
[SPEAKER_00]: the further out away from our our Power
sources we get the smaller the line Sizes
[SPEAKER_00]: are and that means that there's less
capacity out there right so it's important
[SPEAKER_00]: to know where you are on our grid and How
how capacity limited the grid is at that
[SPEAKER_03]: point So just quickly can you can you
talk?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get specific with some
geographic markets like you deal with
[SPEAKER_03]: Carpinteria There's lots of cannabis
cultivation there the Valley downtown Los
[SPEAKER_03]: Angeles kind of what's what's some stuff
you're seeing and each of those Yes,
[SPEAKER_03]: so we don't cannabis cultivation facility
markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so Just a clarification Edison
doesn't cover the LA proper that's handled
[SPEAKER_00]: by LADWP And so I don't know what their
issues are in there, but I didn't three or
[SPEAKER_00]: four yeah, but in In Carpinteria
Carpinteria and Santa Barbara areas are
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually impacted areas for us It has to
do with they basically have one main
[SPEAKER_00]: transmission line into that area and And
it's already is is impacted so growers
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to add capacity add to that impact
and We look at other facilities like
[SPEAKER_00]: Desert Hot Springs we have In Desert Hot
Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of transmission that comes
through there, but we didn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: have the the distribution capacity to do
that because that area was Initially it
[SPEAKER_00]: was going to be five acre home lots right
and And now we're putting ten thousand and
[SPEAKER_00]: twenty thousand Square foot cannabis
facilities on there each of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know in a one to three or four
megawatt Requirement so that taxes us as
[SPEAKER_00]: well because we weren't the the grid at
that area wasn't Designed for the the load
[SPEAKER_03]: that's out there now So take Desert Hot
Springs as a specific example.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you projecting?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say three years from now the demand
from the cannabis community and Desert Hot
[SPEAKER_00]: Springs It's big yeah, we don't have the
numbers off the top of my head,
[SPEAKER_04]: but that's in the pipeline That is what
your team is working on is figuring out
[SPEAKER_04]: how much is this gonna grow how big is
gonna grow where I'm gonna put this How
[SPEAKER_04]: much does the facility?
[SPEAKER_04]: design affect Power consumption are there
right in just in terms of an indoor grow
[SPEAKER_04]: versus a mixed light grow or do you do you
take that into account when you project
[SPEAKER_04]: out?
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to yes, so we're seeing in Indoor
grows that that we're averaging about 35
[SPEAKER_00]: watts per square foot That's that's that
is that's that's down when we first
[SPEAKER_00]: started a couple of years ago We were
looking at 51 watts per square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting More efficient as we go
along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what's driving that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any idea what's driving that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that just data?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just data now that we're we're
getting better data On it we did when we
[SPEAKER_00]: first started looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really didn't have a lot of data and
And now as we've gotten more data,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're getting better numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting better at estimating What
the loads are going to be and that's an
[SPEAKER_04]: indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah The greenhouse grows I don't have the
specific number, but it's probably in the
[SPEAKER_00]: range of 15 to 20 watts per square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah So it's it it does matter can you
know a lot and then the addition is the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses typically are are conditioned
with water walls basically swamp coolers
[SPEAKER_00]: and Indoor grows are typically done with
DX units package units and so a lot less
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient than than the evaporative
cooling Is there any?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any call?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you represent do you represent gas as
well as electric or not just just electric
[SPEAKER_04]: so Then to speculate Differences in gas so
we see nationally, you know a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: difference between gas prices and electric
prices will drive choice of cooling
[SPEAKER_04]: systems Let's talk about indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm speaking specifically about indoor
grows or closed environment greenhouses
[SPEAKER_04]: That aren't open air so closed air
greenhouses or full indoor environments
[SPEAKER_04]: make decisions on using Chiller,
you know chilled water and chiller systems
[SPEAKER_04]: versus DX and electrical systems based on
based on energy price.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah so is there any way to I Mean I'm
speculating here a guess you're reaching
[SPEAKER_04]: for something but say to say is there any
is gas availability similar to electrical
[SPEAKER_04]: availability in your markets in your
specific markets and if they are would
[SPEAKER_04]: there be any relief for for the electrical
demand if people were considering
[SPEAKER_00]: something other than a DX system because
yeah, so There the gas has the same
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that we do in terms of their
pipelines They have a major desert hot
[SPEAKER_00]: springs in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a major pipeline that runs
through that valley But they don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: major gas lines coming off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so their gas system distribution
system is similar to ours and in that
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten-year plan is because none of our
equipment is off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all custom-built right and so that's
a two-to-three year process of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: that and then the Everything that we do
when it's major construction like that has
[SPEAKER_00]: to be approved by the Public Utilities
Commission So bureaucracy, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and and so it just takes time for that to
happen That could be a two to three year
[SPEAKER_04]: process itself So given that it would
still make sense, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's gonna take these it's gonna
take this amount of time just to get
[SPEAKER_04]: electric It's gonna take this amount of
time to get gas right and I'm looking at
[SPEAKER_04]: ways to Decrease load so if load and load
distribution is effective All of us from
[SPEAKER_04]: homeowners to indoor ag growers What?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there is a future is there a what is
the position here in Southern California
[SPEAKER_04]: on on on dividing your your your your
operation into both gas and electric so
[SPEAKER_00]: California has a goal to be decarbonized
by 2045 which means that essentially gas
[SPEAKER_00]: will not for the most part not be
available for For most things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so this is This is interesting right
because around the country.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a conversation that's starting
which is We we understand from a carbon
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective that if we have Renewable
electrical sources that is our goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would want to do all electric homes,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: All electric cannabis grows all electric
indoor ag if we can get our Get if we can
[SPEAKER_04]: get our electricity from a renewable
source What happens when our electrical
[SPEAKER_04]: generation is from 30% efficient gas-fired
plants or from?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe even lower efficiency cold fire coal
fire plants So aiming for the same goals
[SPEAKER_04]: aiming for carbon neutrality aiming for
efficiency there are Really efficient
[SPEAKER_04]: on-site gas systems that are up around 80%
efficient today, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying no system that we install
is gonna last forever, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: My boiler in my house is maybe gonna last,
you know, ten years if I'm lucky,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I'm gonna replace this system So
let me say is there an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_04]: install today?
[SPEAKER_04]: A gas-fired system because it's 80%
efficient knowing that in 30 years to meet
[SPEAKER_04]: the 2045 goal Well, that's not for 30
years away.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 25 years away 25 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm definitely gonna replace that system,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no question and I'm not saying
that there aren't opportunities to do
[SPEAKER_00]: those types of things that The challenge
is is harder because of the policy that
[SPEAKER_00]: says we're driving towards total
electrification the goal is for California
[SPEAKER_00]: is by 2050 or thereabouts to be But what
are those powers general?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the general?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where we are we buying power from from
Utah and it's coal fired and we know it's
[SPEAKER_00]: in in California terms, it's it's all
renewable Where's the percentage of
[SPEAKER_04]: renewable today?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you do you know that?
[SPEAKER_00]: For our grid, it's about 30 little over
30% It's 30% renewable much higher than
[SPEAKER_04]: other places in the country, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And our our goal as as a company is is to
be 70% by 2050 2045 So what what are some
[SPEAKER_04]: things then let's so let's take that let's
take energy efficiency and carbon
[SPEAKER_04]: neutrality How does that flow from it from
it from your perspective from all of our
[SPEAKER_04]: goals?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some efficiency things that you'd
like to see in terms of in terms of indoor
[SPEAKER_04]: plant growth?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it is it LED lighting?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that is that a big game change?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was talking about I was talking about
cooling loads, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're growing with HPS.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know we have a lot of cooling And if we
stick with a DX system or some sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: direct exchange What about lighting is
there ways in which we can reduce power in
[SPEAKER_04]: these facilities, right by changing our
lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so LED lighting is has made a
tremendous Growth in the industry in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of the the type of lighting that's being
produced today, right and and so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: see tremendous drops in loads 30 to 30 to
40 percent in just your lighting load and
[SPEAKER_00]: then your conditioning load drops on drugs
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so we're seeing Savings of roughly
40 to 50 percent Total savings of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting and interactive effects on the
air conditioning system Yeah, so and we
[SPEAKER_04]: know that there's we know that that's that
adoption rate is slow, right because
[SPEAKER_04]: because Nationally and globally it's been
this industry has been done indoor indoor
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis grow has been Dominated by high
pressure sodium, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the whole agricultural industry has
been dominated by high pressure sodium,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's you know, when you talk about
controlled environment agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: Covering the gamut of crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's the same situation issue same
issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah So what what is so is there is there
a is there a line that you know Southern
[SPEAKER_04]: California Addison has for the for the
indoor grow for the indoor grow Industry
[SPEAKER_04]: relative to is their position Is it just
is it a is it a general push to support
[SPEAKER_04]: the state's policy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is there any specific things that you
would tell growers or that you do tell
[SPEAKER_04]: growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well Our push in in with growers is
to try and drive them towards LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah lighting and more efficient air
conditioning systems so we would love to
[SPEAKER_00]: see them get into a chilled water system,
but the the the biggest problem with most
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivators is initial cost right and the
lack of lack of available capital and so
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the the factors that we try
to offset with incentives electric fire
[SPEAKER_04]: chill like to fire chilled water electric
electric chilled chilled water,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: With LED light right but uptake on that
idea has is going to take a long time for
[SPEAKER_04]: people to really understand Well,
what does that mean to me as a grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: What does that mean to my operation if I'm
working with you know a set of Goodman
[SPEAKER_04]: 5-tons right now and and some questy
Hughes and you know a set of Kavita's What
[SPEAKER_04]: is my grow environment gonna be like?
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it gonna perform?
[SPEAKER_04]: So they've got issues, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got KPIs.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got responsibilities to
stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got quotas to me, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's education.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's an education testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's there's there's Yeah, so we just
data we need published data we need and so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one of the things that we're doing
Is we're supporting engineering studies
[SPEAKER_00]: and providing LED lights where we can
operate two grow rooms side-by-side with
[SPEAKER_00]: different technologies and gather that
data and show that You know, we understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that the key components are quality and
yield And so what we're looking for is to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to show that with with the right
lights you can get the right You can get
[SPEAKER_00]: the increase in yield or the equivalent
yield and and the equivalent So is there
[SPEAKER_04]: any are there any TV spots that we're
gonna expect to see on?
[SPEAKER_04]: cable networks for The way we the way,
you know, the way we were the way we were
[SPEAKER_04]: educated about, you know compact
fluorescence in the home Are we gonna see
[SPEAKER_04]: you know TV spots to aimed at the grow at
the grow community?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's sort of you know, how is the
outreach which what shapes the outreach
[SPEAKER_04]: take?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so right now the outreach is is the
the organization part of the organization
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm in is a customer outreach
organization and we go out and talk with
[SPEAKER_00]: the the growers and the grower groups and
Talk to them about what the opportunities
[SPEAKER_00]: are and what the studies are showing and
work with them and try and convince them
[SPEAKER_00]: to to Make the investment in LEDs and and
we support that again with incentives so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can help offset some of that That
cost to the incremental cost I Have a
[SPEAKER_05]: question so specific I guess to my desert
hot springs in and that area I know that
[SPEAKER_05]: people have spent a lot of money
investment in large buildings in large
[SPEAKER_05]: operations out there and They're under
pressure now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you go and you talk to them,
do you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they give you?
[SPEAKER_05]: sob stories do they come you know,
are they under like economic pressure and
[SPEAKER_05]: and That that might mitigate their ability
to put some of these reforms into place
[SPEAKER_05]: and do they talk to you about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so in the cannabis industry in
particular We know that they're under cost
[SPEAKER_00]: pressures We saw basically we looked at at
the other markets Colorado Washington,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw what happened there where there was
the The prices started to drop down
[SPEAKER_00]: because it became a lot more supply and so
We recognize that the the financial
[SPEAKER_00]: implications of that We don't get a lot of
those sob stories so much but Because the
[SPEAKER_00]: growers just aren't sharing those but we
know that that's happening And we know
[SPEAKER_00]: that the the lack of access to capital is
a big issue Aren't real estate prices also
[SPEAKER_05]: falling out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know I I don't Know but I believe
that is true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, which which might also mitigate
their willingness to you know make capital
[SPEAKER_05]: Improvements on on, you know operations
that they don't even know they're gonna be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to hold on to I mean, it's just a
tough situation I would think So due
[SPEAKER_04]: diligence, I mean I would put that I would
put a lot of the For new operations,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's say not for existing operations,
but for new operations Those are the
[SPEAKER_04]: elements That need to be evaluated early
when in the planning process when looking
[SPEAKER_04]: at availability power when looking at real
estate price When looking at finance and
[SPEAKER_04]: capital you want to balance what you what
we tell our investors we're capable of
[SPEAKER_04]: producing so that it's a realistic number
and that It takes into account real estate
[SPEAKER_04]: price upgrade price power availability
time to market labor costs I think what if
[SPEAKER_04]: so I'm seeing that if the picture can be
that That what did you call it the the sob
[SPEAKER_04]: story or the heartbreak story right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah when those come out It's usually
result of there's a mismatch between what
[SPEAKER_04]: the investor wants back at the end of the
month and what and the rock in the hard
[SPEAKER_04]: place that that that that The growers is
is cultivators is pushed into and they
[SPEAKER_05]: might have had expectations for the market
that didn't didn't pan out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, or the Or the municipality may have
changed their mind lo and behold the
[SPEAKER_04]: municipality could change their mind And
you now wait a year an extra year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah plan plan plan I mean,
so one of the things that we always tell
[SPEAKER_00]: them when we're when we go out and talk to
our customers is you know, the the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities that we're identifying for
them to Become more energy efficient is an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to help them stay in
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to help them lower their
energy costs, which are their the major
[SPEAKER_00]: non-personnel costs of the facility lower
that Operating costs down so that they can
[SPEAKER_05]: stay in business and and make a profit
Absolutely, and it occurs to me that these
[SPEAKER_05]: conversations should probably be taking
place before a shovel or pick ever hits
[SPEAKER_04]: the ground We can work together holy cow
who thought we could work together right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about this in the planning
phase So that we don't get between the
[SPEAKER_04]: rock and the hard place so that these
eventualities have been put into place a
[SPEAKER_04]: part of the due diligence the investors
Understand that look there's two years to
[SPEAKER_04]: get power.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we gonna do in those two years?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we just?
[SPEAKER_04]: Move elsewhere or do we take that time to
actually build a plan so that when we're
[SPEAKER_04]: ready We're up and running in a way that's
sustainable Yeah, and the other side of
[SPEAKER_00]: that is if we start this this conversation
up front we can help decide where where
[SPEAKER_00]: you locate because we can tell you you if
there's capacity available on the grid for
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're at and and if you if there's
capacity then it's a lot easier to get you
[SPEAKER_00]: the The power that you need and that's a
mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a mindset shift I was gonna say
where are you seeing a lot of new
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities popping up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like are you seeing trends?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's there's still a lot of
growth going on out in in desert hot
[SPEAKER_00]: springs but those are facilities that
essentially have been in in the process
[SPEAKER_00]: for Mostly two to three years,
but they're still expanding There's well,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're they're going in the way that they
were they're coming coming online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah And they're still probably a year or
so out from actually being and what's the
[SPEAKER_04]: pipeline looking like?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there are there new are there new new
applications coming into that pipeline?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are new applications coming in but
more of them are coming in I think in the
[SPEAKER_00]: urban areas, which is what we're we're
trying to do We're trying to one
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically Which urban areas well that
the largest urban area right now is is
[SPEAKER_00]: Long Beach, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: for us in terms of energy In terms of
applications coming in or in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses that are already there The the
next coming up one is probably in the the
[SPEAKER_00]: Lancaster Palmdale area We have a lot
going on in Atlanta right now And those
[SPEAKER_00]: are some of them are new and some of them
have been in the pipeline for a while so
[SPEAKER_00]: You know we've been working pretty hard
pretty diligently to to get power to the
[SPEAKER_00]: the the business park that is out in
Atlanta to satisfy them, so There's you
[SPEAKER_04]: know nationally.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's really three three huge issues
that face any Indoor grower farmer,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's available capital.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's state licensing and it's municipal
entitlements So your local planning board,
[SPEAKER_04]: but what we're adding here is this third
if there's a two-year Wait time to get
[SPEAKER_04]: power to your facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're adding a fourth major hurdle to
starting a business or to continuing
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the two years come from is that a
is that an accurate wait time two years?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's project specific, but We were talking
about this a little bit earlier the the
[SPEAKER_00]: utility plans the changes to the grid on a
ten-year cycle it takes it because
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what it is if it's a
relocation of a distribution line Then the
[SPEAKER_00]: the it only takes us a year maybe two
years to relocate a distribution line to
[SPEAKER_00]: get power if it's Putting in a new
distribution line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two to three years if it's upgrading
a Substation to get more capacity there it
[SPEAKER_00]: could be three to five But if it's a new
Transmission line that that's required
[SPEAKER_00]: then it could be seven to ten years.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know I have a question when the state
Propagated its rules and created its
[SPEAKER_05]: Strategy for the state its patchwork
strategy of rolling out and everything did
[SPEAKER_05]: it come and consult with you was how these
businesses how these areas and Obviously
[SPEAKER_05]: they the way they did it it was inevitable
that certain parts of the state would have
[SPEAKER_05]: More businesses than others and probably
be overloaded was so was the energy
[SPEAKER_00]: component On their agenda agenda well the
state didn't consider that at all And and
[SPEAKER_00]: because the state wasn't telling people
where to go Right they're not telling
[SPEAKER_00]: people to go to any more reason so when we
when proposition 64 passed It basically
[SPEAKER_00]: said it's legal in the state of
California, and then the state said they
[SPEAKER_00]: left it up to the individual
municipalities and Counties to decide
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not they wanted to allow it or
not Okay, and so what so what's what's
[SPEAKER_00]: what's basically happened is the the
disadvantaged communities that Don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of resources a lot of capital coming
in They're more open to having new
[SPEAKER_00]: industries come in and so They're the ones
that initially passed and the ordinances
[SPEAKER_00]: and said yeah, you can come in and grow
here
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when they didn't coordinate because
and and we've since worked on that with
[SPEAKER_00]: our local public affairs people to go out
and talk with these communities say look
[SPEAKER_00]: before you Start accepting applications
and setting up business parks You come
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to us, and let's talk about what the
capacity is there before you you start
[SPEAKER_00]: taking applications So when we talk about
the the communities that are hardest hit
[SPEAKER_00]: for us in terms of capacity You know we've
got atlanto and California City and desert
[SPEAKER_00]: hot springs or the Coachella Valley That
was all done before they made those
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions before they came and talked to
us And and so we've got a real problem in
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to meet that demand We're doing our
best to do that and it works through the
[SPEAKER_00]: process, but again some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it Is going to be seven to ten
years if we have to put a new transmission
[SPEAKER_00]: line in and and so What we've done since
then is is You know this all caught us a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit off guard We had you know in
our planning cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had no clue that this was coming And so
we didn't plan for it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're out talking to communities and and
The different organizations and saying hey
[SPEAKER_00]: look if you're going to come let's talk
first and You know let's work together to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still think the state has a had a
responsibility to communicate what these
[SPEAKER_05]: smaller municipalities were going to face
in terms of being able to provide the
[SPEAKER_05]: energy and the power to these businesses
Knowing the timeline that you guys are
[SPEAKER_05]: under you know right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I just don't think anybody
ever thought about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't Really think well that's
interesting in a state where are there
[SPEAKER_05]: like?
[SPEAKER_05]: 13 different Sequa Areas in this day,
so you know the flip side is they're very
[SPEAKER_05]: environmentally conscious, but energy is I
mean tied in inexorably to Right
[SPEAKER_05]: environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so it doesn't really add up
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know I was this last session
here I was listening to and what really
[SPEAKER_04]: which is farms of the future There was two
sessions farms of the future one farm of
[SPEAKER_04]: the future two and and both were populated
by both urban And and and you know
[SPEAKER_04]: Kentucky and in various locations
nationally folks focused on the leafy
[SPEAKER_04]: green and small and small vegetable
markets and and I noticed one distinct
[SPEAKER_04]: difference was the language they used
Right talking about these as farms talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about the the their grow environment as a
bot as a as a as a biosphere Talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: their their total growth area in terms of
acreage these are all terms that can be
[SPEAKER_04]: understood by a farmer, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Meaning specifically a sun grown
specifically sun grown work.
[SPEAKER_04]: We understand labor.
[SPEAKER_04]: We understand we understand acreage We
understand biodome biosphere And I was I
[SPEAKER_04]: was struck by how that leafy green
industry is Speaks with ease about the
[SPEAKER_04]: same we using the same language around
their indoor growth fully indoor grows But
[SPEAKER_04]: in the cannabis industry we still call it
the cannabis industry We don't call it
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily farming we talk about in terms
of square feet and canopy we talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: you know watts per square foot and We seem
to be it sounds like if we started to
[SPEAKER_04]: share language that with with farming and
with big ag That there might be some more
[SPEAKER_04]: cross pollination I think that was a real
takeaway that I heard that we could we
[SPEAKER_04]: might have even I mean It's rapidly
changing right this cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_04]: changes fast But the idea that we could
even adopt more innovations more quickly
[SPEAKER_04]: if we shared more information with the
with the with the ag community right,
[SPEAKER_00]: right the the one thing that Struck me is
is that you know the the the ag community
[SPEAKER_00]: that's out there today is They're very
knowledgeable about what the requirements
[SPEAKER_00]: are and how they get from here to there
with the new technologies And they
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that much more so than the
cannabis industries and and so I think a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of a lot of it goes to education and
and educating the cannabis industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing them trying to draw them into
that agricultural community and and Give
[SPEAKER_00]: them that knowledge base that that they're
lacking right now Many of them don't know
[SPEAKER_04]: what their requirements are another
takeaway was so RII is one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: co-sponsors here and I sat on their panel
Yesterday not sat on their panel the way
[SPEAKER_04]: that they did a breakout session and they
really brought together HVAC issues
[SPEAKER_04]: lighting issues utility issues and policy
issues and looking at that And saying look
[SPEAKER_04]: all of all y'all got to talk to each other
All y'all got to talk to within your
[SPEAKER_04]: within your discipline within the lighting
discipline But then let's get the lighting
[SPEAKER_04]: folks to talk to the policy folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get the utility to talk to the
growers I think those are really powerful
[SPEAKER_04]: conversations.
[SPEAKER_04]: What were some of the takeaways for you in
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Again, it goes back to the the
educational process You know I think
[SPEAKER_00]: getting getting the growers more involved
in in that whole process because we talk a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot with the the lighting manufacturers
and HVAC manufacturers and You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we have that relationship going and I
think it's drawing in the the growers into
[SPEAKER_00]: that conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really important Do you think
growers at every scale?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean there were some large-scale growers
here I don't know if there were too many
[SPEAKER_05]: smaller.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I didn't say yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah growers at every scale Yeah,
it's I mean, it's really important because
[SPEAKER_00]: The growers that I've run into the ones
that are growing on a smaller scale They
[SPEAKER_00]: they're growing by rote Yeah, you know,
it's it's not necessarily that they know
[SPEAKER_00]: all the science behind it but they've
learned the technique and That's one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the reasons that they are reluctant to
change Technologies is because if you
[SPEAKER_00]: change a technology you change something
something in the formula you need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to tell them teach them what the the
what other components have to now change
[SPEAKER_00]: to to make the same yield and same quality
and Because they most of them don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: that right and they don't have the
knowledge to figure it out All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's the tech part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there's what about finance?
[SPEAKER_04]: What about the financial side of that?
[SPEAKER_04]: So rebates are a big great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah and understanding Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's the technology piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the there's the adaptation of an
existing grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's gonna take some time We talked
about that earlier, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But what about the carrot the stick thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They are there are there real financial
incentives that need to be communicated to
[SPEAKER_04]: growers at certain scales like I One
takeaway for me Was it growers at large
[SPEAKER_04]: scale do don't always have Excuse me
growers at a large scale often have more
[SPEAKER_04]: patient investors Growers at smaller
scales often have impatient investors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's that's another rock in a
hard place Like how do you satisfy the the
[SPEAKER_04]: investor who wants his return tomorrow
with the time it takes to wait for power?
[SPEAKER_04]: Adapt as grow between an HPS light and an
LED light understand those differences and
[SPEAKER_04]: now bring in the technologies that allow
him to Benefit and allow that plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: work, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that that's one of the differences
that that we heard over the last couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: days the larger growers a lot of larger
agricultural companies are looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: Paybacks in the five to seven years period
the in the smaller grower in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is looking at a two-year payback
You know because their business plan is
[SPEAKER_00]: get in get out in five years and and be
done and either be acquired or some other
[SPEAKER_00]: sell the business But shouldn't that
shorter payback allow?
[SPEAKER_04]: Better a technology adaptation shouldn't
that quicker payback?
[SPEAKER_04]: Allow if the resources are there if the
resource is in the investors should look
[SPEAKER_04]: at then say well Wait, I'm gonna pay that
back in two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why wouldn't I adopt that new technology?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like yeah, so it takes a different class
of investor We're looking for here to know
[SPEAKER_00]: but it doesn't that's that's one of the
things one of the the issues that we run
[SPEAKER_00]: into Is that you know the the paybacks on
these new technologies are typically in
[SPEAKER_00]: the three to five year range and so my
challenge and in terms of incentivizing is
[SPEAKER_00]: to try and and incentivize them enough
that it gets that payback down to two
[SPEAKER_00]: years or or less and That's not always
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always based on the the amount of
savings that they can generate and the
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller Let me see the larger the the the
cultivation facility the easier it is to
[SPEAKER_00]: to get Enough savings that it that'll
bring those costs down So we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller growers who aren't large enough to
have the generate the electrical savings
[SPEAKER_00]: that would Then be incentivized to bring
that cost down.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your definition of a small grower
when you say small?
[SPEAKER_05]: Grower what size farmer are we are we are
you having your mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say anything that's under 10,000
square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay 10,000 gross square feet canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're talking canopy,
it's probably five or six thousand square
[SPEAKER_00]: feet and canopy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay Okay, yeah gross facility size.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 10k.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 20k Can it be in that sort of 6 to
8k?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay
[SPEAKER_04]: That's still in the scheme of things
compared to lettuce, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're not acres for 44,000 square feet in
an acre.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be a lot of canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it's you know and and that's
pretty much the the average size of a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and in our territory in particular is
About 10,000 square feet your territory
[SPEAKER_05]: extend north into northern, California
Where their terrain is so different from
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously the desert and maybe even down
here We don't go into northern,
[SPEAKER_00]: California so much but yeah, we we cover
so on the on the coast We we cover up to
[SPEAKER_00]: about Santa Barbara Goleta area in the
Central Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cover up to the most northern place is
Town called Woodlake, which is just north
[SPEAKER_00]: of Tulare.
[SPEAKER_05]: So You're so you're not really on a
massive scale dealing with altitude with
[SPEAKER_05]: with with farms that are remote or you
know high up or in You know difficult
[SPEAKER_05]: environments or unorthodox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I mean we have there's we have
farms in Tehachapi for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a On higher elevation gets snow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess my question is do those present
special challenges energy wise or for what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing So in terms of having
capacity out in those areas, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: typically It turns out that where they're
at there is is capacity We have Up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: on the east side of the sierras we go up
as high as Bridgeport we have some
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities in mammoth the mammoth area and
and There's some Indian tribe tribal Areas
[SPEAKER_00]: out there that we we service those are
pretty much They're they're smaller grows
[SPEAKER_00]: so that they don't have the the capacity
issues So yeah, but yeah, but do they
[SPEAKER_00]: still need to become more efficient Well,
I believe absolutely if they want to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: in business, they're gonna have to become
more efficient you know the the price of
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is gonna go down it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that historically that's happened
through all the neighbors to the north
[SPEAKER_00]: They're experiencing it right now right
now exactly and in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and So if they're gonna stay in in
business they want to stay profitable
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna have to cut their operating
costs and and so what about this
[SPEAKER_04]: discussion then about way to cut operating
costs is Make a business decision is what
[SPEAKER_04]: what you're growing and why what is your
customer actually?
[SPEAKER_04]: Consuming right and what is going to
distill it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what is what is prize flower and
saying can we grow in our in where we are
[SPEAKER_04]: let's say you're at elevation in this town
you mentioned And you're growing in a hoop
[SPEAKER_04]: house or you're growing in a warehouse in
a pre-engineered metal building is there
[SPEAKER_04]: anything you could do outdoors to increase
your capacity as opposed to building more
[SPEAKER_04]: indoor facility and is that is that part
of the planning process of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: company or is this is the municipality in
California limiting are they legislating
[SPEAKER_00]: against outdoor grows are there where's
that it in the urban areas in particular
[SPEAKER_00]: The the state regulations pretty much
limit on what you can do versus that yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's indoor There so there's an area where
we could use better legislation right if
[SPEAKER_04]: this if the if the legislature wants to
hit carbon neutrality Then don't force
[SPEAKER_04]: everything indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just the two don't work because
we're gonna consume a lot of cannabis Are
[SPEAKER_05]: those zoning issue are those zoning issues
or agricultural?
[SPEAKER_05]: land outside in an urban area what are the
Challenge what are the yeah, that's zoning
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to do with zoning, but it also has
to do with just the way the regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: were written you know the regulations were
written such that the the facility has to
[SPEAKER_00]: be secure so nobody can just break in and
You get some of the product they had has
[SPEAKER_00]: to be Invisible to the outside world it
has to be there has to be Or odor control
[SPEAKER_04]: so that each state each state is
legislating that differently and so one of
[SPEAKER_04]: the big newest examples here is,
Illinois That is great come right coming
[SPEAKER_04]: online, and we're just reading that law,
but in their legislation.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are forbidding outdoor growing and
For a new state coming online the size of
[SPEAKER_04]: Illinois with the population of Illinois
and with the growing season Why can we
[SPEAKER_04]: grow outdoors in Illinois with a lot of
soybean a lot of corn?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no there's no prohibition about
growing outdoors right so why why limit
[SPEAKER_04]: the crop and why the Reason for that do
you know I'm sure it's I'm sure it's
[SPEAKER_04]: stigma.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah well, so odor stigma security We just
went through that here in California
[SPEAKER_00]: because the government Moved hemp from the
controlled substance list and so we have
[SPEAKER_00]: This year we had a lot of hemp grown
outdoors And the the requirements for
[SPEAKER_00]: growing hemp or are much less onerous than
than cannabis and so In Ventura County
[SPEAKER_00]: where I'm based we had about 3,000 acres
of hemp grown a lot of it was grown in the
[SPEAKER_00]: urban areas and After the first crop all
of those communities have now since said
[SPEAKER_00]: we're having a moratorium on Canada on
hemp because it's got the same scent as
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and Nobody wants it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the it's the odor issue Colleague was
talking about maybe just You know creating
[SPEAKER_04]: a forum creating creating more
opportunities to bring you know I like
[SPEAKER_04]: this concept of utility meat grower grower
meat utility That's a really neat.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a productive one of the points I
took away from the future of the farm was
[SPEAKER_05]: so there's these vertical farm from back
east and there they were talking about how
[SPEAKER_05]: they want to compete with California
agriculture right and I'm like okay that
[SPEAKER_05]: sounds great, but someone mentioned the
other day with respect to cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: Thailand producing at one penny a gram So
really you know and I know people are
[SPEAKER_05]: already thinking globally especially
larger operations But you know how do you
[SPEAKER_05]: compete with that now?
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know what their you know
processes they have and how clean that
[SPEAKER_05]: crop is and how they're making it but one
cent a gram so I mean It's one thing with
[SPEAKER_05]: your leafy vegetables in your tomatoes But
if you're talking cannabis, do you also
[SPEAKER_05]: want to think globally as well?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you do and so one of the issues
around that is is understanding the
[SPEAKER_04]: product and if we have Decriminalization
if we can deschedule cannabis from
[SPEAKER_04]: schedule one at the controlled substance
act down to five now the FDA can come in
[SPEAKER_04]: and Manage what is the product and to whom
is it being sold?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's being prescribed by a doctor if it is
it must be you know CGMP certified or GACP
[SPEAKER_04]: certified on the growth side and CGMP on
the manufacturing side That's a whole new
[SPEAKER_04]: set of regulations that we need to be that
we need to prepare for right so we need to
[SPEAKER_04]: understand What are we growing for and
we're an industry that's that's we just
[SPEAKER_04]: talked about the municipalities and how
difficult they are the state and how
[SPEAKER_04]: difficult that is now we're going to add
federal regulation to that mix and we need
[SPEAKER_04]: to be prepared for that we need to
understand that our facilities are
[SPEAKER_04]: regulated at those three levels Yeah,
that's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean for the last three years.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been warning okay that the FDA is
Coming yeah, you know it is coming and
[SPEAKER_05]: with it and that will touch every aspect
of cannabis every no No, they'd be
[SPEAKER_05]: different verticals.
[SPEAKER_05]: Will there be a medicinal vertical hemp
vertical?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right and adult use vertical adult
use we're projecting that that would be
[SPEAKER_04]: controlled by the TTB the taxation and
Trade Bureau Because it is not gonna be a
[SPEAKER_04]: product that is prescribed by a doctor
You're gonna have to have you know you're
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna have to follow and if it's good,
but but if you're gonna sell in You know
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana fused products right then that
is consumed orally That's taken internally
[SPEAKER_04]: that you have to do that in food safe
situations, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very similar to it's the food and
drug industry I think that's we talked
[SPEAKER_04]: about language earlier changing language
about what what industry were and we're in
[SPEAKER_04]: the food and drug industry, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We are drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a drug manufacturing industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to produce drugs that are
consistent Every time it is consistent so
[SPEAKER_04]: that when the customer comes and buys it
it is exactly the same You know I've
[SPEAKER_05]: interviewed large Written articles about
large cannabis companies where the owners
[SPEAKER_05]: came out of the food industry Yeah in a
big way they were they were established in
[SPEAKER_05]: the food industry and these are
established cannabis companies from
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado a couple of them and it was very
interesting to interview these These CEOs
[SPEAKER_05]: these executives because their outlook
about everything was so different they
[SPEAKER_05]: they had so little Patience for the
cannabis regulators because so many of
[SPEAKER_05]: these issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: They said we've already solved them You
know and they really in the food industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know as foodies they were foodies,
you know and You know So but they would
[SPEAKER_05]: you know they would work very closely You
know and these are people who like eight
[SPEAKER_05]: ten years ago were set set up their
kitchens in in Colorado and then the
[SPEAKER_05]: Regulators would come and know nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They wouldn't know what was the right
standards or what to do for setting them
[SPEAKER_05]: So they were teaching them so that
relationship with those local regulators
[SPEAKER_05]: is a decade old Yes, yeah, and that has to
count for something it does When the FDA
[SPEAKER_05]: comes in because one of because and this
this is another thought I had at this
[SPEAKER_05]: because someone to talk about how they
were developing Regulations at a local or
[SPEAKER_05]: state level and my what I was wondering
was okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well when the federal Cup when and that
research when the federal government comes
[SPEAKER_05]: in will they use that data will they use
that research so that we don't have to Go
[SPEAKER_05]: back and start at square one right they
really should I mean there is actually a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of data This is one of the most data
intense industries.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is I I've been covering it now since
2015 and There's more data in this
[SPEAKER_05]: industry than practice and it's extremely
technologically advanced industry except
[SPEAKER_05]: that so much of that data is in silos
again Yeah, not shared so GMP so GMP
[SPEAKER_04]: certification and and and communicating
that to government officials is about
[SPEAKER_04]: record-keeping the fundamental idea of
CGMP is Record-keeping it's being able to
[SPEAKER_04]: report on the spot when somebody shows up
and knocks on the door and said we're here
[SPEAKER_04]: to inspect you and you've got the records
so that so Data is going to read data data
[SPEAKER_04]: drives everything in our world Having it
readily accessible it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know it can't change Just be written
in pencil in a spiral bound notebook with
[SPEAKER_04]: dog ears It's got to be you know
electronic recorded pull up at an instant
[SPEAKER_04]: and ready to ready to transmit to the to
whoever shows up That kind of data means
[SPEAKER_05]: you know this is a really great point I've
been to a whole number of grows from
[SPEAKER_05]: Washington State through this one and
you're going they're all different Some of
[SPEAKER_05]: them are run even if they're large
operations are pretty much run on
[SPEAKER_05]: notebooks Everything's written by the door
written down.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's manual others are all electronic and
digitized.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you speak to that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_05]: The variety of operations and technology
and sophistication that you've seen yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: well I've seen the gamut in our territory
I've seen some that We're literally run
[SPEAKER_00]: off a notebook and others are what I
consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know top of the line We have there's a
grow that I know that is operated by a
[SPEAKER_00]: person who came out of the Pharmaceutical
industry and so everything is done Six six
[SPEAKER_00]: sigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know and there's controls on
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we not leave people behind right?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we how do we bring everybody up
because we're because there's incredibly
[SPEAKER_04]: sophisticated grows that operate off a
notebook, but what we're saying here is
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the tools to to to rock to the
tide rising all boats?
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to lose our traditional
growers our small craft growers because
[SPEAKER_05]: they have knowledge And genetics that are
invaluable we want we don't want them to
[SPEAKER_04]: go away, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So are they're teeming and I don't know if
they're teeming are there see so with it
[SPEAKER_04]: one thing we suffer from as an industry is
lack of shared information right so
[SPEAKER_04]: peer-reviewed journals would be a great
thing so if we could get data written out
[SPEAKER_04]: peer-reviewed and distributed Would be
awesome right because no because one of
[SPEAKER_04]: the lament we talk about the things that
about the takeaways from this conference
[SPEAKER_04]: that maybe weren't so good We don't have
enough growers here And because growers
[SPEAKER_04]: don't have time in their day to is why
we're doing this You know why we're doing
[SPEAKER_04]: this video cast so that we can reach
people where they're at and If you've got
[SPEAKER_04]: time to listen to a podcast mode you get
time to listen with you know YouTube
[SPEAKER_04]: channel Maybe you've got you know can
learn something and I think that's where
[SPEAKER_04]: it falls on the folks You know
professionals in the industry that how do
[SPEAKER_04]: we share that it?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we how do we get that information
out there to share it so that would rise
[SPEAKER_04]: all boats?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think yeah, this is like this type of
conference is almost like a door
[SPEAKER_05]: conference.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like door You know this cut you know
at this this is such an important topic
[SPEAKER_05]: and yet It's been disregarded in a sense
maybe taken for granted is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: attitude is energy taken for granted I
think it is in a lot of cases People are
[SPEAKER_00]: used to going to the light switch and and
turning it on and and it's there You know
[SPEAKER_00]: and at home you never have to worry about
capacity right rapid growth, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about how quick you know if the
investor wants the you know it does not
[SPEAKER_04]: have the patience for due diligence then
Nobody's got the time to come and talk to
[SPEAKER_04]: Southern California Edison right no way
and if you don't take the time to do that
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you don't understand that you're you
could risk an enormous investment if you
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't because you get shut down or right
So that that patience aspect hasn't been
[SPEAKER_04]: established yet, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's now now now now now so we need to
slow down a little bit go slow to go fast
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you heard that go slow to go fast?
[SPEAKER_04]: Planning is not going to slow you down
planning is going to speed you up so if
[SPEAKER_04]: you do diligence is planning Right meeting
with the officials is planning and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the things when I go out and I do
outreach with grower organizations,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one of the things that I try to to
a spouse to them is is that We need to
[SPEAKER_00]: have this this ongoing conversation So
that when you're planning to do something
[SPEAKER_00]: let us know so we can help you achieve
that So so now you've been to this
[SPEAKER_05]: particular conference, which is really
focused what did anything happen here?
[SPEAKER_05]: And and you know there's all these
industries Here and the industry is kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of focused here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is there anything you're taking away or
that you heard where you went?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh Like inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh We got to work on that This situation
is like worse than I thought like have you
[SPEAKER_04]: learned or heard anything here where yeah,
yeah Okay, yeah, and it's it's kind of why
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking to you Gary's because you know
I'm new to the California market not new
[SPEAKER_04]: to cannabis new to the California market
and specifically Oh, this is worse than I
[SPEAKER_04]: thought y'all been at this for for for
20-something years and yet the What's
[SPEAKER_04]: what's worse than you thought the
hodgepodge of municipal Messed up ness
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is way worse than I thought and from
a so when I think about how do I add value
[SPEAKER_04]: to the conversation?
[SPEAKER_04]: How does an architect come in and improve
a situation?
[SPEAKER_04]: Beyond subject matter expertise.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to know I need to know the
utilities because I need to figure out how
[SPEAKER_04]: do you how do you match?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you met?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you knit this patchwork of?
[SPEAKER_04]: Completely disparate laws back together so
we can talk about what what we can talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about things like best practices in the
industry we can talk about things like The
[SPEAKER_04]: traffic cones which are the sort of
standards within within which we operate
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do different techniques within
those but these are the standards like
[SPEAKER_04]: energy consumption water consumption
building thermal envelope, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: but now you add this difficulty of the
patchwork of municipal different in Laws
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's this enormous.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really big complication.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's worse than I thought You
know, we probably used to the patchwork I
[SPEAKER_05]: mean I'm here in California the whole time
and so we've had to deal with this from
[SPEAKER_05]: you know From and it's been a mess from
the very beginning I'm wondering if the
[SPEAKER_05]: state regrets rolling it out that way and
giving every municipality the choice
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's created Havoc within this
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have no idea whether they do or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that they've They're going through
some changes in the way that they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, one of the biggest issues
was the the hope that you know by
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing it that we would Eventually
work out the illicit market and one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: big issues that we we have is is the
taxation and You know by the time all is
[SPEAKER_00]: said and done The product is taxed,
you know, basically 50% 39% the other day
[SPEAKER_05]: at a shop, which is you know For for
someone who has their patient card and all
[SPEAKER_05]: of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's unacceptable But I've told
the regulators that I mean I've the
[SPEAKER_04]: politicians and you know one of the
cannabis control Commission officers from
[SPEAKER_04]: Massachusetts is here for this conference
Kate oil and One of the things that the
[SPEAKER_04]: state of mass does Just as an example is
publishes a map of the state and all 360
[SPEAKER_04]: plus or minus municipalities and you can
read right from that website Which
[SPEAKER_04]: municipality is voted for it which
percentage of the vote who voted in that
[SPEAKER_04]: town?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had two votes like as you did too,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a we had a we had a medical vote in
2012 Massachusetts did they had a they had
[SPEAKER_04]: a adult use vote in 2018 and you can read
on the website Who voted what was the
[SPEAKER_04]: percentage of vote?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a moratorium today?
[SPEAKER_04]: When is that moratorium sundowning?
[SPEAKER_04]: So as it so as an Industry industry can
look at that map and say well,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's let's go to a town that is that is
open So that that increases planning so
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a role that the state plays That
in that enables development and that's a
[SPEAKER_04]: critical understanding is that the state
can enable development the state can help
[SPEAKER_05]: By just publishing data, you know,
which sounds great that really sounds
[SPEAKER_05]: great I hope that Massachusetts now that
I'm thinking about it also said oh we also
[SPEAKER_05]: need to make sure that if there's a gold
rush or a green rush into One particular
[SPEAKER_05]: town or sector that they have the energy
that you know to meet that and and Every
[SPEAKER_05]: state has to be the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to have a long timeline to make
you know Big changes so there that's the
[SPEAKER_05]: same example.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like that does sound great,
but then we realize that everything is
[SPEAKER_05]: connected, you know and And you can't move
forward with large projects without
[SPEAKER_05]: powering them and the very thought of
putting a project into place and having to
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait two years for your power is
mind-boggling Unless you already have a
[SPEAKER_05]: two-year rollout, you know, and then it's
all gonna work for you Yeah, well and that
[SPEAKER_00]: goes back to it takes us a while to get
the power Why you need to get involved
[SPEAKER_00]: early on have us involved early into the
planning process The earlier we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: into it then we have a parallel path going
and well that and that's an interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: thing, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about earlier if you know,
you've got a two-year wait for your power
[SPEAKER_04]: This is you now have a you have a you have
a mandate to go slow to go fast You simply
[SPEAKER_04]: can't go any faster than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question now is what are you gonna
do?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you take advantage of those two
years?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a roadmap?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we provide a roadmap for what needs to
be set in place?
[SPEAKER_04]: So when that two-year time is up,
you're ready to go theoretically that
[SPEAKER_04]: might be the best thing that ever happened
to you in a way Yeah, cuz cuz cuz capital
[SPEAKER_04]: capital can't push you any faster Then
then then the utility is able to provide
[SPEAKER_05]: that drop so that now I'm thinking so
desert hot Springs which you spoke a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: about and I've been out there I was out
there for when Candescent Launched their
[SPEAKER_05]: first two buildings, you know several
years ago and the city was there and they
[SPEAKER_05]: had a little boy scout true I mean they
really they really played this up and I
[SPEAKER_05]: have to say it was a small ceremony,
but it was moving the mayor spoke and What
[SPEAKER_05]: this dirt what it meant to this dirt poor
town.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was moving to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was Genuinely moved because it was so
real And so since you're a very poor city,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know half an hour north of Palm
Springs, you know You know, and so all of
[SPEAKER_05]: that sounds so great, but you know due
diligence, you know all of this thing So I
[SPEAKER_05]: guess my question is so that was several
years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now these large places are coming online
so once they come online then their power
[SPEAKER_05]: needs don't they escalate and like Well,
well they do but they don't come online
[SPEAKER_00]: all at once and that's that's another part
of the planning process so typically these
[SPEAKER_00]: these facilities are coming on in phases
and So if we know that in the year you can
[SPEAKER_00]: plan we can plan for that, too That's
another reason why it's important for us
[SPEAKER_05]: to be involved in the upfront So but
specifically with the desert hot springs
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you feel like right now that you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: How the rollouts gonna come and so you
feel like you're in good shape to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to meet the needs I think we are I don't
know the exact timeline on all of that but
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a pretty good handle on what's
going in and in that Coachella Valley and
[SPEAKER_00]: what the requirements are And and we're
building to do that that raises a question
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any follow-on benefit that you
from a utility perspective see from a
[SPEAKER_04]: large?
[SPEAKER_04]: Consumer customer coming in like a
cannabis entity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any follow-on benefit by
providing that power for that for this
[SPEAKER_04]: industry?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there other it does that create
opportunity for others?
[SPEAKER_04]: Other businesses to move into into desert
hot springs that weren't there before to
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah to support those industries It's
possible I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but it's possible because I'm just
thinking if if If the economic drivers for
[SPEAKER_04]: for the cannabis industry for the food and
drug industry are allowing entities out
[SPEAKER_04]: there to wait those two years There must
be entities who don't have that time to
[SPEAKER_04]: wait and so wouldn't be wouldn't be lining
up to come into desert hot springs so that
[SPEAKER_04]: may Yeah, he must be thinking so well this
could actually spur further development.
[SPEAKER_05]: No doubt That's what that is what they're
thinking.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they see a future finally We see a
future not just more marijuana or drug
[SPEAKER_04]: drug manufacturers But the follow-on
industries the other jobs if you create
[SPEAKER_04]: 200 jobs those people need a place to live
Those people need a place to shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: They need a place to get their car fixed,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are all follow-ons that that that
are that are invisible, but that
[SPEAKER_04]: absolutely they're real.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question For you just occurred to
me and it's probably specific to a state
[SPEAKER_05]: like, California, which has this,
you know, obviously the traditional
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis Market for decades so and it's
still out there still robust larger than
[SPEAKER_05]: the legal one They consume power too,
but there are probably people that you
[SPEAKER_05]: have Difficulty of not impossibility
having conversations with they don't want
[SPEAKER_05]: to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to still stay underneath So how
do you account for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well?
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't is the bottom line the We look
one of the the challenges that I had when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at state licenses for for
cannabis grows they the the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: growers have one name for the state and
When they get power from us, it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: different name and so trying to correlate
the two together Entity name into the LLC
[SPEAKER_04]: INC.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are they actually registered as who
how do they how do they apply?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what is the legal name of the entity
is it attached the property or the tenant,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: and and so Those that are in the illicit
market as long as they're not stealing
[SPEAKER_00]: power from us We don't know what they're
doing and we don't care what they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as they're paying for their
power, it's and so there there are
[SPEAKER_00]: entities within our our territory That I
know or I'm sure are are cultivating But
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't know that they're there and
they're they're paying their bills on time
[SPEAKER_05]: and so and law enforcement still doing
their thermal scanning from the skies over
[SPEAKER_05]: the state I mean, you know looking yeah
for entered hotspots Right, but we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: involved with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They you're not don't they let you know We
only react to that if we get subpoenaed to
[SPEAKER_00]: us, you know, we don't We don't coordinate
with the the authorities You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not part of the the policing
organization the only time that we get
[SPEAKER_00]: involved is if we discover that there's
power being stolen and and then we get
[SPEAKER_00]: involved you're required then obviously to
do something right, but in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: Identifying where grow houses are anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's we don't have any any Role in that
it occurs to me that the the energy needs
[SPEAKER_05]: Of the larger cannabis community in
California were probably baked in a long
[SPEAKER_05]: time ago You know, I mean they've been at
it for so long.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, we haven't gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't had a blackout For that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know we have Although I don't
have any statistics to go with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that we've had transformer issues
and in certain areas that that may have
[SPEAKER_00]: been caused by grows But we don't have
anything specific to to to relate to that
[SPEAKER_01]: You You You You You
