[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm hoping is that there will be more
than one company that will give breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: an opportunity to just breed and then that
will commercialize their genetics and that
[SPEAKER_00]: these companies will compete with each
other for the rights to those genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: that the breeders will have basically
it'll be like the music industry and that
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders can basically bring their their
genetics to these companies and let them
[SPEAKER_00]: compete with each other for rights to
these genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how soon that's going to
happen but that's what I would like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to have plant breeders really
be like the rock stars and be the brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm hoping will happen and I'm
going to do my little part to make that
[SPEAKER_00]: happen but can't make it happen alone.
