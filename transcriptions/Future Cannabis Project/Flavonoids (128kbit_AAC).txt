[SPEAKER_01]: There's flavonoids and esters that don't
come over in a steam distillation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like flavonoids kind of get the
short stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: People talk about flavonoids, terpenes,
so give a plug to flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we care about flavonoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not completely versed on their medical
benefits, but they are heavier molecules
[SPEAKER_01]: that add flavor to the profile of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpenes add smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes deal specifically with your
olfactory senses, where flavonoids deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with your tongue and your taste buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The molecule is way heavier on the
flavonoids, so it does not get distilled
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as volatile?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not part of the distillation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stilled terpenes is not part of a terpene
blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with the esters as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are things that blend to the entire
smell profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it a terpene profile, but it's an
experience profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which includes flavonoids?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And esters?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what kind of reactions
happen when you combust all those
[SPEAKER_00]: different, 180 different compounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, on a medical level, I was
circling this way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: This conference that we're doing is
focused exactly on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of fiction out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have a lot of really good
ideas about what cannabinoids do,
[SPEAKER_00]: what different compounds, what full
spectrum, single isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have some good ideas,
but there is not enough science that are
[SPEAKER_00]: propping up these ideas or smashing them
to pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conference we're doing is really
focused on people who are actually doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that research and finding some answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring it to the attention of the people
that are making the oil in the gray,
[SPEAKER_01]: black, and newly white market.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a disconnection between the
cutting edge research and the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: are making the medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you start connecting with those
people, I think that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: great things that can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go back to want to make the best
product, find out in what delivery method
[SPEAKER_00]: is best for the doctors who are doing
research on that cannabinoid or that group
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've got a long way to go in research
and connecting the people that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: are passionate about it on the side of
making the medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really important with the people
that are actually researching and
[SPEAKER_01]: providing that medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
