[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well we're here with Hallie and
Micah from Humboldt Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi guys, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, how's it going man?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting to finally all get to meet
up again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who's this little guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Milo.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's basically the team mascot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sense, make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so what makes this interview
slightly different than the other ones
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been doing is that we've been
interviewing farmers and they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: showcasing their flowers, but you guys are
a seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's Humboldt Seed Company and can
you tell us a little bit about how that
[SPEAKER_01]: got started, you know, like the background
from your dad and what he did to get that
[SPEAKER_01]: going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, honestly, when it comes down
to it, our creation kind of happened
[SPEAKER_00]: organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what, you know, started was my
dad had a need for reliable seed back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, you know, he had a kid very young and
he was working for the local fisheries
[SPEAKER_00]: department, but we all know government
jobs don't really pay enough for a family
[SPEAKER_00]: of three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he had his little crop going and he,
you know, started getting seeds from his
[SPEAKER_00]: buddies and sometimes they'd work out
great and sometimes it would basically
[SPEAKER_00]: just come out like messy ditch weed and
there was no way of knowing at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this is when strains...
$4,000 a pound.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, then it was like strains
almost didn't even really have a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was like, you know,
probably 10 different things floating
[SPEAKER_00]: around getting called Salmon Creek Big
Bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he basically just started kind of
holding on to the things that he liked and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually saving males and then doing
breeding for his own personal use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it went from that to neighbors
suddenly being like, wait, why do all your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants look uniform and like, you know,
solid?
[SPEAKER_00]: They all smell the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, well, that's selective
breeding for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so next thing you know, the neighbors
all wanted seeds and then they started
[SPEAKER_00]: sending their friends to get seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually my stepmom at the time was
like, you can't keep asking folks to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: you a six pack of beer and, you know,
come pick out their seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting fat and we're broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it came down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was honestly the turning point
where he was like, maybe I should start
[SPEAKER_00]: charging for these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was way back in like you know,
I think he probably didn't ever start
[SPEAKER_00]: charging for seeds until like 2004,
2005.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a long stretch, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been breeding since 1998.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, from going from that and
being able to, you know, kind of launch
[SPEAKER_00]: into the recreational market, having an
arsenal of like very stabilized seed
[SPEAKER_00]: lines, I think has been a major advantage
to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our goal has always, of course,
just to been like to expose quality
[SPEAKER_00]: sun-grown flower to consumers that haven't
experienced that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to be able to kind of have our foot
in the door already and to be able to just
[SPEAKER_00]: launch and be ready to go doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it seems like you guys hit the
ground running for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've we've been gathering and
breeding and hoarding seeds for decades
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of all that, I mean, what are
some of the like management practices?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I know Mike is on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What what goes into some of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're doing mainly a lot of
feminized breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're doing we get our dads and we're
keeping our dads and we're switching them
[SPEAKER_02]: and then we're putting them in these
cloths that protect the pollen and keep it
[SPEAKER_02]: from cross-pollinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of keeps everything like steady.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we yeah, we just we go and we do
our thing in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that I have to say is like
big kudos to all these guys who take care
[SPEAKER_00]: of our farm, because obviously Mike has
had years and years of experience
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we do is so much more scientific
and so much more dialed in to the point
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're keeping track of every single
plant and what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a field of 10,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the phenol, the great phenol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we do a lot of selective breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, Mike is one of the people
that's responsible for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: say a specific chamber like hella jelly
chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's responsible for keeping an eye on the
potential selections that we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: see for breeding all year long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Walking by them every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're kind of just looking like that
one's the best one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, it's so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know your dad took a rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: That does a lot of genetic testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does a lot of testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he's also got these outsourcing
projects where he's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: these huge phenol hunts are going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, genomics has always been really
important to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's a lot of people out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to shame, like any kind of breeding,
because I think it's all with a purpose
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, it's all interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes down to it, if you're
just throwing pollen on something that
[SPEAKER_00]: really is just pollen checking,
it's not breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selective breeding and focusing on
genomics is a whole different level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, back crossing it and getting it to
S1.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like super just straightforward,
you know, that's the main goal,
[SPEAKER_02]: really, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's fascinating stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always been an interest of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's cool having you guys here to talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, I think it'll stay fascinating
for a long time, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, this industry,
as new as it is, I mean, obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not new to us, but it's new to a lot
of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't had the opportunities to do
such intense genomic testing to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: labs like UC Berkeley in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what we were doing at the time was
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's opened a lot of doors as far
as advancement and learning about the
[SPEAKER_00]: strains and, you know, learning about the
effects of different cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think, you know, the more that we
dive into this, the more our minds are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to keep being blown because this
plant, it's like, yeah, it's never ending
[SPEAKER_00]: wonders.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was finding the unicorn, you know,
I know it leads me into so many different
[SPEAKER_01]: lines of questioning about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I mean, what do you guys
see in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys obviously you're working hard and
trying to develop new products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do you see anything interesting in
the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you have future developments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've kind of learned to not get
like too excited by, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the new crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like back in the day, I think the first
thing was like CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did do like a few CBD lines and we
got kind of into that and we're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this going to be like the next huge
thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this going to take over?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what we've learned is like following
hype trains really never works out for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like we kind of just like follow
our heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, obviously THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all people really want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like, I'm sure you know,
like when you walk through the field and
[SPEAKER_00]: you find one of those unicorns,
you fucking know when you walk through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse my language.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, you know, you're in a field of
five thousand plants and you think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible to pick that one winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you find it, you really do know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like you see it and it,
you know, blows your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smell it and it blows your mind even
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool to capture it too, you know,
it's like when you take a clone and you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you take it back and then you
kind of get.
[SPEAKER_02]: To run it and you could have that forever,
you know, once you turn it to a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been doing that a lot with our R
&D process now for when we, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we go and we do our phenol hunts and we
have our winner selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will propagate enough cuts of that to
at least run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One full sun, one light death and,
you know, one indoor mix light as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we want to see what it
represents in any environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, like we breathe for full sun
product because I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion and it's honestly one of the
things that like I've had to really like
[SPEAKER_00]: teach myself that not everyone knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not logic for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, I'm like sun-grown flowers,
what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives the widest expression of the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, full potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, speaking of sun grown, what do you
guys, what's your favorite, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are your favorite seeds that you like
to smell like out of the seed line?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your favorite?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a really tough question for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this year, I think I'm really rooting
for the farmer's daughter strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only because it was a little bit of a
homage to myself, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that overall that one definitely
has potential for full sun cultivators to
[SPEAKER_00]: be getting, you know, higher yields,
higher THC, but also still having that bag
[SPEAKER_00]: of fuel that we're all looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the genetic, the cross,
you know, crosses?
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was our Humboldt pound cake
times, what was the rest of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it wedding strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was wedding tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt pound cake times wedding tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely super cakey,
kind of purple, big chunky nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about you, Michael?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'd say my all time favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have definitely an all time favorite
and then the new favorite, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: my all time favorite would probably be the
blueberry muffin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I smelled some of that Dave
Sunrise bag of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It literally smells like blueberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think my new favorite would probably
be the potty mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potty mouth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I haven't tried that one yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a weird, crazy cross we did of a,
is it, was it Humboldt pound cake times
[SPEAKER_02]: mountain top mint?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what that was.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one's just, it looks like we had
it grow in full sun and it looked like
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor with an amount of leaf to nug,
you know, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that one's a really unique one,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was another one where I like,
I won't ever forget the day where we
[SPEAKER_00]: really like fully, we were out there
taking cuts and it came from our own farm
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, which is kind of rare,
but we went up to it and we were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, this one's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just has like these crazy, you know,
trichome covered potty bracts,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has great bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep hearing about it, but I haven't
looked at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been selling really well so far this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like a really good sign for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were going crazy for it at the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they were like, what is that nug?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we had the nug spinny thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then obviously you guys got a big auto
flower line you've worked on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've been putting a lot of focus
into our auto lines, to be honest,
[SPEAKER_00]: like even personally when they first kind
of started our come around and I,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, did our first little R and D
batches of the ones that we'd gathered
[SPEAKER_00]: from, you know, corners of all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were like, we don't know about these.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, you know, kind of larpy,
kind of small, kind of eh.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like as the years have gone on,
like, man, I have to say, I never thought
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say this, but some of them are really
like standing up to photo period lines for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're testing high, they're getting
chunky, they're getting dense and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they have those gorgeous frosty
representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing is like, you know, they don't
really have nearly as many environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: factors that they have to deal with
because it's such a short flowering time
[SPEAKER_00]: and because they're just kind of doing
their own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if you plant them in the optimal
timing, you're not dealing with like rain,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not dealing with frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I know they're hardy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your dad's been kind to me and he's helped
over the last few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using some of his autos in the
spring and it's been really interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: watching the evolution of the quality and
then also just the potential of the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, planting in May or actually
April, end of April and then watching the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant grow, not having to do anything with
spraying at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have, because they're just like
the heart, I don't know, something happens
[SPEAKER_01]: with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the plants like are shifting so
rapidly, they're not releasing the same
[SPEAKER_01]: hormones during flowering or something
weird's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of crazy how they're not
attracting pests as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that too actually and I mean
that's something that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we should definitely look into a little
bit more from a scientific stance,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if I was gonna guess, I would say that
it's probably something similar like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the hormones or even it's maybe,
you know, it's just something in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruderalis trait itself where it's just not
as susceptible to those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ruderalis might have some other secondary
metabolites that it's producing that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: not quite tuned into, but yeah,
it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fascinating watching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been a huge advantage to like
honestly a lot of growers these days,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when, you know, I highly
recommend people who are doing full term
[SPEAKER_00]: to an interplanting project where you kind
of just put an auto right in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're paying for every square foot,
you might as well try to get as much out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it feels like the way Humboldt
Seed's heading, it's like pretty soon the
[SPEAKER_01]: autos are gonna be, you're just gonna have
whatever variety you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, it's just gonna be like the
photo period variety but in auto form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of the greenhouse dep companies
will be out of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Micah helped a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this year with, we did our caramel
cream auto flower and that one was a photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period strain for quite a few years before
that and so taking it from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that photo period line and then making
sure that it carries all of those traits
[SPEAKER_00]: while also introducing the Ruderalis is
definitely tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big undertake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't like to split.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lot of lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the crazy thing about the auto flowers
is you can't take clones off of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking with Nat about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you're just in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they're flipping, you're having to
reverse and deal with a large scale
[SPEAKER_01]: population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think we've covered pretty much
everything that we would normally would
[SPEAKER_01]: with the flower guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's, let's see, we could end it on
if there's anything that you'd like to see
[SPEAKER_01]: change with the regulations or education
in the industry, what would that one thing
[SPEAKER_01]: be?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, right now, something I've been
really thinking about is how absurd it is
[SPEAKER_00]: that the tax that people are paying per
pound is not based off of the price
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting for a cent pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that first, you know, it's just a
brick set.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I think, you know, for sun grown
cultivators to actually be able to have
[SPEAKER_00]: like a winning shot, it's not really fair
to be putting them in the same exact tax
[SPEAKER_00]: bracket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although to me, sun grown is worth so much
more than indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the fact that we have a lot of
uneducated consumers out there and they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what to ask for when they go
into dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, realistically, that should have
been based off of the price you're
[SPEAKER_00]: receiving for your pounds in the first
place, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something I would really like to
see change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any taxes?
[SPEAKER_02]: The taxes on the square footage and stuff
is just outrageous right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hard market to get into if you
don't have a lot of money and you know you
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people aren't surviving right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micah and his family have been in the area
for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micah is, you know, a native tribal
member.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, for people in those
cultures to even be able to get their foot
[SPEAKER_00]: in the door in the cannabis industry,
it's now like nearly impossible because if
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have hundreds of thousands of
dollars to put up front for licensings and
[SPEAKER_00]: taxes and for employment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up front costs, as opposed to like
starting a tomato farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: The startup is just so different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could start a tomato farm pretty
readily.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of these people don't want to
grow to be big.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this needs to get normalized a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely needs to be normalized,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully we'll get some change going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if we come together as a community
in these groups like this and start
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing regulators, we'll hopefully make
some change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been really awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate coming by and hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot.
Thank you.
