[SPEAKER_04]: We are here doing the Dragonfly Earth
Medicine panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of announced earlier, but I've got
to go over it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got Jesse BioVortex.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's also a producer of a movie that's
coming out called Tending the Garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's also an incredible breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been working things.
[SPEAKER_04]: He does a lot of breeding on the coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you are looking for that mold
resistant stuff, this is the man.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been doing some amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been working with his genetics for
years, and I can't talk highly enough
[SPEAKER_04]: about them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got Forrest from Sunroots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kovalo, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all know Kovalo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys want big plants, these are the
people that work on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it does help.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we got Zelig from Spring Creek.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to check out what he does.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the man obviously works really,
really hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And much respect to just the tenacity and
the pursuit of farming and challenging
[SPEAKER_04]: mountain hillsides and stuff and working
with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Daniel from Heart Rock Mountain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Daniel's the family guy that you want to
bring your kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want your kids to hang out with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he's a true breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's good at making kids, and he's good at
making seeds, and he makes a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people that want the auto flower or
some CBD, this guy's got kind of the
[SPEAKER_04]: range.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we've got Moongazer.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got Josh over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I met Josh a long time ago at this point,
which is kind of a trip because it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: like time has gotten weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's been really cool watching
somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys came to our farm way back in the
day before you had a farm and before you
[SPEAKER_04]: started yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I got to kind of watch that process
unfold via Instagram mostly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also I've been able to visit that
farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been just magical.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got twins.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole kid thing changes your world.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that's who's up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have a piece of paper, and I was
trying to be somewhat organized.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to look like I am.
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically what I'm going to do is just
kind of bring up some topics in relation
[SPEAKER_04]: to breeding and genetics and let these
people kind of share with you their
[SPEAKER_04]: thoughts on what I'm asking.
[SPEAKER_04]: So prepare.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dempere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just got to shout out to Josh and
Kelly.
[SPEAKER_04]: They really have spearheaded a large
network of community that has really,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're really doing good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're up in Canada, kind of stuck there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's so good because they get to
really work on their space.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they bring a lot of inspiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is a Dempere panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're all a part of that family.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've all been sharing genetics and
working with genetics for some time now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks, everybody who put this on,
Tamara and Joey, making this kind of thing
[SPEAKER_04]: happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, this is like the true future of all
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like going back in time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, let's make this happen like it
once did again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Regardless.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like it's a timeless act.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we gather.
[SPEAKER_04]: We share seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get to be around the people who have
put a lot of time and energy into their
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that needs to keep happening in our
planet in order for us to really fully
[SPEAKER_04]: awaken into this next coming age,
which is an age of golden light.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that age of golden light and
consciousness is real.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been trying to give people,
as many people, some of that weed that I
[SPEAKER_04]: grew just a smoke during the time while
we're all listening so we can receive that
[SPEAKER_04]: energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to let each one of the breeders
here just kind of talk about themselves a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want you to just kind of introduce
yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to know your relationship to
the breeding and to genetics and what
[SPEAKER_04]: inspires you and what has inspired you in
that realm and where it kind of started.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know it can get long-winded,
so let's just keep track of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just try to pick out some nuggets of
things that have really helped guide you
[SPEAKER_04]: further into the process.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's start maybe on one end.
[SPEAKER_04]: And work down the line just for easy sake.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Jesse, what's the inspiration?
[SPEAKER_08]: Come up or do you move in the microphone?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stand and deliver.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we hear it for Nick?
[SPEAKER_08]: That was freaking amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's real shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nick's a little stand-up comedy and
brought everyone in and all of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: And those seeds will do a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes me think of the original Living
Soil Symposium and the seeds that went out
[SPEAKER_08]: there and seeing that stuff today still in
all the different ways that it's been
[SPEAKER_08]: worked on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's real beautiful,
the sharing of seeds and the way that it
[SPEAKER_08]: brings us together.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we get to exchange around a
relationship with nature, observing a
[SPEAKER_08]: plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think from the moment I first found
cannabis seeds and weed, I was immediately
[SPEAKER_08]: fascinated, immediately grew them,
brought them out in the woods,
[SPEAKER_08]: fascinated about the plant in every way.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then that made me fascinated about
nature in every way and science and art
[SPEAKER_08]: and mutualistic relationships,
all the ways that those work and how those
[SPEAKER_08]: actually can apply to everything in
nature, but also everything in our own
[SPEAKER_08]: constructs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the way we should be working
for economy and for the way that we
[SPEAKER_08]: interact in business and in friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: And events like this, I think,
are an amazing example of that potential.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, let's hear it for this event.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really special because this is what it
was.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it feels good.
[SPEAKER_08]: The weather blessed us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is the type of exchange.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the type of thing we've been
hungry for in very much the last two
[SPEAKER_08]: years, for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: But honestly, before those two years,
it already kind of got fucked.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we didn't even have shit like this
before COVID.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's definitely a very cathartic feeling
to just be here and experience all this
[SPEAKER_08]: with you and celebrate the plants and
friendship and community.
[SPEAKER_08]: I started a project called BioVortex a
while ago around the idea of influencing
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis industry in a more
environmentally thoughtful direction and
[SPEAKER_08]: mutualism in general in the way that we
interact with each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the breeding has been part of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But so has the social media as the
photography, the art projects,
[SPEAKER_08]: the movie projects that we're doing now,
all kinds of different aspects.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the talks and events,
the regenerative cannabis farm award at
[SPEAKER_08]: the Emerald Cup and being able to have an
award ceremony also talk about the
[SPEAKER_08]: practices and the farms and getting to
know the farms in that level and being
[SPEAKER_08]: able to do the rage lounge and do all the
different talks that got to connect
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis community to the practices that
mattered.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that also built this kind of amazing
family, like everyone right here,
[SPEAKER_08]: just very special people.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've got to grow each other's
genetics, visit each other's gardens,
[SPEAKER_08]: share in each other's families and food
and watch each other's children grow up.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's special stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I'll let it go to the next
person.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm very thankful for this moment and
all of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I'm Forrest from Sunroots Farm up in
Colvillo.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everything what Jesse just said,
like bring this all together really feels
[SPEAKER_03]: like the right thing to do right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like we need this more than
ever to be able to come and just show each
[SPEAKER_03]: other what we're doing, what we still love
to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just feels like a good thing to be
doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I started growing when I was in a
young age, and I always was drawn to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the color and the weed and like
the connection to farming and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, just being out in the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really been like a journey
through life, just doing what I love and
[SPEAKER_03]: like sharing each step and, you know,
just keep, you know, expanding like the
[SPEAKER_03]: awareness of, of, you know, good conscious
gardening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And bringing the skills to the table to
show people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like to grow big plants,
obviously, you guys have probably heard.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do a lot of our own genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done our own genetics for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: My family has been breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: My brother crossed the jaw goo and we've
just been kind of going off, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the goo line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, bringing this and that into
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really been a pretty awesome
thing to be doing and it feels good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for being, letting us be up
here and showing you what we do best at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo, what's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to see you all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Zellig, Spring Creek Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sonoma County, Casadero.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been doing no till light dep for,
you know, 18, 19, 20 years for or so
[SPEAKER_01]: before we knew what we were really doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's really nice to,
you know, be here with everybody and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, experience, you know,
this seed swap and, you know, just really
[SPEAKER_01]: thankful to, you know, know you all and,
and just you know, just smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just smoked a bunch of hash,
so I'm fucking baked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, hitting the old hash pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I know this is what we all
really need, you know, for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we all know what's going on in the
industry and, you know, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is kind of in control of this
whole paradigm, you know, it's not about
[SPEAKER_01]: money or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really just about the plant,
you know, and, and so it's, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: going on and, you know, I think that as
long as we, you know, obviously it's
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing us together as much as,
you know, I think we can all say that
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe we feel a little bit detached,
you know, honestly, because I know I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am right here with everybody,
you know, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel, I don't know if it was just me,
but I feel like there's this detachment
[SPEAKER_01]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by all of us coming together,
it's really crucial, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially right now, because I know we're
all feeling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm feeling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know everybody else is feeling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just really thankful that we're all
showing up for each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you know, just like you're all,
like some of my favorite people in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world right here, you know, I just love y
'all and just been doing my thing up on
[SPEAKER_01]: the hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Y'all probably see me doing what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I just do what I do,
make no claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come from no educational background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just a practical, practical guy who,
you know, just listens to the plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: do what I'm told.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just tell me what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just do what they want me to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I need to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter if it doesn't matter
what you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of the whole part of my
whole methodology is just the trust,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just trusting the plant,
trusting the process, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like an onion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just peeling back the layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you peel back the layers,
the more you trusted and the more,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more is revealed over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's just the, you know,
cause like there's a lot of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's like the, the bro science that
people like the science world is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, if you don't test stuff, you're a bro
science, you know, like, you know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean, Nick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you don't test something,
you're, you're automatically, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you don't need to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if you're following the methodology,
methodology of nature, nature is taking
[SPEAKER_01]: care of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause nature is the most intelligent
system on earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't really need to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think it's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have that relationship with your
soil, but once you get that base of your
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding and relationship with your
soil, then, you know, you can kind of just
[SPEAKER_01]: go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I dunno, it's just,
I dunno, it's just something I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about a lot, you know,
just, it's just like this, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: within the industry, how, you know,
people are, if, you know, just the
[SPEAKER_01]: different sides of the coin of the science
side to, you know, like me and Nick are
[SPEAKER_01]: just like on our own little world,
you know, and like, you know, a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: other, you know, farmers, we just kind of
like do our thing and listen to the plans,
[SPEAKER_01]: do what we're told, you know, but,
you know, then there's the, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the side of the coin where you have to
test everything and it's all like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think it's, and
ultimately everybody's just looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: that balance, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's just what we're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's looking for balance,
whatever it is, whatever you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're just all looking for the
same thing, which is balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I dunno.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing my breeding project,
which is just like, I'm just breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: For like this head change that I am
experiencing, um, which was this,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, dog shit seeds bag seed that I
started, uh, just kind of a long story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't get into it all, but yeah,
I've just been kind of, which turned out
[SPEAKER_01]: to be, I was breeding for a high CBGA and
didn't know it until I started testing and
[SPEAKER_01]: then went back and went through all of my
previous tests and I found they were all a
[SPEAKER_01]: high end CBGA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've realized that's what I was
breeding for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of like my breeding project
is like a high CBGA breeding project,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, which is the precursor to all
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's kind of significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's something that's cool that
I've been working on, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: just super thankful to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, just love y'all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm Daniel with a heart rock mountain
farm, uh, pride line seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think kind of what like Jesse was
saying, uh, cannabis was my gateway
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was the first plant I grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and my older brother isn't here to
confirm anymore, but he had like house
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in like middle school, but he could
have been growing weed then too,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I started out growing cannabis
and now I have, you know, cactuses in my
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, you know, I'm like taking
cuttings from people's houses of their
[SPEAKER_00]: house plants and I'm obsessed with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so I'm thankful for that and for
this community and um, I'm second
[SPEAKER_00]: generation, uh, cannabis reader.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third, if you count my Nana, who was,
who grew in Old Topanga for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even went down to help her harvest once
in high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, can you help me out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come down and it'll be fun trip to LA
that she had like a plant up her second
[SPEAKER_00]: story window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, okay, I see why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you know, my, one of my favorite
stories from my dad, he was saving bag
[SPEAKER_00]: seed for like a decade, you know,
before he popped his first seeds in 76 and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like, you know, Mexican South
American.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they acclimated that to the Hills in
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then some Indica came in from
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew that, they crossed those
together, groom for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I came onto the scene,
my older brother, a lot younger,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he was like 10 or 11 helping my
dad in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looked at me and said, you don't
know, you need to go to school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one kid growing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do something else with your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm running the family farm and
he's pretty happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he wanted me to be more than just
an outlaw, which I get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm more than just an outlaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: They run a commercial cannabis farm and
licensed nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, we just, you know,
we just, we, we've always made seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: like, um, I've talked with Nick and like
Zellick was saying, like we learned the
[SPEAKER_00]: heart first.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were plant whispers first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're like, okay, what does filial
mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I better look that up from Webster's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, so we're learning the
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, where we need to, and it's,
it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're all very passionate about what
we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's great to be up here with these
guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I'm Josh from moon gazer farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, just got to give a huge love and
gratitude to Joey and Tamara.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, this is like how things used to be and
I'm getting a lot of good feeling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back from how that all was.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but basically pretty much,
uh, uh, my wife, Sandra and I,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, we have a couple kids twins and we're
just trying to make it as a legal,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, as a, you know, rec farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, back when we met Nick and Jesse and
everyone, things were starting to get
[SPEAKER_05]: legal and we kind of jumped into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, people were telling us to grow
clones and have everything be all uniform
[SPEAKER_05]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just always wanted to stick with
the seeds and, um, do our breeding and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's, uh, finally gotten, you know,
it's gotten us to a point now where it's
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you just gotta have like triple a
herb right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's gotta, you know, it's like,
it's gotta be good and, and growing from
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds, you know, we were able to achieve
that even though we have different
[SPEAKER_05]: phenotypes and you know, things don't have
to be like super deeper uniform all the
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so it's, you know, yeah, so,
you know, seeds are just for so many
[SPEAKER_05]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I mean, even our own kids,
like they're, you know, we had,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're different phenotypes, but people
think they're identical.
[SPEAKER_05]: People think they're identical all the
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but we see there's subtle differences
and we love their subtle differences.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and so that's sort of how I approached
the cannabis, um, and how a lot of us here
[SPEAKER_05]: approach the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and, and, and it's just kind of been,
if you, if you want a truly sun grown
[SPEAKER_05]: product, uh, which we do, that's what we
like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it's sorta planted in the spring on
the, when the moon is a specific,
[SPEAKER_05]: when the moon is in a certain,
uh, phase and we harvest it in the fall.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, when the moon's in a certain phase
and, uh, you know, when you're growing
[SPEAKER_05]: from clones, clones are wonderful and
they've been crucial for this plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: of course, uh, in its evolution.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at this point for us, when we're,
when we're out in the light and we're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing it out, we're doing it this way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, that's, that's how we want
to smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we want to provide for people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's how we're doing it is just
from seed planted in the spring,
[SPEAKER_05]: harvested in the fall.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, planted among lots of other
beautiful plants so that we don't have to
[SPEAKER_05]: spray anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this just got a loose thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got to be careful when we're
holding it, but I just rather sit down and
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of not do the whole thing in that
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then I'll just pass this around,
but I'm just going to kind of bring up
[SPEAKER_04]: some topics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: back on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're back on.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so I want to, I want to get into some,
um, just kind of, I want to dig into some
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I'm pretty passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, my evolution with breeding seeds
has evolved rapidly and, and, and I
[SPEAKER_04]: haven't been doing it as long as
everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but I've been committed to it,
uh, very pretty seriously and been paying
[SPEAKER_04]: really close attention to a whole bunch of
different lines and, and working lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my question is, uh, out of,
out of all the seeds that you like to
[SPEAKER_04]: grow, and if we could think of seeds in
different categories, such as a F one,
[SPEAKER_04]: IBL, poly hybrid, um, specific traits
within genetics that you might like,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, but what type of seeds are your
preference for growing for you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not, not for what the market wants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause if we're all, all breeders have to
do a certain amount of work, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: for the market, but also then there's a
certain amount of soul work that goes on
[SPEAKER_04]: in breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I want to pull some of the soul out
of you guys and just like hear what your
[SPEAKER_04]: favorite types of seeds to pop right now
are and interpret that the way you will,
[SPEAKER_04]: if it's from your own stock, if it's just
whatever, but if anybody, who wants to
[SPEAKER_04]: volunteer to take that one on first,
let's go down the line again.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice and easy with the mic.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess what I most want to grow is what I
find interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a little bit rough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yeah, it's what, what I get to learn
from what, things that I find interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's, that's what I want to keep
sprouting.
[SPEAKER_08]: The things that I have in my head,
what I want to see, what I want to see
[SPEAKER_08]: other people grow and what I want to see
come from that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all the like very interesting,
like possibilities that go out and you
[SPEAKER_08]: know, what, what else will come from this
seed?
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, the speakers right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that actually works.
[SPEAKER_08]: What better?
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so to be able to see the outcome of
something on a farm to in different
[SPEAKER_08]: locations also really interests me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And doing that around hash is really
interesting to be able to see how hash
[SPEAKER_08]: comes out, how that yields and to see that
on different farms and different plants
[SPEAKER_08]: isolated and then the idea of breeding
with them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but some of the like really joyful
things are growing like true primordial
[SPEAKER_08]: varieties and land races and seeing all
the lessons that they like kind of have in
[SPEAKER_08]: there and really observing the plant in
those forms.
[SPEAKER_08]: The low lab, um, from, uh, Erasmus Indian
land rice seed exchange.
[SPEAKER_08]: He had, he had got these low lab Valley,
um, seeds, which is like 7,000 feet up in
[SPEAKER_08]: Kashmir and in an area growing in the
trees and in the Hills where it didn't
[SPEAKER_08]: have any other cross pollination.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no light pollution.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not really affected by human
encroachment.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it actually is a primordial variety
that's just been growing in the trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was really interesting to see all
the things that were already there in this
[SPEAKER_08]: thing, this plant that's been growing in
the same way for thousands of years in the
[SPEAKER_08]: same location without other things messing
with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was very, they were, yeah,
very adaptive, very smart.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're kind of like the wolves of,
uh, a cannabis plant and the fact that
[SPEAKER_08]: they're like just adapted to survive in
this place and not domesticated.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we start to do domestication process,
like instant morphology changes happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like if you're picking your favorite
plant and smelling those flowers and then,
[SPEAKER_08]: or seeing how well it hashes or something,
those seeds are the ones that are actually
[SPEAKER_08]: inside the flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just hidden in that Brax, a little
closer to the, the actual stem and inside.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so those ones, they don't like fly out
that easy and they get bigger and
[SPEAKER_08]: instantly you start domesticating the
seeds, get plumper and bigger.
[SPEAKER_08]: These seeds are incredibly small and very
thin and ready to like fly out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like when breeding with it,
like it had to be really careful to like
[SPEAKER_08]: put a bag around it before cutting it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause the seeds would all just start
flying, you know, and that's like a
[SPEAKER_08]: scattering to the wind would come by and
they would actually go pretty far.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just like ready to shoot out and
it's like, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like the only reason why they'd
stay in is because that was like an
[SPEAKER_08]: interaction with humans and like picking
the thing that you, so those are the ones
[SPEAKER_08]: that keep getting passed on.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like the one in your favorite flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're, you're actually choosing that
kind of selection process.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just kind of interesting to think about
all the lessons something old would show
[SPEAKER_08]: us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the adaptive aspect of it too,
as far as being able to watch it and
[SPEAKER_08]: interact with the sun and its environment
or them, I don't want to say it,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's not like the right word when
referring to a plant, but you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: they, I was growing up male and females
and we should have better words,
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess, but they were, they were tracking
the sun so perfectly before it rose,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, like, and I actually did night
vision time-lapse photos of them to watch
[SPEAKER_08]: this dance that they do each day.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they would just like set up so good,
like, just stretching like straight yoga
[SPEAKER_08]: ready for the sun and got every bit of
that perfect like light in the beginning
[SPEAKER_08]: and then would kind of track.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then at night they would fold down so
far, just completely like hold everything
[SPEAKER_08]: in and go through this whole breath.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, it was just interesting like how
fast they grew and how small and slow they
[SPEAKER_08]: grew at first too.
[SPEAKER_08]: All the seeds were, they're just so small
and they take so long to germinate and are
[SPEAKER_08]: difficult to germinate.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was thinking about, well,
that makes a ton of sense because if all
[SPEAKER_08]: of a sudden they're scattering and then
the snow comes down or like it rains right
[SPEAKER_08]: before the winter, every plant that
germinates just dies 7,000 feet up or so.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they had to really be smart enough
to know, hey, are these conditions really
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like, okay, yeah, it's wet,
maybe it's warm enough, but is it warm
[SPEAKER_08]: enough for enough period of time for us to
really be like, okay, cool, let's crack,
[SPEAKER_08]: we're gonna have a successful season and
not immediately die by like some big
[SPEAKER_08]: storm.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, then they seem to like show that
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're very careful.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's like, okay, is this it?
[SPEAKER_08]: And they cracked so slowly the germination
and just that root radical is just so
[SPEAKER_08]: small and coming out the teeniest little
sprouts, but then they grow really,
[SPEAKER_08]: really fast and take advantage of whatever
they have.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that might be, but if they don't have
much, they'll conserve too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they can kind of, they're very adaptive
and figuring that kind of stuff out.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, the things that are fascinating
or interesting that connect to something
[SPEAKER_08]: old and get me thinking and whether that's
for making something that makes a farmer
[SPEAKER_08]: more successful in what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I like mold resistance.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like having stuff that flowers at
certain times, certain terpian profiles,
[SPEAKER_08]: certain hash yielding, just profiles in
the flowers and look at all the things and
[SPEAKER_08]: like figuring out what works for someone.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a constant puzzle and
fascination too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the things that are interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to thank Jesse because he shared
his genetics with me and have just made
[SPEAKER_03]: new genetics now that are like
substantially better mold resistance and
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, crystal content because he has a
lot of hash strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I bred that with a lot of my different
velvet perps crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now they're like, they seem
supercharged, but I started growing like
[SPEAKER_03]: little plants in the bushes, like gorilla
status, you know, I'm sure a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: have done that before, but I was always
fascinated with like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: throwing pollen on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have to like walk two miles and I
had a couple little male plants in a
[SPEAKER_03]: little spring bed, you know, and I would
take the pollen and throw it on my best,
[SPEAKER_03]: my, you know, one of the best plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, just to see the diversity
of what comes out of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: just throwing a little bit of pollen on
and seeing, you know, the different
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotypes that come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's kind of like a Pandora's
box.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that really like, you know,
got me into breeding, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: so about 10 years ago, I really started to
do it each year, making my own seeds and
[SPEAKER_03]: then growing them and then selecting the
best ones, you know, that I liked and
[SPEAKER_03]: throwing more pollen on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, you know, it's just like a,
it's a good thing to do, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really, it makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, yeah, keep on doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's like that everything has changed
into, you know, like you have to have the
[SPEAKER_03]: best stuff to even just get it on the
market to maybe sell it for a decent
[SPEAKER_03]: price.
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not, not anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe hopefully in the future,
you know, but, you know, we can just keep
[SPEAKER_03]: crossing our varieties together and who
knows what we'll come up with.
So I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: going to jump in because I'm right here in
line.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to share what I'm working on
as well, or what is exciting right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I think of breeding seeds,
I mean, that's the piece that I'm most
[SPEAKER_04]: excited about.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny because it doesn't mix as well
as a commercial production farmer,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I have to rely on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I love breeding so much that I just do
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my favorite thing lately has been
doing as many inbred lines as I can,
[SPEAKER_04]: as many populations of those inbred lines
as I can in small rows within a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_04]: high population counts and making
selections within those inbred lines and
[SPEAKER_04]: furthering each inbred line.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also they're all there set up stacked
on one another to make real F1s if all of
[SPEAKER_04]: the lines that you're putting in your
breeding hoop are inbred.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're making more IBLs and you're
making more F1 stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: And F1 stock is what you want to have if
you're growing production, which I have to
[SPEAKER_04]: do and I have to depend on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've had to go through that testing
process.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the truth is there aren't really real
F1s out there right now because we're all
[SPEAKER_04]: still so immature in our breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there are some, you know,
deeper F, we're getting further,
[SPEAKER_04]: but really standard inbreeding for
isolating traits and characteristics is
[SPEAKER_04]: like more than 10 generations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, when that's the case,
we just have to be realistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just say keep going down the lines,
keep inbreeding, but also keep crossing
[SPEAKER_04]: those inbred lines to make those F1s and
explore that because the hybrid vigor is
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely something to understand when
you're growing for production.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the breeding is the most exciting thing
for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just go kind of a little overboard
with inbred line collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what Nick just said, yeah,
what he just said, basically, well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, there's a bunch of things in
there, like what you're saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: how it's hard to do that in a commercial
space that you're trying to run for
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I've been doing for years
is breeding and doing production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So running a research facility and a
production facility in one space,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is really crazy because there's a
lot of room for, I mean, there's no room
[SPEAKER_01]: for error, you know, so you really have to
be like extra on your shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot slack for one second because
you just you're working with a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plus, it's just, you know, yeah,
it's just hard to really, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: pop enough seeds and have the square
footage to make those selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of actually kind of phased out
of doing my breeding projects for right
[SPEAKER_01]: now and just holding on to my seed stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because it's it's I'm trying to just
stay, you know, we, you know, shit's kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of falling apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just trying to stay in my lane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I'm not trying to do too
much, which is, you know, it's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've been so, yeah, I was
running these inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been running this these dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm calling it the dog pound, which,
you know, from my dog, my my dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Originally, it was like dog shit,
bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this super silver haze male.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we just started running a
bunch of lines off of that dog shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really like the dog shit turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just literally I just love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a hard sell because of the name,
you know, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, but so that's, you know,
so then that that's how kind of the dog
[SPEAKER_01]: star came up once it went into the super
silver.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we we called it dog star,
you know, which was, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like like Sirius A, you know, the origins
of cannabis, that whole story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to get into all that,
but, you know, that's kind of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, paying homage to to the origins
of cannabis and that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that, you know, kind of,
you know, that we ended up finding the
[SPEAKER_01]: high CBGA, which is the precursor to all
cannabinoids, you know, that was pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriate for, you know, calling it dog
star, I felt, you know, to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was it was something special,
like, you know, over three percent CBGA at
[SPEAKER_01]: full term, like like full term,
you know, full term, three months later
[SPEAKER_01]: testing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's three percent, three, four percent
CBGA, which was, you know, which is one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the first cannabinoids that, you know,
deteriorates, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really hard to get high,
you know, to isolate the CBGA,
[SPEAKER_01]: apparently, which I didn't know at the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, once we found that out,
we just started working with that a little
[SPEAKER_01]: more intentionally, you know, and that was
kind of like that was that head change
[SPEAKER_01]: that I was chasing, kind of like a CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we all know what that's like,
you know, but the CBGA, it's kind of it's
[SPEAKER_01]: similar, but it's got like that different
head change, but it's similar,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and it's really hard to put your
finger on, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, it just is so that's,
you know, so that was really exciting for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of like my story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as what I would like to work with,
I'd like to work with everyone else's
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, but I don't quite have like the
space to pop everybody's label at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, but I would love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really, you know, and if somebody is
going to give me some to work with,
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of need like a hundred of any one,
you know, seed to just to pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like ten is just like,
what am I doing with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm like, where I don't have,
you know, I'm going to start looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: other, you know, heads that, you know,
just, you know, I'm trying to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, on a commercial facility,
I have to have more of a direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but we just don't have my county,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were just we're just staying in our
lane for right now, you know, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, that's been it's been good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I'll get back into messing
with popping a bunch of seeds and looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for different lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'll get back into that in
a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for right now, I've just been trying
to like, you know, hold the line,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just survive for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, yeah, I just like to I would
love to work with like everyone's stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: really.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, kind of like what Nick is
saying, it's just like that's what I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been, you know, just doing that for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, just yeah, it's working out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just got to listen to the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we were just we were just,
you know, we weren't we didn't have any
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, education.
[SPEAKER_01]: This or guidance, we were just literally
just like, you know, like we do everything
[SPEAKER_01]: just listening, just being guided by the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's amazing how far that can get you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really just what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our ancestors did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's really effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got us all this far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at all the amazing genetics and lines
and breeding, breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's that's happened
throughout, you know, like a long many,
[SPEAKER_01]: many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it's just it's really good that
we're all here swapping seeds and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I think it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool how everybody's like not
holding on to shit anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it used to be like this like whole
lockdown, you know, and that's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: also why I just was like doing my own
thing, you know, just because we were just
[SPEAKER_01]: doing our own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't like messing with anyone else's
stuff, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it's just been so it's really
nice that to have all this variety because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, you know, that's just like that's
what life is about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep this short.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Nick said?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, just working lines is
definitely what I'm into, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you kind of you kind of see
what you're want to look for in your your
[SPEAKER_00]: first generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get to see what you're
working with in your second generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and it is like I'm sure
everyone up here will agree, like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: about getting lucky, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like sometimes you just but
then if you have like the populations
[SPEAKER_00]: through the sifts, like if you start
enough seeds of, you know, F1,
[SPEAKER_00]: F2, F3, you're going to find one that
looks just like her mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the one you made the seeds on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the one you want to
stabilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you get lucky and find her
and, you know, 40 seeds or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sometimes you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to look again the next generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of times where I make a
generation of seeds, get the pond.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, I'm not going to make it
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't, you know, I didn't find what I
was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to lose things and you're
going to find things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is beautiful working with this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant spirit, you know, the,
you know, cannabis is I mean, everything's
[SPEAKER_00]: consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they are light or vibrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you looking on the market level
and something like cannabis or the cactus
[SPEAKER_00]: or some other plants that interact with
our consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a higher concentration of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get a code.
[SPEAKER_00]: We co-create with that and we get to find
whatever, you know, you, any one of us
[SPEAKER_00]: could take a line and go a different
direction with it when we put our heart
[SPEAKER_00]: into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a beautiful thing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is beautiful to share those
genetics with everybody and, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to not worry, like worry about getting
it out there because you're going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: something beautiful with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we might go somewhere else with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get something back from
somebody or lose something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that co-creation with this plant
and, and yeah, we really need that right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, as a planet and a people, what
cannabis can do from like oil production
[SPEAKER_00]: to medicine and, and just with
consciousness in general, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and I'm also very excited that,
uh, psychedelics are going to be legal
[SPEAKER_00]: soon, hopefully in the next light,
our lifetime across the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I mean, if you listen,
you know, she, she calls to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: she talks to you and, and then you get to
put your input in too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a fun, fun relationship as a
breeder that you develop with your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in your lines and then your friends lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, like, you know,
we're all doing like amazing work or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, or getting lucky.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yeah, I mean, with regard to what we
like to grow, uh, basically when we first
[SPEAKER_05]: started out, um, you know, definitely
Jesse seeds I had been seeking out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I was basically looking for seeds that
had been grown in living soil and out in
[SPEAKER_05]: the full sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that were resistant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course that tastes really good and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, since then, we've probably ever on
this panel, we've got a little bit of
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics from, we have some from Amanda's
garden and Joey and Tamara.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got some seeds from, so,
um, we just love to mix it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We love to smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we like to try lots of different
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And from day to day or, you know,
our, our taste or our palate might change.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but we definitely will go for
commercial.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, but we're not too fixated on
having them all be purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if, if, if you end up having a
little bit of mixed phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they all have a certain smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we're super into like some,
you know, uniformity in that sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but hash also, we're definitely been
breeding for and thankful to Jesse for
[SPEAKER_05]: getting us some of the Nana breath and the
other banana OG crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they've been super nice for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, bananas, coffees, uh,
just lots of different guavas,
[SPEAKER_05]: watermelons, blueberries, um, just kind of
mixing it all up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always been fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, I'm into hash as well now,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and so that's another part that I'm
super excited in the, like, I'm,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm seriously mostly focused on hash line
seeds for growing because I really just am
[SPEAKER_04]: like, well, the truth is, is when the
resin is stored, I can have something for
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really like it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the flower, you know, it's bulky and
big and I don't know, but so there's this
[SPEAKER_04]: beauty in hash that I've really been
tuning into.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so from a genetic standpoint,
that's definitely been something I,
[SPEAKER_04]: I have felt, but I think, you know,
things have been rolling for quite a
[SPEAKER_04]: while.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's everybody feeling?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we want to keep rolling down this path
or should we kind of take a break and walk
[SPEAKER_04]: around and what do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's way past the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't, I don't know when we started.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where we're at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, keep going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yeah, let's do another round.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't, rarely are we all in this kind
of scenario together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have,
[SPEAKER_04]: so when I, when I talk to people about
what are you going to get from a seed
[SPEAKER_04]: standpoint, um, you know, I like to have
some categories of like steering people in
[SPEAKER_04]: the right direction to kind of most help
them in their path towards what they're
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like trying to, uh, create a whole
bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's all these names that people
use in our cannabis genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, and I just kind of want to
address them a little bit and be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a lot of loose meaning to a lot of
the language, uh, when it comes to F1,
[SPEAKER_04]: F2.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there's a lot of, uh, you know,
it's, it's not super dialed within,
[SPEAKER_04]: within cannabis breeding or, or it hasn't
been as much, but, um, I think it's
[SPEAKER_04]: important for us to explore it and to
understand it more, uh, and to understand
[SPEAKER_04]: like what agriculture normally does.
[SPEAKER_04]: In, in the breeding sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, uh, I was talking about inbred
lines and, and, you know, the value of
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding within bred lines to create
hybrids that really have a lot of vigor
[SPEAKER_04]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to talk a little bit about,
uh, the benefits in the, in the value of
[SPEAKER_04]: poly hybrids as well, because,
you know, there's a lot of, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a lot of poly hybrids around and,
and a lot less of the more strict line
[SPEAKER_04]: work has been being done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, there's a lot to learn.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you get on that path of strict line
work, um, and, and when you peter out or,
[SPEAKER_04]: or just understanding that inbred lines do
kind of slowly become a less of a
[SPEAKER_04]: productive thing, but it should be being
more honed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you narrow that further,
your population should start to become
[SPEAKER_04]: increasing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you might bottleneck some things a
couple of generations to try and steer it
[SPEAKER_04]: in the direction you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at that, after that point,
when you've honed something that you've
[SPEAKER_04]: got, and most of them are showing that you
want to open the population's backup
[SPEAKER_04]: because you don't want to keep taking one
single parent and one single male and only
[SPEAKER_04]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to start to increase the genetic
diversity amongst your bottleneck genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: already.
[SPEAKER_04]: So inbred line work is more than just
continually filial generationally
[SPEAKER_04]: crossing, but you also want to think about
some population expansions as you getting
[SPEAKER_04]: into a lesser or more inbred degraded
state, which are actually really good for
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people shouldn't get scared of an
inbred line that doesn't produce and grow
[SPEAKER_04]: like a hybrid does.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you don't get them for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't get them for production.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get those inbred lines because you
want to work with them from a breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: standpoint, because they create a super
vigorous F1 hybrid offsprings.
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's, I want to go down the line and
just let people address poly hybrids and
[SPEAKER_04]: how poly hybrids and working with poly
hybrids, what that's like for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that working?
[SPEAKER_08]: We good?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, that was excellent information.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope everyone was actually paying
attention to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, there's a lot to think about with
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really appreciate Nick's constant
work to go down, you know, like multiple,
[SPEAKER_08]: multiple generations, like getting to F6,
7, 8, in different varieties.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you get to that point,
it's a certain level of line breeding that
[SPEAKER_08]: breeds over very true as far as genetics
go.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and the hybrids that come out of that
are really amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, when we first met,
we, there was these was with Ryan from
[SPEAKER_08]: Humboldt seeds and the glazed cherry,
and he gave you those, I gave you the
[SPEAKER_08]: black dog and you took them to like
multiple generations.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then put them together and those
hybrids were so even and so much bigger,
[SPEAKER_08]: like you could just see that multiple
generation bigger.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, you know, that's how a lot
of breeding is done in agriculture for
[SPEAKER_08]: vegetables and everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: You take stuff to pretty far generation
F8, F9, and then you put them together to
[SPEAKER_08]: make an F1 that is a true vigorous hybrid.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's actually, strangely enough,
a certain uniformity in, in what happens
[SPEAKER_08]: from that crossing of varieties when
they're there to that point of line
[SPEAKER_08]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_08]: But he also just gave really, really good
information around not getting
[SPEAKER_08]: bottlenecked genetically.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as you, you know, you start off
earlier, making very solid selections for
[SPEAKER_08]: exactly what you want it to be.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're building that cannon of the flavor,
the like the resistance, the structured,
[SPEAKER_08]: all of the factors that you're thinking
about and building that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But then you want to make sure that you're
using multiple males.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if you're putting that onto
multiple females, and this is from sibling
[SPEAKER_08]: generation, that you then get to really
choose from those females, but you know
[SPEAKER_08]: that they've been pollinated with multiple
males.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so then, as you've already done some
work towards that, selecting what you want
[SPEAKER_08]: and stabilization of that variety,
you make sure not to bottleneck it,
[SPEAKER_08]: and then you can work that for for longer.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's, it's really like opening that
potential to not get too far down that
[SPEAKER_08]: line.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what happens is actually smaller and
smaller plants a little less vigor and but
[SPEAKER_08]: more and more smaller seeds, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And but more and more similar to though,
you know, and so it's an incredibly useful
[SPEAKER_08]: thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: But F1s are amazing, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, polyhybrids is actually what
the question is about.
[SPEAKER_08]: What we're supposed to be talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I fucking love polyhybrids.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love the work of going down multiple
generations.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also love backcrossing work too,
which is going back to a generation,
[SPEAKER_08]: the original generation, that what you
like the most of something.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a way of like kind of stacking
the genetics onto each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can get to a higher percentage of
the same genetic in that next generation
[SPEAKER_08]: really quickly.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's something I like to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I like to combine that with then
doing sibling generations from that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so making BC1F2 or F5 or something in
the black dog case, and then it becomes a
[SPEAKER_08]: very much just that genetic.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the and very useful for breeding
because it's similar to that wine breeding
[SPEAKER_08]: of getting to a F8 or something.
[SPEAKER_08]: But during that time with polyhybrids,
you get to like, do all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_08]: I only line breed like a couple things,
you know, each year you choose a few
[SPEAKER_08]: things that you're going to work pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then but then you have the potential
to do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't really want to limit that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's pretty exciting to be like,
Oh, my god, this would be amazing with
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just it's all these probability like
wave fields of potential and goodness that
[SPEAKER_08]: you're like, looking at and wanting to see
happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, yeah, it's just a super fun selection
process.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a it's a freedom.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a jazz.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a art like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get to just kind of immerse yourself
in the moment and figure out like,
[SPEAKER_08]: man, this should go here on this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just can't wait.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're so excited about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, as soon as it happens, it's like,
Oh, my God, I'm going to crack these next
[SPEAKER_08]: year.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to make sure my friends grow these.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you get to see it on other farms
in place.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's so exciting to see something
new and all kinds of amazing things come
[SPEAKER_08]: out of poly hybrids.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it can be very, you know, different,
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I like to really label the poly hybrids
because there can be certain aspects that
[SPEAKER_08]: that come from the line breeding.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they can actually kind of be some
relatively stable sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then other combinations will be all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it depends on those combinations going
in.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I like to kind of like be able to
let people know a bit and guide like on
[SPEAKER_08]: what, you know, you might be experiencing
with something, you know, there's three
[SPEAKER_08]: very select kind of things that come out
of it, or there's a certain uniformity,
[SPEAKER_08]: or it's just all over the place.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I just I just love the selection
process and really respect the length of
[SPEAKER_08]: time to put each year into making a
selection on that next generation,
[SPEAKER_08]: like to grow out several plants and to
then continue on.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a very useful thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Nick, with the seeds that he's brought
today, a lot of people have some really
[SPEAKER_08]: useful breeding tools in their hand,
because now you actually have a line bred
[SPEAKER_08]: thing that you could put with another one
to make true high, you know, f1 hybrids
[SPEAKER_08]: that are going to have that bigger
uniformity that we expect in all
[SPEAKER_08]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, keeping the diversity in the
stock is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, my dad always said, keeping more
than just one one of the males around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's keep keep a couple of them to
breed on, you know, keeping the diversity
[SPEAKER_03]: in the stock that you never know what
you're going to get out of those seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: then like, there might be one in there
that's just like the one louder poly
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrids I I like I breed I bred the velvet
perps down like five or six generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then definitely bringing them back on
other varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it just shows the diversity
of, you know, what we're working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just really special.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm happy to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Poly hybrids, I say, are the best for
people hunting clonal stock.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What Nick said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but seriously, what Nick said?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for clone stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I've yeah, this just depends
on the direction you want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who your clients are,
what your market is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, a lot of this really depends on
who who your clients are and where your
[SPEAKER_02]: market is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, far as poly hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like if you're which is kind of good
because you have your poly hybrid,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have you make an amazing selection and
then you cloud your work in that line
[SPEAKER_01]: there and which you're going to get some
really nice diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can just kind of work with
that because, you know, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: ways to, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends on I really feel like it
depends on like what you're trying to do a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of the times.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that just makes that just makes,
you know, whatever you go in that
[SPEAKER_01]: direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, for me, that's kind of like
the poly hybrid thing is cool because I
[SPEAKER_01]: make a selection and run that in my
greenhouse and in like a high yield,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, see a green style and that kind
of works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I get get what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but lately, I mean, I've just been
kind of running with, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever different hype clones and,
you know, bullshit just because like the
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, everybody, Finn is looking for
Tucker.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tucker, Tucker, Tucker, Tucker.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure he's around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's not leaving without you,
but we're going to stay really close to
[SPEAKER_06]: this.
[SPEAKER_06]: This area, if anybody knows Tucker,
what's Tucker's last name?
[SPEAKER_06]: Johnson, Tucker Johnson from from where?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give you a good little time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ready, Daniel?
[SPEAKER_00]: The jam general, everybody, which,
you know, with the price of input,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it seems like everyone's going
to be headed that route.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm about to go get a truckload
of mistletoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excited for the high phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's fun working the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to grow for like production for
like commercial farm, like F3 to F6.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen some F3s that are really
stable and I've seen some F4s that aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: but stable, stable enough to blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, moon gazers here,
they're, you know, they're doing some
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller batches stuff, which is also kind
of like a niche market trend anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know, like smaller batches are easy
to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to see what that's like
when we're going some true F1s in a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're going to see that's
going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have the velvet coffee I'm
going to be starting, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, not you know, but two stable
lines bred in together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also breed a lot of Otto flowers and
backcross it into that with a photo
[SPEAKER_00]: periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're getting the here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Nick said.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just going to just repeat what
Jesse said.
[SPEAKER_05]: I fucking love Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_05]: Testing, testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just absolutely love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love poly hybrids too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know about cloning them,
but I just love to find them and breed
[SPEAKER_05]: them and then just kind of do the whole
cycle again.
[SPEAKER_05]: We keep our males pretty close,
like just far enough and downwind.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I love each every of each of our 600
plants to have like a one seed in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I find some Fino that I didn't
breed, I can just, I'll plant that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it's a male, I'll use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's a female, I'll definitely seed it
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, like if you're looking for hash,
if you're looking for the best hash
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties, you got to go find the poly
hybrids and look at the back stock,
[SPEAKER_04]: the lineage in there and all the stuff
should be from other hash varieties too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay for poly hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should never like look down on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay for inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: We love them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay for the back crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could get into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have a whole, my own kind of old way
of back crossing, but back to generation,
[SPEAKER_04]: even next generation.
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, we're going to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for coming out everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: For us at our booth, you know,
we're hanging out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot to talk about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Feel the light.
Woo.
What next, Ed?
What next, Ed?
What next, Ed?
What
next, Ed?
What next, Ed?
