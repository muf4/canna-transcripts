[SPEAKER_00]: More near and dear to my heart and going
through with the legislature and has been
[SPEAKER_00]: an ongoing debate with the regulators are
compassion and trade samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all get that they don't want brands to
be giving free samples away to every
[SPEAKER_03]: consumer who walks down the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when a new brand is trying to get into
a retail operation and any industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: they get samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: Diversion.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just worried about diversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they put out their regulations,
they have to put out what's called an
[SPEAKER_00]: FSOR, which is a final statement of reason
that explains every single rule they make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that particular section,
they say exactly that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They believe that it could create
diversion of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was sort of it wasn't a very long
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I remember correctly, it was just
saying that past experiences with that,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I assume, well, must have been based
on the unregulated or less regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: market in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't want to say unregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the Bay Area has been very
highly legacy market.
[SPEAKER_00]: This also comes back to an element of
trust and, you know, sort of an evolution
[SPEAKER_00]: of misinformation and stereotyping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these rules, when you look at
cannabis being regulated, like plutonium,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of you can connect that back with
prohibition and refurbished.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the reason of this very
slow, tightly regulated incremental
[SPEAKER_00]: approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you could be compassionate
towards cancer patients, talk about what
[SPEAKER_03]: it was like then and what it's like now
when you have to look that same cancer
[SPEAKER_03]: patient in the eyes and be like,
sorry, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's been really tough because we
started a program many, many years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: called the Helping Hands and where we gave
free cannabis to low and no income
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city of Berkeley actually modeled that
and made it a law for all retailers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it was anybody with a doctor's
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once these new laws went into effect
and the bureau said that we could not give
[SPEAKER_00]: free cannabis to anyone without an MMIC
card, which is very explicitly stated in
[SPEAKER_00]: the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were certain exceptions that
were made by different regulators for that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular exception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've had to tell people that have
been on this list that could not get MMIC
[SPEAKER_00]: cards or have had a lot of challenges
getting MMIC cards that they were removed
[SPEAKER_00]: from the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can't give them to them for free
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've lost probably half of the
number of people that were part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: program, which is really sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, I mean, we, we give it to them at
a, we don't give it to, we sell it at a
[SPEAKER_00]: very low rate, like under market rate,
but we have to sell it where we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to give it away to those patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, made a lot of people
drop off the program and gotten it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been tough because Berkeley patients
group has really been, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a legacy operator of compassion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the middle word almost implies that
you care about the medical side of this
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it does go away whenever states go
wreck the medical side of the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, this is the problem with our system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medical, the medical program that we,
that exists today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that medical cannabis is
going to go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think patients are going to be using
cannabis as more research is being done
[SPEAKER_00]: every day on, on the benefits of cannabis
and specific cannabinoids and the
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions that they help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's going to be a ton of,
of medicines, just not in the traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana market that we are,
have known and are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a very nice person.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little bit angry about this because
I think it's unacceptable that the state
[SPEAKER_02]: would not allow people who need this
medication to get it for free if they need
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm outraged as a patient that I have
to pay a sin tax, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is essentially literally a sin tax
to get this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can barely afford it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a consumer and as a patient,
I'm, and as working with him on this,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to, going to continue this
fight because it all comes down on people
[SPEAKER_02]: like me and to drive those people into the
black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, one more point on the
compassion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think an argument can be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a lawyer, but I truly think that
it is a violation of prop two 15 and 64 to
[SPEAKER_00]: restrict the compassion programs and
donations like they are right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you think there could be like,
I'm also not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a class action type thing against the
state or, or some lawyer could basically
[SPEAKER_03]: sue the state on behalf of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it wasn't supposed to interfere with
any, anything prop two 15 said prop two 15
[SPEAKER_00]: said safe, affordable access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for people that can't afford
affordable means free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how this entire compassion pro
this entire industry was birthed out of
[SPEAKER_00]: compassion, out of the AIDS crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, if there's anything that
should remain in this ever changing
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, it should be the compassion and
the social awareness that birthed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where in the pecking order do you think
people with great illnesses currently sit
[SPEAKER_03]: in California cannabis industry as a
whole?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty low is my answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's shrinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've, we've talked to the compassion
kind of free giveaways, but then talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about the trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when, when brands, cause I would assume
it's hard for a new brand to come in and
[SPEAKER_03]: show you what they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very complicated process with
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of moving pieces and,
you know, a different people have,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're, we have to make sure that
everything is done above board,
[SPEAKER_00]: completely compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when it comes to different
people have different interpretations on
[SPEAKER_00]: how that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, some people take
the rules more seriously than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's, it is just, it's just
become a challenge that is not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, again, this also goes back to,
this is a, an outgrowth of free for
[SPEAKER_00]: madness, propaganda and provision.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is absolutely every other industry
does this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's even pharmaceuticals do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have, you can get samples of,
of pharmacy, you know, scheduled to
[SPEAKER_00]: narcotics for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, one of the arguments was the,
you know, the diversion and the tracking
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is, it is 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a man on the moon in the sixties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can, we can code in a little line to
make sure that, you know, trade samples
[SPEAKER_00]: get into the metric and get into track and
trace.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not, this is something that
pharmaceutical industry does.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many ways to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the only way that new business
that we're going to be able to help new
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses get a foothold in the industry,
because right now only ones with,
[SPEAKER_00]: with huge resources are going to be able
to have the, the manpower to create teams
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going to be creative and working
with all everybody to, to get these new
[SPEAKER_00]: samples to market or not samples,
get these new products to market in
[SPEAKER_00]: various ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best way for a company to get
their, their products introduced to the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer base is to be able to have the
employees that are selling those products,
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to speak informatively about them
and be able to answer questions and figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out what exactly a customer is looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't know, they're not going
to recommend a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even as a business, you know,
we want to know what we're selling are
[SPEAKER_00]: good products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you can't do that, it,
you know, people, your, your store is
[SPEAKER_00]: based and your reputation is based on,
on the products you sell, your quality
[SPEAKER_00]: products and the service you provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are your two key retail components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there has to be a way to both
support new small businesses and ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: that you are providing the community and
the customers with the, the best products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the compassionate giveaways and the
trade samples to completely, I see them as
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both free.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd moving hands, but they're question
is, and this gets back to can we influence
[SPEAKER_03]: things towards a sensible outcome is one
of them baked into the law and the other
[SPEAKER_03]: at the whim of one of those three
regulatory agencies or are, are both those
[SPEAKER_03]: no free anything to anyone law or are they
both whim of one of the three regulatory
[SPEAKER_03]: agencies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Trade samples is regulatory.
[SPEAKER_03]: So which, so let's, do we know,
do we have, which agency are we talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about there?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the bureau.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to put, so, and, and,
and they are more than aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a bill, there's a trade
samples bill right now that's moving
[SPEAKER_00]: through sponsored by Senator Skinner,
Senator and, um, go Skinner and Flo
[SPEAKER_00]: Khanna.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, that's going to make things,
if it makes it all the way and the
[SPEAKER_00]: governor signs it, which I certainly hope
he will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, I mean, people have really,
this has been, this has been a,
[SPEAKER_00]: a debate and an issue since there were
subcommittees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know how many, this must've
been 27.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know when it was, but there were,
there were all of these stakeholder
[SPEAKER_00]: meetings with the regulators as they were
developing these regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even after the first round in the next
round, um, we'd been debating trade
[SPEAKER_00]: samples since the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this is something that
people are not going to let up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get normalized and treated like
norm, like any other business treated like
[SPEAKER_03]: fentanyl where you can give samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, from the state's point of
view, they're probably looking and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going, we don't even know who a real
patient is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what, what's a real patient?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's a, you know, so they're going to
their potentially they'll be giving away,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I mean, it doesn't make any
sense, but the state wants control,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the new middleman.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the new drug dealer, you know,
as far as cannabis goes and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: they're promulgating at this moment is for
them to maintain control.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, that's, that was what that's
prop 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's malcursa that they are the
regulators and, but they were,
[SPEAKER_00]: they, they are, they serve at the pleasure
of the executive branch and the governor's
[SPEAKER_00]: office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's politics,
politics is involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a third, less of, but still
somewhat of a third rail issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of, a lot of
familiarizing that needs to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to take place and is taking place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as, as every year moves on and
people get used to the idea of legal
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization, legal cannabis, they're
thinking it's going to be a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look at Colorado, Colorado just
passed delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I always say, you know,
prohibition has been going on for more
[SPEAKER_00]: than 80 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just at this very early starting
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope it doesn't take 80 years to make
up for all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's definitely not going to
happen overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's one of the most
important things that I've learned in this
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy process over the last few years is
that really have to take a, it's important
[SPEAKER_00]: to take a short term picture, but you
really have to take a broader,
[SPEAKER_00]: more long-term view of, of everything,
all of these policies, all these
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations, all of these laws that may
work very well for you in the short term,
[SPEAKER_00]: but long-term might not work so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of things that,
that could go wrong and that you maybe can
[SPEAKER_00]: anticipate, but maybe you can't
anticipate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is, and not everything is as much of
a crisis as it might feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, you know, I've seen burnout
is rampant, which is completely
[SPEAKER_00]: understandable, but being able to
prioritize and be able to take a,
[SPEAKER_00]: take a, just take a broader view,
a more long-term thing, instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking like six months to a year,
which is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you don't, don't negate that,
but also think five to 10 years from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we don't know what any, any of these
states are going to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's hit 10 years yet, but I think
that things are going to change a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these rules are going to,
most of them are probably going to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: the same, but I think there is going to be
some significant changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, another thing for patients,
the edible potency cap needs to be either
[SPEAKER_00]: removed for patients or raised for
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily adult consumers,
but for patients, I think a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams for an edible is not fair and
too expensive and should be higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an agency level decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malcursa does not put a potency cap.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's in the regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on the strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I hit my 11 years in the cannabis
space last month, this month, today's
[SPEAKER_00]: 31st.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no bird for 11 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's time to retire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked for normal national normal in DC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't really an industry back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
