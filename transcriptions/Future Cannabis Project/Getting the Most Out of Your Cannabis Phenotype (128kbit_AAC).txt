[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us today for our
presentation on phenotypic expression and
[SPEAKER_00]: why it matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's easy to lose track of the
fundamentals amongst emerging data and
[SPEAKER_00]: crop steering theories.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that we're thinking
about the end product when it comes to all
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects of facility design.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to start, I want to give a quick
introduction to my friend and
[SPEAKER_00]: co-presenter, Anders Petersen,
who's a molecular biologist with hands in
[SPEAKER_00]: the dirt cultivation experience,
owned an extract company, dispensary,
[SPEAKER_00]: and has been a valued partner in numerous
large scale cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been in the cannabis business
since graduating Berkeley like 15 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've owned cannabis businesses,
run cultivation facilities, and use that
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge and experience to help
facilities produce the best product as
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Together, we analyze peer review papers,
real world metrics, and data and turn
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis science into business solutions
by focusing on the KPIs that influence
[SPEAKER_00]: every aspect of cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the reason we get so drawn to
discussions on phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this webinar, we'd like to focus on the
meaning of a phenotype and why it is the
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation to success of indoor
cultivation businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I'd like to turn it over to
Anders and let us get started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm excited to be here today to talk
about a subject that is near and dear to
[SPEAKER_02]: my heart, phenotypes and phenotypic
expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really what we are talking about is
the uniqueness of cannabis, varieties,
[SPEAKER_02]: and how we can maximize the expression of
each cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are more desirable phenotypes and
there are less desirable phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there are certain varieties stacked
with so many desirable traits that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like you just stumbled upon a unicorn.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a keeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hunting through all this variety in
cannabis to find something truly special
[SPEAKER_02]: is a huge reason why people devote their
life to this plant, including myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: The variety keeps it fun and interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The smells, colors, effects, or how it
grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have heard of Skunk 1,
Chem 91, Northern Lights 5, all the OG
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush and Girl Scout varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: These names and numbers represent a unique
expression of the cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to explain how that works
and why the environment in which they are
[SPEAKER_02]: grown is so crucial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legends, brands, and fortunes are built on
good genetic potential with maximum
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotypic expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's begin with the definition,
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: The set of observable characteristics of
an individual resulting from the
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction of its genotype with the
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in regards to cannabis, phenotype
describes the plant's physical appearance
[SPEAKER_02]: or form, its developmental growth,
its biochemistry, and its behavior.
[SPEAKER_02]: The key words to focus on here are
interaction of genotype with the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, this definition is often
simplified and represented as an equation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genotype plus environment equals
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, there are two factors that
generally influence the way a plant grows,
[SPEAKER_02]: the genetics and the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: The environment is 50% of the equation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is why having precision
environmental control in your facility is
[SPEAKER_02]: so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: The term phenotype can be used in two
different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can get kind of a little bit
convoluted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phenotype can refer to a singular trait
that the plant displays, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: color.
[SPEAKER_02]: This plant displays a purple flower
phenotype, and this other plant displays a
[SPEAKER_02]: green flower phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it can refer to all of the observable
characteristics displayed by a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The phenotype of this plant is more
desirable than the phenotype displayed by
[SPEAKER_02]: this other plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scientists tried to clear this dual
meaning up by introducing the term
[SPEAKER_02]: phenome, similar to genome, to describe
the collection of traits a plant exhibits.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this was never really universally
adopted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we use phenotype to describe a singular
trait or an accumulation of all the traits
[SPEAKER_02]: expressed by a plant under certain
environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another nuance to this definition of
phenotype is the word observable.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that doesn't mean just with the naked
eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can also mean traits that can be made
visible by some technical procedure,
[SPEAKER_02]: like in a laboratory.
[SPEAKER_02]: An example of this in humans would be
blood typing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't see it with the naked eye,
but it is a phenotype of yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in cannabis, the cannabinoid and
terpene profiles that you see on lab
[SPEAKER_02]: reports.
[SPEAKER_02]: To describe the unique chemical expression
of the plant, we use the term chemotype,
[SPEAKER_02]: or sometimes chemovar, which is the
chemical phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the cannabinoid and terpene
quantities and ratios that a specific
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis phenotype produces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, there are about five broad
classes of cannabis chemotypes based on
[SPEAKER_02]: the dominant cannabinoid that is produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that we have a base understanding of
what a phenotype is, let's dive into what
[SPEAKER_02]: a genotype is, a quick refresher on how
genes are expressed, and some examples of
[SPEAKER_02]: how the environment can affect the
expression of these genes in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is a genotype?
[SPEAKER_02]: A genotype is an organism's complete set
of genetic material, although it is often
[SPEAKER_02]: used to refer to a specific gene or a set
of genes in a genome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think of it as like the basic genetic
boundaries which define a range of
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotypic possibilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like humans, cannabis is diploid and
has two homologous copies of each
[SPEAKER_02]: chromosome, one copy from the male parent
plant and one from the female parent
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each chromosome in the pair contains the
same genes in the same order and place
[SPEAKER_02]: along the length of the chromosome.
[SPEAKER_02]: These genes then get expressed into the
phenotypic traits that we observe.
[SPEAKER_02]: A segment of the double-stranded DNA
undergoes transcription, which forms a
[SPEAKER_02]: single-stranded RNA transcript,
which is then translated into a functional
[SPEAKER_02]: protein.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this kind of oversimplified example to
the right, this protein might help produce
[SPEAKER_02]: a purple pigment, and then the end result
of this gene expression is a purple
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Punnett squares are used by biologists to
determine the probability of an offspring
[SPEAKER_02]: having a particular genotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows all the possible combinations of
paternal and maternal alleles.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the parental genotypes with each
of their dominant or excessive alleles,
[SPEAKER_02]: one allele from each of their chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have the offspring's predicted
genotypes and phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this example, the allele for tall plant
is dominant, so wherever we see a big T,
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant will be tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the offspring inherited two recessive
alleles, little t, then we see a short
[SPEAKER_02]: plant phenotype, like the square in the
bottom right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Punnett squares can be used to predict
phenotypes, but without a real high degree
[SPEAKER_02]: of accuracy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because there are a lot of other
factors at play that influence how these
[SPEAKER_02]: genotypes are expressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the most important being the
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, some traits are largely determined by
the genotype alone, while other phenotypic
[SPEAKER_02]: traits are highly influenced by the
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: This can be described as phenotypic
plasticity, the ability to vary phenotypic
[SPEAKER_02]: expression in response to environmental
conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why you can get two clones with
identical genotypes to two different
[SPEAKER_02]: growers, and the end product could look
completely different from each other due
[SPEAKER_02]: to the way the environment steers and
influences the plant's growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant growth rates, morphology,
and timing of plant development are
[SPEAKER_02]: examples of some traits that are generally
plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anecdotally, all cannabis cultivators know
that with tighter control in your
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, you tend to see higher yields
and a more potent product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, each of these colored lines on the
graphs below represent a genotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the first graph, we see no plasticity.
[SPEAKER_02]: The environment has little to no effect on
how that gene is expressed, compared to
[SPEAKER_02]: the graph on the far right, where we see a
strong genotype by environment
[SPEAKER_02]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: As cultivators, we can take advantage of
the plasticity of certain phenotypic
[SPEAKER_02]: traits by altering the environment to
elicit certain responses in the crop that
[SPEAKER_02]: are beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, let's go through a few examples of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anthocyanins, the pigments that are
responsible for all the purples,
[SPEAKER_02]: pinks, and colors we see in cannabis
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You must have a cultivar with the genetic
potential to produce these beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: pigments.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if the plant is exposed to too high of
a temperature at the end of its flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: season, cycle, then you will not get a
full expression of these colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the proteins that produce them will
degrade.
[SPEAKER_02]: How cold do we need to get the room?
[SPEAKER_02]: And for how long?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody really knows yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can vary from cultivar to cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the colder we get the room,
we know that the slower the metabolic
[SPEAKER_02]: plate of the ramp will be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too cold for too long, we could sacrifice
yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too warm, we could lose some color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, it's a delicate balance to bring
out these colors in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another example is the day-to-night
temperature differential.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a warmer lights on-temp and a cooler
lights off-temp, you can see the
difference in temperature between the
temperature of the plant and the
temperature of the plant.
Now, let's look at some examples of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a positive diff.
[SPEAKER_02]: This promotes stem elongation or stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a cooler lights on-temp and a warmer
lights off-temp, we have a negative diff.
[SPEAKER_02]: This suppresses stem elongation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for cultivars like GMO, garlic
cookies, that stretch crazy the first
[SPEAKER_02]: three weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can use this environmental crops during
technique to keep them at a manageable
[SPEAKER_02]: height.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there are many more examples of
environmental influences on phenotypic
[SPEAKER_02]: expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: But more research is needed to determine
exactly which genes are influenced by the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment and those that are not.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the most fun things to do as a
cannabis grower is popping seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: hunting for a new pheno.
[SPEAKER_02]: With inbred lines of corn or soy,
you pop a million seeds and all those
[SPEAKER_02]: plants will look and yield very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But due to the variability in the cannabis
genome and the lack of professional
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding to stabilize genetics at this
point in the industry, primarily due to
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition, a pack of just 10 or 12 seeds
with slightly different yet related
[SPEAKER_02]: genotypes will yield a huge variability
between plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, most growers utilize clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before you can use clones,
you must find a phenotype with enough
[SPEAKER_02]: desirable traits to keep in your staple as
a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the process goes something like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say I get a pack of 10 regular seeds
from the same cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all germinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I arbitrarily label them one
through 10 to keep track.
[SPEAKER_02]: They continue to grow and eventually start
showing their sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dang it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got four males and I'm not looking to
breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I call six through nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number 10 was from Aphroditic,
which is a sign of unstable genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want pollen in my flowering
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's toss it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like on this phenohunt, I have five
females to hunt through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they continue to flower and begin
showing the full extent of their
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotypic expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three through five start showing some
purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: One and two stay more green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phenols one and two have a cakey turf
profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And three through five smell like I just
opened my gas tank.
[SPEAKER_02]: But wait, phenol three is gassy and cakey.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe phenols one, three and five had
a pretty good yield at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But phenol three had everything I was
looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is the keeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: The keeper of the bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I decide to call her gas cake number
three.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a simple explanation of how
growers go about hunting for good
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the popular phenotypes of gelato is
another great example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Originally bred in Northern California
with genetics from the cookie family and
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Guzman, a.k.a.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sherbinski, it is a cross of sunset
sherbert and thin mint Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they collected all the seeds from
that cross and hunted for phenols.
[SPEAKER_02]: For simplicity's sake, let's say there
were 100 seeds in this hunt, labeled one
[SPEAKER_02]: through 100.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just so happened that numbers 33,
41, 43, and so on really stood out as
[SPEAKER_02]: being special.
[SPEAKER_02]: So special that they each got their own
unique name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gelato 33 became Larry Bird.
[SPEAKER_02]: And gelato 41, my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had mother plants for each of these
phenotypes, cloned them and disseminated
[SPEAKER_02]: them throughout the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, do not expect to see this level
of quality in every batch of gelato you
[SPEAKER_02]: pick up at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all comes back to the environment they
are grown in.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many other qualities to look
out for in a good phenotype than just
[SPEAKER_02]: color, aroma, and yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this slide just shows a few of those
traits that growers and breeders look out
[SPEAKER_02]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, I'd like to pass the mic
over my good friend, Jesse, and have him
[SPEAKER_02]: take it away from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great info per usual, Ders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always great to hear you talk about the
science of phenotypic expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the gelato example you chose
is a great one because it resonates with
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators, brokers, and buyers alike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about sales for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, the sell-through numbers and
customer preference is based on THC
[SPEAKER_00]: content and name recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, gelato 33 could be worth $300
to $500 more per pound than gelato 49.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why?
[SPEAKER_00]: It has appeal for a number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Name recognition and hype, bud structure,
THC content, nose, color, and intense
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what if all of a sudden there was a
discovery proving that the chemo type of
[SPEAKER_00]: gelato 49 was the best medicine for MS or
a particular cancer?
[SPEAKER_00]: The entourage effect and the relational
proportions of the secondary metabolites
[SPEAKER_00]: would increase its value.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that were the case, gelato 49 might now
get you $300 to $500 more per pound than
[SPEAKER_00]: gelato 33, all based on phenotypic
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one reason why phenotypes,
COAs, and environmental control are so
[SPEAKER_00]: important for the future of cannabis
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And success in the cannabis marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you see a list of traits that many
people consider when breeding or selecting
[SPEAKER_00]: for commercial cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll admit, I'm a trait chaser.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest, I've chucked pollen,
hunted, and done generations of line work
[SPEAKER_00]: to find cultivars resistant to broad mites
in Oakland or root aphids in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've chased faster finishing times,
better production under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've selected phenotypes because they
rooted faster for my commercial clone
[SPEAKER_00]: operation or produce more THC and terps to
win cannabis competitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've found genetics that produce higher
yields above 5,000 feet and ones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: drought tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Anders always reminds me the
importance of trichome size and cuticle
[SPEAKER_00]: thickness for my solventless extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result of the laborious and time
consuming phenohunts led to healthier
[SPEAKER_00]: plants cured towards my environments with
better effects both medically and
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: These decisions have directly impacted the
financial success of my cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prioritizing the traits that have the most
impact on your business plan and goals
[SPEAKER_00]: should be something you're always
considering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this brings us to key performance
indicators.
[SPEAKER_00]: KPIs are how we benchmark the performance
of our phenotypes and our cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way to determine the
efficiency of your facility as a whole as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as your ability to capture phenotypic
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are primary, secondary, and even
tertiary KPIs that should be considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we wanted to focus on a few big ones
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, let's talk about KPIs that measure
quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grams per square foot is one that we all
know and use to measure yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much biomass did we generate per
canopy square foot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another measure of quantity plus
efficiency is grams per watt.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much biomass did we generate relative
to energy consumed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a third quantity KPI is leaf to trim
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: A cultivar with less leaf will be easier
to trim, produce less shake, and give you
[SPEAKER_00]: more sellable flour per square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are great measurements, but the
deeper question is, did we optimize
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions to get the most
possible sellable weight from our
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, we have KPIs that measure quality
like active compounds per gram,
[SPEAKER_00]: per watt, and per square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question here is, did we maximize
secondary metabolite production relative
[SPEAKER_00]: to cultivar?
[SPEAKER_00]: And did we cure it appropriately to
protect those desired compounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: The active compounds you collect will
directly impact the price per pound of
[SPEAKER_00]: your sellable flour and your extract
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any buyer will tell you, gelato that tests
at 20% THC is just not as valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gelato that tests above 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any concentrate manufacturer will tell
you, it's fire in, fire out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the market and production
expectations from a phenotypic expression
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another KPI is harvest cycles per year and
refers to the length of time it takes your
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will impact your speed to market and
your plant flow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finding a phenotype that allows you to
harvest one more cycle per year can
[SPEAKER_00]: transform a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maximizing quantity and quality will get
you the lowest cost of production and the
[SPEAKER_00]: most efficient production facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's be honest, anyone can get one
good run, but the key to long-term success
[SPEAKER_00]: is consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consistent excellence comes from accurate
data collection per cultivar and
[SPEAKER_00]: optimizing their expression with
environmental control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consistency is the difference between a
good batch and a good brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consistent environment equates and equals
consistent customer experience and
[SPEAKER_00]: predictable production levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these KPIs also speak to the value of
a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a gram really worth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends on who you ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: With 15,000 square feet of canopy and five
turns a year and a $2,500 price per pound,
[SPEAKER_00]: one gram is worth $400,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: With six turns a year, it's $500,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can optimize genetics and get a few
more $100 per pound, one gram will be
[SPEAKER_00]: worth more than $600,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, squeeze out one extra cycle with the
right phenotype and it could be $700,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, we're just talking about one
gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotypic expression is key to getting
you the highest price per pound possible
[SPEAKER_00]: and the best yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also impacts your brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotypic expression is what customers
are buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the stable of phenotypes you produce
gives you strategic pricing per cultivar,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the gelato example we used earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that expression also translates to
cannabis awards, influences the price a
[SPEAKER_00]: customer is willing to pay, how much they
buy, and ultimately the financial success
[SPEAKER_00]: of cultivators, distributors, and
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also plays a major role in customer
satisfaction, which leads us to the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of COAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: COAs get you paid and they help create
action plans, but they also save lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: COAs are how current purchasing decisions
are being made at the commercial level and
[SPEAKER_00]: how we begin to correlate medical efficacy
to secondary metabolite production.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of measured connection
abonoids and terpenes, or what we know as
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotype, that Anders had mentioned
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular example is of FATSO,
which tested at 44% THC and 3.1% terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking for a specific chemotype profile
can be a target for personalized medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: or a recreational experience that helps
determine value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a former commercial buyer for
dispensaries, this game used to be
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: A cultivator would bring in 10 pounds or
so into my office, drop it on my desk,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd squish the bud between my fingers,
give it the nose test, the eye test,
[SPEAKER_00]: roll it up, see how it burned,
and then give my value assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now value assessments are based on the
numbers provided by COAs and even medical
[SPEAKER_00]: research is driven by chemotype
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purchases today are based on percentages,
not personal relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we improve our COAs and monetize
the value of a test result?
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality, quantity, consistency,
and efficiency is about optimizing all 10
[SPEAKER_00]: cardinal parameters in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could go through all 10,
but I think we will save that deeper dive
[SPEAKER_00]: for another webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think this slide does help
illustrate the impact of environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions and phenotypic expression on a
larger scale facility design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting is a great example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think spectrum control will help you
produce more terpenes and people are
[SPEAKER_00]: choosing to pursue high PPFD lighting
because the science tells us that it will
[SPEAKER_00]: equate to more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But increasing light quality and quantity
will mean more transpiration, more CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: and likely a higher EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is the leaf temp offset relative
to your lighting choice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Controlling VPD isn't as simple as picking
a temp and humidity set point.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to use VPD effectively,
you have to control the temperature of the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that knowledge, how do we measure and
maintain ambient conditions to optimize
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant's photosynthetic rate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we deliver CO2 with the appropriate
velocities directly to the plant's stomata
[SPEAKER_00]: to drive the utilization of these photons?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we adjust fertigation strategies
and airflow to optimize the performance of
[SPEAKER_00]: each cultivar in a high PPFD environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just getting started and this is
only one parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental crop steering is the key to
getting the best COAs, and it's backed by
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific research.
[SPEAKER_00]: During the flower period, we can induce
drought stress with controlled drybacks to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase secondary metabolite production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can acidify the media and lower temps
to produce anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can increase EC, increase VPD,
and reduce feed duration with measurable
[SPEAKER_00]: positive results.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, your ability to apply
environmental crop steering techniques is
[SPEAKER_00]: only possible with precision environmental
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without control, it's just stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus on control of all 10 cardinal
parameters and you can design a facility
[SPEAKER_00]: to drive any cultivar that the market
demands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build a facility with limited control and
the choice of high performing cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: will also be limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 10 cardinal parameters are a symphony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it wrong and your band is off key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get it right and you have a masterpiece
that everyone is excited to experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest limiting factor for phenotypic
expression is your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental control is 50% of what makes
up a phenotype and 100% of what makes each
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar special is phenotypic expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about control and what you do
with the control that drives plant
[SPEAKER_00]: expression increases prenatal performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's so important to think
about these interactions when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: building your cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, I think we want to really thank
everyone for listening to us talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant that we love so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we'd love to hear from the
community on future webinars that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: dive into and express some experiences
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here, I think we're going to spend
another 30 minutes or so to jump into some
[SPEAKER_00]: question and answers from the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, let's turn it over to Brian and
jump right in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Anders.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a really good guy and I'm super
excited to jump into Q&A with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get things kicked off, your
presentation spurred a thought for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminded me how closely plants are
related to humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, we're talking about the
evolution of the cannabis genome here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like the nature versus nurture
conversation we have about children.
[SPEAKER_01]: A child can be born with the best genetic
makeup, but without a good environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: they may never realize their full
potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that in mind, I'm wondering what
environmental parameters have the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: impact on phenotypic expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first of all, I love that analogy
you made with your kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I like to think about with
plants versus people is there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: corollaries, but people are mobile and
plants are sessile.
[SPEAKER_02]: People can move out of undesirable
environments into more preferable one,
[SPEAKER_02]: but plants have to have all these
mechanisms to adapt to poor environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, which environmental parameter or
which parameter in general has the most
[SPEAKER_02]: influence?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say it's just one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Jesse said, with 10 cardinal
parameters, to me, it's a symphony of
[SPEAKER_02]: balancing all of them into the right
parameters and ratios to get the maximum
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotypic production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I think it's dangerous to
focus on one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all so interconnected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's so easy to get excited about
Instagramming your lights or your racks or
[SPEAKER_00]: your fertigation skid or the cool facility
you've built, but it's the interaction and
[SPEAKER_00]: how one influences the other when we talk
about these parameters that really
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately give us the phenotypic
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't adjust one without the other and
understanding that relationship is just as
[SPEAKER_00]: important in investing in one
wholeheartedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's part of the challenge,
the huge challenge and the potential
[SPEAKER_01]: reward that cultivators have just because
it's just such a multidisciplinary
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge and there's so many parameters
to take into account.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also genetic specific,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the parameters, depend on
what genetics are growing as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can have the coolest
irrigation, most precise irrigation,
[SPEAKER_02]: fertigation system ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you can't control temperature and
relative humidity, you can't drive that
[SPEAKER_02]: transpiration rate, move nutrients
throughout the plant and just drive the
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolic rate of the plant in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a limiting factor game,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this joke that I used to make is give
me antiquated lighting styles,
[SPEAKER_00]: cheap nutrients, recycled media,
but let me control the environment and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: always going to get to the finish line
with a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess what I mean by that is your
biggest limiting factor is HVAC,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why in a lot of ways,
HVAC became like a four-letter word for me
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry for so long, not having
purpose-built technology or the tools at
[SPEAKER_00]: my disposal to optimize all the other
parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was that everything was limited by my
lack of investment or lack of access to
[SPEAKER_00]: technology from an environmental control
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Environmental control is your best form of
crop insurance is one wise sage once told
[SPEAKER_01]: us, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of genetics, there's a really
interesting question here from a member of
[SPEAKER_01]: our audience asking about your opinion on
indica and sativa classification versus
[SPEAKER_01]: chemomore classification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we already see a shift in the industry
towards chemomore classification versus
[SPEAKER_01]: the traditional indica versus sativa
geography type of classification?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we all kind of learned that the
traditional indica sativa hybrid
[SPEAKER_02]: classification, there's no real genetic
basis for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one species and we're learning that
there needs to be a new way to group these
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars and on the shelf and then also
in for medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for medicinal purposes and
recreational grouping them by chemo types,
[SPEAKER_02]: type one, type two, type three,
type four, type five plants in general is
[SPEAKER_02]: a good first step, but I don't think it
takes into account all of the nuances that
[SPEAKER_02]: we need to use to describe these plants in
general.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely a big area.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some groups in the industry try
and put forth their own nomenclature and
[SPEAKER_02]: ways of grouping these different
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't ever seen one fully get adopted
yet and I can't wait because it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: help dispensaries a ton being able to put
these on the shelf in a more accurate way
[SPEAKER_02]: and it'll help patients and consumers be
able to purchase more wisely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I foresee a nomenclature that has to do
with the dominant cannabinoid and then
[SPEAKER_02]: also paired with the dominant terpene in
that profile so that we can understand the
[SPEAKER_02]: entourage effect, but I think until we do
more research on those interactions that
[SPEAKER_02]: produce these entourage effects,
there's not going to be a good system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the relational proportion of those
terpenes too and understanding the
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage effect and what percentage of
beta-karyophylline relative to another
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene or whatever it may be from a
scientific application and formulary
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective or a recreational perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a guy who ran dispensaries,
it was so easy to train staff a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: ago where you say, this is an indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to give you couch lock.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make you creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was more of a marketing ploy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have so many polyhybrids in this space
now that it's really about understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemo type and being able to read that
certificate of authenticity or analysis to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine what the best medicine or best
recreational product is for someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't think there's enough good
research out there to educate the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certainly a movement where people
are coming in looking for particular
[SPEAKER_00]: things, but that dialogue isn't deep and
rich enough yet for a customer to come in
[SPEAKER_00]: and say, hey, I'm looking for these four
terpenes because my endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors react a certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, that's what I want to take on
the boat when I go fishing or that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to use to write my novel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of challenges, but the more
research we get and the more correlations
[SPEAKER_00]: we get, I think we'll better have the
language to really satisfy the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, everything we buy
at the dispensary is a hybrid now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no indicas and sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have indicas that give you sativa-like
effects and things labeled sativa that
[SPEAKER_02]: give you indica-like effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: There needs to be a better system.
[SPEAKER_01]: To circle back with the relation of
cannabis to humans, it all depends on our
[SPEAKER_01]: own endocannabinoid system as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What gives you couch lock?
[SPEAKER_01]: It may give me anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: What helps alleviate a certain condition
for you may exacerbate it or may not give
[SPEAKER_01]: me any curative effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The research being done in Israel on using
cannabinoids to fight cancer, they're
[SPEAKER_02]: finding that these ratios and quantities
of different terpenes and cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: together is very specific to that form of
cancer and that person.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge challenge figuring out with
all these permutations, what is right for
[SPEAKER_02]: you and your ailment and your disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exciting though.
[SPEAKER_01]: 140 or 150 different cannabinoids and
cannabis and we're focused on two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: of them right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: We accidentally selected for high THC
cultivars for decades and now we're having
[SPEAKER_02]: to bring back those other genes and get
them expressed in higher quantities.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to take time to catch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your points about the plasticity of
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you guys could talk a little bit
about the chemical composition or the
[SPEAKER_01]: chemo bars and the ability to manipulate
those potentially or express the chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: composition differently through
environmental practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way I like to think about it is the
essential dominating cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes are genetically determined.
[SPEAKER_02]: The basic ratio of what that plant can
produce is determined at the genotype
[SPEAKER_02]: level.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the overall quantity that you get at
the end of the day is highly determined by
[SPEAKER_02]: the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can have a two to one THC to CBD ratio
cultivar, but I might only get 10% THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: 5% CBD or with a better environment,
I can make that ratio 20% to 10%.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get higher potency, but with
similar ratios.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't always hold true, but that's
generally the way I like to think about
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think anecdotally, historically there's
always been conversations about plant
[SPEAKER_00]: stress increasing some sort of aspect that
we want in the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's a book from the 1970s talking
about sticking something through the stem
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to get higher THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think now we've really evolved the
concept of stress to embody what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do from an environmental crop
steering perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these stresses, but controlling
the stresses and understanding the cost
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit analysis of applying these
stresses is the important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have some sort of aspect of
stress, let's call it temperature that
[SPEAKER_00]: brings out color.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bring that in in the late stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to understand the customer and the
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that temperature stress equate to
more performance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're slowing the plant's metabolic rate,
so we're going to probably compromise our
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass accumulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But does it give us more bag appeal that
raises the price per pound or gets people
[SPEAKER_00]: more excited in the market for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many of those cannabis, these delicate
amounts with cultivation in general and
[SPEAKER_02]: really like to me the phenozoic
plasticity, the ability of these genes to
[SPEAKER_02]: be influenced by the environment is the
prerequisite and really what gives us the
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to employ environmental crops
during techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're taking advantage of that and we're
able to steer that crop into a way that is
[SPEAKER_02]: more beneficial for our facility and our
business or plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a question here on autoflowers,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pros and cons of commercially growing
autoflowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thoughts there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the commercial viability part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can avoid some of my personal
opinions on consuming autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think for me as a guy who's been an
outdoor cultivator with experience up
[SPEAKER_00]: north in the Klamath area, one of the
reasons I love autoflowers is it allows me
[SPEAKER_00]: to sneak in another cycle every year and I
can put out these autoflowers early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when they're going to harvest,
they're not triggered by the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden I get an additional
harvest before I put out my large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely a benefit to
autoflowers and you see a lot of current
[SPEAKER_00]: publications and authors talking about the
evolution of autoflowers getting better
[SPEAKER_00]: and better and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Realistically, I mean, it's a cross with
ruteralis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cross with, I lovingly say,
ditchweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But realistically, there might be medical
viability that's coming through
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflowers because of their willingness
to sort of step back into this genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: pool and pull out other secondary
cannabinoids that right now are currently
[SPEAKER_00]: not prized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a commercial viability
perspective, I like the run of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a crop steering and plant management
perspective, it can be challenged to run
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing but autoflowers in your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from a genetic preservation
perspective and the ability to pull from
[SPEAKER_00]: that pool in looking for medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think a lot about my mom who was
sick with cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When she was sick, we weren't even talking
about CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't really even a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for her to have consistent access to
medicine was a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, consistent phenotypic
expression and chemo bar analysis is
[SPEAKER_00]: really important for medical viability.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can go and have an expected result
from a product they get.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can think what you want about
autoflowers, but it's definitely a niche
[SPEAKER_00]: part of this market that allows us to
continue to grow and explore new business
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from an extract perspective,
I'd love to hear what you think,
[SPEAKER_00]: Enders, because I know a lot of guys up
north that I know are like, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's run autoflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to run everything through the
press at the end of the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to run this big
flower harvest and try and get nothing but
[SPEAKER_00]: cherries that go in a jar on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it diversifies their market share.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in regards to that concentration
of resin is resin, whether it's an
[SPEAKER_02]: autoflower variety or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you grow good resin cleanly and
surely, and there's a lot of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you can preserve that quality of that
resin throughout the extraction process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see an issue with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am kind of blown away at how far
autoflowers have progressed in the last
[SPEAKER_02]: decade or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I never really saw an autoflower
that I wanted to consume or grow or
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it just wasn't that impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lately, there have been some
autoflower genetics that I'm very
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in checking out in terms of
growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at a commercial indoor facility,
I see some challenges with autoflowers
[SPEAKER_02]: because one of the biggest challenges of
running one of these large scale
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities is scheduling and scheduling
the rotation of your rooms and your crops
[SPEAKER_02]: from propagation to veg to generative
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plasticity that we can play with
by holding plants into a certain photo
[SPEAKER_02]: period and not having them flower
automatically gives us some flexibility to
[SPEAKER_02]: hold things back.
[SPEAKER_02]: With autoflowers, we can't necessarily do
that because its clock has started.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on a predetermined timeline for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with the ability to have photo period
sensitive plants, you can have a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit more flexibility in your crop
rotation, holding things back in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to take that flower room an
extra week, what have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do see some challenges in that side of
autoflowers and the genetics need to catch
[SPEAKER_02]: up a little bit more in terms of plant
vitality and expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also think about sort of how people
go about, you know, the autoflower
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's usually trying to find feminized
seeds and popping these feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in a lot of ways, because you
don't have this genetic mother stock for
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency, you're going to have genetic
variability until we get a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: progression of breeding in the autoflower
in the industry as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to pop 200 autoflower seeds and
expect them to all be the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a challenge from a go to market
strategy as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we can shift gears here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real quick and talk about some facility
specific items.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the highest impact items to
consider to maximize phenotypes in the new
[SPEAKER_01]: facility?
[SPEAKER_02]: Highest impact items to maximize
phenotypes in the facility?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first and foremost, you have to have
good genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You build this golden spaceship of a
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you don't have good genetics to put
into it, then there's not much you can do
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of maximizing phenotypic
expression if they're just poor genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: samples to begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, to me, it's about
control, having control of all of those
[SPEAKER_02]: parameters and not just some control,
but as tight of a control as you possibly
[SPEAKER_02]: can.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's challenges with that from a
business standpoint, because the more
[SPEAKER_02]: control and automation and data collection
you get, the higher the capital
[SPEAKER_02]: expenditures are to start that business.
[SPEAKER_02]: You also tend to then see a higher capex,
a lower operating expenditures for that
[SPEAKER_02]: facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the control is going to cost you
something, but you're going to get that
[SPEAKER_02]: back with the maximization of these
phenotypes and the increase in yield that
[SPEAKER_02]: we see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, it's a trade off that in the
long run is really worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Investing in the right equipment to
control all of the parameters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the HVAC, the CO2 supplementation,
your lighting type and lighting layout,
[SPEAKER_02]: your irrigation, fertigation system,
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the construction of the facility
itself, making sure it's well sealed,
[SPEAKER_02]: clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not bringing things in that are
going to harm our crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those things go into maximizing
your phenotypic expression, getting the
[SPEAKER_02]: most out of that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like, you know, everything is a
balance of, you know, cost and value and
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding what the end goal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think one of the things that gets
overlooked so often is labor and SOPs and
[SPEAKER_00]: training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes we think, Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I built this facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have these great genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, who's actually going to grow the
plants and how do you train them?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what is your IPM application
strategy and who's going to do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they going to do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: When are they going to?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your cleaning procedure with what?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your trimming procedure?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all these things have.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many times does it get touched in a
whole cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all these things affect the end
consumer experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important to factor in
labor and training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we see a lot of opportunities
in the space to continue to refine the
[SPEAKER_00]: training of this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've also seen a ton of growth and
it's great to see people at a high level
[SPEAKER_00]: of academic research, receiving PhDs and
studying cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's, you know, just one
step in the right direction of great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're getting the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get the labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get the application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get the financial acumen up and
combine all these aspects so we can truly
[SPEAKER_00]: make a decision on where to allocate these
limited financial resources to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: best reward at the end or meet our goals
at the end of this production facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: To piggyback a little bit, what's the best
way to measure the temperature infrared to
[SPEAKER_01]: your camera, something else?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where to measure leaf temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can definitely use infrared
thermometry like IR gun.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing to keep in mind is that if
you go and buy one of these from Home
[SPEAKER_02]: Depot, they're typically calibrated for
drywall to measure the temperature of the
[SPEAKER_02]: drywall for contractors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's an adjustment called
emissivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to adjust the emissivity
rating on these IR guns to be able to get
[SPEAKER_02]: an accurate temperature reading on a plant
surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found from reading white papers and
stuff that about 0.97 to 0.98 is the right
[SPEAKER_02]: emissivity setting for these IR guns.
[SPEAKER_02]: To get an accurate temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this is not an automated process.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't get real time reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a spot check.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flir cameras or thermal imaging cameras
are a great target for automating that
[SPEAKER_02]: process and getting real time VPD
calculations.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that there needs to be some
further R&D to refine that technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: The angle of the camera plays a big role
in getting accurate readings, the distance
[SPEAKER_02]: from the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The height of the lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And plus, it's a lot more expensive than
one of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have to think about costs as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does it cost someone to go in and pay
a labor to go check your temp and record
[SPEAKER_02]: it versus a real time reading?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we get the cost of those flare
cameras down and refine the application of
[SPEAKER_02]: them on these rooms would be a really good
target.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think another thing to think about too
when we talk about this all the time is
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy cubic footage and which leaf are we
measuring?
[SPEAKER_00]: How deep into the canopy do we go?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we come up with an appropriate
average?
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes such a challenge in really
understanding real time leaf temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: data relative to airflow and
homogenization of the space relative to
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf temp offset to light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it's almost like it's a
constant that needs to constantly be
[SPEAKER_00]: recalibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like you mentioned the distance
from the light, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means even if we have one lighting
source, and we understand the offset at X
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of feet, as those plants grow,
that offset becomes different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is the real focus?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just another part of plant flow
process and cultivation techniques and
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy management to try and get that
canopy as even as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And understanding the depth of the canopy
and the penetration of the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of factors it's not as
simple as just running or poke your head
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room and see the first leaf and
shoot it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the leaf temp offset.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about trying to understand that room
as a whole and the canopy as a whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw someone throwing a link to an IR
camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely an option as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't investigated that as much,
but any way that you know infrared
[SPEAKER_02]: thermometry is very similar, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just a gun.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can also use cameras to do it and that
could be a great technology as well to
[SPEAKER_02]: investigate for real time.
[SPEAKER_02]: VPD readings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quickly, maybe you guys can touch on
explaining how different HVC conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: affect the crop and how tight control is
required in terms of temperature and
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a pretty good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's several different angles
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my mind first goes to the accuracy of
the sensors and the data that you actually
[SPEAKER_00]: collect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have all these different parameters
that we can control and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: scientifically backed on the actions we
take and what the final product should
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's so easy to just and we,
Anders and I talk about this all the time
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have such different experiences
in the cultivation space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the first thing I'm going to do
when I go into a space is read the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing he's going to do is read
the data and then we're going to switch
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're going to make sure that there's
a correlation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's some of the challenges that
we've seen in this industry is sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: drift and lack of recalibration,
lack of accuracy of certain sensors,
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors that are affected by IR in the
room or heat in the room or light in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really fun to think about how you
can apply HVACD as a tool for crop
[SPEAKER_00]: steering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But without accurate data, how do you
create an accurate action plan?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I, I totally hear you on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the parameters and the control
it, it's, um, it depends on what kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting type you're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it depends on what stage of
growth you're in as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biggest challenges controlling environment
in an indoor grow is, uh, the lights off
[SPEAKER_02]: to lights off transition, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have all that sensible, you know,
heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Intensible load during the lights are on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it goes off, we get this huge
spike in relative humidity and it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: high relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to give us mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be those big swings and
relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to mold our crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so having equipment that can control
that spike during that transition is a
[SPEAKER_02]: great tool for IPM.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and just to make sure that this plant
is seeing the right environment every
[SPEAKER_02]: minute of every day, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the goal of an indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grower is to basically provide it with the
perfect environment every minute of its
[SPEAKER_02]: entire lifetime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that always attainable?
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's challenges in an indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but trying your best at doing that is
really our goal, you know, and I think to
[SPEAKER_00]: unpack that, you know, from a digestible
action plan creation to me, it's about 24
[SPEAKER_00]: hour VPD control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We so often talk about, Hey, what's the
right VPD when lights are on to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for biomass accumulation or
secondary metabolite creation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that lights off period is so
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, as you mentioned, from an IPM
perspective, but you know, the two main
[SPEAKER_00]: plant processes that we're talking about
here, transpiration and the lights are on
[SPEAKER_00]: and respiration and the lights are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do those factors of root zone
temperature affect the ability of that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to take up oxygen in the root zone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's just, uh, there's a lot going on,
but thinking about it from a 24 hour
[SPEAKER_00]: period, rather than just, what can I do
when my lights are on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's think about how that plant repairs
itself and the lights are off,
[SPEAKER_00]: which prepares us to jump back into a high
PPFD environment as soon as the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, that's a great debate about
sunrises and sunsets and light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I think the more that you can
allow that plant to see the appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions when the lights are off,
the better she'll perform when the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: are on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually say a healthy day requires a
healthy night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you really want to perform,
um, and get as much out of that lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: period as you can, you need to let her
sleep a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean by that is just
effectively take, uh, take care of the
[SPEAKER_00]: respiration process as well.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, again, it's, we control
ambient in these rooms, the temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: and relative humidities to really control
leaf temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we really care about,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure that leaf temperature
is in the proper zone for photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: rate, metabolic rate, um, you know,
maximum CO2 assimilation, which is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to pack on yield and biomass, all of those
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great answers, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one on COAs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what do you guys see as the range of
terpene percentages?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we know the upper limit
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the highest result you've seen?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was like four or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen anything higher?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you've seen five percents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a significant amount of fours,
especially recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to breeders that have their
hands in the dirt and, uh, it reminds me
[SPEAKER_00]: of, you know, just good storytelling where
people said that they've cracked eight or
[SPEAKER_00]: even crack 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those numbers to me seem absurd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they seem absurd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen them on paper,
but I do know that there are breeders that
[SPEAKER_00]: prize terps and they are driving every
aspect of their breeding and selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's male selection for,
you know, to be a carrier male or to be an
[SPEAKER_00]: influencer male, um, in trying to get more
out of that female from a terp
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think, you know, we're going to
continue to see those numbers grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you said, I'm not exactly sure
what that upper echelon is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, on paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, probably close to five is the
highest I've seen 4.8 or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, again, it's, you can only
achieve that kind of number if you have
[SPEAKER_02]: good environmental control throughout your
flowering cycle, but then also drying and
[SPEAKER_02]: curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's preserving terpenes to me is
a very important part of being a terp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's the same kind of
mindset I used when making concentrates or
[SPEAKER_02]: like a winemaker does.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grower grows the grapes or grows the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a, as a concentrate manufacturer,
you don't make anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just try and preserve it and keep that
quality there, that quality, that resident
[SPEAKER_02]: and showcase it in its best possible
manner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing with terps on flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow this, your room can be just
so loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, you know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You open up that room to your flower,
that door to your flower room,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you just get hit in the face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Ooh, that's a good room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's gas cake, gas cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's loud, you know, but if something goes
wrong, you're drying and curing,
[SPEAKER_02]: or even in your post-processing and
storage, how you handle it in transport
[SPEAKER_02]: through distribution and then to
dispensary shelf, that 4% might've existed
[SPEAKER_02]: when it was sent to the lab, but I would
wager that it's not that level by the time
[SPEAKER_02]: it gets to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I take them with a grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, the value of terpenes is
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely a room for breeding for
higher percentages.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, think about a few decades ago,
cannabinoids were back in the seventies
[SPEAKER_02]: were only eight to 12%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cultivars would be eight to 12% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're seeing stuff 35, 40%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, we can argue about moisture
content and how that affects that overall
[SPEAKER_02]: potency, but still it's crazy how far
we've come in terms of the potency of this
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that the last, you know,
five, six years or so, a huge focus has
[SPEAKER_02]: been put on terps and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, I'm sure we will see those numbers
grow over time as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Knows what one gram can actually hold in
bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's insane to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the first time I cracked 30%,
I was so proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm like embarrassed of those test
results considering where the community's
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, man, I cracked 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm just like, you know, you need to
be shooting higher than that considering
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetics and the level of control we
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show me a test result at 40% THC with like
12, 13, 14% moisture content.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I just showed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the reasons I shared it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the gamesmanship of that water
content is really important here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reading those COAs and understanding what
they really say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you do need to know the moisture
content because you know, 4% moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: content and 44% to me is not nearly as
exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what the bud is going to burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know that it's going to be dry and
crumbly and the same goes for Terps,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a relational percentage and
proportion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this gamesmanship of how low do
we let that moisture content number get in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to get high COAs but still keep it
high enough that we get customer
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfaction, shelf life, and just a
product that people really want and enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I saw another question here in
the chat that I just like to speak to real
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially it says, what are the best
yields that phenotypes can achieve?
[SPEAKER_02]: And Christian here is speaking in grams
per meter squared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I'm here in California and
I speak in grams per square foot of
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't off the top of my head know the
correlation to meter squared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adrian kindly did the conversion here and
it looks like it's between 74 and 84 grams
[SPEAKER_01]: per square foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's what he put 800 to 900?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the translation of the
standard measurement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if so this is the way I think
about it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I was doing a pro forma to do a
financial plan for my cannabis business,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would probably benchmark it at 55 grams
a square foot, which is attainable and not
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone can attain it, but it's a good
target to benchmark your business off of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you're getting closer to 20 grams
per square foot to, you know, 25 grams per
[SPEAKER_02]: square foot, you might need to up that a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: To survive in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're up at the 80 to a hundred
grams per square foot, you're killing as
[SPEAKER_02]: long, especially if you have the quality
too, because it's one thing to have yield,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's also about quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm talking sellable flower weight,
not trim plus, plus everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking 80 to a hundred grams of
sellable flower weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I've ever seen anything too
much over a hundred grams per square foot
[SPEAKER_02]: of like actual sellable flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even that probably had a little bit of
some smalls and B grade flower included in
[SPEAKER_02]: it too, but that's how you calculate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the importance of like
understanding what the baseline for
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement is, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talk about this a lot too with
people throwing around, I got a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: grams of square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you realize they were measuring
fan leaves and all this other stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: like, come on, man, that's not going to go
to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't count that in the calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really understanding what went into
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you derate your smaller buds,
you know, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're big factors in trying to get
everyone on the same page for
[SPEAKER_00]: communicating what a good baseline would
be or what a high level, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's going to win that game is the person
that really understands what is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: going to market, how to measure it and
putting together a historical crop
[SPEAKER_00]: steering techniques per cultivar that
allow you to achieve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this even kind of reminds me of
the discussion we had the other day
[SPEAKER_02]: around, you know, accounting practices in
cannabis too, and how there's just so many
[SPEAKER_02]: different ways to report this information
in a financial statement as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the same thing when we're
talking about how to report our yield in
[SPEAKER_02]: grams per square foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's a lot of non,
you know, generally accepted accounting
[SPEAKER_02]: principles that are applied to cannabis
financial statements as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of, we still have a lot of
things to figure out.
That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, should we, I'm thinking maybe we cap
off this conversation with a question
[SPEAKER_01]: regarding growing media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse lets you scratch your microbe itch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get him started.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we're doing it at the end here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_01]: So high level thoughts on hydroponic
versus soil growth, growth media methods
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of the highest quality product or
both methods capable of reaching same or
[SPEAKER_01]: similar high quality end results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wondering if using hydroponic growth
methods limits a certain phenotypic or
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype expression in some cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're asking the plants to perform an
environment that is unnatural.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eliminating the phenotypic expression of
your plants by growing hydroponically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's a super loaded question
that we can unpack 15 different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way I think Andrews and I talk
about it, because I think as most people
[SPEAKER_00]: that know me know, like I love soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love thinking about inoculating fungal
colonies and nutrient cycling and the
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulation of molecules in the plant as
a by-product, microbes as pest defense,
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes for systemic acquired response.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these angles that microbes bring to
the party doesn't necessarily mean they
[SPEAKER_00]: can't be included in hydroponic
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the part of differentiating
hydroponics and let's call it a soil-based
[SPEAKER_00]: approach is the level of control and
understanding you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very challenging to understand let's
say you do a soil test or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that to understand what's in the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't necessarily give you all the
tools you need to truly crop steer from a
[SPEAKER_00]: fertigation and control perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about response time when you're
making that decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a hydroponic or quote unquote
sterile media, you have the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: control those variables with much more
precision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that creates an opportunity
for you to potentially make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And considering we don't have,
you know, we're still, they're still
[SPEAKER_00]: emerging data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for me to say I'm a hundred
percent in the camp of nutrient salts and
[SPEAKER_00]: rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, I respect the fact
that there's control measurable
[SPEAKER_00]: applications that we can predicate action
plans off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: The management of soil and soil recycling
and recycling media can be incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we have a hydroponic media,
it's so much easier to say, all right,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're done with this run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're starting from scratch again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a blank slate to write your
poem and get this plant to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that that necessarily
means you have to exclude microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a whole other conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think from a crop steering and
application standpoint, soil is more of
[SPEAKER_00]: like a very wide or very long tarmac for
you to be successful on without precision
[SPEAKER_00]: measurable control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas a hydroponic approach is shorter
tarmac, but very measurable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if something goes also about buffering
in terms of risk, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, your plant is going to be somewhat
safer in soil to an extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: If something was to go wrong and indoor
facility, it provides more of a buffer to
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the downside is then the
responsiveness in eliciting certain crops
[SPEAKER_02]: during techniques, you know, vice versa.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you forget to water rockwool for a day,
that plant's not going to live very long,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or your pH sensors off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get slammed with acid or
alkaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can have a dramatic effect just
in four applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I myself am more of a salt
rockwool type grower, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: into like precision agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I definitely respect the soil guys out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tough to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to duplicate and make consistent
run to run, even though it is possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of benefits of soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen some wonderfully grown
living soil cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the best flower I've ever consumed
has come from living soil grown media.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from a reproducibility, efficiency,
cleanliness standpoint, it's hard to beat,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, hydroponics with more of a
sterile media.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a give and take.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really a preference thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's about, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a science thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need more scientific research to
truly understand what's going on in these
[SPEAKER_00]: organic soil based medias to apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, my hope is that we get more
soil guys embracing some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertigation crops during techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get more of these sterile salt
based guys embracing the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques, bringing them amino acids and
hormones and these other factors into the
[SPEAKER_00]: party rather than just thinking,
hey, what are the, you know, 19 nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: that I need to deliver to this plant and
instead think, how are these nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: being available?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they chelated at what levels?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the relationships between them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some of that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think, you know, it's definitely a
marriage of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not two camps that need to fight each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two camps that need to respect each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get the people that are in the
organic camp that say, hey, I don't ever
[SPEAKER_00]: want to use salts because they're
synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these chemicals end up in the
soil and leaching into our world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not healthy for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's why it's so important
to fine tune the control and how much
[SPEAKER_00]: fertigation, how much runoff and really
being able to minimize the negative
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental effects of using synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, embracing some of these organic
understandings, I think that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: marriage where you don't lose anything at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing but gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the precision control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get great phenotypic expression and
maximizing and optimizing that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there has to be some middle
ground, a hybrid approach to fully sterile
[SPEAKER_02]: and utilizing organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, whether that is using some
beneficial insects in your flowering room
[SPEAKER_02]: or using mycorrhizae fungi during the
transplant, even if in rock and roll,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's still benefits you can get from
organics in a sterile hydroponic media.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate the opportunity to talk
about these things that we love so much.
