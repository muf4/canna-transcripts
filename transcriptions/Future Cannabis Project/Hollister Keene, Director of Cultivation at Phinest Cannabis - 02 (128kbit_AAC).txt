[SPEAKER_00]: And then this plant will spend about 21
days, 14 of which at almost 100% humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: before it establishes roots and we can
start acclimating it to lower and lower
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity and higher and higher light
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a little bit of kind of the
outline of like, so we have stage one,
[SPEAKER_00]: initiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stage two is shoot proliferation,
which is basically figuring out the media
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plant is actually growing on,
getting more biomass that we can multiply
[SPEAKER_00]: off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stage three is multiplication and then
stage four is this hardening off and
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting phase that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which process?
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole process?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, I'm glad you asked that
question because this brings me to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the next points that I wanted to
talk about, which was just the pros and
[SPEAKER_00]: cons of tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are definite pros, but there are
definite cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a more expensive way to produce a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: No question asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a lot easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you've ever done breeding
before, it's really cheap to produce seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do you need consistency across
your production system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because obviously with seeds, you get a
huge amount of varying genotypes and
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hey, I need consistency in my
production system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to grow the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go to asexual propagation as
opposed to sexual propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cloning, you know, cloning
asexual propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all been doing it for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not rocket science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it pretty clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the environment right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a little bit of hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 to 18 days, you got a new plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the cons is this process does
take a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do, we say, so we work with a lot
of clients throughout the states and we've
[SPEAKER_00]: brought their genetics in under contract
with, you know, specific language saying
[SPEAKER_00]: who, if anyone besides them has access to
these genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we tell people it takes usually eight
to 12 months before, from when you give me
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant that I can induce into tissue
culture, from when I can sell you a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand clones a week off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be eight to 10 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's different processes and
there's different types of tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the big cons is that it does
take a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the things that we've
struggled with, especially with how the
[SPEAKER_00]: market can be very trend driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, you've got the hot strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I want fucking, I want 10,000 a month
fucking clean ass tissue culture clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, my, pardon my language.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be able to give them to you a year
from now when the new hot strain is
[SPEAKER_00]: trending and that doesn't sell anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so this is one of the challenges
that we've faced, you know, and so,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, I mean, so that is definitely
one of the cons and there's different
[SPEAKER_00]: processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're different methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do something called a quick clean,
you know, where we take the plant in,
[SPEAKER_00]: we do a generation or two in vitro or in
culture, and we can give you 50 or a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred plants back, you know,
that you can then grow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what most people do with tissue
culture is they tissue culture their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and they grow out mom plants of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they take traditional clones off
of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we provide them new tissue
cultured plants on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're always cutting off of clean
stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same as what we do traditionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do, and I'll cut back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I get too granular at any point,
stop me if you're like, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what the fuck you're saying,
but we do different types of, and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple types of different tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have nodal propagation, you have micro
propagation, you have Maristem
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation, you have callus cell
propagation, and you have embryogenesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these different types, depending on
what section or amount of cells or tissues
[SPEAKER_00]: you take to reproduce kind of defines what
we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do what's called nodal propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're only taking the lateral nodes and
propagating off of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that you have the lowest rate of
mutation through that type of tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture, because other types of tissue
culture work really well for other things
[SPEAKER_00]: like removing systemic viruses or
producing a large volume of plants in a
[SPEAKER_00]: very small area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you run a higher risk of mutation on
the plant, which is a reality of,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a reality of cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about genetic drift, which is a
mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see mutation in seed production
where you have intersex traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphroditic traits, diploid traits,
diploid, triploid traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mutation is a risk that you always run
with roof reproduction, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sexual or asexual or in-vitro or ex-vitro,
but it is a risk with tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so through nodal propagation,
we see, again, the lowest, we see the
[SPEAKER_00]: lowest rate of mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I think there's a decent way to segue
into like one of the big advantages of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture process is this
reinvigoration that you see of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I have not spent nearly as long
working in tissue culture as some of our
[SPEAKER_00]: partners have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even talking with them, I've tried to
press them to understand, why does a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerate when it goes through tissue
culture process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can I take a 20-year-old OG Kush clone
that is just not performing like it used
[SPEAKER_00]: to?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way more susceptible to diseases and
pests than it used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can I take that through the tissue
culture process and it comes out healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: and healthier and stronger and growing
like a seedling again?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think we're screwing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pardon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing that we really see,
and this is like, I had like a double
[SPEAKER_00]: doctorate tell me this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first asked this question,
he was like, the plant forgets how old it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, what the hell does
that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cells have a genetic memory.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant has an age.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Senescence is a natural process of all
biological organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants have this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow through this tissue culture
process, the plant is resetting its cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's resetting its genetic age.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll take a plant that's been growing
and again, has all these what we would
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe call undesirable traits after a long
time of traditional asexual propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spends eight months in tissue culture,
generation after generation after
[SPEAKER_00]: generation, getting micropropagated in
vitro with zero biotic stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: No bacteria fucking with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No pests fucking with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The perfect climate, the perfect
temperature, everything, all the right mix
[SPEAKER_00]: of nutrients, hormones, sugars,
vitamins, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow those plants out and they do equal
opposite branching again, the way a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, holy shit, there is
something going on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say one caveat, we haven't seen
that across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say 70% of the strains that were
showing symptoms of degradation,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can take through the tissue culture
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within eight months to a year of being
in tissue culture, they come out growing
[SPEAKER_00]: better than they did before, but not every
single strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately we think it's the amount of
time that it spends in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this quick clean process that we have
done, we really now only do for Maristem
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture, which is what I'll talk
about now, is taking a different set of
[SPEAKER_00]: cells and propagating and multiplying from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage of Maristem culture,
raise your hands, do we know what a
[SPEAKER_00]: Maristem is on a plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Maristem is a region of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's multiple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a Maristem in the growing tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a Maristem in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a Maristem actually in the stem
region as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an area of rapid cell division that's
happening in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting thing about these regions
in the plant is that if the plant say has,
[SPEAKER_00]: have you guys been hearing anything about
hemplatin virus recently?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there is a systemic virus in the
plant, systemic meaning that it is not a
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogen that's external and affecting the
plant from the outside, but it's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: a pathogen that's reproducing inside of
the plant, viruses are this way,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's very prevalent in other
agricultural crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Maristematic region of the plant,
the cell division is happening so fast
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can have new healthy cells that
contain all the genetic material to grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: new plant that is not yet connected to the
vascular tissue of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vascular tissue being what transports
all the water and all the sugar through
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can take this cell cluster from
the Maristem and produce a genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: identical, perfectly healthy plant that's
outgrown the virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has not yet been infected by the
virus that's running through the xylem and
[SPEAKER_00]: the phloem, the vascular tissue of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I worked briefly with Driscoll's right
out of college.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure no big berry growers,
and all of their plants are produced
[SPEAKER_00]: through Maristem tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're taking, again, the very,
very, very growing tip of the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is something you have to do under
a microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pull that growing tip, you scrape off
all the leaves, all the leaf primordia,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you get this Maristematic dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this area of rapid cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, all the genetic material to grow an
identical plant, but it's not connected to
[SPEAKER_00]: the vascular tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can culture that Maristem and grow
a virus-free plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Driscoll's at their facility up in Red
Bluff, that's what they do for all their
[SPEAKER_00]: berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what they do is they grow that
tissue culture Maristem strawberry plant
[SPEAKER_00]: into a mother plant, and they take
traditional clones off of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what they provide to all their
growers, disease-free, virus-free,
[SPEAKER_00]: pest-free plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're trying to do at Finest
Candidates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this Maristem process is the only quick
clean process that we do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Maristem takes longer than traditional
nodal propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say quick clean, you're still
looking at probably six months until I
[SPEAKER_00]: could give you a flap of Maristem
regenerated disease-free plants back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good question.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we haven't had that positive mutations,
obviously, yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do, I'll definitely be the first to
tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, most of the mutations that we see are
increased intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we evaluate every plant that we take
through tissue culture, we evaluate
[SPEAKER_00]: in-house in our facility before we release
it to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow it out to make sure that there
isn't mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't think I'm speaking out of
line when I say a lot of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars that are widely circulated and
grown and loved have intersex or
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphroditic traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the result of extremely rapid and
somewhat unmonitored breeding that's
[SPEAKER_00]: happened in the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of traits that maybe weren't
noticed or documented are getting passed
[SPEAKER_00]: along and passed along through the gene
pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is pretty unique in the
angiosperm family that it's dioecious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has male and female plants that have
flowers that have totally different
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive organs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is right now one of the only
plants except papaya that is dioecious and
[SPEAKER_00]: is being tissue cultured.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something that we're really
looking at pretty actively is what do we
[SPEAKER_00]: see with dioecious plants and intersex
traits when we start to do the tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture process, especially when we start
to talk about things like embryogenesis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is another type of plant tissue
culture where you're familiar with stem
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically stem cell growth for
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take plant material in and you can put
it in the media and it grows what's called
[SPEAKER_00]: a callus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And callus is just undifferentiated plant
cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those cells, depending on what biotic or
abiotic stimulus they get, they can become
[SPEAKER_00]: a leaf, they can become a root,
they can become a shoot, they can become a
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Embryogenesis is a way to produce a huge
number of plants in a small area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take a piece of callus the size of
a pinhead and get it to grow 75 plants out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Embryogenesis is something that's not done
in a lot of crops, again, because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mutation rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're currently doing trials with
embryogenesis right now to see if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's even viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I don't want to get too
granular.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other things, at least for me,
that has been really interesting about the
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture process and learning is
just the idea of germplasm, the idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to store a vast amount of
genetic material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, anyone who's ever tried to do a
breeding program or done breeding in-house
[SPEAKER_00]: or even tried to keep mother stock around
knows that it can be problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be challenging to keep mother stock
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not to mention, if you want to have
10, 20, 100, 300 cultivars that you can be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to cycle through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So germplasm, just the genetic banking,
is a really big advantage of tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we offer that program to actually a
handful of breeders as well, who they have
[SPEAKER_00]: a library of genetic material that they
don't want to have to keep alive and
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially lose or have potentially get
infected with pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for joining us.
Thank you.
