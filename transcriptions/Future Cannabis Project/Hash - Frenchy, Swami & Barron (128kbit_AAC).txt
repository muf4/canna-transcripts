So,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're telling me that if I want to
collect genetics for the Emerald Triangle,
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to study the microbial life of
every one spot where I collect the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, because it is the terroir which
creates...
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbial life is the second science
of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: To a level, I understood the power of
those microbes, but I didn't understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that they literally regulate the health of
the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you change what you feed the plant,
you change the terpenes profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the microbes that break the
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but the nutrients are processed by the
microbes in the soil, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the source of the microbes... The
microbes are in the soil, but you add to
[SPEAKER_03]: them, and then you put in your compost tea
which has the ingredients that you have,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that will be processed in a way that
will change.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the... You told me,
you taught me about the soil creates the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to science, it's the microbes
that do... In French, when you say
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir, there is the terroir,
the land, the climate, the genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the farmer, but there is the terroir,
the test, the test of that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a long time, the terroir couldn't
be...
[SPEAKER_00]: Like terroir was never proved that the
plant had the ability to capture the
[SPEAKER_00]: essence of a place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I started to look all that
stuff for terroir, I found out that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually they had a break, they're
breaking down further, and they realize
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's actually the microbial life in
the soil that defines the characteristics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because if I get soil from under the
redwood trees, or soil from over here out
[SPEAKER_03]: in the thing, or soil from under oak
trees, it's all different in the microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the minerals may be the same,
but the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine in Bordeaux, you have field where
there is a little dust track in between,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in between those two, well,
there is a serious difference in the
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristic of the wine, and it's a
microbe here inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: But see, the microbes break down the
nutrients that you put in, whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: and when they break them down,
they make them accessible to the plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But those are, we call those indigenous
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're from the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in real regenerative farming,
you cultivate those indigenous
[SPEAKER_03]: microorganisms from your local farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot adapt genetic from abroad to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have maybe not the same
microbial life, but you need to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of those microbes that are similar
so that the plant can really adapt better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the plant will adapt over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but then you change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does change.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of the microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The genetics, yes, but the microbes,
I agree 100%, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just really finding out how it
actually does that work, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been learning about the various
kinds of bacterium which are in there,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then the fungi, several different
kinds of fungi, and then the nematodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know about the nematodes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever seen those on a microscope?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ellen was the first person I ever saw that
was talking about microbes, like I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about raisin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's trippy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So trippy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my realization, Frenchy, was that
there's an old saying in mystical things,
[SPEAKER_03]: as above, so below, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I say, as above, so below,
because there's life in that soil in a
[SPEAKER_03]: way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff Lowenthal calls it the soil food web,
and everything interrelates to everything
[SPEAKER_03]: else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the worm dies or casts off its shell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something eating that shell of the worm.
[SPEAKER_03]: The worm poops out, and something eating
that, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it dies, and then something else
eats that, and then the nematode is eating
[SPEAKER_03]: that, and there are bad nematodes and good
nematodes, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some of the fungi go into the
root system.
[SPEAKER_03]: The key thing for me, Frenchy,
was to realize that the plant roots put
[SPEAKER_03]: out, I always thought the plants just suck
up, which they certainly do, but they
[SPEAKER_03]: actually exude, they're called exudates,
they exude sugar to feed the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have an exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give you sugar, and you give me what I
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, and they put out carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why sun-grown cannot be duplicated,
because the plant rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: As much as it rule on the outside with all
the other insects, everything that move
[SPEAKER_00]: around the plant is controlled by the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even other plants, they can kill other
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, whatever plants are growing around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another story, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you give me this, I give you the
sugar that you wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: These trees, everything's dropping from
those trees, but nobody turns the soil
[SPEAKER_03]: till it's the soil, nobody waters it,
nobody feeds it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens, it falls on the soil,
30 years later, it's all decomposed down
[SPEAKER_03]: because the microbes have done,
and then what does the plant do?
[SPEAKER_03]: It brings it back up again, and it's a
total cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: They call it the law of return.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant gives to the soil, the soil
transforms it through the microbial life,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then the plant then reacts again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you have a forest living like that,
it's self-regenitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It feeds itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a sustainable system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can grow there also.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, at the edge of the forest,
you have to plan your place as your
[SPEAKER_03]: permaculture to say, how do I fit into
this total landscape?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's land here that's good for this,
and there's other land that's not good for
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helen was showing the microbial life for
different type of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can literally use microbes to grow
only what you want on your land.
[SPEAKER_00]: She blew me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's farming for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not growing cannabis in yeast and
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can avoid having weed or any plant
that you don't want depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial life that you have in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It regulates everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: What tobacco are you smoking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're using American beans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's got to be Panama.
No,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's cool to see all the people into the
regenerative program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some workshop in Seattle and Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 99% of the farmers in Washington,
they were all indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all no-teal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blew me away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that, I had seen two farmers,
one in Spain and one here in Cali that was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing no-teal inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do really cool things no-teal
inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's flippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see the growth of that guy in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow inside like other people,
you sleep out when you see that home
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's alive with life.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's exactly the opposite of what
Indore wants to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to have a sterile room,
a totally controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now you bring in living soil and
you've got a living environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason that the plant creates terpenes
and trichol and cannabinoids is to protect
[SPEAKER_03]: itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're out in the open,
in natural soil, there's many things you
[SPEAKER_03]: have to protect yourself from.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they produce a variety of terpenes and
many different kind of cannabinoids to
[SPEAKER_03]: protect themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we use those for the same
purpose, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making a cheeto?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're mixing sunshine, sunshine,
rebel moon, norcal d, with alpine glow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Craig's THC ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two pioneers of the regenerative
movement in Humboldt, people that have
[SPEAKER_01]: been in it since the old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the hash, the best hash that I
found from the hardest school.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't know how big you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep this inside till the mix is
ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Jacob has some of the best weed and
hash around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, see, Trinity is the orphan child of
the Emerald Triangle, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to get some weed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think he won an award recently,
right, for your book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't you do it?
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, for the Adrymal Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the quality of the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a clip for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is lovely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and that pink in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the pink sunshine is doing a pink
Nepali right now, crossed with the rebel
[SPEAKER_01]: moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's giving me a reminiscent of the
mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pink Nepali.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swamy, what was that flower you had?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me keep this away till the mix is
ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mix is done, otherwise I'll break it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have never... You know the field in
Malana?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those fields in Malana, they have really a
specific smell that you don't find in
[SPEAKER_00]: hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all those fruit terpenes together.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a flower that smelled exactly like
those fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I smelled it, all my hair
was like... Same thing with the pink.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that, the orange turbo?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: A while back, two years back, and I even
find a seed that I gave you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was trippier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was trippier because it was being...
It's like when I smelled it the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time, I was back in a mountain at the end
of that valley in Malana, in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the field, making charaspé, like that
exact, exact terpène profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trippier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know how smell can touch you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a reincarnation or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get back to that same moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hash didn't taste at all like what I
was making there, but I had never come
[SPEAKER_00]: even remotely close.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I'm totally thrilled about the
progress of hash making, partly due to all
[SPEAKER_03]: of your teachings and so on, because when
I first came back to the States...
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first came back to the States in
03, well, no, it was actually more like
[SPEAKER_03]: 99, and people would say, here,
try this hash, try this hash, and I'd say,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is grass hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smelled like my front lawn when I used
to mow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no concept of how to make true,
fine hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, what's that term mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it charas?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it wet?
[SPEAKER_03]: All these different ways to make it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The experimentation is tremendous between
how many different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's resin, rosin, wax, shatter,
all these different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to keep track.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for me, I still like the dry sift from
my trim tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's so different from an extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you drink the juice from a fruit and
you leave behind the whole matrix that
[SPEAKER_00]: created the sugar and the juice,
it's maybe the apple or the fruit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the fruit anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take the resin from the resin
head, from the matrix that created those
[SPEAKER_00]: 150 plus cannabinoid and 150 plus terpen,
you leave behind that matrix that created
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I make hash, that matrix is inside
the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you make wine, the skin is
inside the juice to be able to make,
[SPEAKER_00]: to ferment, to do that, to have that
chemical reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take the juice from the grape,
you can make pure alcohol, but you cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: make wine at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter your tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot create the wine if you don't
have the matrix that created the sugar and
[SPEAKER_00]: the juice with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is on the skin of the grape,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all these microbes and yeast and
so on on the skin of the grape.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why the full plant has all of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you extract, you get into a
domain that is so vast and so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: create so many different products until
you have something that is so pure that
[SPEAKER_00]: even big pharma have to face reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually extract 99.9%
cannabinoid, isolate and distillate
[SPEAKER_00]: something that they've been telling us for
50 years you couldn't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you needed to do it chemically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like there is that advance in the BHO
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the ultimate mean to capture and
separate all those compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then test them for that, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: As against the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you isolate so far down, it becomes a
western medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start extracting, you step out of
the entourage effect and you have that
[SPEAKER_00]: whole territory of amazing extract and the
ash is in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we don't have the 450 compounds
of the plant but we have a really wide
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, I think the cannabis world
is big enough for all of that because
[SPEAKER_03]: those isolates are going to have specific
medical use that we're going to discover,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all about the whole plant,
all 100%, all that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that there are going to be,
they're going to be able to isolate
[SPEAKER_03]: certain things and pinpoint and I think
that's really exciting and that's what's
[SPEAKER_03]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using different terpenes with the
same cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have different.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's really exciting that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're playing with some things that they
have to make it up literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, the cannabis plant produce
terpenes that everywhere are not unique to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that terpenes profile of 100 plus
terpenes, most of them you cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: quantify.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's unique, that you cannot duplicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also with the cannabinoid, those different
things, all that mixture.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I call it the ensemble,
not the entourage, because all of them are
[SPEAKER_03]: playing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: All of them are playing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Entourage, it's usually one playing,
everybody following.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the ensemble of a 500 degree or an
orchestra.
[SPEAKER_03]: In America it is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he actually, he told me that when it's
in the plant, it's the ensemble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it's in the brain, it's the
entourage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because in that sense THC is
probably leading.
[SPEAKER_03]: THC would be the dominant one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the most ancient device to
spark ash that is known, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we did a mixture today of a little
bit of tobacco and a hash made from
[SPEAKER_01]: sunbolt farms, grown in Humboldt,
dry farmed, sunshine Johnson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So did the rebel moon for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Craig from Alpine glow did the
THC bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are both regenerative farms,
which for me and my data topped yield and
[SPEAKER_01]: THC and cannabinoid content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a huge proof that you don't need
inputs, you don't need chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you just work with nature,
you can produce the most fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that you don't need inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, sorry, no commercial synthetic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and it's like, sunshine is in a very
specific place where she can do dry
[SPEAKER_00]: farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not dry farming that define quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's in osmosis with a place where she is
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's using that ability to limit
totally the water input so that the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: have to kick into her defensive system and
produce a lot of resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, torture your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but how long has she been growing
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the third, this is the fourth
year we're doing on the same exact spot,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also to make people kind of
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a flood zone that plays every 50
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's underwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also right in between the avenue of
the giants, which are some of the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and the biggest respiratory,
they're breathing all the time and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: blowing, they're blowing so much moisture
throughout that valley in the morning that
[SPEAKER_01]: yes, they're doing your watering for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like people say, oh,
how can you grow plants without water?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not without water.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know vineyards also that don't have
water use because of just what's
[SPEAKER_03]: underneath the ground and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you say what's average use for
cannabis, you're really talking through
[SPEAKER_03]: your head because there's no average use
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it all depends on the land potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she's got redwood air.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where I grow, I have dug fir air,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dug fir and oak air.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to...
[SPEAKER_00]: The beauty of India, that was the first
time where it's spiritual.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and this is a brand new Chilam,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Our blessings on the Chilam.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big deal in India because when
you dedicate the Chilam to the God,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a lot of awareness that comes to
what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that, the panel last night,
we're talking about making the tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: In India, when you smoke, it's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a ritual.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are all sorts of details about
the ritual.
[SPEAKER_03]: How to pass the Chilam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not this way, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Kali.
[SPEAKER_03]: Call it Kali Chilam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kali Chilam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't going to say anything,
Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, normally, just for an explanation,
normally the Chilam always goes to the
[SPEAKER_03]: right and you pass with your right hand
and you only take with your right hand and
[SPEAKER_03]: so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Frenchy, out of honor to me,
passed it this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have to say Kali Chilam,
which is the feminine energy going to the
[SPEAKER_03]: left side.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was all unsaid, but I realized he
did it and I realized why he did it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody said anything and we all
understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis wasn't born in the Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was born?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was born in the Tibetan Plateau,
next to the big lake.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was on the other side of the Tian Shan
mountains in Kazakhstan.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a Kumbh Mela story, you know the
Kumbh Mela story?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where the seed dropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it's like, so they find the
birthplace of cannabis when it separated
[SPEAKER_00]: from Humulus 28 million years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Separated from what?
[SPEAKER_00]: From Humulus, from the hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the hops, okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six million years ago it was up to Europe
because there is a corridor of all the ash
[SPEAKER_00]: producing countries, the same climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only one million years ago it went to
South China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only 370,000 years ago it jumped the
Himalaya and became tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that plant was a desert plant to start
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why when you have genetics that
come from anywhere but a tropical country,
[SPEAKER_00]: you really need a little water when you
have in a place where there is so much
[SPEAKER_00]: water in the air to start with,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: New research on pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send it to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, because the other one is it's in
Kazakhstan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they are Central Asia, the feet of
the Himalaya or China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's next to the oldest evidence of
humanity on that continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's next to the birthplace of cannabis,
it's 2.1 million years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we've been working with this plant
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ethnobotany, they call it,
the interaction of the human.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's terroir also, the culture of
the people creating it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's why we value Afghani hash,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or we even say, you know, Manali,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Kulu Valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell the difference between Kulu
Valley?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm old school.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the difference between a Kulu and
a Manali?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's like I was for a month in
Kulu, in Manali.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't touch a plant until I was in Tosh
and Nakhtang.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to touch any plant before I
was at the place where they are supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the top of the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Manali before, I think they pushed it
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but before it was all wild cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the more the demand, the cultivated
came in.
[SPEAKER_03]: More feral, I think it was actually feral,
not really wild because it had been
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the feral cannabis tends to go
50-50 usually CBD, THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it's like the hash come from India.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way lower in CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to use this to clean the stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you have more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I gave him the Chilean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: look at that stone.
Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are students from Franco.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the whole lineage of the
Chilean thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was there a Lorenzo too or not?
No?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That first guy was Lorenzo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lorenzo, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And does anyone still have a Lorenzo
Chilean?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, mine was broken after eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was funny because the first year I
was in the mountain, we were lucky to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: a good friend of my best friend that spent
some time in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the French guys, they were with a guy
that had been 15 years in the mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was buying all the best of the best
in Tosh and Nakhtang.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for three weeks, I saw a lot of hash
come in front of my nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lesson I took from it,
you want jungle, Tosh and Nakhtang,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want cultivated, Malana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the second year, I send my best friend
to get some field as far away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: village as possible in Malana Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to do the jungle in Tosh and
Nakhtang for three weeks alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came down, I stayed a night in
Pulga with an Italian house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that Italian dude was burning chilum
in an oven in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't really understand how special
it was to share my own jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't understand the value people put
into the quality of your chilum and the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of your resin that defines the
respect that you receive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because I cranked up my jungle all
night long with him in the morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: he fucking gave me a chilum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't know that dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I arrived in Manikaram and I broke
my chilum with a bunch of Italians,
[SPEAKER_00]: they look at me like I had fucking stole
the piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that guy literally changed totally
what chilum was in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used three different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used three different types of clay.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a very important part of any
chilum smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to clean it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look at your chilum.
[SPEAKER_03]: They pull up the chilum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this chilum clean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this dude clean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part of the ritual and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you look how fine the polish is
inside the chilum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be like a mirror, but it's
porous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to absorb a lot of the tar
from it.
Is it ceramic on the inside?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's all clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often two, three, four different types of
clay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is a little more porous,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it absorbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want that absorption.
[SPEAKER_03]: But see, this is the high art.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the high art of chilum making,
you see, because you can get these little
[SPEAKER_03]: throwaway chilums all over the place that
are little tiny one to one or two people
[SPEAKER_03]: chilums.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very similar to what the glass is
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sort of status.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see in California, somebody will drop
four or five thousand, ten thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars on something they can dab with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I suppose, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In India or Italy, it's all about the
chilum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some Italian people, they don't give you
their chilum to smoke when they look at
[SPEAKER_00]: your ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never touch their chilum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when you're new in India,
you don't understand that the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: respect that you receive is the chilum you
have in your hand and the quality of the
[SPEAKER_00]: resin you put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even 15, 20 years old people in India,
if you have the goods, they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter how long you've been in
India.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have it, they don't even give
you the time of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I swear it's not very nice, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not really welcoming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's the caste system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: you got to you got to earn your credits.
[SPEAKER_03]: No question about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the thing going up to India and
like how hardcore is it to go up into the
[SPEAKER_01]: mountains?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've got lost there before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like there's nothing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You live in a cave for months.
[SPEAKER_00]: The closest shop is like today's walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The closest bus is today's walk,
hot spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to bring all your shit and
it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be crazy, crazy, crazy about
resin quality to put yourself through that
[SPEAKER_00]: type of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's at the end, before the winter,
if you get stuck in Malana with the snow
[SPEAKER_00]: and there is one pass at 12,000 feet,
when you have that pass and you have like
[SPEAKER_00]: snow up to your tight and shitty basket,
old and plastic bag to stay, you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kill yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be, now that I think of it
with such a stepping back so far,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like I was insane to do shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the best time in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's a road to Malana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's a road to Malana, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was just thinking at one point,
I was in Nepal and I went from Pokhara to
[SPEAKER_03]: Kathmandu and I had to walk about two
thirds of the way, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just making the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at one point it's like barefoot you're
walking along this thing and you're just
[SPEAKER_03]: out of the village and no one speaks
English for like whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When were you in Nepal?
[SPEAKER_03]: When was I in Nepal?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was 1971?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was in 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were moving from EP to Tracker.
[SPEAKER_00]: They changed my visa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to change my third month visa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was supposed to pay 30 rupees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted 3000 rupees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to come back tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time I went to Nepal I believe
was 70, 70.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was working on a movie called Sun Seed
and we were filming various teachers
[SPEAKER_03]: around.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we went and filmed at the Swayambhu.
[SPEAKER_03]: We filmed the Rinpoche at Swayambhu with
the long trumpets like that and the Buddha
[SPEAKER_03]: up there and they're doing this snapping
thing and they're chanting this amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: chanting and pouring tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's up on top of the hill there in
Swayambhu.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I went back a year later but I
went over land from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right all the way up to Nepal again and
then I had a house in back of Swayambhu
[SPEAKER_03]: and I stayed there for about three months
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every day around the temple,
around the hill, Swayambhu hill,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't really into the hash at the
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't like you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't seeking out that most rare
extreme place I was there just to be
[SPEAKER_03]: sitting and painting and meditating.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think that I was going there and
sitting at the feet of the Ashishin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going there to make my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned because you walk alongside with
the same tool and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You try to walk along with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I came to India, the difference
was all my life I worked mostly in the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter in producing country and with
bundle of dry material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me to be able to get that one kilo,
one kilo and a half, two kilos that I need
[SPEAKER_00]: for my year of consummation, I need to
move to do a lot of sieving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the deal was, OK, I'm going to make 80
kilo, 100 kilo to get what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, everything I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're carrying that on your back?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but everything I do, I leave behind me
to that local farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me, I just want that kilo or two of the
pure cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do I have to pay for staying with
you so long?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much are you going to make me pay for
the two kilos of cream that I'm taking?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: People don't know what you're malai,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, cream like melt, like something so
melty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It melt in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highest quality of your sieving.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does the farmer make and get the
cream?
[SPEAKER_00]: By sieving.
[SPEAKER_00]: By sieving to a level by hardly.
[SPEAKER_03]: He cuts the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like so I buy a bundle of branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of plants together in a drying
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take that bundle in a room where I break
down everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take all the stock, everything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, my first sieving, super light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I keep for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And onto what?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing onto a screen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's all dry sieve.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have a screen like this and you're
breaking it up and it's falling and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: catching it down below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even break it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break it, it's later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just make it vibrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this is for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get enough of this, I need to have a
lot of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that material, it's stupid to do it
only one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do it ten times.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those grade, I'm ready to give it in
an exchange for hospitality and that they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't kill me on the price for what I'm
making because that normally is at their
[SPEAKER_00]: stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like I take your stash,
but I give you everything else and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to give you a good price because
you're the people I work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then after you take that... It's a
pretty sweet deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in India... No, it's a relationship
you make over time with the people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm not a good customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not spending much money and I stay
long with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to supercompensate with your
farmer to be able to get that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: In India, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: In India, you literally stick live resin
on your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The relation with the plant, doing that in
the most remote valley of the Himalayas
[SPEAKER_00]: and shit, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first time where I had that
relation with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to come here to understand genetics
and flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had that strong relation for the
first time with that living organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have it in your hand.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day, month after month, it's like
it's sipping in you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have all these buds,
but they have seeds in them?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what do you do with those buds
with seeds in them?
[SPEAKER_00]: You caress them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all caressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're super light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You waste tons.
[SPEAKER_05]: How long is the period that you're
repping?
[SPEAKER_00]: The season is earlier than anything
cultivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the jungle is like early September to
end of September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mid-September to the first week of
October.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then up to end of November,
you have cultivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes even I had a season where it
fucking snowed like this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But two days later, it had melted and we
didn't finish our field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went back to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the plants were all back up,
but they were like semi-wild plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year, we didn't touch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let them go back to the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were all stand up, but they were
all burned by the snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a lot of contaminants in our
hands that we couldn't separate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the resin was strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, torture your plants and make
them survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's survival of the species.
[SPEAKER_03]: They put out something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said gently, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to torture them gently that way,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You carry them because your hands are your
tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resin is sticky, but if you have water in
your hand, it's not going to stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you sweat, you don't stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have oily hands, you don't stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you break the plant and there is water
from the plant and chlorophyll that come
[SPEAKER_00]: in your hand, it's not going to stick the
same either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a while before it...
Otherwise, it's like you just carry the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time you look at your hand,
it's all shiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sticky like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then layer, plant by plant, layer by
layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant, you clean up any little
particles that stick to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly, it layers and the color starts to
appear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got from transparent to light amber,
orangey, red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you have a thick enough layer,
it's dark, almost black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you have enough and you care for
it, you see that when you carry the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is chunk from your hand that goes
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you take your thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You turn it on your hand and you snap it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the ash is going to be on your thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you unstick all your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still sticky, but it becomes super
white.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most difficult is actually to transfer
this to your other thumb so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: clean up that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is two ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either you do a finger, that means that
you roll in your hand that piece of ash so
[SPEAKER_00]: you capture whatever is left in your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like better because the locals didn't
have plastic in the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made flat pancakes into a thick plastic
so that there is very little air that can
[SPEAKER_00]: get in contact with the resin and create
mold and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in India, the problem is mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when your resin is perfectly clean,
the mold spores are everywhere and they
[SPEAKER_00]: stick to the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a bunch of fingers super clean,
but they put them all together into a big
[SPEAKER_00]: bundle.
[SPEAKER_00]: In between, you have the mold that is
coming only when you bring it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain down in South India.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the temperature changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a place when you're molding the
house, where at a certain point,
[SPEAKER_03]: it changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The texture changes and the color changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like live resin, but it's not like
live resin we got with the ice water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: As much as dry resin ash is the same than
ice water, dry cured resin, live resin in
[SPEAKER_00]: your hand is very different than live
resin from the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why because it shouldn't be
that different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen nucleation in my life and
there is 70% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy humid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see why Frenchy, you wanted to
make your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because for them, they can either make
like 20 grams a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can either make like 20 grams a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they can make five grams of creme.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then to get them to make creme is very
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need them next to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell them, okay, you work like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of making 20 grams at so much
money, you're going to make only five,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven, 10 grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give you as much money for what all.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time I went there with a Brahmin that
was pretty amazing in Malana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changed the perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the deal was a guy said, everything
you make, I put ash that I buy of high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the season, we go
together to New Delhi and I sell it to
[SPEAKER_00]: foreigners the same way that I would sell
it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's your payment for what you're
giving me basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you have the local people also that
come and do the field around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they know that you're ready to pay for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they literally work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every night they bring you their
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They show you their hand during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now it's, it's a kind of sad situation
in the mountains right now, because before
[SPEAKER_01]: the farmers used to go there and they had
this word called cod.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and cod used to mean goat shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you go to the mountains and ask
them what cod is, they pull out this
[SPEAKER_01]: little pink bag of salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, it's been completely destroyed
because so many, the demand for hash is so
[SPEAKER_01]: high, especially with India's economic
boom, like everybody smokes hash in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you have these farmers pushed and
they're growing with salts and ruining
[SPEAKER_01]: that whole, all of those hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need worldwide legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even like the first people that started to
change everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bring foreign genetic to a place
where the genetic is possibly 670,000
[SPEAKER_00]: years old, it's like you're polluting a
pool that it's, technically speaking,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a national treasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Indians, they want actually,
they ask for the, I had some huge argument
[SPEAKER_00]: on the forum, the guy wanted genetic from
here to bring to India.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was telling him, it's like,
you have a vast source of amazing and
[SPEAKER_00]: unique genetic in India and you want to
bring something foreign that is based,
[SPEAKER_00]: an hybridation of actually land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to bring that there and
pollute something that is unique to your
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, man, you don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because they see the market in
Europe, they want to do the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to smoke the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the Indian government is now
actually trying to do a land race catalog.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're about to start doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things is for that whole
thing with the genetic markers,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But they want to make sure that they get
land races that are still existing,
[SPEAKER_03]: not just in Himalaya, but in Orissa.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, not Tamil Nadu, but Andhra
Pradesh is also a traditional cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: growing areas, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, but they're still hung up on the
0.3%.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still, they're only going to stake
stuff that's 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they sort of don't get it,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: About full plant, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In India, it's the highest level of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like from the old ash I was smoking
when I was young.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a scientist in Israel that did a
study on 10 years of bust in Israel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moroccan, Lebanese, and Indian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was from the 1990 to the 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not too far from my time to be a
huge difference between what I was smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: in France and those busts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lebanese is basically a one-on-one CBD
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a pretty low level of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were seeing only, looking only at THC
CBD THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 4% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're telling me that the fucking red
Lebanese that I remember 45 years later
[SPEAKER_00]: was only 4% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's cracking me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moroccan is- Was it really getting you
stoned in those old days?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2 to 1 is a Moroccan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two higher percentage of THC than CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in India, it's basically 5 to 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot more THC, but like from the
mountains, the Charras is like 14% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: 14?
[SPEAKER_00]: 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like- But not the crème you made.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you make crème in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's not the greatest of the
greatest, it shows very much how much the
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage effect actually give power to
the ash we smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is no way I was smoking a
one-on-one 4% THC and still be raving
[SPEAKER_00]: about it so many years later, I dream to
smoke a red Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, there is no way that if it
didn't have that specific terpene profile
[SPEAKER_00]: that is so unique, you cannot even
describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, frankly, we made the Willys one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, we made the Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Willys, Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we only made like 3, 4 grams of it,
but super nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a super nice high and I don't think
there is much we tested it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot more THC than I thought,
but a lot of CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD is an active thing on a certain level.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going to call it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you use western words?
[SPEAKER_03]: Psychiatry?
What?
[SPEAKER_00]: I made ash 52% CBD, but I never tried them
until Milan a month ago when I was a
[SPEAKER_00]: judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the ash made from high CBD,
almost 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first time I smoked four spliffs in
a row in the morning, clean of high CBD
ash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait, four spliffs in a row?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Four in a row.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is science.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate your dedication here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: With tobacco and CBD, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ash, it was pure ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wake up in the morning, I have a
bunch of aches and pain and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never felt such a well-being-ness.
[SPEAKER_00]: A body release, but like, it's like a
curtain that comes slowly, slowly down
[SPEAKER_00]: your body and it's well-being-ness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a buzz, but it's a buzz of
feeling so good in your body, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a buzz per se, but it's like,
on the body it's got an amazing... Well,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's your cannabinoid system, your
endocannabinoid system that the CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: somehow comes in and like dances with and
it's just a sort of... And it's super
[SPEAKER_00]: pleasurable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, that's what Western science
always wants to isolate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, this does only this and this does
only that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about everything that's in there at
the point that it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fascinating because like before we
were just making ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in India, you just make ash and you
don't really know what's inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I learned what was a tricon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I learned what actually was the
cannabinoid and how they transform into
[SPEAKER_00]: each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now as an ash maker, I have the ability
to put a pure CBD ash on the market
[SPEAKER_00]: because I can transform the THC in CBN.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can manipulate cannabinoids because I
know them and because there is so much
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of having one type of ash,
now I have high THC ash and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: from one on one to 50 to one CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those ash is like it's a new territory
for an ash maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's pretty trippy what's... You
remember the first time you saw the
[SPEAKER_00]: tricon?
[SPEAKER_03]: Under the microscope you saw the tricon?
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time that was like... No,
seriously, this is a revelation when you
[SPEAKER_03]: see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a huge inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even on hash you see the tricon on my
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I remember the moment that I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know Mila in Amsterdam, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm in her shop, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And she knows Mila and all these people
from Manali and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm with Mila, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And she says, here, you don't know nothing
about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not marijuana, it's cannabis,
she says, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then she says, here, look at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like, wow, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You have these tricones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to realize there's this stuff there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We called that pollen before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like how can you understand what
you're doing if you don't understand,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't know the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: When for me all those years in producing
Contre, it was to make my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, so it was not a pastime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very, very, very special time
dedicated to my well-beingness for the
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't really serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became serious when I came here and it
became a craft where there is a product
[SPEAKER_00]: and the tool and there is nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew the tool a lot, but I was
totally ignorant on the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually working with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I became better because I know
the product I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now, instead of playing around with
a product, I have no idea what it is and
[SPEAKER_00]: tools that are adapted to a certain level,
but it's very local.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I could create my own tool because I
know more in depth what I'm actually
[SPEAKER_00]: working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a metal blacksmith.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give any blacksmith titanium to
work and he doesn't know the property of
[SPEAKER_00]: that new metal, he's going to do stuff,
but he's not going to be able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever he can do if he knew really all
the property of that metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would go to a place where everybody
works with that metal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: We came here to this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it's like if you ask a local,
why do you cure your flower for three to
[SPEAKER_00]: nine months in that room, the guys make
good resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you press your resin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it makes good ashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time it's like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they know it for a fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: They invented the game, but they cannot
tell you why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything they do, there is something
behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not getting there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting there in Mendo and Humboldt
of having enough time and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to really dial it, we got another
hundred years here at least.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of growing in the finest place.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because you have science on your side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like imagine a farmer that can have
the ability and the finance to analyze his
[SPEAKER_00]: soil before he plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every month during the whole season,
not only the soil, but the plant so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you know exactly what the plant is taking
from your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know before if it's going to miss
something before when you see it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's dead already.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if you do that with certain
genetics after three seasons, you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: shit load of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know exactly that osmosis that you
have with the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after about five years, I think you've
really dialed in your soil and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And your soil has become like more of a
huge part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's the health of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like with the science,
you can define why your plant is what your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is going to miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's taking a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's fucking huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know when you first realize that
the plant needs all these minerals,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs not only minerals though,
but it needs all these different microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs bacteria and fungi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how do you feed that, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you start experimenting with
compost teas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those compost teas become locally
sourced, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the compost tea you're putting on is
from your compost that you have,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of that, your worm bin that you
have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are now the ingredients that are
purely local that you put in, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but do you know exactly what your
compost tea do to your soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because you need to analyze your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to use a microscope to look at
the microbial life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you look at the compost tea with the
microscope before you put it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you do testing on your soil?
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you do testing on your soil?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first of all, I started doing
mineral testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the NANDRO NPK and all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you realize, wow, there's 14
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you know your plant needs molybdenum?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody know what molybdenum is,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it needs manganese and magnesium
and copper and sulfur and all these sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of things, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are all heavy metals, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And normally in regular commercial
agriculture, they deliver it as a salt,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're more easily absorbed in the
water when you water it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now if you want to do the regenerative
soil, then you don't use those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You make those ingredients with your
compost tea, which is like a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: say, comfrey in there, not comfrey,
but alfalfa you might put in there and you
[SPEAKER_03]: put in some worm castings and you put in
some compost and a few other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: What mineral is the alfalfa high in?
[SPEAKER_03]: Alfalfa is like four, two, one,
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alfalfa's got a fair amount of nitrogen,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you want to introduce the magnesium
or the manganese.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, a lot of things what people do
with that, because those are more
[SPEAKER_03]: minerals, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you get what is volcanic ash,
azomite, something like that, which has
[SPEAKER_03]: trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, see, that's the thing about weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weeds aren't weeds, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Weeds are something that thrives in that
environment, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can tune into what it's got.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some microbiologists that tell
you that you don't need to give anything
[SPEAKER_00]: actually to your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is in the soil, but you don't
have the microbial life to break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Hélène, she's called you all at the
living soil in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's called all the farmers and only her
can do it because she's a star and she
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't know her shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, she changed the way we look at
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are fucking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're so babysitting those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're so pushing what you give to those
plants that it's almost ridiculous to a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain level when she show you table of
everything that is available for you right
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just need to put microbe to break
it down so that you're having a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the trees that are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I have to go and set up
something to adapt your genetic to the
[SPEAKER_00]: condition of the place where they live.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for example, not putting back the
plant matter where the next generation is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to grow like it's done in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a big mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not leaving the seeds in the soil during
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a big mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you have such a diversity and the
plant are adapted, but they're still not
[SPEAKER_00]: local.
[SPEAKER_00]: Local because you don't give them the
chance to become really heirloom,
[SPEAKER_00]: to spend the winter to go through the
whole cycle, real cycle of a plant life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to create heirloom
genetics that are going to become
[SPEAKER_00]: really...
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to sacrifice the harvest though,
I think, to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because now there is extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite thing to watch is seeded
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not have the flower for the
market, but as long as you have that first
[SPEAKER_00]: tier of flower that is born and the
ability to get credit for the biomass that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't go to the flower market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that biomass, the credit of doesn't
matter if it could become a bloody
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate, a web pen, a bowl of ash or
anything, the credit should go to the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just going to put the flowers
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, anybody in the industry need the
farmer to thrive so that we can get the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very simple.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the source of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like if you don't have a farming
community that is thriving, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of the industry is not going to
really step in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, human civilization is built on
thriving agriculture, the way we have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our cultivation, our cannabis
civilization is built on thriving farmers,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we came here in order to learn from
each other and a situation which we had an
[SPEAKER_03]: isolation here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So nobody was bothering us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And seeds came in from all over the world
and people came in from all over the
[SPEAKER_03]: world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the progress that has been made in
genetics now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do have to say we owe a lot to the
indoor growers, too, who really figured
[SPEAKER_03]: out a lot of the science.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had to figure if there's nothing in
that, they got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had to figure out what does this
plant need.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we now have that data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it turns out to be just about what
every other plant really needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can dial it specific for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we really the whole basis of our
conversation is really about the place
[SPEAKER_03]: where you grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that place creates something very
special about the product from that place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember you telling me in the past
that every plant that we see on the planet
[SPEAKER_03]: originated in one particular place,
which is its terroir, its original home.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now through our interaction with
plants as humans, especially the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: plant, it's at home in many, many places.
[SPEAKER_05]: From South Africa to Alaska.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're trying to make it more at home.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to make it more an expression of
every place that it really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that we're now working on this
Appalachians project to try.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very controversial and a lot of
details about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the idea is to create areas of
recognition that this is a traditional
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis area around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were making fun of me five years
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, no, I was talking about it 10
years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no one even know what the word meant,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you think about an Appalachian
for some part of Afghanistan or from
[SPEAKER_03]: Manali, various things, they will have
protection as the guarantee of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, what you don't get, Swamy,
is like you cannot use the word
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protected international.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to be those quality standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have two choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you follow to the later the standard of
Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we're working with the state at
the moment, which has the legal
[SPEAKER_03]: requirement to create standards for
Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, because those American
standard are not Appalachian origin
[SPEAKER_00]: standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's American towards with the committee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you understand that?
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because you have two choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you do the Appalachian origin or you
create your own standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so all you have some things that is
valid worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would be a breakthrough for
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture in general in America,
or you need to create something that is as
[SPEAKER_00]: valid as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can be sure that the rest of the
world is going to follow those standard of
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have those two choice, but you cannot
use the word Appalachian origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be sued, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot use that word.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have or you play that game,
but you don't want to play it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you need to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you create your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a great path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you follow the path of what every
country in the world when they use the
[SPEAKER_00]: word Appalachian origin is because they
have followed to the later every standard,
[SPEAKER_00]: every limitation that give you that
ability to not only create that level of
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, but you cannot but improve that
level of quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to create your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be as representative as what the
French did for the wine, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be only for cannabis in that
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would create your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the wine industry did their own,
and they did a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it doesn't have the potential
protection of an internationally protected
[SPEAKER_00]: name, it's still very valid worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for you, you create your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to create something so fucking
valid that anybody that legalize is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to want to follow that because it's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's already someone in Florida who
wants to use the word humble.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like his fucking brother is
using Emerald and I was thinking Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: Square.
[SPEAKER_05]: Emerald Square.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, ah, ah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, ah, ah, ah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, ah, ah, ah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, ah, ah, ah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, ah, ah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, ah, ah.
