[SPEAKER_06]: inside the bag for the Extended period of
time there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want any of it to come out for
the first cycle Ten minutes and a hundred
[SPEAKER_06]: degrees second cycle is a hundred and ten
degrees for ten minutes and You just bump
[SPEAKER_06]: it up by ten degrees every time basically
So we're just now about to bump it up to
[SPEAKER_06]: 130 And at this point once it's at that
temperature I'll put a little bit more
[SPEAKER_06]: pressure on it It'll most likely hold in
place now So you'll start to see the bag
[SPEAKER_06]: wet up Sometime around the 20 minute mark
or so if you got no pressure on it If you
[SPEAKER_06]: see the bag wet up before that you got too
much pressure on and you're basically
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna waste some rosin So now that's my
timer I'll reset the timer
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is actually the 31 minute mark
basically we got it in 130 degrees Gently
[SPEAKER_06]: apply some extra pressure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really like this particular press the
Long's peak because you can really dial
[SPEAKER_06]: that Pressure in just one PSI at a time
[SPEAKER_06]: Lock it in place right there right around
five PSI now You get in real real tight
[SPEAKER_06]: here for extreme close-up You got you can
see that the bag is just now starting to
[SPEAKER_06]: wet up Little color little little wetness
to it
[SPEAKER_06]: Sit there we go extreme close-up extreme
close-up I Know that it's good actually
[SPEAKER_06]: zoom in on the part.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not trying to get it to the But you
get the idea It's very much there at this
[SPEAKER_02]: point when it's dripping I'll do it close
up and I'll hold it there Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually you want to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure how that could turn properly
It's kind of junky but it works Damn okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah
[SPEAKER_06]: Wayne's world Wayne's world Okay,
yeah, but it's uh you get it actually see
[SPEAKER_06]: a little Bit of moisture on the bag now at
this point on the parchment Six PSI Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's still pretty fucking slow and steady
at this point there's gonna be a lot of a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of waiting a Lot of thumb twiddle in
maybe some some song humming Well,
[SPEAKER_05]: I honestly I wanted to start it up because
I think that it is very interesting and
[SPEAKER_05]: just I think we pretty much got them
caught up most part it's like the main
[SPEAKER_06]: thing is just going slow and steady at the
beginning because I have went too fast at
[SPEAKER_06]: it before and the rosin all goops out and
You know, there's still THCA in that rosin
[SPEAKER_06]: that oozed out initially.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you basically didn't harvest the THCA
from that and Your first turpene layer
[SPEAKER_06]: will end up being not just turpene to that
point Well, that's a fun voice That's
[SPEAKER_06]: already as closed up as you can get it
apologize for the loud air compressor So
[SPEAKER_06]: it's my theory here that we're gonna end
up with the best yield of THCA that I've
[SPEAKER_06]: done in any of my previous experiences
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm imagining that the THC percentage
of this stuff I don't really know there's
[SPEAKER_06]: no On that sticker.
[SPEAKER_06]: There wasn't a percentage now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way to know but uh,
I'm imagining that the rosin is somewhere
[SPEAKER_06]: over 80 85 percent THC and with this
method being as effective as it is you're
[SPEAKER_06]: not really gonna lose any I have gotten
fairly low THCA yields in the past while
[SPEAKER_06]: using a lower quality rosin starting
product I'm imagining this time we're
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna have somewhere over 50% That's the
hopes So any other weed nerds in here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, we did have two people.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about weed nerds?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, when you actually do start to put
the pressure on you'll get a Very clear
[SPEAKER_06]: looking drip coming out of it That's the
turpene fraction there.
[SPEAKER_06]: The turpenes are more viscous than the
rosin itself So yeah, the first thing that
[SPEAKER_06]: you'll actually see who's out might end up
being an actual liquid drop.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure it's just a Place that's my
first time doing it with this high of a
[SPEAKER_06]: purity.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah Not sure what to expect with it,
but I've seen some shit come out before
[SPEAKER_06]: that literally just looks like You know
nectar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay but Yeah, the the first Couple that
come out Be like a higher Yield of
[SPEAKER_06]: turpenes that come out and then the ones
that come after that will be cleaner but
[SPEAKER_06]: lower yield and Those ones tend to be a
little more shattery We'll find out what
[SPEAKER_06]: we're gonna get today pretty much every
product And end up with a Different
[SPEAKER_06]: consistency Depending upon you know,
how it was stored what it was sprayed on
[SPEAKER_06]: it What it experienced in this life cycle,
which this rosin rancher seemed to Really
[SPEAKER_06]: optimize his growing environment.
Hmm
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably pretty fucking clean Well,
yeah a lot of times cleaner stuff will be
[SPEAKER_06]: a little more shattery or stable On this
I've noticed, okay I'm just bumping up the
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature a little bit higher again It's
140 now You can see that there is a good
[SPEAKER_06]: corner of Moisture formed but nothing's
actually squeezed out of the bag yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm Just at 7 psi now slowly creeping up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah Not really smelling it yet Yes,
yes there Yeah So this is technically
[SPEAKER_06]: mechanical separation process this is this
is what they call it mechanical Turpene
[SPEAKER_06]: fractioning or mechanical separation of
THC a We're gonna We'll do a little
[SPEAKER_06]: experimentation with mixing them back
together in a form of solvent free diamond
[SPEAKER_06]: and sauce
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see the other sides got wet
[SPEAKER_06]: So witnesses Yeah at this point it's
slowly starting to separate The the more
[SPEAKER_06]: viscous terpene layer will Kind of get
pushed away from the THC a layer so that's
[SPEAKER_06]: Essentially, that's the only thing that's
actually coming out of the bag His waxes a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit and some terpenes there like to
at some point it'd be really cool to check
[SPEAKER_06]: it out and see like You know what
percentage of THC is left in the terpene
[SPEAKER_06]: fraction and You know, obviously I have to
find out what the rosin was going in what
[SPEAKER_06]: the terpene fraction was and then what the
THC a Just to get an idea of how pure of a
[SPEAKER_06]: separation we're actually getting here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh Yeah, okay now you can really see it
starting to ooze
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, there's um Different ways we can
handle this at the end There's a most of
[SPEAKER_06]: the stuff I see in stores.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm has a pretty pretty dark tinge of
yellow To it That means that there's still
[SPEAKER_06]: a little bit of the terpene fraction left
in the THC a the more Times you repress it
[SPEAKER_06]: after we get the separation done.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can just keep repressing it at full
pressure and full heat 180 degrees and
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll just get cleaner and cleaner I had
one that I did that just was like
[SPEAKER_06]: perfectly clear crystal and another one I
tried I didn't go as hard on and It was
[SPEAKER_06]: still very amber colored.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm So it's up to you how you want to
play that I mean obviously you don't wanna
[SPEAKER_06]: Waste too much time in this situation
since you're already off work
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll just we'll do it at the what I
would consider to be like 75% of the way
[SPEAKER_06]: done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay If we keep going at it and keep going
at it make it add a whole extra half an
[SPEAKER_06]: hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah Yeah, 40 minutes on to the thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm and it doesn't Really change the
the purity that much.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't imagine Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's perfect Because what we just
really want to see is the diamonds and
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah kind of mixing it back into its own
rosin Anyway, I want to see I think it'll
[SPEAKER_06]: be crazy Cool The weights can go down each
time to each time you that it's okay
[SPEAKER_06]: separating out There's less in the terpene
or less in the THC a faction.
[SPEAKER_06]: So right Less each time there's just a
little more pure Do you think this would
[SPEAKER_05]: work on a larger scale or would you have
to like yeah Most definitely would you're
[SPEAKER_06]: wondering to a certain point though.
[SPEAKER_06]: I Don't think you could do like a full
plate full of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you can It just I feel like it could
end up being a lot more of a mess because
[SPEAKER_06]: with the Viscosity of rosin when you press
out a whole plate full it doesn't like
[SPEAKER_06]: just spill over the edges Whereas this
stuff if it's really viscous.
[SPEAKER_06]: It could just like drip down to the Inter
workings of the press there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why some people do the extra
parchment folds and get that Mm-hmm the
[SPEAKER_06]: directed flow and whatnot, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've actually had a lot of bad luck
with those causing the bag to slip around
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't see the bag properly to like
tell when it's ready for pressure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm Makes it way harder for me to not
blow out Yeah, totally I've kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: stepped away from the directed flow Okay
Particularly when it comes to making
[SPEAKER_06]: actual rosin almost impossible Low
pressure involved with this will be more
[SPEAKER_06]: forgiving Okay, it would be possible to do
it without blowing out Yeah, but it's
[SPEAKER_06]: really I mean sometimes it's hard to see
what you're doing when you do those
[SPEAKER_06]: directed flow pouches Okay And one thing
I've had problems with in the past is I
[SPEAKER_06]: get the Flow proper but then too much of
it still goes out in the back It causes a
[SPEAKER_06]: pressure buildup back there and that can
actually cause the parchment paper to
[SPEAKER_06]: explode Hmm in the on the backside Two
more minutes we'll bump up to 150 degrees
[SPEAKER_06]: and start putting real pressure on this
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the first good cycle full real
cycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah That's when we'll start to might have
a few drips Pulling out of here and I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: guaranteeing this stuff is gonna be super
clear.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm We've had some in the past that
came out they were like
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a terpene separation right there So
the
[SPEAKER_06]: later ones they start being smaller rippy
and more stable hmm, that's what these are
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay Yeah, so basically it's just climbing
to 150 degrees now Once it's there crank
[SPEAKER_06]: up the pressure until I start to see some
Action now we're over 40 minutes into it
[SPEAKER_06]: and the the THC is probably pretty well
bonded at this point and Not likely to
[SPEAKER_06]: accidentally use out Hmm now it's safer to
put pressure on mmm Timer started
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucked up and I cut this just a little too
short.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't mm-hmm clip it up to damn magnet
Move
[SPEAKER_06]: it right up to the edge of the plate since
it's so small and we'll go see otherwise
[SPEAKER_06]: See how incredibly viscous and clear that
liquid is yeah, that's what the first
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool you can see it pretty
well on your phone weed live Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: I smell it now
[SPEAKER_06]: And the grandpa mouth we brought the
grandpa mouth right out Yeah, you didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: miss a whole lot as I was saying earlier
John so the really slow process on this
[SPEAKER_06]: Start here, but it's starting to ooze up
pretty good now Just terpenes basically
[SPEAKER_06]: right there I Did my job all the THC a is
still in the bag, and that's just the
[SPEAKER_06]: terpene fraction losing out
[SPEAKER_06]: The strains you got running this time John
what you running?
[SPEAKER_05]: Deep purple golden goat Correctly if I
remember correctly, and I meant to ask you
[SPEAKER_05]: what what that golden goat is that's a
crazy sound straight.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't even heard of that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Am I right is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that you red jaw Okay, gotcha Oh an IT
working IT.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay golden girl go out deep purple and
raw cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah What's up sounds like a nice nice
harvest on your horizon there Fuck yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, I I remembered because of the golden
goat and the deep purple He said I have a
[SPEAKER_05]: great memory on the strains good Happen to
remember that but Frank does have a really
[SPEAKER_05]: good memory The golden goat that's an
interesting one though both of us have
[SPEAKER_05]: said that we never heard of that that
strain new to me So it's kind of a plant
[SPEAKER_05]: encyclopedia, so I was surprised to hear
him say it as well Yeah, I'm no plant
[SPEAKER_06]: encyclopedia, I'm just old
[SPEAKER_06]: That raw cook Fuck yeah, yeah,
is that more on the sativa?
[SPEAKER_05]: Deep purple is from so cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's badass man rip Yeah One thing
I've grown by him was that Apollo 13.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's cool But I know it was his at
least that was a while back too But now
[SPEAKER_06]: 150 degrees now We've been doing this for
about 45 minutes Just now starting to
[SPEAKER_05]: actually ooze out Hell yeah, you said yes,
it's a Steve a leaning hybrid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember for at least 60 to 70 day
finisher nice nice Yeah, I like those uh
[SPEAKER_06]: Pineapple sativas and some really good
pineapple tie once it was just fucking
[SPEAKER_06]: Bees knees I have nine exists But yeah as
Frank knows I'm not a biggest fan of free
[SPEAKER_06]: strains, but a couple of them every now
and then hit right oh I like those uh
[SPEAKER_06]: stinky foot, you know burnt rubber Diesel
fuels like those things that stink Like
[SPEAKER_06]: this GMO boy does it ever it's just so
funky I mean literally it's like You know,
[SPEAKER_06]: this is the only way to describe it in
word Pretty sure it's effectively
[SPEAKER_06]: descriptive of its funk aroma 160 bumping
temps bumping temps at this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're ready.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just go Blasting away at it with You
[SPEAKER_06]: know, it's not gonna blow up now we're
just gonna put the pressure on I'll be
[SPEAKER_05]: back in the chat in a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna use my camera Really brought the
grandpa mouth right out he says All right,
[SPEAKER_01]: we are at full blast At this point I'd
like to get a new partner swap partners
[SPEAKER_01]: out Oh boy
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's technically Turpin separation,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's just the turf later should be
fairly Low in THC compared to everything
[SPEAKER_06]: else.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I kept all the turps or all the THC
a in the in the back still, okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I said if you want to make a good
diamond and sauce you you mix this back in
[SPEAKER_06]: with that Okay, get multiple runs of this
after it cool off a little bit You can get
[SPEAKER_06]: hopefully get it off of the parchment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes they're a little more stale This
one looks like it's probably gonna be like
[SPEAKER_05]: straight up liquid So we got a Question
from job or 11 you said what strain had
[SPEAKER_05]: you guys press that had the best return?
[SPEAKER_06]: SFV or this GMO honestly this GMO because
it's six star we pressed it had a 77% from
[SPEAKER_06]: hash to Rosin, but we'll find out what the
yield is on Rosin CHC a in the past my
[SPEAKER_06]: highest yield on THC a was I Got like 20%
So it's usually like I said I get like 60%
[SPEAKER_06]: or something 50% maybe from hash to Rosin
and then out of that You know a 20% of
[SPEAKER_06]: that to go in the form of THC a the rest
of it comes out in the form of this Goopy
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff on the parchment paper But I'm
feeling like this is gonna be a much
[SPEAKER_06]: higher yield because of the actual
percentage of THC in the Rosin was higher
[SPEAKER_06]: This probably was 88 90 percent THC a
Rosin It's a from a traditional market
[SPEAKER_06]: source, so there's no testing info on it
But it is Pure let me tell you that gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: test to its purity There's like no
particles in there it shouldn't be in
[SPEAKER_06]: there so unless in my I can tell right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's already still really just goop
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's crazy Jar oh my goodness Wow that
is a Wow You can see it in there Wait at
[SPEAKER_05]: certain angles you can see that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a little pit strip of fucking
nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah right there It's clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amber.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks just like the milk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it was like his head Hmm
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, not Working off of the paper though
It's like way too viscous to get off the
[SPEAKER_04]: paper Doesn't stick to itself either huh
smell that Wow yeah, that's the whole
[SPEAKER_06]: garlic So That's crazy Usually like a lot
more shattery Hmm At least of that waxy
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of pliable material or you know you
can play with it kind of hmm.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just straight-up liquid So
[SPEAKER_04]: I freeze it I get it off that way
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow Too close to the light now
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'm hanging out at black oak ranch
Really good bands on the stage and you
[SPEAKER_06]: know Saturday night people are just doing
all that Saturday night stuff that they
[SPEAKER_06]: The band says something about man it
smells like somebody's cooking popcorn out
[SPEAKER_06]: there in the crowd Sure would like to
smoke some pop.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean eat some popcorn Then the security
guard comes over and he's like yeah some
[SPEAKER_06]: good smelling popcorn Can I have a bite?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like fuck yeah security guard enjoys some
popcorn and then Karen comes over.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like y'all can't do that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Kate Wolf Kate
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean that happened to a friend of mine
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we have a little bit more turps next
time or I mean sorry a little bit less
[SPEAKER_06]: turps each time after this now
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay Yeah, I don't know how well we're
gonna be able to do this song that was
[SPEAKER_06]: dying in the salsa Well pretty much what I
thought we're getting more in the form of
[SPEAKER_06]: THC a than sauce What I was thinking
originally also is like I don't know what
[SPEAKER_05]: the drone is from them But it's like it
looks like it's like whipped rosin that
[SPEAKER_05]: just has the diamonds in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I think it's really Rosin it's a
probably a proportion Of terpenes to Rosin
[SPEAKER_06]: to THC a and then whipped while heated oh
Jesus and then the diamonds added after or
[SPEAKER_06]: she's hard to say yeah, they're
proprietary tech is their own method it's
[SPEAKER_06]: hard to Recreate but they're there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like it's some form of those
combinations of things Heat whip
[SPEAKER_06]: Proportions of ingredients
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so now we're doing full pressure
full heat which is 170
[SPEAKER_05]: Allegedly the glove did not fit must have
quit
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll do another Swap
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not have inhalation relations with
that woman this marowinsky I'm getting my
[SPEAKER_01]: 90 scandals all mixed up hold on
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my mom's area buddy That's
[SPEAKER_01]: just the pure turkey weather like so
incredibly big it's like straight-up The
[SPEAKER_06]: parchment actually Like leave it on its
angle so it kind of pulls up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm All right now at this point it's
just cleaning up We'll just do this one
[SPEAKER_06]: more round and we'll call it at that
point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that would be a Hour and ten minutes
cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and then I Think we're just now at
an hour and ten minutes actually since
[SPEAKER_06]: it's 514 We started at four, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know Yeah Fuck yeah, so yeah any any
bit of time from here now isn't really
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna do much else except for just Change
the color of the THC a little bit Okay,
[SPEAKER_05]: very interesting so you think it comes out
darker as you keep going or it gets like
[SPEAKER_06]: it gets lighter So like I said right now,
there's still some terpenes stuck inside
[SPEAKER_06]: the bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm and Slowly over time you're gonna
push all of those out and then you'll just
[SPEAKER_06]: end up with a pure and pure THC a I meant
I guess the terpenes come out darker as
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, they actually get lighter too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah In my experience, it's just like less
of it each time, but it's like clear So
[SPEAKER_06]: that little bit of color that is there
isn't gonna be there in the next one,
[SPEAKER_06]: okay But yeah, it's probably not even
gonna be enough to actually collect it's
[SPEAKER_06]: just Pushing it a little bit further out
of the inner bag into the second bag at
[SPEAKER_06]: this point and then sometimes what I'll do
is I'll actually pull apart and then
[SPEAKER_06]: collect it all the THC out of there and
put it in a clean bag and then repress it
[SPEAKER_06]: again at this point and that gets like At
this point the bag is just being a sponge
[SPEAKER_06]: pulling the extra turps out of it that
would be in the THC a That's how you end
[SPEAKER_06]: up with the clearest most pure crystals
[SPEAKER_06]: For the sake of brevity, let's just call
it now in the middle of the cycle
[SPEAKER_06]: You see there's like I mean basically
nothing on the paper at this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: But each time you do that It just a little
bit comes out of there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I see so now This is the goods this
is the goods Be right back in the chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna be videotaping this So,
[SPEAKER_06]: like I said, it's like a sponge almost of
sorts, it's it's soaking up the terpenes
[SPEAKER_06]: at this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, pull them out of the inner bag The
inner bag will be a lot cleaner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh Shit, I busted out just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that's crazy looking though,
dude That is already pure white at this
[SPEAKER_06]: point.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's already like oh my god Pure oh my
goodness, dude So we're back from Columbia
[SPEAKER_06]: with our goods That's crazy looking that's
really nuts looks like the absolute pure
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we got the parchment teared out
figure out how much we actually harvested
[SPEAKER_01]: here Now there's on a piece of brown paper
you can probably see it better So,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah almost exactly 50% it's probably
[SPEAKER_06]: 0.47 out of one gram It is really here I
could have maybe not went as hard on it
[SPEAKER_06]: Just heat the press up to 190 degrees and
just let it sit there slowly over time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll get there, but it takes forever Holy
shit, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just found that it can do it that way
Now here's the cool thing
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's the coolest part about it this
is this is the It is the most stable THC
[SPEAKER_06]: I've ever played with my life At this
point once it's solidified into this
[SPEAKER_06]: crystal or this whatever glassy type deal
it takes over 200 degrees to reheat it So
[SPEAKER_06]: I could literally just sit there and hold
it my hands forever It'll never melt to my
[SPEAKER_06]: finger at all even without gloves on It's
like the most stable THC product I've ever
[SPEAKER_06]: seen This here still got some THC left in
it it's hard to get it all out but what I
[SPEAKER_06]: generally do with that is just like throw
it into a little bit of tea, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: let the hot tea soak it off That's good
enough, you know It's probably gonna end
[SPEAKER_01]: up with like a little bit left on there
