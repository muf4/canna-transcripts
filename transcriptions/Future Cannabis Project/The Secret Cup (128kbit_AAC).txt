[SPEAKER_16]: The event's been good.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think this is my favorite Secret Cup
that we've done out of all of them.
[SPEAKER_18]: Secret Cup is one of those special events,
you know.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a secret.
[SPEAKER_18]: You really can't tell people too much
about it, you know.
[SPEAKER_18]: Can't say none.
[SPEAKER_16]: This has been a dream of mine to be able
to do these events.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's super, super great to be able to
dream up something like this and then sit
[SPEAKER_16]: back and see it come to fruition like it
has.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was taking some scary ass risks.
[SPEAKER_08]: It really was.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the reward was great because it felt
like we carved out a little piece of the
[SPEAKER_08]: world and made it exactly how we wanted
to.
[SPEAKER_08]: For a little while.
[SPEAKER_11]: You put the flour in the grinder and you
crank it.
[SPEAKER_11]: In bed with Mary, you can find her in my
blanket.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got fire on my blazer, call it rise to
the occasion.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fat shatter patties, butter drying in the
basin.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't need no provocation to smoke.
[SPEAKER_11]: My occupation's the toke.
[SPEAKER_11]: Even though it's also making me broke.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come on, Barack Obama, gotta lend some
change with a stroke of a pen.
[SPEAKER_11]: Quit persecuting all it owes you,
supposed to defend.
[SPEAKER_11]: How to be taking tokes of the sour D.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hourly gone like a falcon on the balcony.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm tripping when I'm out of weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: I need a booter sack.
[SPEAKER_11]: That pre-98 bubba headband, the super
jack.
[SPEAKER_11]: Rolling never get far.
[SPEAKER_11]: Opening the fresh jar.
[SPEAKER_11]: Little Skywalker choking on the Death
Star.
[SPEAKER_11]: Spoiled braggart.
[SPEAKER_11]: E-Nail coil wrapper.
[SPEAKER_11]: Royal Shadow wrapper spitting hotter than
my oil spatter.
[SPEAKER_16]: The Seeker Cup is a cannabis judging
contest that puts the voting power in the
[SPEAKER_16]: hands of the people who know cannabis
best.
[SPEAKER_16]: The growers and concentrate makers
themselves.
[SPEAKER_16]: Most people already know that cannabis
grows from a seed, but the part of the
[SPEAKER_16]: plant we use for medicine comes primarily
from the oil in the trichomes which are
[SPEAKER_16]: formed on the outside of the flowers and
leaves.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hashish is simply oil extracted from the
flowers and leaves.
[SPEAKER_16]: Trichomes can be separated many ways.
[SPEAKER_16]: The oldest is to use a sifting technique
to separate the resin heads and make what
[SPEAKER_16]: is commonly called keith.
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the most popular extraction
techniques is to use low heat and pressure
[SPEAKER_16]: to simply squish the oil out of the buds,
keith, or water hash and make rosin.
[SPEAKER_16]: Water hash is made using a system of bags
filled with ice, water, and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: The contents are carefully stirred to
separate out the plant material from the
[SPEAKER_16]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_16]: Once properly dried and cured,
water hash results in a quality product.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hash oils have become one of the most
desired cannabis extracts to true
[SPEAKER_16]: connoisseurs.
[SPEAKER_16]: Usually made with common solvents and
involves a closed looped extraction
[SPEAKER_16]: process.
[SPEAKER_16]: Often called oil shatter wax or butter,
these products have proven both the safety
[SPEAKER_16]: and effectivity of cannabis as a universal
medicine.
[SPEAKER_16]: While the recipe is simple, the results
are amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: The Secret Cup is the only competition
where the extract makers are the judges,
[SPEAKER_16]: coming together as a community and sharing
techniques with their peers to advance
[SPEAKER_16]: their craft before ultimately deciding
whose entry is the international champion.
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess for me, the Secret Cup is many
things.
[SPEAKER_16]: It has become a way that I get to
celebrate with my friends.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we have a family.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice job, Keith.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I started making hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually a grower, been in the
industry since solidly 1998.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get like a lime taste.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good, but it's...
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just kind of low in taste.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got this inspiration by coming to the
Cup, to the Secret Cup in 2012.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I took last place, man, and it burned
inside of me like no other.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was around a bunch of guys that were
from my area that were probably like the
[SPEAKER_06]: best hash makers on the planet,
you know, like, and it just was super
[SPEAKER_06]: inspiring being around them and haven't
really looked back.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have been making hash since I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_14]: We would grow outdoor and because of the
climate and where we were at, we weren't
[SPEAKER_14]: getting very dense nugs.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so what we would end up doing is
hashing it because that was the only way
[SPEAKER_14]: we could make any money off of what we
grew.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's how it kind of started.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then it just progressed from there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I ended up preferring hash to flowers just
because it really lets me know where the
[SPEAKER_14]: terpene profile stands and where the
grower was at when he made his product.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it lets me know everything about
the grower, you know, just from the taste,
[SPEAKER_14]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, you know, that's why I prefer
hash.
[SPEAKER_14]: That and it's a health thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, less is more, you know,
when it comes to hash and you don't end up
[SPEAKER_14]: smoking flowers all day long, every day
stinking and wasting your time.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you take a dab and it's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite thing about the Secret Cup is
the friends and the people that have,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're all from different areas in
the country, but we can all keep in touch
[SPEAKER_03]: on the internet or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all share an unhealthy obsession
with dabbing, the culture that surrounds
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a real organic community
experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is done with a lot of effort,
a lot of love.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is something here that you won't
find in the corporate element of other
[SPEAKER_05]: events.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't really have that feel of people
trying to make money.
[SPEAKER_05]: It more or less has the feel of a
community trying to really become more
[SPEAKER_05]: tight knit and a group of purists trying
to really find the best product and the
[SPEAKER_05]: most healthiest product out there.
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Doug Drakeup and I own Hitman
Glass.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I also throw Chalice Festival.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big round of applause for Hitman Glass and
Chalice.
[SPEAKER_13]: Supporting Daniel and Jeremy and this
whole elaborate thing they've created.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've definitely been there from the
earlier stages, you know, attending a lot
[SPEAKER_13]: of their events.
[SPEAKER_15]: Events like this progress the movement
because really nobody else is doing
[SPEAKER_15]: anything like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We strive for perfection in our work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the Secret Cups, there's a little
bit more of a I don't know, like a
[SPEAKER_02]: brotherhood where we can talk about things
and share our tech rather than try to
[SPEAKER_02]: hoard it or keep it as like a secret
society or something like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: To me, the Secret Cup is my family,
not just my friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wherever we are, if you catch the vision
and you're part of it, then you're part of
[SPEAKER_08]: the family.
[SPEAKER_16]: And Hydro, just as an artist supporting
the Secret Cup with the Secret Cup anthem,
[SPEAKER_16]: it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: I know everybody loves it, so thank you
for the anthem as well.
[SPEAKER_18]: For me, it's really family, you know,
having all the people come together from
[SPEAKER_18]: all the different cities.
[SPEAKER_18]: Every Cup, it's something bigger,
it's something better.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's people helping each other out to get
the stuff on another level, you know,
[SPEAKER_18]: people aren't holding back the tricks
really much.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what's cool about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, like I said, family, family,
family.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're on film, dude, you're not
posing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we get to celebrate the things that we
love, the culture of cannabis concentrates
[SPEAKER_16]: and all the good things that we want to
see go further in the community.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like summer camp for Hashmakers.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like the best symposium we can come
up with.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's cool that the event kind of grew with
the movement, you know, and it grew with
[SPEAKER_13]: the times.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really developed.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's developed into its own beast.
[SPEAKER_13]: I go to all types of weed events all over
the world.
[SPEAKER_15]: All these guys are my friends and family,
really.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been attending almost every Secret
Cup since the inception, and I've also
[SPEAKER_15]: performed at several of them or hosted
others.
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been involved in one capacity or
another for a lot of the shows,
[SPEAKER_15]: but I can't take credit for any of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all definitely Jeremy and Daniels.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm really, really happy that we were able
to do the event here.
[SPEAKER_16]: In such an amazing venue, we were really,
really lucky to have the people that
[SPEAKER_16]: helped us last year kind of line it up.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's Steele, Danoli and the whole staff
here.
[SPEAKER_16]: Ron, everybody's been awesome.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would love to come back and do a lot
more here.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a certain joy that comes from
experiencing superior work.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's for the connoisseurs and it's for
the patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm really happy to give this award to
we actually took first place last year,
[SPEAKER_06]: so that was out of control for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love this, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, it's just to be around all my
brothers and sisters.
[SPEAKER_06]: I work a lot right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to get to enjoy this and be around
family and like, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bringing everybody together, you know,
it's somebody's cool house and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: hanging out and you're just chilling like
you're with your friends at home,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_14]: I like being able to meet people on a
one-on-one basis.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sometimes when you meet someone in their
booth, they're so riddled with other
[SPEAKER_14]: people and stress and everything that they
got going on.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's hard to get on a personal basis with
someone and really talk to them about
[SPEAKER_14]: their tech or what they're doing or where
they stand in the oil industry or even in
[SPEAKER_14]: the cannabis industry period.
[SPEAKER_14]: When it's a much more personal level like
this and you have a lot more time to hang
[SPEAKER_14]: out with everyone and hear where they come
from and hear their story, you meet a lot
[SPEAKER_14]: of great people from all around the world
that you never would have had the chance
[SPEAKER_14]: to meet.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, that's probably one of the
better things about the Nationals is that
[SPEAKER_14]: here in Vegas, you know, you have the top
three from every region around the world,
[SPEAKER_14]: essentially the 20 best hashmakers in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, to have them all sit down
at the same table and compare each other's
[SPEAKER_14]: stuff in and of itself is just making
history in the cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck yeah, I think we're the best,
you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe not me, but the group of people are
probably hands down the best, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a very lucky person.
[SPEAKER_08]: I get to travel all over the country and
now the world doing these competitions,
[SPEAKER_08]: bringing like-minded people together.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's such a joy to be able to experience
all these different places and all these
[SPEAKER_08]: different people.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't make a lot of money, but the
experiences we get in being able to go to
[SPEAKER_08]: the event ourselves that we want to go to,
even though we had to create it,
[SPEAKER_08]: is priceless.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the thing I'm most proud of in life.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank Hagrid for just DJing for
like two days straight.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Jeremy has a few thank yous too he
wanted to throw out there before we start
[SPEAKER_09]: announcing the winners.
[SPEAKER_16]: Myself and Daniel met at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was called Kind Meds.
[SPEAKER_16]: They were the premier dispensary for
concentrates in the Valley at the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I was growing up there was a definite
stigma against cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: My mother, she was a smoker and was
actually smoking until she was about five
[SPEAKER_08]: months pregnant.
[SPEAKER_08]: But my grandmother was definitely against
it, even though she owned a bar.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I moved from Arizona to California to
live with her, she broke it down for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, see that bench right there
in Blythe?
[SPEAKER_08]: Me and your stepdad smoked a joint there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And at first it was completely shocking to
me the fact that my mother smoked pot,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: But for the next five years I was living
with her and got very exposed to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I never really had a stigma
after I was nine years old.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it was just a part of regular
life.
[SPEAKER_16]: So there were no brand names or companies
known for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: There were strains that you'd heard about
like Maui Waui was this famous Hawaiian
[SPEAKER_16]: strain or Thai stick.
[SPEAKER_16]: When you're going to buy cannabis in the
old days, it was like good bud or bad bud.
[SPEAKER_16]: Cheap or expensive.
[SPEAKER_16]: There were not a lot of choices and it
wasn't the same every time you went back
[SPEAKER_16]: to the same person.
[SPEAKER_16]: Sometimes they would have this,
sometimes they would have that.
[SPEAKER_16]: You got a little bit of variety,
but they were limited in what they grew or
[SPEAKER_16]: who they were able to get from too.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we didn't have any of the brands here
in the United States.
[SPEAKER_16]: When you went overseas though,
they had seed companies and coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_16]: So certain genetics started to come from
people who had established themselves in
[SPEAKER_16]: Amsterdam and other places as seed
companies.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the strains they came out with would
generate recognition and those would
[SPEAKER_16]: become sought after as well.
[SPEAKER_16]: But even then from grower to grower,
the plants can be very different,
[SPEAKER_16]: even though it's the same genetics.
[SPEAKER_16]: And even from seed to seed of the same
strain, they can be very different.
[SPEAKER_16]: Your experience with cannabis was very
limited and very unique if you were even
[SPEAKER_16]: able to get some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_16]: So as cannabis grew and became more of a
mainstream thing, now you saw it was
[SPEAKER_16]: easier to establish and popularize a
brand.
[SPEAKER_16]: Then the change went away from the
emphasis being really the genetics and now
[SPEAKER_16]: it's more the brands with certain genetics
being associated with those brands.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was all in college for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: See, when I was 16 years old, I was living
in a foster home.
[SPEAKER_08]: I joined a Christian fundamentalist church
and was in there until I was 19 years old.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when I was 19 years old,
I decided that, you know, I met a girl and
[SPEAKER_08]: I decided I wanted to be with her and not
with the church.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I left it.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was this weird kid who was an
obvious stoner.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was about to cross the street and he was
crossing the street too.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was and we ran into each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was like, hey, can you try to buy us
some beer at the store above 19?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, sure, I'll give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I walk right in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I get us two 40s and come out and he's
like, hey, I want to roll up this blunt.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, do you want to smoke?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we go back to his apartment.
[SPEAKER_08]: He got one of those giant cigars and an
ounce of schwag, and he broke it all up,
[SPEAKER_08]: pulled the seeds and stems out and rolled
the fattest blunt, smoked half of it,
[SPEAKER_08]: slept on his couch like for two days.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just woke up and I think I've smoked
weed every single day since.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at that guy go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Lungs of steel.
[SPEAKER_10]: Afters fall off the stones and everything.
[SPEAKER_16]: Cannabis helped me socially tremendously.
[SPEAKER_16]: I wasn't one of the popular kids growing
up.
[SPEAKER_16]: And all I ever wanted was to just be one
of the cool kids.
[SPEAKER_16]: For the longest time, I did not embrace
being different.
[SPEAKER_16]: I saw it as a negative thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Growing up, not being part of the
in-crowd, knowing that I was different
[SPEAKER_16]: from everybody else, it was a struggle.
[SPEAKER_16]: As I smoked cannabis, I started to realize
that being different could be something
[SPEAKER_16]: really cool and really special.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was able to have this life that I
had dreamed about growing up and travel
[SPEAKER_16]: all over the world, do all these crazy
things.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was all because of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think for me, it was the entire
lifestyle of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I sold weed because I was a foster kid
that went straight into a university and
[SPEAKER_08]: lived on financial aid.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wanted to smoke and have fun and
live like the other college kids.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this afforded me the opportunity to do
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I liked about it the most is how it
just brought so many different people
[SPEAKER_08]: together.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you're 18, 19 years old, you have
these sessions where you have black
[SPEAKER_08]: people, white people, people from Korea
that are exchange students, people from
[SPEAKER_08]: Europe that are exchange students,
all together smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was really fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was really nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I felt like I was on the path to some
sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Something was coming.
[SPEAKER_08]: The idea for the secret cup came from a
trip that I took to California right after
[SPEAKER_08]: I won first place the Denver High Times
Medical Cannabis Cup for concentrate.
[SPEAKER_08]: It gave me a little bit of notoriety.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was doing well financially.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I took a trip all up and down the
coast.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I went to San Jose, I was hanging out
with a bunch of people that were part of
[SPEAKER_08]: this group online called Extract Artists.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were talking about cups.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we wanted to make the best event
possible.
[SPEAKER_08]: So one thing that we decided was we really
had to have qualified people judging it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we decided that the most
qualified people of all would be actual
[SPEAKER_08]: extract artists.
[SPEAKER_16]: The first secret cup, Daniel was throwing
it.
[SPEAKER_16]: When I went to cover the event at his
house, I realized he was overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I started helping out.
[SPEAKER_16]: Right away, being the person that I am in
the industry, I've been on a lot of
[SPEAKER_16]: different teams.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I can recognize something as truly
wonderful and truly special when I see it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I immediately recognized that the
secret cup was going to be something very
[SPEAKER_16]: special, that the people who were entering
were different.
[SPEAKER_16]: They weren't the typical people that enter
a lot of these other events.
[SPEAKER_08]: The idea came sort of evolved into the
actual competitors would be judging the
[SPEAKER_08]: people they were competing against.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the fact is, I wanted to make it
educational.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want everyone who competes to learn.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want them to see what's possible.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want them to see what they're competing
against.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they need to, just change what
they're doing to do better.
[SPEAKER_16]: The whole sentiment of the competition was
not the same.
[SPEAKER_16]: There was almost a level of sharing and
camaraderie that was part of this
[SPEAKER_16]: competition versus like a typical
competition was very segregated and
[SPEAKER_16]: tribal.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm versus you were enemies.
[SPEAKER_16]: But at the secret cup, people were sharing
ideas.
[SPEAKER_16]: They were talking about these concepts in
a different way.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was kind of to raise the bar for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of my legacy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I won a lot of prizes and contests
previously.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I find that I like giving out the
prizes even better than I like winning
[SPEAKER_08]: them just because it's fun to be able to
find new talent in something.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of the hash makers that are
doing really well today and making great
[SPEAKER_08]: products were not discovered by the secret
cup.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, that was the first contest
they ever won.
[SPEAKER_16]: When I saw that in Colorado at the first
secret cup, I told Daniel, I said,
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to do this in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_16]: Our community was.
[SPEAKER_16]: Potentially deeper and doing better work
than the work they were doing in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I wanted to showcase that right away.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I had been to the Amsterdam
cannabis cups many times.
[SPEAKER_16]: And a common sentiment when you're going
there from California is that you're not
[SPEAKER_16]: very impressed with the quality of
cannabis or the quality of hash or,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, the quality of a lot of the
products that are being entered.
[SPEAKER_16]: Some of it is definitely very impressive
if you're lucky enough to get introduced
[SPEAKER_16]: to that.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I came to Daniel and I said I
wanted to do it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then when he gave me the green light
to go ahead and do it, I took that ball
[SPEAKER_16]: and I ran with it.
[SPEAKER_16]: The big event in cannabis when I was
growing up was High Times cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_16]: And they would do that every year in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_16]: There was a part of the whole business
side that was really odd to me as a
[SPEAKER_16]: consumer at the time.
[SPEAKER_16]: When you're meeting these cannabis
celebrities and people you looked up to,
[SPEAKER_16]: there was all this beef that was going on
in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_16]: Adam from TH seeds.
[SPEAKER_16]: I heard refer to it as politics.
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems so ridiculous from the outside
looking in.
[SPEAKER_16]: These people were openly working in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: They were growing weed for a living.
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't this the most wonderful dream job
that anybody could have?
[SPEAKER_16]: But somehow they all had these little
chips on their shoulders to a certain
[SPEAKER_16]: degree.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was kind of this whole shady side
of the business.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you win a cannabis cup, you get to be a
judge.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I got to see behind the doors and see
that whole process.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the coolest part of the whole
experience was getting a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_08]: different weed, of course, and being
actually chilling in what was called the
[SPEAKER_08]: judge house at the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Felt really exclusive, you know,
hanging out with like Method Man and Red
[SPEAKER_08]: Man smoking weed with like famous people
is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, it kind of occurred to me
like coming from the perspective of a
[SPEAKER_08]: competitor.
[SPEAKER_08]: These people were just not qualified.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a few of us winners and then like
everybody else was just like buddies and
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff that had known certain staff members
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a lot of events right now and they
are a new thing for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_16]: The high times event is the one that's
been around for the longest time.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're all just figuring it out as we
go along.
[SPEAKER_16]: And different people have different core
ideals.
[SPEAKER_16]: Involved with when they're doing the
shows, you know, different people do it
[SPEAKER_16]: for furthering their companies or for some
vision that they might have.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think we have a really special place
that we come from where we're doing it
[SPEAKER_16]: because we've attended and done all the
other shows and we know what it is that
[SPEAKER_16]: we're missing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're trying to fill that gap for
people and show everyone how great it can
[SPEAKER_16]: really be.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you have people like our boy Brett in
Maine.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was the coordinator over in Maine and
he started doing his own event out there
[SPEAKER_08]: at the same venue that he found this like
cool little farm area and they have like a
[SPEAKER_08]: big barn where you can throw stuff in and
like the owner smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he started doing community bonfire
like two or three times a year.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'm very happy to inspire
something like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you have the people that we
inspired that only saw the Expo part of it
[SPEAKER_08]: thinking like that was the thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, our events like we're about like a
week or two weeks leading up to the actual
[SPEAKER_08]: public Expo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Public Expo was the award show that we
also had boost that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that wasn't the thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that was the end of the thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they saw they saw that and they were
like, OK, we if we find a venue and make a
[SPEAKER_08]: swap meet, people will come.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's good, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that is good, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is like, you know, the the lowest
aspect of it all, the the buying and the
[SPEAKER_08]: selling, not the hanging out, not the
community.
[SPEAKER_08]: You might have a DJ or comedian making
some jokes, but there's nowhere for you to
[SPEAKER_08]: sit.
[SPEAKER_08]: You walk around in a circle.
[SPEAKER_08]: You buy what you want.
[SPEAKER_08]: You go home.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's cool, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cool, too.
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, it started when high time
started coming around.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was like 2010, 2011.
[SPEAKER_14]: High time started coming to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_14]: The medical scene in California and in
Denver and Washington had had progressed
[SPEAKER_14]: to a state to where they could hold
competitions there.
[SPEAKER_06]: High times is a different thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just its own giant in itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and like I think this is more
like like the best of the best type of
[SPEAKER_06]: deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like, yeah, a lot of people
compete in that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is where we like really get to go
like this, you know.
[SPEAKER_14]: I started going to the competitions and I
had friends that owned different companies
[SPEAKER_14]: and I had helped them with different
entries and or entered my own stuff and
[SPEAKER_14]: just kind of progressed from there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I started to make a name for myself when
people started to see what I provided.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, it's kind of funny, you know,
what you find to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, for instance, Southern California,
if you go to LA, everyone has OG or grows
[SPEAKER_14]: OG and then you go to somewhere like
Denver or even the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's a lot of people who never even
tried it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, you know, you start to really open
your eyes to a lot of people out there and
[SPEAKER_14]: where they're at and where they stand.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then CBD started to happen.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I, you know, I started to try to
progress into CBDs and help as many people
[SPEAKER_14]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, when I started seeing when
I was I would go to a cup and have a booth
[SPEAKER_14]: and people would come up to me and say,
hey, man, you know, that last drop you
[SPEAKER_14]: made here at so and so, you know,
that really helps me with whatever ailment
[SPEAKER_14]: I have.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was that right there was my
motivation to continue with what I was
[SPEAKER_14]: doing and to go even harder and try to
help as many people as I could make money
[SPEAKER_14]: doing it and feel good about myself.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of people that work every
day and they make a lot of money,
[SPEAKER_14]: but they might not feel too good about
what they do for a living.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, like I don't have those issues.
[SPEAKER_14]: I feel great about what I do.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of people I help.
[SPEAKER_14]: Everything about their life and the people
that love them is better.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what pushes me forward.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's that right there.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what makes me want to help as many
people as I can and try to make sure that,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, everyone understands that,
you know, a lot of things have been
[SPEAKER_14]: purported a lot away.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, there's a lot of pharmaceutical
drugs that really increase problems
[SPEAKER_14]: instead of alleviate them.
[SPEAKER_14]: And CBDs is a way for people to really
change what's wrong with them,
[SPEAKER_14]: change issues that they're having and
alleviate symptoms and live a much better
[SPEAKER_14]: lifestyle because of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, it's just new.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just now coming forward.
[SPEAKER_14]: We just now have the science behind it.
[SPEAKER_14]: We just now have everything we need to
progress forward and and show people,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, the science is there.
[SPEAKER_14]: The more people that are helped,
the more people that lives are improved.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the more people that see that is the
change that we can make in the world.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, we got to start with ourselves
and hope that other people follow suit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely not my first Secret Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard about the Secret Cup a while ago
and then finally they came to the East
[SPEAKER_05]: Coast, the Secret Cup, East Coast when I
entered.
[SPEAKER_05]: I entered in as Debra Hachery Extracts and
got to meet all the good boys at the Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: The competition element of it is sort of
like it's like an American Idol of hash
[SPEAKER_03]: making.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now the award for highest Terps
surprisingly goes to a high CBD entry as
[SPEAKER_09]: well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Number 17, Gilded Extracts for Remedy Sap.
[SPEAKER_16]: For the highest Terps award.
[SPEAKER_16]: To compete in this event, each contestant
only needs to provide 20 grams of
[SPEAKER_16]: concentrate or 60 grams of flour,
evening the playing field for smaller
[SPEAKER_16]: producers.
[SPEAKER_16]: Their submission is broken down into
judges packs at intake and distributed
[SPEAKER_16]: just a few hours later.
[SPEAKER_16]: The competitors will have a week to sample
all the entries before the award ceremony.
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you excited to judge it?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_16]: They will score the entries one to two.
[SPEAKER_16]: 10 in various categories.
[SPEAKER_16]: Some places have more competitors than
others, but who will win is always a
[SPEAKER_16]: mystery.
[SPEAKER_16]: All that is known for sure is that the
competition will be stiff between these
[SPEAKER_16]: masters of the cannabis craft.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody in this competition knocked it
out of the park.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all there for a reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: They call it extract art for a reason
because it's people's art.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to say which one is better.
[SPEAKER_16]: I was an attendee always at the original
and the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam was the
[SPEAKER_16]: only event.
[SPEAKER_16]: You wait one year and you fly across the
seas and you got to go to one event a year
[SPEAKER_16]: in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_16]: And now we're here.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's all kinds of events and it's all
changing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it's really, really great.
[SPEAKER_16]: When High Times started doing their events
in the United States, they were now
[SPEAKER_16]: allowing the booths to sell cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually a few other events did this too
on a smaller scale, but High Times did it
[SPEAKER_16]: really big.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I remember going to that event and
thinking, oh my God, this is really new
[SPEAKER_16]: and different from even the Amsterdam
events.
[SPEAKER_16]: It still wasn't as cool.
[SPEAKER_16]: As that experience really, but it was the
best we got so far for the US.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm one of very few people that got my
love for events by going to events and
[SPEAKER_16]: being inspired and building these
friendships.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's really unique.
[SPEAKER_16]: And most of the people that are involved
in them now never spent a dollar to just
[SPEAKER_16]: go to enjoy the event without promoting
some business or something entirely
[SPEAKER_16]: business related.
[SPEAKER_16]: Growing up not being part of anybody's
tribe, feeling like you're an outcast and
[SPEAKER_16]: very different, then you go to this event
and there's all these different kinds of
[SPEAKER_16]: people, but they're somehow like you.
[SPEAKER_16]: And you start to feel like, it's okay to
be the way that I am.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like these things that I like.
[SPEAKER_16]: And in fact, maybe I'm going to get more
into it.
[SPEAKER_16]: Start enjoying these things in a more
celebratory way, not just in the shadows.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that shouldn't be something that you
get only once a year in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_16]: When events started to happen in
California, I was all for it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I wanted to support all of those
events and see where they went.
[SPEAKER_16]: But for High Times, there was a stigma
that followed their competition.
[SPEAKER_16]: Over in Amsterdam, people had started to
say that the competitions were fixed.
[SPEAKER_16]: I can say the winners were not the
authentic best in the competition.
[SPEAKER_16]: So how were they winning?
[SPEAKER_16]: These big companies, obviously people
thought they were paying or cheating in
[SPEAKER_16]: some sort of way.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have enough experience now that I
can say that's not true.
[SPEAKER_16]: May have happened, but it was marketing
that was mostly winning the events because
[SPEAKER_16]: it's much easier to convince people that
you have the best than to authentically
[SPEAKER_16]: produce the best.
[SPEAKER_16]: And High Times got a bunch of bad press
just because of the way their competitions
[SPEAKER_16]: worked.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was all about building your brand
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these people would, like some of the,
a lot of the attendees were fans of these
[SPEAKER_08]: hash makers.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they'd go out and they'd actually be
able to meet them and dab their personal
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff and like form personal connections
with these brands that, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: sometimes they had, they'd already been
supporting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes that they had just seen and
really wanted to try.
[SPEAKER_13]: This event, I'm all about having each
event have their, have its own unique you
[SPEAKER_13]: know, terms or, you know, judging rules or
whatever, you know, like every event I
[SPEAKER_13]: liked that it's its own thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this clearly wasn't just like
regurgitation of High Times or anything
[SPEAKER_13]: like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was its own unique thing from the
get-go.
[SPEAKER_13]: And like knowing Jeremy and Dan,
I know they just really care about hash
[SPEAKER_13]: and you know, like they're very caring
people.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jeremy helps me with Chalice, you know,
the Chalice Festival and he does it for
[SPEAKER_13]: the community and he does it because he
cares, you know, and that's what I love
[SPEAKER_13]: about these two guys, you know,
and they really, they're, it's from the
[SPEAKER_13]: heart.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a really good mix of people who
compete and everyone kind of works
[SPEAKER_16]: together to make the Seeker Cup happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasted to taste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about the taste.
[SPEAKER_16]: And people bring all these great things to
the table.
[SPEAKER_16]: They, they, for free, you know,
they'll give their product or something
[SPEAKER_16]: from themselves and just to make it better
for their city or the other people that
[SPEAKER_16]: are attending.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so that's probably the thing that's
the same.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's amazing that we are able to find
these really unique and helpful people in
[SPEAKER_16]: every city that make it possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's the bond with like the
brothers that we have here with all the
[SPEAKER_06]: hash makers and the knowledge that
actually is being spread amongst us now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And well, like I said, 2012 was a lot
different where people were, I think,
[SPEAKER_06]: scared to give their technique out and all
these things because of business,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and now everyone I think is
getting it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's a lot of business and man,
we can all teach each other and maybe grow
[SPEAKER_06]: from this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at least that's where my mindset is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't really speak for everyone else,
but I feel like if you want change,
[SPEAKER_06]: right, then that has to be within
yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I really want something to be
different, then I need to change it from
[SPEAKER_06]: right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw it as a networking event.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people saw it as a party.
[SPEAKER_08]: But this was like high level networking
that was like causing lanes to open up all
[SPEAKER_08]: over the country.
[SPEAKER_16]: When we developed the event, we tried to
think about the things that we didn't like
[SPEAKER_16]: that weren't just personal opinion things
that we didn't like about the other
[SPEAKER_16]: events.
[SPEAKER_16]: We tried to think fundamentally what was
wrong with them.
[SPEAKER_16]: If we could improve the fairness,
we wanted to make sure we could make them
[SPEAKER_16]: more accurate representations of what our
culture is really about.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've entered a lot of high times cups.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've entered a lot of different
competitions.
[SPEAKER_14]: What always ends up happening is nine
times out of ten, they hire someone like
[SPEAKER_14]: Wiz Khalifa or Snoop Dogg, the judge,
and he doesn't know a thing about growing.
[SPEAKER_14]: He may know what Weedy likes and what
Weedy doesn't like, but he doesn't know
[SPEAKER_14]: anything about growing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so you get a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_14]: And like, for instance, it's a lot harder
to take a 16 week sativa full all the way.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cure it properly and have it be dense,
hard, resinous.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a lot harder to do than it is to
grow cookies at eight weeks, which frosts
[SPEAKER_14]: up for everyone.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, there's a lot of things that
aren't taken into consideration because
[SPEAKER_14]: the people judging aren't hands on.
[SPEAKER_14]: When it comes to the secret cup,
everyone judging is also entering.
[SPEAKER_14]: So they do this on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_14]: They understand what to look for.
[SPEAKER_14]: They understand what not to look for,
what they like, what they don't like.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it reflects in the judging,
you know, nine times out of ten.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, when you look at the people that
win first, second, or third place,
[SPEAKER_14]: they deserve to be there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's that says something about the
competition in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_16]: So when we were first doing the events,
we had really a lot of support from
[SPEAKER_16]: everyone in the industry.
[SPEAKER_16]: So the well-known brands were entering the
well-known hash makers.
[SPEAKER_16]: All the biggest companies wanted to be a
part of it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then as we started doing the events
and they couldn't even place in the top
[SPEAKER_16]: three, you started to realize these big
brands had a lot to lose.
[SPEAKER_16]: By entering these competitions with these
smaller, more passionate growers and hash
[SPEAKER_16]: makers.
[SPEAKER_16]: And they were universally defeating these
big companies at every event in every part
[SPEAKER_16]: of the country, even internationally.
[SPEAKER_16]: When we did our events in Spain and in
Amsterdam, both times people from the UK
[SPEAKER_16]: traveled there and won the events.
[SPEAKER_16]: And there's no medical cannabis in the UK.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's no legal cannabis of any kind in
the UK.
[SPEAKER_16]: So these people are risking their lives.
[SPEAKER_16]: And when they would show up at the event,
they reminded me of all of our people in
[SPEAKER_16]: California.
[SPEAKER_16]: They were at that level.
[SPEAKER_16]: And you're going to start to see that as
cannabis becomes more open.
[SPEAKER_09]: Without you guys in the community,
we would not be able to throw an event
[SPEAKER_09]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: So give yourselves a big round of applause
for being part of the 710 community.
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember when we first started throwing
them, we would put really, really,
[SPEAKER_08]: really long tables with power outlets
underneath the tables and set them up and
[SPEAKER_08]: throw out candy and waters and stuff for
people just to go at it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We could have made so much more money.
[SPEAKER_08]: They wouldn't have remembered it the rest
of their lives.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the people that got to go remember it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why I wanted a secret cup here in
DC.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been traveling forever outside of
DC going to cannabis cups, going to
[SPEAKER_05]: events, going to the West Coast where it's
really three times ahead of where we're at
[SPEAKER_05]: because you have the temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have the ability for people to flex
that experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted to see how that would happen
over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just as I kind of saw it in my head,
first out of DC, most of the things that
[SPEAKER_05]: you saw were just fairly OK and homegrown.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted people to understand that there's
more out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's gold oils.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are trees that look like Christmas
tree dusted in snow.
[SPEAKER_08]: The secret cup was like a party that made
you feel exclusive just because you were
[SPEAKER_08]: there.
I got
[SPEAKER_12]: it.
I mean,
[SPEAKER_18]: it was something different than the high
times events, which I'd been to and I'm a
[SPEAKER_18]: fan of.
[SPEAKER_18]: I enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_18]: But this was another level.
[SPEAKER_18]: You had a lot of the people that came out.
[SPEAKER_18]: There were smokers that they just wanted
to, you know, they just wanted to smoke
[SPEAKER_18]: weed.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they weren't really about the higher
end of things.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's where the secret cup came into
place is that that's where it gave a place
[SPEAKER_18]: for people that were interested.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's where I got into that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I asked Dan if I could, you know,
put together a song for him.
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to do a top shelf song for
appreciation.
[SPEAKER_18]: And he said, no, I got this secret cup
mixtape that I wanted to put out.
[SPEAKER_18]: So you should do a song about the secret
cup because we're about to start doing
[SPEAKER_18]: them in other cities and expanding.
[SPEAKER_18]: So so I ended up putting together the
secret cup anthem.
[SPEAKER_18]: I came out to Denver for the finals and I
had two verses done in the hook and I
[SPEAKER_18]: wrapped it for Dan and Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're like, oh, this shit is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll put together the third verse.
[SPEAKER_18]: After the event, from the experiences.
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's really what it is.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just the songs are all like a story
of my life.
[SPEAKER_18]: So this was what that was.
[SPEAKER_18]: It was just documenting my times at the
secret cup.
[SPEAKER_18]: And especially that third verse was just
like soaking up that finals event.
[SPEAKER_18]: Mortimer out there rocking her belt,
that energy of everybody in the place,
[SPEAKER_18]: just having a great time.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's always peaceful.
[SPEAKER_18]: There's never problems at the events.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just being around so many like minded
people, so many people that are into the
[SPEAKER_08]: same thing you are that appreciate the
same things you do.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not just it's not just the hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's it's everything else,
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all the trappings of the culture,
intense love of glass art that everybody
[SPEAKER_08]: shares, the chance to meet people that are
actually making medicine, the chance to
[SPEAKER_08]: meet people that are actually making the
glass art.
[SPEAKER_16]: So when we were doing the secret cup,
one of the things that I wanted to
[SPEAKER_16]: incorporate into it were some of the
stereotypical things about cannabis that
[SPEAKER_16]: go along with the whole culture.
[SPEAKER_16]: I myself, I believe really strongly that
cannabis and art are really closely
[SPEAKER_16]: connected.
[SPEAKER_16]: You've all heard stories of this musician
talking about cannabis influencing their
[SPEAKER_16]: art.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we wanted to incorporate some of that
into the secret cup.
[SPEAKER_16]: We had live glass blowing at almost all of
the events and glass blowing for me is a
[SPEAKER_16]: really important part of the culture.
[SPEAKER_16]: For a long, long time, head shops were the
main meeting point for stoners.
[SPEAKER_16]: When you got in trouble, a lot of times
that was your only opportunity to still be
[SPEAKER_16]: in the cannabis industry in some sort of
way.
[SPEAKER_16]: You could work at a head shop and that was
OK.
[SPEAKER_16]: The glass aspects of cannabis has been one
of the things that pushed the culture
[SPEAKER_16]: forward.
[SPEAKER_16]: So glass was very simple in the very
beginning.
[SPEAKER_16]: And as it has innovated and become more
intricate and more diverse in the colors
[SPEAKER_16]: and all the different things, it's pushed
the whole culture forward in a classy and
[SPEAKER_16]: really respectable way.
[SPEAKER_17]: The first secret cup I did was the first
one they did in California.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I mean, that's one of my favorite
memories blowing glass live because I've
[SPEAKER_17]: done it before.
[SPEAKER_17]: But for head shop owners and they
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_17]: But this was a crowd of like virgin eyes.
[SPEAKER_17]: For that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: So you had a whole bunch of people just
staring at you.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I mean, I remember the event.
[SPEAKER_17]: The crowd was at the glass demo.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, that was where the most of the
people that attended the event,
[SPEAKER_17]: they had music going on and the vendor
booths with the different hashes and
[SPEAKER_17]: flowers and things to buy.
[SPEAKER_17]: And people were buying for sure.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure it was a lucrative event for
them.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I just remember seeing this really big
crowd of people that were all focused on
[SPEAKER_17]: us taking pictures and videos.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I see the pictures from that event.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I mean, it just looks cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: We were blowing glass in front of this
huge graffiti murals on these train tracks
[SPEAKER_17]: that were defunct.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I mean, we were literally set up on
the train tracks and the pictures are just
[SPEAKER_17]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: It wasn't a huge area.
[SPEAKER_17]: So the crowd looks tight.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it looks like there's a lot more
people there that may have been there,
[SPEAKER_17]: but it was still a really large crowd.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super huge fan of glass blowing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew up around some really amazing glass
blowers that I'm like, in a way baffled
[SPEAKER_06]: that they're not taking advantage of all
this, like what's going on around them,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of them have money and some of
them are growing, whatever else.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just I felt like they're like
missing out on this like huge opportunity
[SPEAKER_06]: in the glass world right now.
[SPEAKER_16]: And growing up, like even before I was
really deep into the scene, like you would
[SPEAKER_16]: buy glass pipe that you liked at a head
shop or somewhere.
[SPEAKER_16]: It would have a special meaning to you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Because you would take it around
throughout your life and you would have
[SPEAKER_16]: all these special moments that you shared
with this piece and with other people.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it became kind of part of your whole
journey.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then when you would break it,
it was like a loss.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a real tragic loss.
[SPEAKER_16]: You would maybe buy a new piece or
something like that, and it would start a
[SPEAKER_16]: new journey.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was something that, you know,
became really special.
[SPEAKER_16]: And as I learned more and more about
glass, you know, I think that that is
[SPEAKER_16]: something that's underappreciated.
[SPEAKER_16]: People kind of don't even realize that
they have this relationship with their
[SPEAKER_16]: glass pipe or their glass bong or whatever
it is.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I think that it concentrates had a
big role on how glass manufacturing has
[SPEAKER_15]: been changed.
[SPEAKER_15]: You've watched, you know, pieces go from
being the four foot bong to being the four
[SPEAKER_15]: inch rig.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very hard to walk into a head shop
and find a piece that has a downstem for a
[SPEAKER_15]: flower bowl now.
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything's got a male ground joint for a
dome or a domeless nail.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's been interesting to watch it
evolve.
[SPEAKER_15]: And obviously, the Internet's had its role
in that by giving everybody the immediate
[SPEAKER_15]: access to information where it would
normally take words out of mouth a long
[SPEAKER_15]: time to spread geographically.
[SPEAKER_15]: The Internet allows it to just spread like
overnight.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is what's putting us,
the hash makers and all that, kind of in
[SPEAKER_06]: the forefront.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like we're piggybacking off each
other because they go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this revolution is like, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Glass had to change when the kind of hash
that we smoked started to turn into a
[SPEAKER_16]: liquid.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so the tools, that were being used
originally, became much more diverse.
[SPEAKER_16]: And when we entered the cannabis cup,
we were entering with one of the very
[SPEAKER_16]: first dabbing tools that were out there.
[SPEAKER_16]: And as time progressed, those tools have
become so innovative that that original
[SPEAKER_16]: tool is basically obsolete.
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody uses it anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just hitting it purely off the titanium
device.
[SPEAKER_08]: All you were getting was that oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was getting vaporized super quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not setting it on fire.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're just getting it so hot that it
changes from a plasma to a gas.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you inhale it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it bypasses your, what is it,
the blood-brain barrier and just instantly
[SPEAKER_08]: high.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the thing is, it's really easy to,
you know, sort of regulate your dosage
[SPEAKER_08]: too.
[SPEAKER_17]: When dabbing came onto the scene,
it really, it changed everything.
[SPEAKER_17]: It gave us artists a new outlet to make
things because now we're coming up with
[SPEAKER_17]: entirely new accessories that haven't been
thought of before.
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.
[SPEAKER_17]: So this right here kind of changed
everything for the glass industry.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is dabbing.
[SPEAKER_17]: What this is is concentrated THC oil or
hash oil.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we're heating up this nail,
which is native quartz on one of our glass
[SPEAKER_17]: rigs.
[SPEAKER_17]: We get this nail nice and hot.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no combustion.
[SPEAKER_17]: You're not burning any plant material at
all.
[SPEAKER_17]: The first time I saw someone take a dab,
I was at Mer's house and he's since passed
[SPEAKER_17]: away.
[SPEAKER_17]: But he was a well-known glassblower in our
industry.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I showed up at his house and I see
this torch in this rig just like that,
[SPEAKER_17]: except we had titanium at the time and it
was a swing.
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're heating it up and taking dabs.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm like, oh my gosh, are you guys
doing drugs here?
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, that's what I was thinking
because, you know, I never associate
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis with that kind of thought,
but yeah, I didn't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_17]: They explained to me the process.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I mean, it's like a whole different
way to consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_17]: And now we have a whole different line of
things we need to make.
[SPEAKER_17]: We made these like swings.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was basically a funnel that was bent
and you'd sell these swings like this to
[SPEAKER_17]: other companies and they would wrap them
with metal.
[SPEAKER_17]: In fact, this is one that was one of the
first companies that kind of marketed the
[SPEAKER_17]: swings.
[SPEAKER_17]: They asked me to make and I did pattern
work ones.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I did these sculpted ones and
looking back, I mean, these are really
[SPEAKER_17]: rough.
[SPEAKER_17]: But what they were doing was wrapping this
titanium pad around the swing,
[SPEAKER_17]: around the glass and calling it a swing
because it swings back and forth.
[SPEAKER_17]: So you'd heat this up and once it was
glowing, you'd swing it back down and get
[SPEAKER_17]: your dab ready and you just drop it.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's what this little opening was
for.
[SPEAKER_17]: So you could get your dab tool in there
and vaporize it and you don't see very
[SPEAKER_17]: many people using the swings anymore.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, every now and then I probably
make one a year.
[SPEAKER_17]: Someone will hit me up and they want like
a classic rig.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we started making the swings and then
nails came out and domes and that's a
[SPEAKER_17]: whole thing that's like come and gone.
[SPEAKER_17]: Like that time, it's weird because it's
still so new, but there's trends that have
[SPEAKER_16]: come and gone.
[SPEAKER_16]: And now everyone uses some form of a
banger and even those are becoming a
[SPEAKER_16]: little different and taking on different
shapes.
[SPEAKER_16]: And cannabis in general is just a very
fast moving, innovative business.
[SPEAKER_16]: The thing that is popular this year might
be completely obsolete by the end of the
[SPEAKER_16]: next year.
[SPEAKER_16]: So you have to stay on top of it really,
really all the time.
[SPEAKER_16]: And having these events in all the
different cities, that helped us to
[SPEAKER_16]: constantly be on the pulse of where
cannabis was going.
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, the rigs and the dab scene is
big.
[SPEAKER_17]: So a lot of the more higher end pieces are
going to be styled and engineered to do
[SPEAKER_17]: dabs.
[SPEAKER_17]: Whereas a lot of the flower pieces are
made differently.
[SPEAKER_17]: They have a different way the diffusers go
in and things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because, you know, without the
dabbing rigs, like I said, in 1999 we were
[SPEAKER_06]: making oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: There wasn't no dab rigs then though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we were pouring that shit on buds and
like killing our throat and lungs and it
[SPEAKER_06]: was a horrible way to do oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some people tried to hot knife it and
stuff, but I just think that that's,
[SPEAKER_06]: like I said, it's piggybacking off each
other.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like a, it's a beautiful dynamic,
you know, like it's future.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's what it is, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think vaporizing the oil and stuff is
the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like no more smoking the flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love flowers to death, but I just
really feel like vaporizing, even
[SPEAKER_06]: vaporizing flower, I guess, is better than
not, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think dabbing is still the future,
dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's all these youngsters that want to
be a part of it still, like haven't got to
[SPEAKER_06]: experience all this, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now these certain states are becoming
21 years of age to partake.
[SPEAKER_06]: These kids are like, wow, I can't wait to
be 21.
[SPEAKER_08]: People need to see that the stuff,
if it's made properly, it's not dangerous.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in fact, can really approach like
connoisseur grade, levels.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want people to know what's possible,
like the magic that you can get out of
[SPEAKER_08]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want people to know how to smoke it,
know how to judge the quality of it,
[SPEAKER_08]: have better access to meds wherever
they're from.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want all that stuff to happen.
[SPEAKER_16]: So when you attended a secret cup,
a lot of times you're being exposed to the
[SPEAKER_16]: next new trend in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: People would show up to the secret cup and
sometimes they would have worked on
[SPEAKER_16]: something for like, you know, maybe a year
long and they'd have this wonderful story
[SPEAKER_16]: of the plant that they grew or where their
concentrate came from.
[SPEAKER_16]: Sometimes it was like a new technique.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I've even had, you know, my eyes
opened on things that I didn't think were
[SPEAKER_16]: possible.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like I've had an alcohol extraction oil
that was phenomenal tasting.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, there's just been numerous
things that even me as somebody who had
[SPEAKER_16]: experienced quite a lot in cannabis,
I constantly am having my eyes open to new
[SPEAKER_16]: things.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I love that about the secret cup,
the innovation, the real innovation,
[SPEAKER_16]: because people that were into that whole
part of the events, the secret cup was the
[SPEAKER_16]: kind of event that attracted a true
cannabis connoisseur, somebody that had
[SPEAKER_16]: really learned the history and a lot of
people that were doing really,
[SPEAKER_16]: really cutting edge innovation.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I love about these two guys,
you know, and they really, it's from the
[SPEAKER_13]: heart, you know, and that's, I feel a
little more rare, you know, in industry
[SPEAKER_13]: events or whatever, that it's from someone
from the movement, from the industry,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's from, you know, the soul.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think everybody notices that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the energy the event has now,
it means something to win the event.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if I don't win for a second or third
or anything, at least I got to present
[SPEAKER_14]: myself and my side of the story and show
people maybe something that they haven't
[SPEAKER_14]: had the opportunity to try.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, that's a win to me.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, winning, actually winning,
that would be a large statement to where
[SPEAKER_14]: the cannabis industry is progressing and
how much extract artists care about
[SPEAKER_14]: quality, clean meds.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because when you enter a solvent-less
entry, it's zero PPM, zero, it's zero,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, solvent, there's no,
nothing that can harm you.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so when you have something as loud as
my entry and as flavorful as my entry,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, and have them recognize that,
recognize what it is as a medicine and
[SPEAKER_14]: vote for me to win, that would be probably
one of the highlights of my life.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd be really stoked, not just for myself,
but for the cannabis industry and where we
[SPEAKER_14]: stand as extract artists.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want it to get big.
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of the other events, their goal is
to get bigger and make more money.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's never been my goal.
[SPEAKER_16]: My goal has been to provide the best
experience for the people that attend the
[SPEAKER_16]: event.
[SPEAKER_16]: And as we've done the events, I know where
we're lacking and I know where we're
[SPEAKER_16]: strong.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just want to focus on those kinds of
things and bring to the people some more
[SPEAKER_16]: of the experiences that they're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's one of the hardest things is the
budget that we're facing.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I believe that people see what we're
trying to do now and that's going to open
[SPEAKER_16]: the doors to a much greater experience for
all the people involved.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really excited that, you know,
I think the face of the secret cup is
[SPEAKER_06]: changing a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the more knowledge, the more things
that are like this, we get to express it
[SPEAKER_06]: to each other, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really want to break new ground.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I like to do different things with the
events.
[SPEAKER_16]: If I keep getting caught up in the same
pattern, a lot of times that can be not so
[SPEAKER_16]: fun, you know.
[SPEAKER_16]: The other thing is I want to see everybody
happy and I want to push the education.
[SPEAKER_16]: So this message that we've got,
I want to get to everyone.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's difficult, you know, we don't
have the platform to speak just yet.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're slowly building, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would recommend it to anybody who's a
connoisseur or someone who strives to know
[SPEAKER_02]: what real medicine in the cannabis
community is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people that try to pass
off, you know, no grunt or these other
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of what high quality things should
be when they're really not anywhere close
[SPEAKER_02]: to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the competitors are a good example of
what the perfect concentration traits or
[SPEAKER_02]: what we strive to have should be like and
what real medicine should be for people
[SPEAKER_02]: that need it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I think that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The goal was to make it a part of regular
life and we were successful and it is now.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what was special was the fact that we
were on the fringes, on the front lines,
[SPEAKER_08]: making something happen for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that there was risk involved and that
was exciting.
[SPEAKER_16]: There have been a number of times in my
career in the cannabis industry where I
[SPEAKER_16]: almost had to pinch myself, where I'm
like, think about what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Think about where you are.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, the only way I could compare it is
it's like having like a rock star
[SPEAKER_16]: lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_16]: You're like traveling to these strange,
unknown places.
[SPEAKER_16]: People are like bringing you into like
these grows or these, you know,
[SPEAKER_16]: farms that they don't bring people into
and I'm going to bring them attention.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is some sort of value, new value to
their company that wasn't something that
[SPEAKER_16]: existed before.
[SPEAKER_16]: And here I am.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thankfully, I am an authentic cannabis fan
so they could talk to me and know that I'm
[SPEAKER_16]: truly passionate about everything.
[SPEAKER_16]: And they felt a lot more comfortable
bringing me into these places.
[SPEAKER_16]: But it was strange, you know, you could
feel the danger in some of the situations,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, and I'm in Oakland going to this
different place or that different place.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, here I am, you know,
little me.
[SPEAKER_16]: And some of these people are heavily
armed.
[SPEAKER_16]: Going to other countries like Spain,
dealing with the military police in Spain,
[SPEAKER_16]: like they have cannabis over there,
but they don't necessarily have like legal
[SPEAKER_16]: cannabis the way that we have.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's constantly an evolving process.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, it's stressful.
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of times you're hating it.
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of times you're thinking I should
have done a regular job.
[SPEAKER_16]: That these risks that I'm taking are not
worth it.
[SPEAKER_16]: That I'm not getting financially something
that's going to get me set up for life out
[SPEAKER_16]: of this.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is just some sort of like passionate
thing that I've got myself into because of
[SPEAKER_16]: how much I believe in this.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, for some reason, a lot of credit
comes my way.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the fact of the matter is the secret
cup wouldn't exist.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't have been able to accomplish
any of this without Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, he has a mind for events and he
puts in all the tough work.
[SPEAKER_09]: And anytime he needs someone needs to be
an asshole, like this guy is the one who
[SPEAKER_09]: does it.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, you question.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I think it's pretty normal to have
those moments.
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's also pretty awesome to have those
triumphs when you've won or you've done
[SPEAKER_16]: something, especially at the events.
[SPEAKER_16]: Like we've thrown an event in some sort of
unique place and people have like won
[SPEAKER_16]: awards.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been this really wonderful thing for
a lot of people and a really amazing
[SPEAKER_16]: adventure.
[SPEAKER_16]: You feel a triumph that's not really
explainable.
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I've vacationed to Amazon.
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been to Amsterdam many times.
[SPEAKER_16]: When I threw an event in Amsterdam,
I felt like a totally different feeling.
[SPEAKER_16]: And those kind of things are really
special.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm glad to have been a part of it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think even just for the people that
attend the events that they've had some of
[SPEAKER_16]: those really special moments, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Local laws are what determines what we're
able to do as far as an event goes,
[SPEAKER_08]: because we don't want to run afoul of
them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that determines how any kind of
distribution, if possible, happens.
[SPEAKER_08]: That determines whether we have a big expo
that's public or we have a small private
[SPEAKER_08]: event like this one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Vegas laws right now, until they go fully
recreational, means that we can totally
[SPEAKER_08]: rent a house and have a private event,
but we can't just invite the public to it
[SPEAKER_08]: because they had an event here recently
and totally had options.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that was a message.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, one of the things also at the
Seeker Cup was because we were experts at
[SPEAKER_16]: all this stuff, you know, we might be
consuming these large amounts,
[SPEAKER_16]: but the idea was not to be trashy about
it.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was to be classy about it and to show
that cannabis didn't have to be this,
[SPEAKER_16]: like, get fucked up and be a mess,
you know, like this stereotypical negative
[SPEAKER_16]: thing that a lot of people look at it as,
that you could enjoy it and still be like
[SPEAKER_16]: a functioning adult and do all kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's a lot of things you can do
to, like, leave a good impression on the
[SPEAKER_08]: city that you're working with.
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that we did in Rhode Island that
worked really well is we went to the city
[SPEAKER_08]: government.
[SPEAKER_08]: We told them exactly what we were going to
do.
[SPEAKER_08]: We broke it down for them.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were completely on board.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got all the permits we needed and we
were able to, on top of all that,
[SPEAKER_08]: raise a whole bunch of stuff for the
homeless.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we had people bringing food and clothes
and we had two truckloads full of stuff
[SPEAKER_08]: that we dropped off to the local homeless
shelter.
[SPEAKER_16]: Even with the Seeker Cup, I will say,
like, as bad as the situation was with the
[SPEAKER_16]: law enforcement, my interactions with them
were all fine.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, nobody did anything to me that
was inappropriate.
[SPEAKER_16]: They definitely put a lot of attention on
events simply because we were smoking
[SPEAKER_16]: cannabis there.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was the entire reason they had a
problem with our event.
[SPEAKER_16]: We could have done almost the exact same
event minus the actual cannabis part of
[SPEAKER_16]: them and they would have had no problem
with the event.
[SPEAKER_16]: The problem was the smoking cannabis part,
not even the sales.
[SPEAKER_16]: The sales, obviously, I could see
sometimes those being problems,
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, or issues.
[SPEAKER_16]: That was not the issue.
[SPEAKER_16]: The issue was smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that, to me, is staggering.
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't believe this.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's still a problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: People don't see all the wrestling that we
have to do with regulations and laws.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we throw one of these events,
we have to contract a lawyer and make sure
[SPEAKER_08]: that it's even possible to do it,
first of all.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it comes to actually putting the
event together.
[SPEAKER_08]: That means that we have to raise a lot of
money and we have to have the trust of the
[SPEAKER_08]: community in order to do so.
[SPEAKER_08]: Primarily, what pays for these events is
people that pay for the enhanced
[SPEAKER_08]: experience of, like, you know,
the chance to come to the VIP event,
[SPEAKER_08]: the chance to get a gift bag, that kind of
thing, the chance to try the entries.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, they're all paying extra for
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we use that money that we raise from
them to, like, throw this event.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have major sponsors.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're a grassroots event.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so as far as manpower goes,
we have a lot of volunteers, a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: people that really believe in this.
[SPEAKER_08]: They might not be able to shell out the
$300 necessary to get a ticket,
[SPEAKER_08]: but, you know, they are definitely willing
to put their heart and, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: their efforts into making sure the event
goes well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, we have people doing, like,
web work, photography, people that are
[SPEAKER_08]: cooking, people that are serving,
people that are cleaning up, people that
[SPEAKER_08]: are running errands and putting out any
fire that pops up.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's 100% a group effort.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, you know, the family comes
together and then we get it done.
[SPEAKER_16]: The very first Secret Cup was targeted to
just kind of be one event.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then as I wanted to do my own event,
in Los Angeles, other people that had gone
[SPEAKER_16]: to the first one wanted to do their own in
their own cities, too.
[SPEAKER_16]: But they were having trouble.
[SPEAKER_16]: So Dan contacted me, brought me on.
[SPEAKER_16]: So from that point on, I became involved
with throwing all of the events all over
[SPEAKER_16]: the world.
[SPEAKER_16]: And ultimately, I'm the only person that
was at every Secret Cup in every city and
[SPEAKER_16]: every state and every country.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's actually a very proud
accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_16]: And one of the best adventures of my life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everywhere we went, people would just,
you know, jump in and help out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, when we had the Beast Coast thing,
we ordered hundreds of lobsters.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just turned out that we had a chef
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's now one of my good friends,
Ben, had a chef there with his knives and
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he started cooking them for everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it was that it was that level of
pitching in all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody was just everywhere we went,
like we had people just step up and help
[SPEAKER_08]: out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give us places to stay, drive around,
work for free.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's so many people like
everyone we did.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a community.
[SPEAKER_08]: And like we really what we did was
facilitate, you know, everybody coming
[SPEAKER_08]: together.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we did.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we we created a lane and
everybody else had to pitch into work.
[SPEAKER_16]: So eventually there were little events
that just focused on money making,
[SPEAKER_16]: vending aspects of the event scene.
[SPEAKER_16]: And they started popping up every day,
basically.
[SPEAKER_16]: And there were huge concert based events
every month or so when we were first doing
[SPEAKER_16]: the events.
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is also true for Chalice.
[SPEAKER_16]: We had the community all coming together.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was really a special thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a whole movement.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we were powerful.
[SPEAKER_16]: But as these things happen and people
would go to all these other events all the
[SPEAKER_16]: time, we lost that feeling that what we
were doing was something special.
[SPEAKER_16]: And now most of the other events are gone.
[SPEAKER_16]: In fact, there's only a handful of events
all over the world that I really think are
[SPEAKER_16]: worth going to.
[SPEAKER_08]: It seemed that as time went on,
there was less of an interest from the
[SPEAKER_08]: community to help.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had always relied on the
community's help.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one thing to find a venue that is
making no money and you're going to give
[SPEAKER_08]: them thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_08]: To use their event space for a big-ass
event.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a little easier, it seemed,
over time, than finding an intimate space
[SPEAKER_08]: for a hundred friends to hang out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Airbnb was up on the whole party thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just got harder and harder to do the
VIP stuff, to put out the money ahead of
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been to a lot of these things since
the first one in Seattle that I was able
[SPEAKER_03]: to go to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was kinks then, too,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I learned to expect it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a bunch of stoners putting
together a party, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_16]: As we were doing the Secret Cup,
we ran into all these problems,
[SPEAKER_16]: all these different ways.
[SPEAKER_16]: And one that was common was legal problems
with the police.
[SPEAKER_16]: From the first event in Los Angeles,
we had police called in who showed up in
[SPEAKER_16]: riot gear.
[SPEAKER_16]: That same year, we had issues with them in
San Francisco involving our venue.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we had to switch that last minute.
[SPEAKER_16]: That happened often.
[SPEAKER_16]: The worst time was probably Colorado,
where it happened twice in a week.
[SPEAKER_16]: And we had to switch cities because at one
venue, I had to talk to detectives who had
[SPEAKER_16]: a file on us.
[SPEAKER_16]: The second event in Arizona was the only
event they forced us to cancel.
[SPEAKER_16]: But in Humboldt, they showed up to the
second event with canine units and wanted
[SPEAKER_16]: to arrest everyone they could.
[SPEAKER_16]: In Spain, they met me as I was exiting the
plane with my picture and wanted to look
[SPEAKER_16]: through my luggage because all the
trophies and prizes made them suspicious
[SPEAKER_16]: of me.
[SPEAKER_16]: The last event we even did had a local
cannabis ad advocacy group take a public
[SPEAKER_16]: stand against the event simply for coming
to their town.
[SPEAKER_16]: There were so many times we had to deal
with problems like these.
[SPEAKER_16]: All of it made it really difficult to
continue with the events.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it also led us to having to do refunds
and cover losses from dropouts and deal
[SPEAKER_16]: with all the negativity surrounding all
those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_16]: Caught a few people trying to cheat and
the support from the community just became
[SPEAKER_16]: much less.
[SPEAKER_16]: We weren't making a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're doing these events for the love of
cannabis and recognizing the really true
[SPEAKER_16]: achievement and innovations in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_16]: When we started to run into so many
problems, especially financially,
[SPEAKER_16]: and people just not appreciating what we
were trying to do, we decided to stop
[SPEAKER_16]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: To sum it up, there's two aspects of how
we inspired people.
[SPEAKER_08]: We inspired people with the spirit of the
secret cup, and we inspired them with the
[SPEAKER_08]: business of the secret cup.
[SPEAKER_08]: The spirit of the secret cup was,
for me, it was freedom.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was almost like being a kid again.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like a summer camp, like a getaway,
like a convention for a very niche society
[SPEAKER_08]: of people that were making hash for the
community, that had built fans,
[SPEAKER_08]: that were like celebrity chefs,
that had some notoriety.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we were able to just bring all these
people together and it was great.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was the best part of it for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: You do stuff, you do at other events,
listen to music, eat food, all that stuff,
[SPEAKER_08]: but the love of the cannabis was why
everybody was there, and that was great.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_16]: Does that live on?
[SPEAKER_08]: It sure does live on, but not like it was.
[SPEAKER_16]: Now that it's been a couple years since
we've done an event, right around the time
[SPEAKER_16]: we did the camp outs, there is a group of
people who start talking about doing
[SPEAKER_16]: another secret cup.
[SPEAKER_16]: When I run into people at other events,
it's very common for them to tell me about
[SPEAKER_16]: how their company owes some of their
success to the secret cup in some way.
[SPEAKER_16]: They got their first booth there,
they made some important connection,
[SPEAKER_16]: and the love for the positive experiences
is still strong.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that makes me super happy for all
those people who are still doing it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And Big D, you made it all possible for
me, so thank you very, very much.
[SPEAKER_16]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, there were more events after
this.
[SPEAKER_08]: We inspired a lot of people to do this on
their own.
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, one thing that I said every one
of the cups we had was like, look,
[SPEAKER_08]: we did this, we're just like you,
do this too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give your people a place to buy better
medicine cheaper, directly from the people
[SPEAKER_08]: that are making it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Build these relationships that will carry
over after legalization, and after the
[SPEAKER_08]: chads come in and steal it from you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really did my best to spread those seeds
everywhere I went.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we didn't even ask for credit from
anybody.
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of times people get really upset.
[SPEAKER_16]: They start to see into things that aren't
there, and then they start to believe
[SPEAKER_16]: these stories that they've created for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_16]: We had people that entered our event lots
of different times, and they never won.
[SPEAKER_16]: They get really frustrated.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's hard to accept that you just
aren't doing the best work that's out
[SPEAKER_16]: there.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a lot easier to say that there's some
sort of conspiracy against you,
[SPEAKER_16]: and that's why you're not winning.
[SPEAKER_15]: Any time that you do something that
somebody else isn't doing, even if it's a
[SPEAKER_15]: failure, it's still a progression.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because in that failure, you're going to
learn from it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you're going to learn something that
you would have never learned had you not
[SPEAKER_15]: taken the step anyway.
[SPEAKER_15]: So anything that's a progression towards
what something that hasn't been done
[SPEAKER_15]: before, in my mind, is an advancement
towards something better, even if it's not
[SPEAKER_15]: something that you initially recognized as
better.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were operating in a gray area between
medical and recreational.
[SPEAKER_08]: They passed these laws.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were not very specific.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you kind of had blanket protection in
order to put one of these on.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of times, the local authorities
didn't even want to bother with us.
[SPEAKER_08]: We put this together with our friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: We made a movement that attracted people
from all over the country and all over the
[SPEAKER_08]: world that built up the mythos of the
subculture to the point where it entered
[SPEAKER_08]: popular culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the end of the day, we didn't have
the resources to go on anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we had to stop.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, the movement still goes on.
[SPEAKER_16]: There are still other events that are kind
of doing similar things to what we were
[SPEAKER_16]: doing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And some of the people that used to attend
our events are headlining those other
[SPEAKER_16]: events in other places.
[SPEAKER_16]: But it's not the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is one of the best events out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think that, you know,
we would love to have more people that are
[SPEAKER_05]: purists and people like us, like-minded
people, get involved all over.
[SPEAKER_05]: As we're opening up the doors in the
United States for legal marijuana,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's also going to open up the
doors for more people to become family in
[SPEAKER_05]: the Secret Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would recommend it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to see this family grow.
[SPEAKER_15]: The best part about the Secret Cup is how
it brings all the like-minded individuals
[SPEAKER_15]: together, kind of in a form of unity.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's not so much about the
commercialization.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's more about the art.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's more about the product.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's more about the sense of community.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, everybody's going to have a good
time no matter what, because we're all
[SPEAKER_03]: here together, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all that small stuff doesn't really
matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all made it here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all having a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it could be stressful because of
the logistics side of things, but in the
[SPEAKER_03]: end, it always comes together.
[SPEAKER_18]: I love everybody gathered.
[SPEAKER_18]: And really, man, this shit's like... It's
like being in some magical wonderland that
[SPEAKER_18]: people just don't... I mean, when my
friends and my folks hear about how we're
[SPEAKER_18]: getting down out here, they just can't
believe it, you know.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's nuts.
[SPEAKER_18]: They see the videos.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a blessing to be a part of all of
this.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I can only relate it to when I was
younger, I thought, man, if we could only
[SPEAKER_18]: live in the times of when the hippies were
doing, you know, the 60s, the 70s,
[SPEAKER_18]: the Woodstock days, how crazy that must
have been.
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, where are we?
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we're in that blip of our 60s,
70s.
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's just cool to be a part of this,
have so many of the homies get down that
[SPEAKER_18]: we do get down with.
[SPEAKER_18]: And you already know, it's just the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_18]: Secret Cup to infinity and beyond.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I mean, dude, it just erupted into
its own thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: The cannabis scene from place to place is
unique and wonderful.
[SPEAKER_16]: They have their own genetics.
[SPEAKER_16]: They have their own heroes, their own
soldiers.
[SPEAKER_16]: They have their activists.
[SPEAKER_16]: There are really wonderful things going on
all over the country, all over the world.
[SPEAKER_16]: And when you go to these other places and
you start to learn these stories and part
[SPEAKER_16]: of the story is the culture of the place
that you're in.
[SPEAKER_16]: And part of the story is the cannabis
history that is from this location and
[SPEAKER_16]: surrounding all of these kind of genetics
and these different growers and hash
[SPEAKER_16]: makers.
[SPEAKER_16]: All of that stuff is so rich.
[SPEAKER_16]: And for me, as a cannabis enthusiast,
a true person that loved cannabis,
[SPEAKER_16]: like going to these places and hearing
these stories and meeting these people,
[SPEAKER_16]: it was awesome for me.
[SPEAKER_16]: And just as cool as it was for them to be
a part of our event, it was cool for me to
[SPEAKER_16]: be a part of their history and their
culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing I want to communicate is like
the best thing about it all for me wasn't
[SPEAKER_08]: the cannabis it was the freedom.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was like traveling to a different city
and people there greeting us warmly and
[SPEAKER_08]: giving us gifts and feeding us and taking
us to their favorite spots and showing us
[SPEAKER_08]: their zones like only a local could.
[SPEAKER_16]: Local people that would hear that you're
coming out and they would want to take us
[SPEAKER_16]: to their grow or they would want to take
us to some really local special food spot.
[SPEAKER_16]: Sometimes it had nothing to do with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: They just wanted to show us the history of
the town and I loved it.
[SPEAKER_16]: It was so wonderful.
[SPEAKER_16]: I enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_16]: Probably the best out of all the things
that we did.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my favorite part.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm glad to see you all out here and
supporting.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is what we wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to spread the movement.
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys all get it.
[SPEAKER_16]: This is this is a medical event too.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I really want to thank all you guys
that are patients.
[SPEAKER_16]: I really believe in the medical value to
what we do here.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's pretty commonly known that having
friends and having a good social life is
[SPEAKER_16]: healing for people and they're constantly
trying to keep us away from each other.
[SPEAKER_16]: They don't want us to be friends.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what it's about.
[SPEAKER_16]: But we're all here together and we're
forming a family and they're not going to
[SPEAKER_16]: be able to keep us apart.
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you guys all for being out here
and I hope you had a great time.
[SPEAKER_16]: When we first did the events, you know
people were very skeptical about our
[SPEAKER_16]: ability to do them and the whole thing and
they would have a lot to say.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then as we were doing them and people
were having these amazing wonderful times
[SPEAKER_16]: and there are these colossal successes.
[SPEAKER_16]: People wanted to get on board.
[SPEAKER_16]: And become supporters.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we had some people kind of just had
play on our name.
[SPEAKER_16]: You know they started their own event and
they had a similar name to our event.
[SPEAKER_16]: But that ultimately resulted in people
just straight up stealing our name.
[SPEAKER_16]: There were multiple events in other
countries that were just called the secret
[SPEAKER_16]: cup that we had no affiliation with at
all.
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess that's flattering.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then kind of now where I'm standing
I'm ready to give the title of secret cup
[SPEAKER_16]: to the world and everyone can go throw
their own secret cups.
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know I wish everyone all the
success and all the happy times that we
[SPEAKER_16]: had.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay let's get to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we were really lucky that we got to
do it in the right time and we did it in
[SPEAKER_08]: the right time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a lot of people made a lot of
connections and we all made a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: memories and we all made a lot of
friendships.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the thing we did could only happen in
the time period that it happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm glad we made it happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so glad that you made it.
[SPEAKER_04]: From L.A.
[SPEAKER_04]: to NY.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are getting faded.
[SPEAKER_04]: All across the nation tell me who got the
best.
[SPEAKER_04]: The top shelf extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't settle for the rest.
[SPEAKER_04]: No it's gotta be that proper.
Get me high as helicopters.
Chest thumping like a chaper corp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I need a doctor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking slow like a mobster.
[SPEAKER_04]: Leaning low in my chair.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thinking what should I hit next.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you high off the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dabbing with the judge's extract.
[SPEAKER_04]: Extraordinaires.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tangy to the T.I.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got them well over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where?
[SPEAKER_04]: Highly educated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Top notch dabbing air.
[SPEAKER_04]: You damn right we faded but I still hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't scared.
[SPEAKER_04]: Call me Mr. Dabalina.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Glive Dabalina.
[SPEAKER_04]: The 91 ISO got the rig looking cleaner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dab barn do it big.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's my number have you seen it?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the game of the event and most will
never find it either.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Raptors fired up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the cup.
Welcome to the cup.
Raptors fired up.
Dab it dab it up.
Dab it dab it up.
Dab it dab it up.
Everyone's faded.
Dab it dab it up.
Dab it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Nobody tells him about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what you don't see at the secret
house.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what you don't see at the secret
house.
