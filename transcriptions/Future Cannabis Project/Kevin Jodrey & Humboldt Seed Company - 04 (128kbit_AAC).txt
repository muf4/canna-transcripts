[SPEAKER_04]: It's like I have people who send me seeds
to give out for free to other people and I
[SPEAKER_04]: love when they give me specific notes like
one guy did a lot of this breeding in like
[SPEAKER_04]: Maine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he was breeding for similar things to I
think like the Washington state area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when I know people are in those
climates I'll send them something like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah I know you're trying to help like if
it works for them too because that'd be
[SPEAKER_04]: cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're similar just like the Maine comes
in colder quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're both wet but Maine has a
f***ing definitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a short runway.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're 747 on an aircraft carrier.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Pacific Northwest is going to be warm
and temperate for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be really mold you know 50
and 80 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah 50 degrees and 80 percent humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but it allows you to be able to steer
people in the right way and that like we
[SPEAKER_01]: were all talking about earlier how do you
get people to want to educate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way you really get education is
through interest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you have to do is no better way
than hobby growing growing a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Canvas is not addictive but growing it
sure is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well and the hobby the hobby relationship
starts to make you more of a detail freak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you start to figure out really what
you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you find is that just because
it's grown organically outdoor which is
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm into doesn't mean that you have
to like it most.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might like Athena and Rockwell because
that's your f***ing mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's you're not wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that what you have to be able to
do is have people be able to experience
[SPEAKER_01]: enough different methodologies to
understand where is their preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they go to the store they can ask
better questions of the tender.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not so much for me I make it I'm
like if I if I don't think that there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: huge knowledge base I'm like okay you got
anything that's any any farm that's
[SPEAKER_01]: running outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have an outdoor section.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a sun grown section.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know that it's always going to be
older pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll always be older pot than any of the
newer pot in terms when you look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: date.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I know is that if I can go
through and I can then look at them I can
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the cultivars I can kind of figure
out which ones held up best storage
[SPEAKER_01]: because I kind of know from playing with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go oh this one usually holds up
really good and this farms out of Sonoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you break when you get it out the
car you break it open you go there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the smell's slight because it's faded
but as soon as you crush it it's bumping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know the mouth is going to be
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that lets me but that lets me be a
more intelligent shopper if I'm shopping
[SPEAKER_01]: at dispensaries out of the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm out of the area and I want to go
explore dispensaries I go and have fun
[SPEAKER_01]: with the bud tenders and I'm like what do
you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are people enjoying right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you like.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I wasn't busting what's the best thing
that you've seen come in this week.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's something that caught your eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you what do you what do you
notice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allows them to be able to be
creative in the thought process and then
[SPEAKER_01]: it allows them to be able to steer
directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're also able to say OK what I
like is I like these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also like to explore what other people
are into.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like if someone introduces you to
their music collection and you're just
[SPEAKER_04]: like play me what you like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like in some direction you're
like it's not my thing but within that
[SPEAKER_04]: thing I like what you like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well you can also appreciate the detail of
the individuality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice not to all be the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to have enough commonality that
we can all get together but enough
[SPEAKER_01]: differentiation so that we're never bored
looking at each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because every time I see you doing
different shit that I don't do makes me
[SPEAKER_01]: interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know everybody's got some weird shit
they do that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's that's the it's
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But being a home grower lets you touch the
product in a way that helps you really
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what you like and what you
don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're able to become a far more
educated individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only other way that you can
understand the product is you have it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like building your own sneaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have non biased tasting panels and I
mean non bias where they and when I when I
[SPEAKER_01]: we sometimes companies will ask me to help
them release products to the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I do is I bring people in to
communicate to the audience what these
[SPEAKER_01]: products are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I make sure is that the people
that we bring in are unbiased in what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not telling you what the fuck they
like or what they don't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not a relevant topic here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's relevant is this is what this is.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are relatable flavors and scents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please try.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now what it does is it allows people
to make unbiased decisions as the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not catching your your your
your direction of I only like O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only like hella jelly and I only like it
grown on the floodplains of the Eel River
[SPEAKER_01]: in the in the in the crook where the
sawdust used to catch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because even there's those little details
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't say any of that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you get that cold air at night right
in July.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cools it down right when it's 54.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are like what the fuck are you
talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ultimate terroir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most people don't understand what that
means.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it just becomes overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you want is you want relatable
scents and flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would simplify it and make it
presentable and make it approachable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say like you and I we're going to we're
going to bring this forward right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to we're going to take Josh's
that that black rock gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to bring it forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and you would sit down and say OK
what's all our relatable scents and
[SPEAKER_01]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were doing that earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were pulling up some strong citruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grabbed a heavy line.
[SPEAKER_01]: We picked up a light tangerine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a fuel oil in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had almost like a rose tone and from
that cherry pie that what we would do is
[SPEAKER_01]: we would go and gather those salad those
salad and we would bring it to the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now when someone says what is this
thing we're like hey this is what this is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how it was grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here are the relatable scents for you
to smell so that you can see if you can
[SPEAKER_01]: pick it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're talking about pencil
eraser the best thing you could do for
[SPEAKER_01]: good gases is bring a can of tennis balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smell that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it does is it allows them to
understand what people are talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also lets them get caught up in
patterns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your job though is to just allow
people to understand better what this is
[SPEAKER_01]: how it was grown where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you never add your influence to this
process because what you're not trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: do is educate someone to buy what you want
because that's really more of an
[SPEAKER_01]: infomercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're trying to say is these are all
considered good products.
[SPEAKER_01]: You choose what you like among them
because the bottom line is indoor herb
[SPEAKER_01]: that's grown under chemical is as a more
subtle profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we start to go into heavier
profiles just because I like it thick and
[SPEAKER_01]: full doesn't mean everyone else does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the same with wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if if 85% of the wine there's no wrong
answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's who's the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the mouth corresponds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as there's both.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just fall on your nose through a big
palette.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll get you through.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll get you really hone in on different
like almost like personalities and types
[SPEAKER_03]: of people and like people that resonate
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can be totally different in all kinds
of ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's similarities based on who kind
of likes what when it comes to canvases.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only to me there's only four real
directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when when I when I when I broke down
cannabis in the four divisions right earth
[SPEAKER_01]: and fuel fruit fruit and flower fruit and
floral like a band.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and that was that was that was a was a
compass.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I came up with that hypothesis
and said this is how cannabis really
[SPEAKER_01]: breaks down to me from looking at it from
all these years when I had the the the
[SPEAKER_01]: team from UCLA challenge that and then
fucking prove it that really does break up
[SPEAKER_01]: into these categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows you to understand that ninety
five percent of the population that came
[SPEAKER_01]: into the state of California looking for a
medical card came in for one of these four
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons that ninety five percent of the
cannabis we see in the world basically
[SPEAKER_01]: fits into these four fucking directions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that hard to see what cannabis is
really good at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's really there are
directions that fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our job in cannabis in the industry
cannabis is to help people just understand
[SPEAKER_01]: where you find your mesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not for me to tell you where to find
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you why I do what I do and why
I like what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not telling you that my shit is
going to be better for you than the shit
[SPEAKER_01]: you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're someone 10 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I love about the scratches and
it's like putting scratches in front of
[SPEAKER_03]: like three or four different flavors and
watching people go through them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like when they're like really
distinctly different varieties of like
[SPEAKER_03]: real terpene cannabis scratches this like
people light up on different ones and
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll like see like you know they'll
smell like somebody like it'll be eight
[SPEAKER_03]: people in a row that all love you know the
Cali team just like a new line we just
[SPEAKER_03]: dropped.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then they'll be a bunch of people
that'll come and they'll love the
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry pancakes which is totally
there's like waves and there's almost like
[SPEAKER_03]: natural waves to groups of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all flavors and all flavors have a
cycle and some and some flavors to me like
[SPEAKER_01]: deep oranges when they're hot they're
blistering and then when they fall off
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a vertical and then it disappears for
a while and all of a sudden it comes back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can only take so much of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why the skittles kind of
interesting because the flavor in the
[SPEAKER_01]: skittle didn't diminish in desirability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when when that lawsuit went down Mars
did the research on it and said which was
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing but it was you know if you have
skittle in the gene pool it equal to 17
[SPEAKER_01]: percent change in value of your product in
the California market which is which is
[SPEAKER_01]: big.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they got sued skittle got sued by for
the name but Mars Candy sued them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when Mars Candy sues you they're
bringing a research team and a legal team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the data that they so I read the
lawsuits I was just fascinated by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was the quantifier was they said
oh yeah we've been injured and money has
[SPEAKER_01]: been made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can say that money has been made by
the virtue of the fact that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: they're diminishing our name and they're
making 17 percent more for a skittle in a
[SPEAKER_01]: product than a non skittle product which
blew my mind because there's no that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no data that corresponds to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they they were able to mine it because
they're Mars and it's the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah they can use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do what you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: No leg to stand on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's Mars.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it's kind of like fucking with
Coca Cola or you want to you want to have
[SPEAKER_01]: a you want to screw up somebody's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Add some Disney to the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day you know you
want you want people to be happy with what
[SPEAKER_01]: they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me what I like is being able to
play with new things and put them out and
[SPEAKER_01]: let people check them out and.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of just keep the curiosity peaked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the stuff that I do
professionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing but it's very
targeted.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's you're bringing it has to be still
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it like a contract killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're bringing me in to kill a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm there for a specific thing and a
target without the target.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without the target I do my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do my thing but that's not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those but I'm clear about the
division.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I clearly divide them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very dichotomous to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what it does it allows me to maintain
my interest and what I'm into so that I
[SPEAKER_01]: never lose like why I why I really like
doing what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love the scientific work I get to do
and I love working with some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: giant fucking operators because you get
horsepower you just can't get in the
[SPEAKER_01]: garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just can't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just don't know what it's like to look
at 20 fucking thousand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to take 10,000 clones to give
the capability of taking 10,000 clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see a million clones because I
want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that way I can see the limit to the
left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I want to see the too light
person who only works a specific thing for
[SPEAKER_01]: time and comes up with an outlier because
there's a purity there that's to me just
[SPEAKER_01]: overwhelmingly beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what I love about the craft
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes I'm in the craft community
and sometimes I'm not depending on what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm always a smoker like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's I was a smoker before I was a
grower and I was a smoker and a grower
[SPEAKER_01]: before I was a dealer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know so for me I'm always still a
smoker and what I what I really want to
[SPEAKER_01]: have happen is the desires I want for
myself of availability access
[SPEAKER_01]: affordability community different genes
that we can work with gene banks that we
[SPEAKER_01]: can borrow and lend from.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to give me the fucking
plant but they can sell me a vial of
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be able to sell me a vial of
pollen so I can go and pollinate and work.
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be abilities to have people
work and develop in the cannabis craft
[SPEAKER_01]: without having to be under an MSO label
without having to be under a big brand
[SPEAKER_01]: label.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well the MSOs are looking for something
different I think than the craft.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not much overlap at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they're looking for and like the you
know the matrix they're trying to hit is
[SPEAKER_03]: drastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the craft copies them though.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem is that the craft
copies the craft doesn't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a whole different market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well the craft people are used to selling
to Malibu Don.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not selling the dispensaries at
this level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Malibu Don needs to start a distro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah but Malibu Don wouldn't he wouldn't
start a distro because there's no fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what the small operator like for me
what I do is I take all the cloneless that
[SPEAKER_01]: come across my phone right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking rivers of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just screenshot them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I think how many similarities I
get the same name your price.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just show somebody and I said hey watch
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said see this right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said this same group just hit me up
twice which means they're hungry for
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to watch the clone price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to see the clone price
drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're going to see teen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're going to see one gal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they're doing is they're just
holding this fucking plant moving it
[SPEAKER_01]: through their world because they can't
bear to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're spending fucking 40 bucks to
sell you a $10 plant because they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: catch that nobody wants the fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you made too many of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so taking care of plants is expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh it's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're looking at this these
lists it just lets you understand that
[SPEAKER_01]: when you see huge quantities coming
through just realize that those things are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be mostly grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the pool you don't belong in
as a 400 500 pound operator 400 500 pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're looking for your niche which is
maybe some heritage market that you got
[SPEAKER_03]: into or you're looking for the next new
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that next thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 10 percent there.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me we got like you know it's kind of
the bell curve right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go 10 on the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll buy whatever the fuck you sell 10
on the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to basically pay them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that 80 in the middle is swayable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I can move them over to here a
little bit I might even get 1 percent of
[SPEAKER_01]: the 10 on the right to move.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll get a 91 which puts me into an A.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's this middle that I work with
of what are they seeking and what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: seeking is this this this nexus of quality
and value.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a diversity that's relatively
simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that you're not having to to try to
create too many different lanes you're
[SPEAKER_01]: saying OK the distro wants three things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take a look at the three things that the
distro wants which is basically into this
[SPEAKER_01]: box and then I increase the category where
the sales are hottest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now this year I would make a
prediction I would say if I was to have
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica a sativa and a hybrid I would go
more sativa more hybrid less Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what do we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: The steering of what does Indica mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Narcotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hybrid balanced sativa ethereal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where have we focused all the work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Narcotic because all the gene pools we
work with for indoor are that short
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering cyclical speed of use.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we go to hybrid we start to get into
this middle zone but people didn't catch
[SPEAKER_01]: that just because you breed something
together doesn't make it fucking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the cerebral end of it that shit is
a project to get neck down into a
[SPEAKER_01]: desirable level and so everybody goes all
blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well all of a sudden everybody's the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get tired of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many days in a row do I have to smoke
the exact same shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well we're going to see this whole
resurgence of hazes, train wrecks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think next year we're going to see a
little bit of it come in and over the next
[SPEAKER_03]: three years it's going to really pick up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it won't pick up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with it is to me what we're
doing wrong with this shit is we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: accepting the fact that we're not supposed
to fucking grow it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not supposed to grow it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fuck around on the equator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh it's a different looking plant there
I'll tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should be growing it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should grow things here that are
hybrids that North Americans can grow in
[SPEAKER_01]: our situation that shine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're growing things indoor for
125 days how much does that cost you to
[SPEAKER_01]: buy it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh indoors it's not realistic.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you're working with the
genetics and bringing in that trigger time
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're modernizing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're modernizing it and for me and I
play with groups that modernize where I
[SPEAKER_01]: get to see what it looks like when you
take equatorial Africans and compress them
[SPEAKER_01]: into a fucking soda can sized plant where
you've brought them all the way down into
[SPEAKER_01]: their true form.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also now looking at all the new auto
flowers and auto flower conversions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and I like those too because you can
take the auto gene revolution lets you
[SPEAKER_01]: understand how to increase vigor and speed
of a regular without having to really
[SPEAKER_01]: utilize some of those what we used to call
rudorellas but really northern flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been worked out enough that you have
it isolated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have been working with that shit
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The mint jelly is oh my god Pepsi Coke
challenge you can't tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's absolutely no difference there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually preferable.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been seeing the all gas,
the emerald fire and the mint jelly being
[SPEAKER_03]: top sellers for some people against their
full season.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of times it's because they're in
an area where it was way more appropriate
[SPEAKER_03]: for them to grow an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah because it's finished.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you're in like New York,
Massachusetts, Maine your full season
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff sometimes it's gonna get beat up a
little bit in those late storms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So having auto flowers that perform like
photoperiodic cousins that's a game
[SPEAKER_02]: changer for those kind of areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: There just has to be the ability for
people to do this in a way that lets them
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is it was the question of
like I was pondering this thought of what
[SPEAKER_01]: the fuck's up with D8 and why are you
having such an availability of derivatives
[SPEAKER_01]: of analogs and how the DEA and the FDA is
so cool with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like man they're crawling up our ass
over everything we do forever but when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to these things and you take a look
and it's really who owns the hemp fields,
[SPEAKER_01]: who really controls the derivative market
of these products and its other larger
[SPEAKER_01]: entities that are in pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_01]: No that would never happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're looking at it from that
perspective which is honest, you realize
[SPEAKER_01]: that for so much of the stuff that we do
with THC based cannabis where we call it
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, it's so highly regulated that it
makes it almost impossible for mainstream
[SPEAKER_01]: to touch it in a way that's convenient.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of research should be done with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no convenience for the consumer like
the regular smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone who just wants to be able,
like what I would call like the regular
[SPEAKER_01]: craft beer consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably drink maybe a six every
week, once every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a beer every couple days when
they, they're just like you know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: just want to have a drink and chill and
I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got guys who drink a six a
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You burn a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I burn, I probably burn like I guarantee I
burn every night when I sit down at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I almost know I always burn sometime
like around lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm doing some Zooms, I'm burning
when I'm on the Zooms because the fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: Zooms wear you out when you're on the
fucking computer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not smoking and then all of a
sudden you can smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but mostly, you know, two or three
times a day I consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used to consume I figured on the
average about 18 times a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like for most of my, you know,
youth and career, I had a joint in my
[SPEAKER_01]: mouth full time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was never not a joint fucking,
I was in almost like chain smoking where I
[SPEAKER_01]: was constantly lit up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the stress was so high that I
didn't really realize that I had just
[SPEAKER_01]: found that this much cannabis use would
allow me to maintain like normality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise unhealthy life though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because you're running a wild life,
you know, and pushing it to the max.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you realize what you're doing,
sometimes it freaks you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have like, wait a minute,
my whole life.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people don't realize that now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The industry is like back in the day there
was this underlying level of like constant
[SPEAKER_03]: stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you look at it with the helicopters
flying today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a roadblock on the road for the
consumer?
[SPEAKER_01]: The consumer having to stash the weed in
their drawers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like mass state troopers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be driving from Boston down to Rhode
Island with pounds in the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: With like a mass state trooper pulling
behind me for like five miles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going like 40 miles an hour in the
right-hand lane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know that, and that's just real,
but it did, it created a stress level that
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that what I did is I used cannabis
as a nullifier of it so that it allowed me
[SPEAKER_01]: to function at, because I couldn't ever,
even like when we first started,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the nursery, there was no medical
protections in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had like 30, 40,000 plants in the
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was building at a time in fucking
public.
[SPEAKER_01]: All they had to do was get the fed to come
visit me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was looking at four life sentences,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like never reading about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ball balls, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew exactly what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew exactly what I was doing,
but I had to be able to have such faith in
[SPEAKER_01]: myself that everyone around you had faith.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way to really maintain that
constant was to stay that lit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was way before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fucking A.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's levels to this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh no, I went all the way,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is the team around you,
the reason why they follow you,
[SPEAKER_01]: the reason why that you get buy-in is
because people trust you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because historically you've been able to
navigate them through the dope game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people around you all made money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all stayed safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all made benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they trusted you to figure out what to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you get into these levels of
really responsible situations,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why I fucking frown on most of the
new modern CEO of cannabis is that,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, Jesus Christ, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you raised a lot of money,
but you fucked all your investors and you
[SPEAKER_01]: shit on everybody in your company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you got a coke problem, a broken
Ferrari.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you got a fucking drug problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got fucking issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, to me, that's not what I'm
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I knew was that if I was bold
enough to do what I was going to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to make sure that the people around
me never lost belief that I fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: believed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That there was never a moment you fucked
with me, that you didn't think that I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't believe that I could pull it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know that that's, and I learned
that in the military, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That when you want to get people to do
really hard things, you can either create
[SPEAKER_01]: shame or passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And shame I don't like, but passion I'm
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that the way you get someone to
come out of a helicopter is you go first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go first, they go, fuck yeah,
I'll follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're behind them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I did was the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it changes how you see
the world because of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, it doesn't mean
anything to the people that are here
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't really have to appreciate
it because it was choices we made.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I want to see is I want to see
that that struggle resulted in a benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: for people so that they were able to be
able to use URB in a way that was positive
[SPEAKER_01]: for them and allowed more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that I'm only so limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it's us, it's we.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means that one of you in the room
is going to bring an idea forward that I
[SPEAKER_01]: never could.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the only way you can continuously
create is to have continuous new ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way that can really take
place is through community participation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my desire all this time as I got older
was I just can't wait to see what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope people crack the code.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going to happen next is the coolest
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be a fucking hater.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking into the canvas, it's totally
blown apart as far as quality for me now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, what's next?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's stuff in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's molecules that seem like we're
manifesting them out of there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's making shit up that's coming out
of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Potter Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had some Potter Valley, some
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew that one in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what the other one,
but the genetic work was all done in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not a bad community.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got all these together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we have is directions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nothing's better than the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all super unique, shining stars.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as they're grown with passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a pretty good interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, baby?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we wrap it?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
