[SPEAKER_01]: When working with plants, as I was just
talking about, working in the size of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants you have, watering, how you deliver
the water to the plant is critical in how
[SPEAKER_01]: it grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me personally, I think that the more often
you water small doses, the better off your
plants are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a little bit of working exactly
what a small dose is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've often worked with 60-70 mils per
watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you deliver that water on a regular
basis, the amount of water that the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: sees, the amount of nutrient that the
plant sees, and the amount of air that the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant sees at any instance is much more
uniform throughout the whole day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that plant then should be in an
optimum growing environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: More often, or a larger portion of each
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look at watering first thing in the
morning, maybe a half an hour after the
[SPEAKER_01]: lights are turned on or the sun comes up,
giving the plant its first water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe an hour or so after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you get more toward the heat
of the day, you may get down to a half an
[SPEAKER_01]: hour between waterings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really have to work with what plants
you have and in the environment you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the air is drier around you,
if you have a wind moving through,
[SPEAKER_01]: all these things are going to increase the
amount of water that your plant needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to adjust your
watering program to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also believe that in the end of the day,
you should be stopping your water two
[SPEAKER_01]: hours before the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's two, three hours before the lights go
off so that the roots are dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be drier going through the
dark period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the dark period, they do not use as
much water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's a lot of water setting
around, you increase the possibilities of
[SPEAKER_01]: root problems, root rot setting in to give
your plants some difficulty in that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: This type of watering system works well in
any kind of a growing media where you have
[SPEAKER_01]: enough drainage or where you're not going
to be having the media too wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing in soil and it's getting
too wet going with that, you still should
[SPEAKER_01]: be watering a number of times smaller
bursts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just maybe cannot get quite so close
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things you'll find out in
delivery of water is that if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: dripping water, the slower you drip the
water, into your growing media,
[SPEAKER_01]: a drop hits and spreads sideways.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the drips are coming too close or it's
just a small stream coming into there,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to find out that the water is
going to build a certain amount of weight
[SPEAKER_01]: in a small area in a centered pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's going to start going
straight down right below the dripper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll end up with a tube almost two,
three inches in diameter going straight
[SPEAKER_01]: down as opposed to if it's very slow
coming in, it drips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gets a time to move sideways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might be a drip, drip, drip.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after every one, it gets that little
bit of a time to move sideways so it moves
[SPEAKER_01]: across the whole pot level or whole area
of the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other things that the watering
on a small dose is regular is that your
[SPEAKER_01]: balance of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to hear a lot of people
talking a lot about oh, I feed at a parts
[SPEAKER_01]: per million of 1200 or 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's nice to know what that level of
nutrient is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's more important than the level
of nutrient is actually the balance of
[SPEAKER_01]: your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like eating your own for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you need is a balanced diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more balanced your diet is,
is more important than eating a large
[SPEAKER_01]: amount or a small amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be healthier if you've got
vegetables, if you've got protein,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you've got just all the different food
groups that you need to grow well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plants are the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're feeding them small doses,
what you're going to do is continue to see
[SPEAKER_01]: a reasonably level balance of nutrients in
the same balance that you're feeding all
[SPEAKER_01]: day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: If what you do is you give them one feed
every two days, the first day it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have to be way up over what they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as time goes by, it's going to come
down, come down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's going to be a point in there
where some of your nutrients are probably
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have been used up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we don't know exactly how every
plant is going to use every nutrient in
[SPEAKER_01]: all situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get something that's reasonably
well balanced and you feed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to continue to go down both
the level of nutrients and the balance of
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrients going to get out until it
gets to a point where it's too little.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may never see a deficiency because it
might be just slow growing through that
[SPEAKER_01]: period of time, but you are going to lose
some efficiencies in plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to slow your whole plant growth
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you get to the next feed,
it goes from down here to up here again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bit of shock to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been struggling to get water,
been struggling to get nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden it's got everything it
needs again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it starts to go back through that
same cycle going down again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you can give it just a little
bit of a dose every hour, every couple
[SPEAKER_01]: hours, and I'm sure there's going to be
any number of people that say,
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 times a day, how the heck can I do
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a timer and a valve.
[SPEAKER_01]: A timer turns a pump on or a timer turns a
solenoid valve on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of lets water go out to there and
it can be just a few minutes and then off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when the next time comes around,
doing it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get a much more even supply
of nutrients and air and water to your
[SPEAKER_01]: root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should see an increase in growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the other thing related to the
case for frequent feedings at small
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts is you're also keeping the
moisture level consistent so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial microbes that thrive,
like they're not getting too dry and dying
[SPEAKER_00]: out and then getting too wet and having
anaerobic activity or whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you just talk about beneficial
microbes and that sweet spot and why
[SPEAKER_00]: constant feeding keeps it sort of in that
narrow bandwidth?
Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides the root needing a constant supply
of nutrients and moisture, you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole ecology in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you have all kinds of beneficial
microbes and bacteria things growing that
[SPEAKER_01]: are plant beneficial to the root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: This keeping a level of moisture and feed
for your plant roots also benefits these
[SPEAKER_01]: growing microorganisms, which grow in
symbiosis with your root system to help
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole plant grow and increase in
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you just talk about how they sort
of like live within a narrow bandwidth if
[SPEAKER_00]: you keep drying wet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go too wet for them to be optimal,
too dry for them to be optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it goes right into that
optimal, but then it quickly goes up over
[SPEAKER_01]: the top again too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microbes and other beneficial bacteria
that grow in your media have grown along
[SPEAKER_01]: with root systems over many years and they
have grown accustomed to the same level of
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture to be growing around,
growing that your root system has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they, as you're providing that
level of moisture that is beneficial for
[SPEAKER_01]: your root system, you're going to see that
same thing is beneficial for your micro
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where if you're watering again once a day,
you're going to see your soil get too wet
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're going to see your soil get too
dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be too wet and too dry
for your microbes and beneficial bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: in there also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll go through a period of growing
in that sweet spot and then getting up to
[SPEAKER_01]: a place where it's too wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it comes back to that,
is it too wet?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's actually not enough air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And going back through that sweet spot,
back down to the bottom, and it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get too dry down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I say too dry, I don't mean too
much air.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, it actually probably gets
to be not enough moisture, which may be
[SPEAKER_01]: either too much salt, or because EC is a
function of moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a certain amount of water
and a certain amount of salt, if you
[SPEAKER_01]: lessen the water, the EC or the salt
content or salt concentration goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get down below that sweet spot of
growing for the bacteria, then they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: die.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have to start over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And
[SPEAKER_00]: then they have to start over.
