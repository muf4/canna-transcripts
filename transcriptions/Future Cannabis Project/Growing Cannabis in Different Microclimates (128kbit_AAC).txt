[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I have a real admiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not quite like the gentleman you just met
about who doesn't watch porn but watches
[SPEAKER_01]: Strain Hunters, but nonetheless an
admiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a funny one, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nonetheless an admiration for all of the
work you do to further the plant and all
[SPEAKER_01]: the traveling that you do, you and your
partner.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, where haven't you gone to find
cannabis strains?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where haven't you gone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I still have some countries on my
list, but I want to pick up some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, one of the most difficult countries
in the world is DRC Congo, and at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time one of the most easy countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a country the size of Europe,
exactly on the equator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hard because you can't get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's also war in the east,
there's Ebola in the north, there's all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm from Africa, as you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Zambia originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's why you can say Africa is
Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa is Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the same kind is very rewarding when
you can do something there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are doing clinical trials with
university and hospitals of the country
[SPEAKER_00]: with a group of professors from Europe and
from Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're keeping it a little bit under the
radar, but we're coming out with it very
[SPEAKER_00]: soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we on the equator?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are 12-12 the whole year around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can basically grow outdoor what we do
the whole year around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have at any time between 50 and
100,000 plants, and every time I put out a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole valley of plants and I make whatever
seeds and I do whatever genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the world's biggest genetic
pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a few hundred phenotypes there,
and I in-breed and I cross and I do
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever I want, and I put every time
whatever seeds out and I can test them
[SPEAKER_00]: directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: For whatever I want to see, hermaphrodism,
uniformity, male, female, feminized,
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being on the equator.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the Hugh Hefner of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to play with as many girls as you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so you can see the mountains there,
you know, like I put out, I have at any
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got now 20 glass houses with between
50 and 100,000 plants, and every time when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're two feet, I put them outside,
flower them off, make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seven valleys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to increase to 14 valleys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at any time I can do my breeding there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have hundreds of varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it the greatest thing in the world
that the whole year around you look
[SPEAKER_00]: outside to the sun and it's always between
20 and 32 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always the perfect climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a rainy season November and
December, which is a rainy season,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we can still grow outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a short rainy season.
[SPEAKER_00]: In March, we have rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have free sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have free land.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are one of the few places left in the
world where everything is organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use only bedguana from the caves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use my powder feeding that is
completely organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a whole community of people that
we are feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have four hectares of vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very nice culture of everything
coming together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't even know if I need to ask you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is your favorite country for
cultivating cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: How interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also don't forget, think very logic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congo is the country in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look that up and ask any teacher
in the world is the most diverse in plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that says enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most plants and fruits in the world
are in Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, how nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't copy that with marijuana?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are on the equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I don't have the, I can't grow my
plants big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do that in a glass house.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only little disadvantage,
but you don't need big plants to make to
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, to do breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pre-grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to understand one glass house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, it's eight meters by 30 meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 240 meters like a normal glass
house, you know, like the tunnels you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: have 100 feet by 25 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it you have in America?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the air goes nice through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you, you saw my pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on Instagram all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have LEDs in there, 150 times six
Watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a thousand Watts for a whole
glass house for sub, sub, sub lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I only put the light on at five o
'clock to 11 o'clock because the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: the sunlight the whole day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use 2000 liters of diesel in a whole
month for 20 glass houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of off the grid, you know,
we're amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, this is what you had to make
me want to give up California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like me, we were talking about,
I'm everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I love the fact that you're so
dynamic, man, that, you know, you're not,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not a, you don't just settle for
doing this here or doing this there and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're constantly moving out and expanding
and the organics, you know, I'm all about
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, if you want to smoke a
hydroponic weed, be my guest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, save the organics for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the vegetable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like you're just,
uh, you're, you're, you're, as they say,
[SPEAKER_01]: living the dream, but in the Congo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much time do you spend there a year?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I spent, uh, one week a month in North
America and one week a month in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have two weeks left in which I
spent 10 days home and the other five days
[SPEAKER_00]: in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty busy schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you have the same problem as me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of us are sitting basically in
airplanes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I didn't even know it was existing,
but me and my part is we have diamond
[SPEAKER_00]: cards now on the airplanes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get upgraded every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that crazy?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's a good thing or a
bad thing, but we fly a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do in Congo, which strange,
um, I have 10 valleys and we created a
[SPEAKER_00]: system there that we put out every time
one Hector, like 5,000 plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we put the pots in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the males are there already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we bring the females.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we pollinate the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we pollinate the crop for 10 days,
we cut all the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already bring the new male for the next
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's another variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: We move out out of the ground,
all the pots back to main base,
[SPEAKER_00]: three miles down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put a new 5,000 plants so we can do
in 10 weeks, two crops times 10 valleys is
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 crops nominal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first and only place in the
world where we can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have seven valleys, like all two,
three miles from each other and a few
[SPEAKER_00]: trucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we drive the plants up and down,
but this means we can speed up the process
[SPEAKER_00]: twice, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also the finishing, the crop
happens where the glass houses are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just have a huge field there of 500
hectares.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just put all the pots again in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: The holes already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we dropped them after five weeks,
bring them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just finished them off in the
main fields and we only have to water
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any cross pollination
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoor growing is something that I
haven't done too much of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm primarily an indoor grower,
nothing I'm proud of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, this is the other reason I went
to Congo, not because of the diversity of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and fruits, but also because the
space is enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's big.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine?
[SPEAKER_01]: So of all of these strains and,
uh, that you're working with in the Congo,
[SPEAKER_01]: how, how many of them, what percentage are
actually indigenous and what percentage of
[SPEAKER_01]: ones you brought with you from Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, most of them, we technically have
nearly all the strains of the world there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, of course there's black Congo,
red Congo, but there is also Santa Marta,
[SPEAKER_00]: Punta Roja, Limon Verde.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a Mango Rosa from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is anything that we are crossing
with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just like a great pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a dream come true.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about on the medical side?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you involved in any, uh, with any
medical tech?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this is the main reason we are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a medical license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean really in pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, are you involved in any big
pharma?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, we're not involved in big.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know that's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are creating big pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I cannot say too much right now,
but there is people putting in a few
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred million dollars in big
investigations, uh, concerning Alzheimer,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Parkinson and that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working very close with this group.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a really rich group of guys
that are not related to pharma,
[SPEAKER_00]: but want to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually even better for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds a little more altruistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will probably announce that next
year somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but uh, yeah, yeah, of course pharma
is going to get involved and look what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening in America, but I would rather
it be done by our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I've, I've said for many
years is that, uh, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, there's nothing wrong with
corporations if the corporations are run
[SPEAKER_01]: by good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to work together with
corporations because we need their money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need their experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need their know-how.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need their business skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need their backbone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need everything from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can change the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can change the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: As if we already have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
