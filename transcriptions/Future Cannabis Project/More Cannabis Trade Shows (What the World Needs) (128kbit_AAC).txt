[SPEAKER_00]: We've run into each other at the State of
Cannabis, I think at CWCBE, at New West
[SPEAKER_00]: Summit, now here at CCIA in SoCal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm now based out of Southern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still based out of Northern
California, but you have been going to
[SPEAKER_00]: shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been going to shows for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has changed, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like the demographic,
the traffic seems like not quite as busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I think partly because
there's so many more shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, we've been seeing each other
every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to keep up and run business
if you're trying to go to shows every week
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that brings the attendance down
per show when you're scrambling to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: so many shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we've got to start to see an
oversaturation of the elements that are at
[SPEAKER_01]: that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody needs insurance, but I think
half the booths here are insurance
[SPEAKER_01]: brokers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's only one or two companies that
even write insurance policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So between insurance and packaging,
it seems to be what the majority of what
[SPEAKER_01]: goes on to these shows these days are,
whereas I'm looking for innovative
[SPEAKER_01]: product, packaging, retail outlets type
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been doing the show circuit since 14
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 2016 is kind of when we felt like it
was a point of saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to your point, all of a sudden it was
this show, this show, this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always an advocate for supporting the
organization and the organizations that
[SPEAKER_00]: are supporting the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I love CCIA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love NCIA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even New West Summit,
what Jim's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what Peter's doing with his
series, with bringing the right people
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, those are the shows that really
make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have some shows that they're
Johnny-come-latelys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done conventions in the tech
industry or the diamond industry or this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they see it as a, this is such a
played out term, you'll agree,
[SPEAKER_00]: the green rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want, oh, we can do this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll do that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't have the same, like you
said, grit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking just now and you're like,
I like New West.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had the grit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it had like Jim brings some edgy
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brings tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brings media.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brings innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you come to other shows where
it's cookie cutter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, how many more insurance,
how many more marketing agencies,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many more packaging companies?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was one of the best, actually,
when I was down here last with one of
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter's events, I think focusing on one
like criteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're developing a panel or something
super specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause going to that breeders panel that
you did down here in Venice was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's just, I think it's finding
more unique niches to do shows or panels
[SPEAKER_01]: or conferences about and just filling
those niches, you know, like so around
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and breeding is something that I'm
really interested in packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of fine tuning what everybody's
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we sponsor that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I attended that show and I love how he
even did it in a speakeasy as ironic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think a lot of people absorb that
that here he had it in a venue that was a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge part of the original prohibition in
this country with the whole alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for it to be there back in the
basement, yeah, it's back in a basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to get people like, I,
I was very impressed because Kevin Jodry,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's a good friend who, I mean,
I love Jorge Cervantes and I very good
[SPEAKER_00]: friends with Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But someone like Kevin Jodry who,
you know, he's been working with people
[SPEAKER_00]: like Gavin Newsom, one of the few
politicians that came out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: proverbial green closet to support us with
prop 64, you know, and then people like
[SPEAKER_00]: Mowgli, who's just this almost dare I say
science, you know, kind of mad scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's so, so brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he's doing with the file is
project and the people that were in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room, they have few friends like Tom Himes
from MG, a couple others, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: or like, this is the 2.0 stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is the next level stuff that
this industry needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enough of us know Cannabis 101.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew up around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I from Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been around us for years,
but that's the kind of stuff that I agree
[SPEAKER_00]: with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I geek out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I already have everything else
focused right back to the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant itself and genetics and variety
and where that's all going is super fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like a moving target.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's never going to end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what's the hot new genetic
profile that's going into everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's exactly, I was just
talking actually to Tom from MG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, I did this show in
Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the Utah can first ever canvas show
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of cool because of the
whole, it's an emerging market,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're one like Michigan and,
um, Oklahoma, you know, that are voting
[SPEAKER_00]: in, in November.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was cool to see that energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was such a, um, it's an,
you know, it's not a mature market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone was so open-minded to learning
things and to learn them the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, which again, that's something I
thought was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like real thirsty for information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, wow, this has taken me
back to, and again, not to date ourselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we were both, I know I was of legal
age to vote on prop two 15 back in 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably were too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had two more years before I could vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, but for us to be around that,
and then of course seeing medical just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of take off from there in the States,
but to see that that's still something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's evolving and that people are doing,
I think it's pretty cool as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so where to after this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you, where are you heading?
[SPEAKER_01]: So after, uh, trying to buckle down and
back home and handle the harvest season
[SPEAKER_01]: and get all the packaging and the branding
and focus on, uh, hitting the market in
[SPEAKER_01]: the consumer market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're one of the guys hustling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're, we don't see a lot of
guys, literally individuals that are
[SPEAKER_00]: making the trek down from NorCal to SoCal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I think it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't know when I think of
California, they think of just this one
[SPEAKER_00]: state that San Diego is right next to LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: LA is right next to San Francisco,
but I mean, you're coming from the
[SPEAKER_00]: triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I went up there for HCGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I saw you at Humboldt County
Growers Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great show, another local
supported show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I drove, it was a five hour drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to fly into Oakland airport and I
drove up from there and you don't see a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people that you'd see at a venue
like that down here getting out in front
[SPEAKER_00]: of these customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this instance, your customers being
dispensaries, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually saying, Hey, I'm bringing
fire from, from the epicenter to your
[SPEAKER_00]: front door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you think of like, Oh, it's all in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you think about it, say to the
East coast would be like, I'm coming to a
[SPEAKER_01]: event in Georgia and I'm from New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the fact that, you know,
a vast majority of people aren't aware of,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, we have 39 and a half million people
in this, in this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, a vast majority are in the LA
base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's something like 26 million
people alone in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you look at that compared to San
Francisco Metro or Sacramento Metro or
[SPEAKER_00]: even San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is where a majority of the
buyers on, you know, so you're smart for
[SPEAKER_00]: making that track down and taking it to
the largest audience.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just got to break those doors down is the
hardest part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
