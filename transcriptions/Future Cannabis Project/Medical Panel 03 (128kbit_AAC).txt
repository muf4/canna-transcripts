[SPEAKER_02]: They're also doing that with spec scans,
another fancy scan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're, just so you get this,
they're watching cannabinoids change the
[SPEAKER_02]: brain, physically change the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're measuring that,
too, and they're seeing the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's been studies done out of the
United States that have shown that
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum disorder kids, to test anandamide
or endocannabinoid deficiencies,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of them are doing the cerebral
spinal fluid, spinal taps on kids for
[SPEAKER_00]: studies is not something we allow in the
United States directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they did do is they did a test,
blood tests on spectrum kids with high
[SPEAKER_00]: levels of autism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spectrum is autism spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that their white blood
cells had two to three times the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: CB2 receptors than people not on the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I said, well, that's what the
body does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always fluctuating because it's
trying to find homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because what they're theorizing is
they're deficient in these cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the body is producing more receptors to
try to absorb what is in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's already clinical research
showing that, you know, endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency disorders, which is what a lot
of these mystery conditions that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: lived with our whole life are likely going
to fall under.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, we've had this our whole
life is clinically diagnosed conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: where you have there's no test for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to prove it like migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fibromyalgia, all these sort of things
are, you know, you have to prove,
[SPEAKER_00]: sit and suffer and prove to your doctor
that you have it because they don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: know what to look for to prove that you
have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the discovery of the
endocannabinoid system, we're likely to
[SPEAKER_00]: get those days are going to be over
relatively soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as we develop the ability to test
more efficiently for endogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, you can't really do it at your
local blood draw place because of how
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly they dissipate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those days are coming and the ability
to test for that is really going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: to show why also, coincidentally,
those conditions are ones people will
[SPEAKER_00]: always gravitate towards cannabis for.
[SPEAKER_00]: MS, fibromyalgia, headache, PTSD,
etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know we're getting short on time and
I did leave us with a cliffhanger I just
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to get into real quick because if I
save it right now, it's worse than it was
[SPEAKER_00]: in, you know, it's as bad as it's been
since 1994.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to help give everyone an
understanding as to why that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to get technical for a second,
but bear with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take you to Mortimer, but we'll get
back to the Shire here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to understand why we don't
have access, you have to understand what
[SPEAKER_00]: is needed to treat serious medical
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why I want to take us back to
the Epidiolex trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in those studies, they had kids with
Dravet syndrome, primarily, and
[SPEAKER_00]: Lennox-Gasso syndrome, too very difficult
to treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically the first FDA-approved CBD
medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's purified CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do add a couple terpenes in there,
but for the most part, it's just CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so it's been approved by the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see it probably this year,
later this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start seeing it being actually,
it's already being prescribed to epilepsy
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, but it'll be more common.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts with where they studied and then
they branch out because they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: studies with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it costs about the family's after
insurance, which is going to cover over
[SPEAKER_00]: $36,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and that's cheap, okay, but that's
cheaper than going to the dispensary in
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevada City.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm about to show you why,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in those studies, they showed that
efficacy happened at around, starting at
[SPEAKER_00]: about seven and a half milligrams per
pound body weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lesson number one, if you're treating
yourself with cannabinoids, you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: know the concentration, not the volume,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many milligrams am I taking of a
cannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it relate to how much I weigh?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what doctors usually do for us,
but we have to do for ourselves with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis medicine because we don't have
doctors, present company excluded,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are typically doing that for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're showing seven and a half
milligrams per pound body weight is where
[SPEAKER_00]: it starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take your typical 11 year old that
weighs, let's just make it easy,
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 pounds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They go into their neurologist and they're
putting them on a starting dose of 750
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams a day, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: 7.5 pounds, 100, 750 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: A day, a child, to treat potentially
terminal epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go into our dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you have been in a dispensary
here, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Next time you're in there, I want you to
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had to take 750 milligrams a day,
how would you do it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you have in dispensaries typically
are CBD tinctures that are everywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But no one looks at the concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are 300 milligrams a bottle,
maybe 500 milligrams a bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order for this child to be treated,
they'd have to drink two or three and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half of those bottles a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, the way cannabis is
marketed right now, the stronger it gets,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more purified it gets, which means the
less effective it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some CBD isolate powders or
1500 milligrams, but most of those are
[SPEAKER_00]: less effective because they're so
purified, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And even those, the most I've seen is 1500
milligrams in a bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'd have to drink half a bottle a
day to get the starting dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's a starting dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the kids we have get up to 15 to
20 milligrams per pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're at 2000 milligrams a day doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order for that to work, when the
Collager's Network shut down, we talked to
[SPEAKER_00]: the people at Elevation in Nevada City,
and they are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daniel Bashford, the owner, immediately
said, Collager's families can have
[SPEAKER_00]: everything it costs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, let's see if that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go in and at cost, the strongest
thing they have in there is a one gram of
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not even a suspension or a
tincture that a child could use,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's 500 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after the discount and then taxes,
it's still about $50, $45 for one gram,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's 500 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to buy 18 of those, which is all
they had in stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to break the law to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in California, you can only buy
eight grams a day, even though there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they drove for three hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could only buy eight of them at 500
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about six, seven days worth of
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ended up having to buy an 18
because we just took turns buying it for
[SPEAKER_00]: the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a full discount, meaning Elevation
made zero money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cost us $860, and it was for 21 days
worth of medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I had to take them to my house and
teach them how to turn into a suspension
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was concentrate, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the current state of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even with the dispensary making no
profit, that family could not afford to
[SPEAKER_00]: get back in and give that medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spent the $800 they had, it bought
them about 20 days, and then they have
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is for a young child who has
Dravet syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last I heard, they had run out of
medicine and he was in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've lost kids since this law's gone
in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the current state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to be a big bummer,
but what I want is for people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate about this to be in no doubt
and not spread the myth that cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: here and everything's fine and access is
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a business owner, I think it's
important to understand what patients need
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we can start producing products
that will actually benefit critically ill
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of what we hear is that the market
is saturated, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's got the same things,
but they don't realize that I've got 150
[SPEAKER_00]: families who can't find the medicine they
need in a single dispensary in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a market that needs to be
filled, and it's about education and
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to make sure before we ran out
of time that we had some understanding as
[SPEAKER_00]: to why, when I say it's worse now than it
was in 1994, why that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collectives are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Charities can no longer exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost is unaffordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The products are unavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because now we're violating state law,
the 215 is still around, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: protections are not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the National Guard from Gavin
Newsom going in and busting cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers, and the consequences are way
higher, way higher now than they were
[SPEAKER_00]: prior to Proposition 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: What part of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: The question was does Colorado have a
framework?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a very good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think what California had that
Colorado and a lot of other states didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have is it had 20 years to refine medical
cannabis charities and collectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of these states just
jumped into legalization, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of them, what I find,
they don't know what they don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: they're missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, you might not hear as much of
an outcry out of families and parents in
[SPEAKER_00]: other states, but it's really because they
just don't understand what they could be
[SPEAKER_00]: getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some families get a little bit
of benefit from whatever CBD products are
[SPEAKER_00]: around, but there's a big difference in
the 10 or 20% efficacy from products that
[SPEAKER_00]: are too weak and getting 80 or 90%
efficacy from being able to die and dial
[SPEAKER_00]: in specific products for kids that are
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no compassion or charity model
that I know of in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the Collager's Network was
around, we helped families from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't able to get medicine to all of
them, but we had educational services for
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone who called.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got the most calls from families in
Washington, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't there some sort of framework that
was being developed to allow for this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then it didn't get, what was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I'm hogging the mic here,
I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so last year we worked on SB,
it was 812, that 829?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's so many numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's SB 34 this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how quickly it's in and out of my
memory as soon as Governor Brown vetoed
[SPEAKER_00]: it, which is what he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we worked really hard to start to
develop California compassion model so
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can be recognized as an entity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because right now, the Collager's Network,
someone who just helped terminally ill
[SPEAKER_00]: kids, is the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone who's getting legal,
this goes into, again, why it's worse now
[SPEAKER_00]: than it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the people who are helping the
Collager's Network, as they get legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can no longer interact with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's diversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the black market now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no way to identify who we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would have allowed us to be
identified as a compassion program so at
[SPEAKER_00]: least we can interact, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give you stuff, you can give me
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're someone on paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got Republican and Democrat
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this political climate today,
if that doesn't tell you that it was good,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't get bipartisan support on
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask them what color the sky is and
they vote 51 purple and 49 pink.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had bipartisan support.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got all the way to Governor Brown's
desk and then he vetoed it with really no
[SPEAKER_00]: explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just said he saw it as a tax bet and
people would just be diverting for tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
