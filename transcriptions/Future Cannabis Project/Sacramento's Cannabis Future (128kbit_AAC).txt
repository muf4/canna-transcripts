[SPEAKER_01]: You know one of the things that I'm always
curious is really around the market size
[SPEAKER_01]: right particularly around delivery I think
we've got a pretty good handle on at least
[SPEAKER_01]: what we believe the size of the market for
our storefront is but you know but but
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you think the the size of the you
know greater Sacramento area you know
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery market is I know so I'm not the
only reason I jumped into Oakland was
[SPEAKER_00]: because that was the easiest place to get
licensing but I'm a lot more familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Sacramento market I think on weed maps
horrible topic to bring up but on weed
[SPEAKER_00]: maps right on weed maps beginning of the
year there was about 140 150 delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: services and they were all thriving and
operating in equilibrium but now weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: legal ones they were definitely not legal
but they were they were thriving and
[SPEAKER_00]: operating but now we have in the city of
Sacramento I think 70 applicants right
[SPEAKER_01]: correct we have 70 applications for non
storefront delivery right now so I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that it would be reasonable to say that we
can we can sustain another 70 to get back
[SPEAKER_00]: to that level of equilibrium at about 140
to 150 operators and have fair market
[SPEAKER_01]: share for each each operator do you think
it's is how large is is the size of the of
[SPEAKER_01]: the retail delivery market relative to
storefronts do you think is it is it 25%
[SPEAKER_01]: is it half I've heard numbers all the way
from half down to a very specific 12% man
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody that has a very specific percent
like that is really watching their
[SPEAKER_00]: analytics but I would say I would say it's
about half the market just because every
[SPEAKER_00]: every delivery driver can only complete so
many deliveries in a day versus a
[SPEAKER_00]: storefront can take in an unlimited amount
of foot traffic so they have they have
[SPEAKER_00]: that advantage there so it's you know just
just in my experience and I actually had a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary in LA as well previously to
having that's why I moved into delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: was because the market was so saturated
down here and I would say it's roughly 50%
[SPEAKER_00]: the business that you're able to conduct
with the storefront compared to delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: Sacramento has been on the forefront of
the industry as a whole since January 1
[SPEAKER_00]: they've really tried to push the envelope
and make make a lot happen beforehand and
[SPEAKER_00]: be one of the cities that was out in front
of the problem to be a pioneer for for
[SPEAKER_00]: other cities to use as an example Joe
would be a lot more familiar with with the
[SPEAKER_00]: trials of tribulations that have come with
that because I know there's been a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: victories but then he also comes to blame
when things don't go right Sacramento is
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely not Berkeley you know and I
love I love Berkeley I love the Bay Area
[SPEAKER_01]: but Sacramento is you know always been
much more you know moderate in all of its
[SPEAKER_01]: politics relative to the coastal cities I
mean we are essentially Valley City I
[SPEAKER_01]: think where we what we have been is just
is very pragmatic and realistic about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis I think the council and mayor
showed early leadership on a complicated
[SPEAKER_01]: subject at that moment at least
politically when they really acknowledged
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know what we have cannabis in our
community the last 30 years of
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibitions and enforcement on on in the
war on drugs did nothing to remove
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis from our community and so let's
try something different and you know the
[SPEAKER_01]: people were collecting signatures and they
were gonna they were gonna put this ballot
[SPEAKER_01]: initiative on the on the ballot and you
know and we saw that coming and and we had
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations like okay we think this
thing is gonna qualify for the ballot and
[SPEAKER_01]: if it gets on we're pretty sure this time
around it's gonna pass and so we took
[SPEAKER_01]: steps early on to proactively develop our
regulatory framework that wasn't wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: easy there are a lot of internal battles
around you know what do we need to do in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to prepare for that and you know
where does this you know where does this
[SPEAKER_01]: permitting authority need to you know even
live within the city and there are still
[SPEAKER_01]: you know small battles every day around
you know how do we how do we do this and
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we do this better so after the
district six cap was implemented do you
[SPEAKER_00]: see that rolling out across all the other
districts do you see that impeding us in
[SPEAKER_00]: the city of Sacramento's operators
reaching that hundred and fifty target
[SPEAKER_01]: market where we once were at I don't we're
where I where I actually see this
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially going is and and so might have
my head for this but look as I think as we
[SPEAKER_01]: gain more experiences I think we can have
more informed conversations around what is
[SPEAKER_01]: a rational reasonable policy and maybe the
two and a half million square foot cap
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have currently in council district
six stays forever maybe after some of
[SPEAKER_01]: those come online and a lot of it is
distribution that maybe shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: applied towards that cap maybe we should
have that conversation about pulling out
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution and you know maybe there's a
conversation we had around lifting that
[SPEAKER_01]: cap around you know after we have some
more data on what those impacts
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially are you know one of the things
that we while we have a cap we don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't have two and a million square
feet of applications yet and so there's
[SPEAKER_01]: still some property speculation I guess
within that part of the market and so I
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's going to take a little bit of
time to figure out but I think as we get
[SPEAKER_01]: more data we'll have more informed
conversations policy as it relates to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is going to be never-ending I
mean this is pretty much the you know
[SPEAKER_01]: attorney full employment act so you know I
think like everything else cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: related it's going to be an evolution yeah
I was surprised to hear that from Laurie
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier too talking about the regulations
that every everybody was under the
[SPEAKER_00]: assumption this was it after these final
edits and she said this is going to be an
[SPEAKER_00]: evolving process over the next coming
years this may very well not be it so I
[SPEAKER_00]: can I can imagine on the city level it's
going to be the same as well absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the the reality is is that this
industry is going to continue to innovate
[SPEAKER_01]: much quicker than anyone can regulate and
so industry is going to get out in front
[SPEAKER_01]: of regulation you know call it a loophole
whatever you want to call it but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to innovate to meet customer and
consumer demands and regulation by nature
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be you know behind that
innovation and so we're gonna have to
[SPEAKER_01]: continuously adopt what we do and how we
do it if we're ever gonna I think help
[SPEAKER_01]: this help the consumer transition into
that legal space as well as helping the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis businesses himself trans
transition into that legal space do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think on-site consumption is on the menu
for the city of Sacramento coming soon I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know about soon I think we're gonna
have that conversation beginning early
[SPEAKER_01]: next year we're gonna start it at the
policy committee and in the city it's you
[SPEAKER_01]: know we'll see where it goes I think this
is on site consumption is is gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: really where each community is gonna have
to really kind of dig deep and and and
[SPEAKER_01]: make some you know big choices around
around what that looks like in their
[SPEAKER_01]: community I think between the on-site
consumption that's possible at
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries and now these special events
that can take place outside of county
[SPEAKER_01]: fairgrounds on-site consumption is gonna
look very different in a probably in a
[SPEAKER_01]: short period of time in different cities
San Francisco has an absolute need to have
[SPEAKER_01]: a very robust conversation around on-site
consumption in places other than other
[SPEAKER_01]: than you know this handful of dispensaries
they have so many people that come to that
[SPEAKER_01]: city every day that stay in hotels and
Airbnb's and some percent of those folks
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke cannabis and so in addition to the
population there that smokes cannabis I've
[SPEAKER_01]: heard that some people smoke cannabis in
San Francisco you know so they're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: have to have that conversation you know do
they do they allow a lot of these events
[SPEAKER_01]: to take place in Golden Gate Park I think
the other piece that's interesting as it
[SPEAKER_01]: relates to on-site consumption is you know
is there a conversation we had around
[SPEAKER_01]: designated consumption areas right so it's
not that consumption can only take place
[SPEAKER_01]: at a dispensary but it's the proverbial
yoga studio I get an email a week from a
[SPEAKER_01]: yoga studio hey can we smoke before class
you know no is the answer but you know is
[SPEAKER_01]: there a way where that could be done you
know safely and respectfully to the
[SPEAKER_01]: community around it you know and then
cities you know that are you know very
[SPEAKER_01]: dense can have those conversations like
okay we've got a thousand people a day
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking cannabis in this park do we want
to acknowledge that that's happening you
[SPEAKER_01]: know and and put some kind of you know
framework around it around how we would
[SPEAKER_01]: like it to happen you know otherwise
you're looking at you know really just
[SPEAKER_01]: rules that you're not enforcing and I
don't think that that you know does
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody any good that's speaking to
temporary events so in the interim while
[SPEAKER_00]: the city wraps its mind around the
discussion of on-site consumption is there
[SPEAKER_00]: a possibility for temporary events to
occur in Sacramento for and and allowable
[SPEAKER_00]: on-site consumption for those temporary
events or is that something the city's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna hold off on until on-site
consumption is completely ironed out as a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole no we're gonna I'm very
intentionally trying to bifurcate those
[SPEAKER_01]: those those two issues I think that they
are well related though the can the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation on on-site consumption is
incredibly more complicated and political
[SPEAKER_01]: so we're gonna be moving forward with an
ordinance to allow what would essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: allow the city manager to approve special
events that would take place at a county
[SPEAKER_01]: fairground and then and then I think at
the early part of next year we'll address
[SPEAKER_01]: the the new state bill that would
potentially allow us to have special
[SPEAKER_01]: events at places outside of outside of the
the county fairground it's for local
[SPEAKER_01]: governments and for local elected it's
just a lot I mean I feel like I bring it
[SPEAKER_01]: an item agenda item before them every week
and and and and they get a little you know
[SPEAKER_01]: tight they get a little tired of talking
about cannabis you know they have other
[SPEAKER_01]: things to do they're trying to you know
run entire cities and be responsive to the
[SPEAKER_01]: totality of a community's needs and not
just this one particular thing you know
[SPEAKER_01]: over time it will die down over time it's
gonna be a little bit more normal but you
[SPEAKER_01]: know we're gonna we've been taking a
steady incremental approach to this and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna I think kind of keep plugging
away at it until it's until it's done
[SPEAKER_00]: something I've seen come up in a couple of
different cities and I know from somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: else that I work with is the tiered tax
measures so if somebody like myself who's
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to vertically integrate in the
city of Sacramento every every operational
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint is effectively taxed at the 5%
so it'd be manufacturing distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation and then delivery retail that
would collect the 4% or 5% attack being an
[SPEAKER_00]: effective 20% tax measure on top of excise
tax and the other taxes is that something
[SPEAKER_00]: that this city can consider I know that
the city is already trying to or talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about micro business licensing is there a
way to consolidate those to be a single
[SPEAKER_01]: business tax or is that we are we are
absolutely looking at that like I think
[SPEAKER_01]: everything cannabis related it's been a
lot and we've tried to get it right the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time and you quickly realize that
you know you maybe if you're lucky you got
[SPEAKER_01]: it mostly right we've begun the
conversation around our current tax
[SPEAKER_01]: structure and how to not just remain
competitive within the region compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: other cities but you know primarily the
goal is ensuring that businesses are
[SPEAKER_01]: successful because that's the only way the
illicit market goes away we need
[SPEAKER_01]: successful legal cannabis businesses that
consumers can access so we'll be having
[SPEAKER_01]: that conversation I expect that to
probably start becoming more more more
[SPEAKER_01]: public in the next couple of months you
