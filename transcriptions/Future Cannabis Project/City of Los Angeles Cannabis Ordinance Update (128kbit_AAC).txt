[SPEAKER_00]: The amazing news that we have been able to
make over the last two years is that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can grow in the City of LA, you can
manufacture, you will be able to operate
[SPEAKER_00]: in various segments of the industry here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to pause and say, that was not
always a given.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, two years ago, what we were facing
was a really locked down on the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and a proposal amongst certain established
operators to be vertically integrated and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of keep the industry, I hesitate to
use the word monopoly, but in a very
[SPEAKER_00]: constricted industry versus a much more
open market.
[SPEAKER_01]: To constrict competitiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for so many reasons, that makes no
sense, including that there are people who
[SPEAKER_00]: are cultivating as we're speaking about
growing cannabis today, people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating cannabis in the City of Los
Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The City of LA is probably 30% of
California's market, California's 49% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire national market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a huge consuming base, the biggest
market in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tons of folks who are growing
really high quality cannabis here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: warehouse or even in the small areas where
there are opportunities for greenhouse in
[SPEAKER_00]: that type of a setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am happy to report that there will
purportedly be a pathway to permitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now why I say purportedly is that I have
been involved in this political process
[SPEAKER_00]: very heavily and that's literally a nearly
daily process for the last two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're dealing with a bohemoth of a
city.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a Culver City where there are
five City Council members and it is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to communicate with those folks in
the mayor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the City of LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where there are 15 separate City Council
members with their own districts and their
[SPEAKER_00]: own challenges and their own concerns
around this or maybe they don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: touch it and there are 96 neighborhood
councils in the City of Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in taking up this fight, which is
really what it's been, a massive effort,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it helps the folks who are
operating here as well as their
[SPEAKER_00]: reverberations across the state and across
really the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: How LA goes, other cities and counties,
other states of the world watches in so
[SPEAKER_00]: many regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to have a very well regulated
but also regulated from the existing and
[SPEAKER_00]: new cannabis business owner perspective in
the City of LA for the entire supply chain
[SPEAKER_00]: and California's attempt to regulate a
huge industry of that's gonna work,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to have things organized here in
Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But things are only organized as we see
this from the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: If folks who are in the industry come on
board, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in like Humboldt, Mendocino,
those areas, I think I read a statistic
[SPEAKER_00]: that 11% of the existing growers had
actually registered with those counties
[SPEAKER_00]: that had local rules and a permitting
process in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So laws are only as good as we who are
ruled by them follow them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need to, we have a ways to go
here in LA, even though we're coming upon
[SPEAKER_00]: 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where we're at in the City of LA is no
one still has a business permit,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, manufacturers, even dispensaries
that are prop D, so this kind of small
[SPEAKER_00]: subset group, no one has an actual permit
issued by the City of Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The City of Los Angeles yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where we're at is in a rulemaking
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, if you are a grower in the
City of Los Angeles, my advice is look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the draft rules that came out for zoning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was the first set of draft rules
that came out on June 8th.
[SPEAKER_00]: A second set of draft rules came out last
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will see that there are certain
areas in the City of Los Angeles that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can cultivate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are certain sensitive uses,
schools, et cetera, that you may need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a certain number of feet away from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so analyze your location or your
prospective location based on zoning under
[SPEAKER_00]: the proposed rule, understanding these are
proposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just look at the City of Los Angeles
and their map.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hire a zoning person to do that,
a professional that will look at the draft
[SPEAKER_00]: ordinance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, make sure you loop in with a
political organization, a local advocacy
[SPEAKER_00]: group that knows what's going on,
like the Los Angeles Cannabis Task Force.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, there are some other groups
around the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank goodness there are other cannabis
advocacy groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can really understand the other X
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I think about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will go into, will this be a
permittable location?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some of it, for example,
last week at the planning department in
[SPEAKER_00]: City Hall, based on testimony that was
being given by certain heads of certain
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations, I was outside calling the
zoning guy we use and certain of the
[SPEAKER_00]: clients and sending emails saying,
gosh, I really think we may need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned about this particular use and
whether you are the appropriate number of
[SPEAKER_00]: feet away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think I have a feeling in the
third draft or the finalized rules,
[SPEAKER_00]: that may end up being an issue for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: For certain folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's having your eye on an unfolding
political process, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So where you're at, you know, in what
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then thinking about do you own that
property?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you planning on buying it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you want that purchase to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you lease the property?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have the appropriate contingencies
in the lease?
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of how do you structure that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the name of the game right now on
some level is preserving your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assume, it is, it is, you know,
and get comfortable with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assume that everything will cost five
times as long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will cost five times as much and take five
times as long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, of course, is nothing anyone wants
to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is, again, not a well-oiled
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it turns out that your particular
property would be okay if or isn't okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you've got to be nimble and ready to
kind of move, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just give an example of like one
of those if things?
[SPEAKER_00]: As an example, MAU Cursa, so our State
Medical and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation
[SPEAKER_00]: and Safety Act, has a section that says
cannabis businesses need to be 600 feet
[SPEAKER_00]: from schools and a couple of other uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless a municipality specifies otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that mean municipalities can go under
600 feet or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying this is a question of law
and interpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lawyers and regulators, and we're all
kind of like trying to figure out,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the city of Los Angeles, even though
the city's proposed zoning ordinance says
[SPEAKER_00]: growers do not need to, are not restricted
by that 600 feet requirement for schools,
[SPEAKER_00]: daycare centers, or use centers,
it said that up on the screen,
[SPEAKER_00]: as the planning department was giving its
presentation, I still, I recommend to be
[SPEAKER_00]: measured and thoughtful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you are 600 feet from a school
property line to property line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the other two types of uses I
identified, you could go either way,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I certainly want the mapping guy to
identify everything so that I know,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, here is the facility Now,
it's 600 feet from a school, but there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: daycare center over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so now we're going to, we,
if you were my client, we're going to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand that we don't know,
that we won't have the finalized zoning
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations for the next several weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The application window may open November
1st or December 1st, and you may have 60
[SPEAKER_00]: days to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more than likely what's about to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 60 days to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: These applications are incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're incredibly voluminous,
probably so, based on what we see in the
[SPEAKER_00]: draft regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that requires coordination with
someone in fire safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: That requires coordination with a security
company, an operations company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your local application needs to reflect
the local rules in this city, not to
[SPEAKER_00]: mention the state law, not to mention all
the other X factors of issues that
[SPEAKER_00]: building and safety and these other city
departments are going to need to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would want you to know that you may
be able to continue operating,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's no guarantee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will probably, you know,
if you get through these certain hoops,
[SPEAKER_00]: is your property up to snuff in terms of
have you pulled the appropriate permits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you haven't?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's deal with that issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a lot of this is about massive
game planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the universe of information?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is knowable?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's not knowable?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your particular issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's not knowable?
What's not knowable?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's not knowable?
