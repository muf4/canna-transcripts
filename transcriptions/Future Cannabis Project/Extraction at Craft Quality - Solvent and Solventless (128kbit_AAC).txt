[SPEAKER_00]: Here, that's the GMO right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you already smell it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I did, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wedding cake and purple punch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wedding cake and purple punch?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, that sounds like it's still
just wedding cake though, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just feel like I only see it on fake
packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like how Noah was saying he makes
brass knuckles, I was like, no you don't!
[SPEAKER_05]: No one makes brass knuckles!
[SPEAKER_05]: They're fake, I thought!
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought they were fake this whole time!
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not in California, so I only see them
on the Instagram of people who are like
[SPEAKER_05]: three more states east of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I assume they're fake!
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, the best part about it was Noah not
realizing, he goes, you know, talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about DHA and we're like, yeah we know
that already, but it like blew his,
[SPEAKER_03]: like you could tell that it still
surprised him that it was such a knockoff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well that's because he's like so sweet and
innocent, it doesn't know that people be
[SPEAKER_05]: out here putting like literally anything
in a cartridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: She knows him too, they're actually also
from Ohio, but he lives out here,
[SPEAKER_03]: but he's old, he's from, he was an
extractor in Denver for, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_03]: three, four years, and he moved here last
year, and he runs a lab here, and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: like, dude can we come over?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he's all like, he's walking down
the street and sees us, and he's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh I make distillate for brass knuckles,
and like five other companies,
[SPEAKER_03]: and Murphy's like, yeah like what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's not an actual source,
but you know what, now what I can do is
[SPEAKER_05]: get some from him and flex so hard on the
whole internet, I have real brass
[SPEAKER_03]: knuckles, real brass knuckles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna come get, what room is it,
do you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Pasadena, cool, in that hallway?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll come catch you, I want to see her,
she's so sassy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh perfect, even better.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just like listening to her talk,
I like her.
[SPEAKER_05]: Her attitude on stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah pleasure, we'll see you guys soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want a dab?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, do you want another one?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in the hotel, we're on the fourth
floor, both of us are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, yeah you guys go in the events later
this evening, like whatever, happy hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah we just got our badge for her shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dying to pop some of those seeds,
I saw them in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Portland talking about like auto
flower seeds, and I was like, you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: still keep a little grow, like just for my
own hobby, and it's been kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: laborious, I'm like maybe I should just
switch over to auto flower, and just like
[SPEAKER_00]: have one room, and just plant them,
and then let them flower, and then just go
[SPEAKER_00]: from seed every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who are you going with, like Mephisto or?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got some Cropkin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Cropkin was, I don't know,
are there a lot of people in the auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower game I guess?
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are better than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually what I'm interested in
kind of exploring, like everybody talks
[SPEAKER_01]: about Mephisto, so I want to see,
like I want to grow it out myself and be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, alright, it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean what's sweet about it,
like because people are, if you like look
[SPEAKER_05]: in the like the auto flower groups and
stuff, like the people that are against it
[SPEAKER_05]: are really like aggressively, angrily
against it, and it's like, you know you
[SPEAKER_05]: could just like grow a plant, and if it
doesn't work out, like you can just grow
[SPEAKER_05]: another plant, like a different plant,
you know, like the consequences of it not
[SPEAKER_05]: working out are like pretty small unless
you like just plant 50 acres because you
[SPEAKER_05]: don't research first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I try some diamonds?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, of course, please try whatever you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so first of all, what was the
first thing you offered first,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the GMO or the peanut butter breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, here's the peanut butter,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what do you want to smoke of
hers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some diamonds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I've got, they're basically all
diamonds, kind of fun mentally because the
[SPEAKER_05]: turpentine content is high, so they just
always separate anyway, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got sour clementine over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's a raspberry lychee,
and then this one's Death by Cookies,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is Death Star and Cookies,
which is a weird combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the jars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they, I actually hate them.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, so the opaque part is a requirement
for regulations, and so yeah, and so the
[SPEAKER_05]: way the company's make the jars opaque is
they just paint a clear jar, so inside the
[SPEAKER_05]: jar, you can see the imperfections of the
paint job on the outside of the jar,
[SPEAKER_05]: so it looks like there's black shit in my
hash because it's like a wrinkle in the
[SPEAKER_05]: paint behind the jar, you know,
and so it's maddening to package,
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can't tell if there like is a
thing in your hash or not, and then people
[SPEAKER_05]: take a picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here it's always a perfectly white
background against the amber and brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that is delicious.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the paint part is difficult,
but yeah, so super clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you left ETS, and are you just doing it
yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in with the company right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I have a couple of things going
on, but I started, I partnered with Sano
[SPEAKER_05]: Gardens, which is not a garden at all,
mostly because I got involved,
[SPEAKER_05]: and so I turned their grow rooms into
extraction space because I needed more
[SPEAKER_05]: room, so.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are a live resin only processing
company.
[SPEAKER_05]: All we make is live resin, it's all
filtered through adsorbents using that
[SPEAKER_05]: like Aqua CRC tag, and so, you know,
it's just that one product and that one
[SPEAKER_05]: niche, and we do it the best that we
possibly can, and I got involved with them
[SPEAKER_05]: because they were brand new to the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: 2019 is a really interesting year to
decide to become a medical dispensary in
[SPEAKER_05]: Denver, or a medical MIPS, in Denver,
Colorado, because the market is crazy
[SPEAKER_05]: saturated with a lot of competitive low
pricing, you know, low quality on the
[SPEAKER_05]: inputs, like it's, you know, all of the
premier brands are running the exact same
[SPEAKER_05]: material, so it's really hard to have like
an angle over anyone else, and what I
[SPEAKER_05]: needed was a place to try out my
experiments on higher quality material
[SPEAKER_05]: because I'd just been consulting for the
previous five years, and under the
[SPEAKER_05]: pretense of consulting, people bring you
in because things are not going well,
[SPEAKER_05]: because the material is poor, because the
equipment is non-performing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't call you and they're like,
so things are going really well,
[SPEAKER_05]: our material is extremely high quality,
and we're just wondering what we can do to
[SPEAKER_05]: get better, like that's never the higher,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I needed a place to test some ideas,
and Sano Gardens allowed me to come in the
[SPEAKER_05]: lab and try out some weird stuff with
their fresh resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where I'm getting to this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what it's often referred to as color
remediation, I don't like that name
[SPEAKER_05]: because color is in a compound,
and some things that are colored aren't
[SPEAKER_05]: contaminants, and some things are,
so it's a bad way to describe it,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's the, you know, the nomenclature
of the day, and the idea there is we're
[SPEAKER_05]: using polar adsorbents to remove polar
compounds within our extraction process,
[SPEAKER_05]: and so with a hydrocarbon as our solvent,
it's extremely non-polar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of our target compounds like terpenes
and cannabinoids are non-polar,
[SPEAKER_05]: and so those adsorbents disallow the
things that we don't want like moisture,
[SPEAKER_05]: things that are soluble in moisture,
heavy metals, pesticides, salts,
[SPEAKER_05]: sugars, stuff that we don't want in our
final product, and it allows everything
[SPEAKER_05]: else through.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know exactly what the perfect
ratio of the ideal hash oil really is,
[SPEAKER_05]: but when you compare the high-end solvent
list to the high-end solvent made,
[SPEAKER_05]: we have the same compounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna see almost the same THCA
ratios in your high-end versus mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna see really high terpene ratios
in your high-end versus mine, because it
[SPEAKER_05]: turns out that if you do a really good job
extracting, you get really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the exact conversation we were
talking about to pair you as a
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent-less extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to be fair, I mean, Mary sold me my
first light hydrocarbon apparatus,
[SPEAKER_00]: so much respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the IG's on fire, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started following you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm partial to light hydrocarbon
extractions, and it is because the
[SPEAKER_00]: product, it's the best extraction
methodology, and of course, people out
[SPEAKER_00]: there would argue about cryoethanol and
CO2, and even refining to distillate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, good light hydrocarbon processes
do get you all the, they get you all that
[SPEAKER_00]: you need, what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things we know for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what's in the trichome head is another
way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like those materials are the ones you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other ones need to be filtered out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all coming through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it's so, yeah, this is like,
yeah, definitely very happy to be here
[SPEAKER_00]: with you, because it's just like,
literally, I mean, like I've been growing
[SPEAKER_00]: for a while, but my first step into like
the legit cannabis world, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I like transported myself to
Denver, started building that MIP,
[SPEAKER_00]: and like, it was just awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, first adult use type things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, first, like going to a place,
like they had a facility to buy and get
[SPEAKER_00]: checked out on cannabis extraction
equipment, DemFlea first, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So super excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like now, you know, games,
definitely leveled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like none of these kinds of products were
being discussed back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just weren't at that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just happy for shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're having to have no residual
solvents.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for a really long time, and even still
now, like what people were always chasing
[SPEAKER_05]: with concentrates was like consistencies
and colors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so like the idea of color remediation,
I feel like is remediating our attitude
[SPEAKER_05]: towards color more than remediating the
product of color.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when I make these, none of these
are clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I make them, I have absolutely clear
THCA.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I have slightly colored phenols.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have, you know, like there are compounds
with colors that are in my, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: Super Nate and my Motherlick or whatever
that other solution, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just happens to still look really
clear when I, you know, bring it out by
[SPEAKER_05]: the gram.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like, I'm not removing color so much
as just bring, you know, using every
[SPEAKER_05]: resource I have to make it a little bit
better than before.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so like back when we met, that's what
getting a closed loop was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that was still you taking advantage
of every opportunity that you could and
[SPEAKER_05]: all of the technology that was available
to make the best thing that you could.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the time, probably the best advice
I had was like, use propane.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more selective.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, like we get, we get better
because we learn more and that's not going
[SPEAKER_05]: to stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, TBD till next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: This year is just really exciting because
people are finally starting to embrace
[SPEAKER_05]: some of this change.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something that's been really
hard to do for a long time because the
[SPEAKER_05]: market was so competitive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything sold.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no reason to get better because
if you could just get shatter,
[SPEAKER_05]: you could get money.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people gave up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I'm hearing is that in
Colorado, which is, I mean, the whole DAB
[SPEAKER_01]: market was there before anywhere else and
appreciation for extracted products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're basically saying that,
I mean, it's good to be the one who can
[SPEAKER_01]: say, and we decided our competitive
advantage would be best quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like our competitive advantage is we're
the cheapest or we're the fastest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Best quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody else had thought of that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, in our industry, it's now is the time
for like, like the top shelf, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fair point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in the beginning, not so much here in
California, but definitely in Denver,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like Safe Access was like such a
boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have, you just had to put out
product, like just put out product.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, I felt like, especially with
our company, like we were selling into a
[SPEAKER_00]: void.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to try to innovate or try to
raise the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, yeah, and look, look,
even this device, the peak, it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: normalizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically then they didn't want to pay
you for the Delta in quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we couldn't articulate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consumer had no palette.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so even if you think the alcohol
model, when we come out of prohibition,
[SPEAKER_00]: most people are so used to drinking soda
and milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no refined palette for spirits
or wine or beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that impacts America for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they had mixed drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a sweet thing mixed with
alcohol, but refined spirits, good wine,
[SPEAKER_00]: take a while to get that palette back.
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis, there's a few of us that may
have had it earlier on and didn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: have access to high end stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just happy for good flowers and
whatnot or extractions you might make at
[SPEAKER_00]: home.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now people are catching up quick,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Going into markets being Colorado and
California, you're both seeing a slow,
[SPEAKER_01]: like finally it's happening shift to
appreciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think every day at dispensaries,
there's a higher demand for quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we can talk about it,
let's just start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that like, you know, brand
ambassadors can go out and articulate the
[SPEAKER_00]: value proposition and the differentiation
of what you make your products and how you
[SPEAKER_00]: make them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like science education, like it takes
TLC to innovate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually people like myself and like
Mary talk about it and get passionate
[SPEAKER_00]: about how we make our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're thinking and putting like
energy into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I think consumers resonate with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, Oh, that those dudes are
doing it real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're that's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like, yeah, and then they taste
and everybody's palette is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and look, I'm really psyched on
concentrates because this could like these
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of devices and this kind of session
could mitigate like the vape pen craze
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I appreciate the convenience of
vape pen, it's like, I don't walk around
[SPEAKER_00]: with a flask, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your choices before were vape pen or
torch, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and there's a little bit of
ritual to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, while I appreciate the
convenience of a pen beyond just losing
[SPEAKER_00]: them all the time, I don't know that that
device will ever be ready for prime time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of these are solids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those pens are not really for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the heated chamber, but they're
also, if they're done right, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: potent enough to be curated, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just walked in here, have a session and
move on, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And go for quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody's going to think that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people that walk around with six
packs of paps, you know, and there's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be concentrates and pens for those
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the game is leveling up every
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the peak wasn't around last year,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year, it'll be something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be another either great device or
some new innovation in technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, obviously saucing diamonds,
all those things, you know, that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out lately are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a talk about, and so two markets,
the farmers you're working with,
[SPEAKER_01]: the dynamics between like, like what
cultivars are we smoking?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like, are you telling them what
you want?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are they being like, I have some hot
new shit that you guys definitely need to
[SPEAKER_01]: check out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the market difference is probably
huge then between us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause you know, one thing that I always
like to point out is that Colorado is
[SPEAKER_05]: famous for good concentrates and bad weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're doing our very best out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's probably a product of like,
we have a lot more sun grown and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, we do get good quality weed
and people nerd out on flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrates definitely, of course,
have had a rise here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our relationship, like, you know,
this is not actually just starting with
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yours is all source from sun grown,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all sourced from sun grown and it all
goes back to, to the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are trying to go for, just as a
value proposition, a farm to table,
[SPEAKER_00]: handcrafted product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so yeah, it's just, no one can
poke any holes in that brand positioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I, and I look, I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would not be able to effectuate the
strategy had we not had an already in
[SPEAKER_00]: another brand identity, like our core
brand identity with our topicals and our
[SPEAKER_00]: wellness suite.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that the tip of the spear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's allowed us to grow that marketplace
in dispensary, get revenue and now take
[SPEAKER_00]: our time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is definitely a quality over
margin product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes the labor to create these high
end concentrates, put them at a price
[SPEAKER_00]: point that only so many people are buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing that marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're out here talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to dab as many people out so that
they can understand what it is to have
[SPEAKER_00]: great low temperature vaporization and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love smoking flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes, it's like flour because
that's awesome in the tradition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, I'm all low temp
vaporization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you can harness everything,
all the flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yumminess that you need that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's really big.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're starting to talk about some of
the farms and like what, what,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are you both asking them?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they both asking you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you mostly source from indoor?
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everything that we source is indoor and
we only process fresh frozen at our
[SPEAKER_05]: facility, which is also a little bit more
specific because are you doing fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: frozen?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a lot of resistance to that
from a lot of farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to get really high quality,
fresh frozen on a consistent basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a limited market.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, for example, with the medical
license, all of those pounds and plants
[SPEAKER_05]: are literally still associated to
individual humans and that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: that market is shrinking.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so then it becomes harder to provide
enough cannabis for everyone, let alone
[SPEAKER_05]: enough cannabis for me to process and turn
into high quality concentrates.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, the amount of low
quality material that's available
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely is excessive compared to the
amount of, you know, high quality
[SPEAKER_05]: material, which makes it, you know,
restrictive marketplace.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also only purchase wholesale and sell
wholesale compared to where you're going,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and working directly with a farm
and right back.
[SPEAKER_05]: We hand pick, regardless of who our
supplier is, some suppliers, we purchase
[SPEAKER_05]: only specific things from them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we, you know, choose the best of what
they're growing in our opinion,
[SPEAKER_05]: or the stuff that's best for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: For our extraction, because the way that
you want to grow cannabis and the types of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis that are best for extraction are
not always the best for big fat colas and,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, nice, easy to sell high end
pounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, and especially with like solvent
lists as your application, that matters
[SPEAKER_05]: even more because your yield is so much
less accessible when it's difficult
[SPEAKER_05]: compared to my solvent that can dissolve
it easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's not even just the quality of
the material that we have to go after,
[SPEAKER_05]: but the like, the type of material itself,
because anything that's too dense,
[SPEAKER_05]: anything that is, you know, those big
giant, like football colas, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: is really not the best product for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking for surface area in
addition, you know, to having the,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the incredible potency and the
perfect, you know, turbine and flavor
[SPEAKER_05]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely the same for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, we send a truck out to the
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to, we test wash every strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at the, now that we're in our second
year or second set of cycles, we do have
[SPEAKER_00]: certain crops like the GMO being grown
consistently by the same farmer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's intimate relationship because
with this solvent list, it's about
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome head size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not every stain is going to wash well,
just straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing we can do about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to find the strains that wash
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What size are you going for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now is by eye, even though there's a
proposed technology we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop where we can take snapshots of the
trichomes and get a measurement and
[SPEAKER_00]: understand scientifically the average
trichome heads on this particular strain
[SPEAKER_00]: are this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get them at 90 or 120 and it'll
be perfect right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brady does that because he's a fucking
magician.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's still a little art.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm sure you could agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of art still in this
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like all good cutting edge
science, we have some good toolbox,
[SPEAKER_00]: like understandings of the apparatus and
the methodology of what we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: do, but we're trying to push it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to find the new and we're
trying to make it scalable, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if we can effectuate this
photographic way, it'll allow others to go
[SPEAKER_00]: and it'll allow us to maybe go through
different supply chains quicker in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of evaluating as opposed to test washing
everything, which takes time, but which is
[SPEAKER_00]: also fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's an intimate process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that we have some strains that
we're going to standardize, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've called for four of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'll still let the guys play because
of course, that's part of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always want to have the new,
new and some inconsistent product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But business demands and pressure is on me
to be like, can we just have like the same
[SPEAKER_00]: strain at the dispensary all the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're like, that's you should want
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do one and I am, look, we're toeing
the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that at one point, we'll be like a
sneaker company when we drop a strain on
[SPEAKER_00]: IG, people show up and it sells out and we
that happens a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some fan following, but that's the
level of quality of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's too much to ask for
quality, but we will put a consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought about like putting a lower tier
product as a high end brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a difficult choice to make
to like have a lower price point product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like you have to be really big
to offer like, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like the key chain at Tiffany's or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know something, you have a little
something, you have a little something,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can't have this, you know,
when you only get this on the holidays or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually don't, I don't believe in shiny
things at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, I don't understand
why I love spending money on the things
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm passionate about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate people are passionate
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the kind of four that are the
commercial?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your top 44?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not really for me to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely want Brady here, but I
definitely know the garlic cookies is one
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The THC bomb is running at like eight
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, there's some economics
around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like what washed well and had a good
like yummy profile and what we could
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage farmers to do a few hoop houses
or some full term.
[SPEAKER_00]: I built out a lot of good climate control
storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of fucking luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And freezers, power, power constraints for
walking freezers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, and we've also, you know,
especially well, I guess with both are
[SPEAKER_01]: they mobile?
[SPEAKER_01]: The freezers like you're.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have we have freezer trucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't really get frozen on the
truck, but they definitely stay fresh to
[SPEAKER_01]: the farm with your equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the truck is definitely it's a
freezer, but it's not like sub zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not going to freeze the product,
but it'll definitely start to mobilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the time it gets to the lab,
you know, depending on how far on the hill
[SPEAKER_00]: it is, our whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I immediately gets so Brady, you know,
it's like that thing like the dense coal
[SPEAKER_00]: is like we're wrestling and trying to
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start to macerate them,
you open up cell walls and that
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially is going to leach things that
you don't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, you want to have
surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been experimenting with
techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually only do smalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we partner with the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come through because, again,
outdoor, a little bit different process
[SPEAKER_00]: even from the harvesting perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll just take all the tops and then
they'll just be all the smalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we come later the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants have had those buds have had
a chance to like flesh out again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you see they're all and then we just
strip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how we macerate them is definitely
something that Brady watches carefully,
[SPEAKER_00]: because while we want surface area,
we also have to be careful not to break
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant up too much to let out certain
things that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you what equipment are you
using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hands right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although if I had to shout out pure
pressure for sure, we use pure pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: presses and we use pure pressure stainless
steel washing drums 50 percent,
[SPEAKER_00]: because some people still love a fucking
trash can, food safe trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we paddle by hand and we do use pure
pressure paddles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use pure pressure rosin bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, yeah, I mean, again,
that's just that Denver connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are my people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their equipment is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like they're at least
they're trying to scale the solvent list.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other other company other couple
of companies out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we do a lot of humble centric stuff,
pure pressure is definitely one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: brands that we work with that's not in
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are like SAS questions,
some rosin folks up north that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: partner with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now we mostly use pure pressure
equipment and lots of hands and TLC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what about so that that's at the press
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you get it off the farm,
are you using any machinery to just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like separate hands?
[SPEAKER_00]: That has to be hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like that's people literally like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we and it's definitely our team.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to let them do it and it would
show up in totes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Brady's a perfectionist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most extraction artists are
perfectionists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he takes these jars and has his team
wipe them out because they came from
[SPEAKER_00]: China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it leaves black on the floor,
I'm just like I kind of get shocked by the
[SPEAKER_00]: labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you cannot argue with quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm not mad about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, he wants, you know,
he's got this guy clean, but coming in,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's like we're like we're building clean
rooms to make hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, OK, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to go and take the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to take the product the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like while, you know, some of it,
believe it or not, to investors and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like if I to people who may not
understand, I'm like it's just for the
[SPEAKER_00]: ritual of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will I will articulate to the public and
document this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is not crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wine makers do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spirit makers do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Craft people do this kind of thing to
create quality products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on us as business people or marketing
people to articulate that to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is beyond brand story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we're taking all the videos in
the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because it's cool.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: For people that for people to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would argue that it's still it's
still a part of the scientific process
[SPEAKER_05]: because the fact that you go out and do it
puts accountability on you, which is
[SPEAKER_05]: really important to the scientific
process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone has to have been the one who did
the thing so you can report back and know
[SPEAKER_05]: what happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just have so much more data when
you can go and be there at the source.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like it's really easy to be
fooled when a grower says, I never spray
[SPEAKER_05]: anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you never go into their grow,
if you go into their grow to harvest their
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff and there's flying bugs in the air,
you may have the answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so like that relationship is important
for transparency, which is also important
[SPEAKER_05]: for that scientific process.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as artistic as it might be,
I think it's still very mathematical.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you can still absolutely calculate
the business advantage that comes from
[SPEAKER_05]: that, because you won't end up making a
poor decision based on a lack of
[SPEAKER_05]: information if you are more hands on,
or at least you won't be able to make that
[SPEAKER_05]: mistake twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you'll have made it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll learn all the way through that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's awesome because like we see
people like getting like some of our
[SPEAKER_00]: younger members just getting more
knowledgeable and like, yeah, there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: phoning in hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other thing is our guys are
incentivized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like unlike our other workers,
you if you don't show up to this job,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's at the farm or while you're
hand paddling, you will lose quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will lose extraction rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it's all extractors.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whoever is running your equipment,
regardless of the methodology,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to be in the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's you, if you think it's
automated, then you're just making crude.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to make a quality
product, every like nuance needs to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody is not, hearts not in it,
or they're not some some way tied to the
[SPEAKER_00]: economics or the upside.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden it's not a craft
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you were, I mean, if you were to
compare it to food, it's like someone who
[SPEAKER_05]: just makes Haribo gummy bears in a
factory.
[SPEAKER_05]: They make the same thing all day,
every single day.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter what they think or feel
about the product that they're making.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you take that to like someone who
makes confections in a bakery,
[SPEAKER_05]: one day they make maybe these little
cupcakes.
[SPEAKER_05]: One day they make the little candy
decorations that go on the cupcakes.
[SPEAKER_05]: The next day they're making different
icing for all of the different other cakes
[SPEAKER_05]: that they're going to make the next week.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the diversity of products that they
make is really what makes them good at
[SPEAKER_05]: their job.
[SPEAKER_05]: They might make the same type of gummy
bear that someone who works in a factory
[SPEAKER_05]: makes, but the someone who works in a
factory can't come in and make a different
[SPEAKER_05]: type of gummy bear also.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it doesn't make me a good extractor to
make good hash out of one thing one time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that just happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: What makes you good at it is to be able to
make good hash out of everything that you
[SPEAKER_05]: take in and to be able to repeat it all of
the time with wildly different material.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because even when you're talking about
like I've got four that I really like,
[SPEAKER_05]: those four aren't coming in at the same
bag size that you're choosing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not coming in probably even with
the same temperature and pressing
[SPEAKER_05]: necessarily.
[SPEAKER_05]: The size of batch that you're going to run
at a time might be different based on the
[SPEAKER_05]: way that they yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like all of those parameters make them
individual products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time I have a different strain,
even if I get the same consistency out of
[SPEAKER_05]: it, like I'm still making something
totally new.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's like the expertise is that
you need versatility to be able to do
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't phone in versatility.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can phone in a repetitive process.
[SPEAKER_05]: But even when you do the same thing,
it's not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the scaling comes in,
getting such a large team to be able to be
[SPEAKER_00]: on the same page all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, talk to me about one thing,
which is if the concept of long-term aging
[SPEAKER_01]: of hash, like a lot of times cannabis has
always been like it needs to be consumed
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the best time to consume it is
immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas some stuff you can cure it and age
it for a long term.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you could have concepts of like,
oh, the 2015 year was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these things peak like three to six
years out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your batches become more
valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's more in Frenchies game,
I guess, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And cured hash is definitely not my
personal skill set.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flour that can hold so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's an interesting one,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think flours are definitely perishable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can immobilize them to a good end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's all you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like terpenes or VOCs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to oxidize whether you smoke
them or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same is true with like cigars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you can't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can only be sold.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can bring out a cigar from your 60s
and be like, hey.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like wine in that model.
[SPEAKER_00]: But definitely true Moroccan hash can age
and definitely gets older and more CBN-y
[SPEAKER_00]: and more sleek.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has a distinct taste, aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can see that in cigars in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you put in a good Canagar,
freshly rolled with old 20-year-old
[SPEAKER_00]: Moroccan hash or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm sure there are people that are
passionate about those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I unfortunately have to start to
bounce on you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did promise we have a tour of cannabis
dispensaries to hit and get back here at
one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just quickly, what did you bring?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've got, let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got some sour clam over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then raspberry lychee.
[SPEAKER_05]: And death by cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you brought what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, garlic cookies, mainly, papaya,
wedding crashers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peanut butter breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Banana lychee.
[SPEAKER_00]: These last few events, I've had a good
time just posting up like this and just
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's like Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frenchy's heaven is being in the middle of
the event with his six arms.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the best way to spread the word,
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't argue with the taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when you know your shit's good,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the best picture with Frenchy in
the background wafting the coals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a completely different smoking
experience, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: This definitely has, I mean, even,
again, the drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: With our solvent, this hash, we use a
freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like next-gen drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the same art and curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the freeze dryer has its nuances,
to be sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what are the freeze dryer,
its pluses and minuses versus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Above my pay grade, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you a little bit about what's
it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sublimation or vacuum sublimation,
whatever the type of term for freeze
[SPEAKER_00]: drying is and why it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the nuances and the timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look, it's all in the prep,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it becomes a hand feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: How they lay out the... So basically,
as it comes out of the bags, you scoop it
[SPEAKER_00]: up and it looks like sand, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the thickness that that patty
is, how it gets stacked in the oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with working a vac oven,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I feel like I used to
understand my vac oven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, from Marie's point,
there's numbers somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could find the computer and bring the
number back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden, that would bring
the cook's experience back to front,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in a way, I guess with science,
data is your recipe, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You go back and you're like, oh,
these were the variables that I used and
[SPEAKER_00]: it worked perfectly, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So even things like testing just different
thicknesses and being like, that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect thickness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fuck, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, look, I'm sure on the light
hydrochromes side, just the way you pack
[SPEAKER_00]: your columns, the way, again, the material
is macerated, all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's wildly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sitting on a panel the other day
with a guy from Hammer Mill, like grind
[SPEAKER_00]: shit to a pulp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking, oh, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are people out there,
especially on the on the head side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a massive, massive surface area
blasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get dark as crude oil, but then
they're refining it to distillate anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just big ass, you know, short path
distillation.
[SPEAKER_05]: The hardest way to make distillate because
you have to do so much like prep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, it's just, you know, it's the
longest road.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree to the same, you know,
high purity product.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you would just be faster than the
first.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just silly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's just silliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll see you guys later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to run and buy some desert
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny that like part of the job is
going to dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always buy pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how we're going to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always have to see.
Yeah.
Yeah.
