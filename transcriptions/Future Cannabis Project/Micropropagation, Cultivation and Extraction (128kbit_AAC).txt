[SPEAKER_03]: I talk about you even though, even if I'm
not talking to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, oh, I'm hyped for Hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope she's doing good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like those things for our friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when we see each other,
like we get, we're like, oh man,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking about you, but I didn't
tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I was, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we get together,
it's like we were never apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like Hope's like a sister to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I care about you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think actually that- And I've seen
you at different stages of your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what's so great is like,
Hope is like on her peak game.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like seeing that like up rise and
like, oh, just peak sand valleys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like you've seen mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I'm a hot mess getting divorced,
you know, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing that and being able to love their
rise because you could, you could inspire
[SPEAKER_03]: your friends to do what's in their heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: But nobody can do anything but you,
like yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like seeing like her being inspired
and like being inspired by her own fuel is
[SPEAKER_03]: the shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I am not around people that are as
passionate- Dragging you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be around and with people that
are genuine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I love her actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genuine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genuine and passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: She took care of me last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That she turned on the whole, what do you
need?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the mom?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was moming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, man, I haven't had my kids to
take care of for two whole days.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have seen a talk that Jane's given.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a year ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and it was very extraction
focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular talk, what grabbed me
about it was it was a lot of buildup into
[SPEAKER_00]: what makes great extraction is good
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you put in matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then not just to stop, not just to say
that and stop, but to go into how do we
[SPEAKER_00]: know what is good that we're putting in,
starting with seeds and clones and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the pros and cons of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the hashtag give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it it speaks to my heart because I
swear like a sailor because I just well,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's just who I am and it's how I grew
up and it doesn't always have to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: most scientific words to drive a point
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be very direct and straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, look, if you give a shit
means you're going to pay attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: what the plants and the crops are saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to give a shit when I'm
buying those finished products and making
[SPEAKER_00]: the products that I love and that drives
my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now seeing you become a grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How has your given a shit actually
changed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because were you very I mean, you I know
always love the plan, but has it changed
[SPEAKER_00]: even more so being a grower now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think it's brought it a little
more into that commercial wavelength that
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't have thought of before because
I didn't it was so focused on the quality
[SPEAKER_03]: of the medicine for me before.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's and so what state are you in?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in Colorado and California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me to be able to say, OK,
I've got my little plants in my little
[SPEAKER_03]: backyard and and I'm going to have this
one that I grow for this friend that
[SPEAKER_03]: suffers with this ailment and I'm going to
do this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this is like because it's
freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So seeing me going from 12 plants to right
now, there's 1200 plants in the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very indicative of how our
industry went from exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm very feeling that more than
hearing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what has happened was having to have
the huge free planning of where every
[SPEAKER_03]: plant will go and how that plant goes into
the ground and what that plant has to be
[SPEAKER_03]: fed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Multiply it out instead of like,
well, I'm going to make this bucket for
[SPEAKER_03]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't work that way with 1200 plants
and 800 foot beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it has changed from less individual
love with each plant, which gets
[SPEAKER_03]: frustrating, but more hands on the plant,
which can be good and bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had that conversation before I left
that room that a woman went up to me and
[SPEAKER_03]: was asking me about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that can change because you have good
and bad energy else that's touching that
[SPEAKER_03]: plant and not just yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so not everybody checks their
intentions that the way that that the way
[SPEAKER_03]: that I would check my intentions of,
oh, I'm having a bad day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably shouldn't de-weave today or
something that's like too much touching.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they feel that, you know,
and so I still have that sensitivity,
[SPEAKER_03]: but now it's multiplied out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only have so much energy too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 20 hours a day and four people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in both states, you're basically
growing cultivars that for extraction
[SPEAKER_02]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You like what they can do, whether it's
yield or quality or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: This, the commercial cultivation,
in California will be for the purpose of a
[SPEAKER_03]: licensed flower, but also we want to
introduce a concentrates line that has
[SPEAKER_03]: been close to my heart for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it will be in the end for both.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the name of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be propane Jane extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there will probably be hydrocarbon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be hydrocarbon extracts,
but in that we're not going to seek out a
[SPEAKER_03]: type seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be partnering with Hash Making
friends that have licenses in California
[SPEAKER_03]: so that we can build each other up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody play their strengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you can't be good at everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can have input on that end because I
know the equipment and I know the process
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's neat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's like pseudo vertically.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a, so when Jane came to visit me
one time in Arizona, it was really great
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was taking some, she introduced
a couple of people that ended up being
[SPEAKER_00]: clients of mine on a short term basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were driving out to go see a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted them to meet the chef because
I knew that Jane would instantly love this
[SPEAKER_00]: company in the same way I love this
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I love this company is
because this individual has turned himself
[SPEAKER_00]: into an analytical chemist because he
cared.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to be in the restaurant business
and now, you know, he's a chef and does
[SPEAKER_00]: all the products for this company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's an analytical chemist because he
couldn't figure out certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he would call our lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was at a lab, I used to be CSO for
a lab in Arizona and he would call all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be like, Oh, it's almost time for
Francis to call, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, but we love that because that is how
you learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you ask questions when you're,
when you're fighting with somebody,
[SPEAKER_00]: something, for example, he started,
um, in Arizona, there's no requirement for
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, because it mattered to,
yeah, that just is going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, finally, but it's going to be six
months of rules making.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but yeah, all of this time,
it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love in Arizona to support those
companies that test because they care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this was, and the, and the
consumers that care.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what captured my heart about there
is that people are coming in off the
[SPEAKER_03]: street and testing their product that they
bought.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the state of Colorado, you can't do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not allowed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in Colorado, you're not, if you buy
something in a dispenser, you can't double
[SPEAKER_02]: check it yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's what's crazy to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get your Molly that you buy at a
freaking festy and have that tested by
[SPEAKER_03]: companies right there on site,
but you can't test your hash as a
[SPEAKER_03]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's bananas.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Arizona blew my mind for how,
how open.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, yeah, we had to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so we're meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're meeting with this company and he
would get stuck on something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he just would start on his own.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd say, so what is your recommendation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our chemists would say, test the top of
the batch, the middle of the batch and the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of the batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, you're honing in on a,
you know, an appropriate and working SOP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he does it all the time still for
every batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we get there, we're visiting the
clients myself, we're talking about grow
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Jane's talking with him about
extraction and then they were having some
[SPEAKER_00]: problems and she's like, oh, I know that
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually solved a massive problem for
them on site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know how the equipment works,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was just, I sold that
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still sell that equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're like, oh, this is all we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, yeah, just order this part,
talk to this person and then handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when, when you work with people that
value and it's reciprocated, it is not
[SPEAKER_00]: just taking advantage of, oh, I know you
it's we know that they're, we each bring
[SPEAKER_00]: value to each other and I would rather
work with people that I can trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a mutual respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I know your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know your work ethic and I want to
continue working with people like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to continue working with people
like you in the industry and that give a
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a love fest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the peanut gallery.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's an extraction innovation,
like either technologically or new
[SPEAKER_02]: methodology is that you're kind of,
it's either imminently coming or it just
[SPEAKER_02]: came and it's exciting you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking of Murphy right now of color
remediation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, chromatography.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just, and it's, and it's, and it's
pretty, it's, it's simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do it the right way and it can be
in line with your extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people that are, because it does aid in
pesticide remediation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a big thing that's hot right now
of like, you know, how when consistencies
[SPEAKER_03]: of hash change and shatter was all that
mattered.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, if it, if it doesn't
shatter, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it moves over to sauce and sugar
and diamonds and all of the, and right
[SPEAKER_03]: now, you know, diamonds are still big in
the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would say CRC test.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's, that's one of the
things that people are really getting into
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just media filtration and you can
do it a few different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people already do that with distillate
and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just a same concept of being able
to make your extracts a nicer color.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be able to clarify some of it,
there are pesticides, certain things like
[SPEAKER_03]: that, that would pull or attach to silica
or clay and being able to make your hash
[SPEAKER_03]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen any, in your talk,
you talked about the right time for
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting for based off of your trichome
coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clear milky amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was wondering, are there any
technologies that actually can from an
[SPEAKER_00]: image do a based off of pixelation and the
colors of pixels?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there apps out there that can actually
measure that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can say, take a picture of,
let's say you go out and take a bunch of.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be a computer vision, like
recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it'll say, okay, there's a
certain ratio of red and then it can do a
[SPEAKER_00]: gradation of, you know, from how milky and
you could kind of set a, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll just give you.
[SPEAKER_02]: X percent clear, X percent amber,
X percent milky.
[SPEAKER_03]: What percentage of, like if you want more
than CBG, if you want, if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: do something for an extract that maybe you
want to have more of a docile effect to it
[SPEAKER_00]: or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just to be able to take an image,
let's say just from a single cola,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just, you take a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's then going to actually identify
and if you can do a micro image,
[SPEAKER_00]: so then you micro.
[SPEAKER_03]: A retinal scan, but like it's a cola scan.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cola scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's trademarked, cola scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so if you do a micro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels so red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hulk Jones, the inventor of cola scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cola scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then it'll say, okay, you know,
the amount of reds, the amount of browns,
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of yellows, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're going to amount of whites.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also harvest colas at different
times to maximize because they're not all
[SPEAKER_02]: perfectly ripe at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a commercial scale, that would be
huge, but you could actually from a craft
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, you know, from a smaller and
then you're like really picking and then
[SPEAKER_00]: say, if I really want to do specifically
for extraction and I want that creamy
[SPEAKER_00]: color, then I want to stop once I start to
see this percentage of reds start to
[SPEAKER_00]: appear and then you could just do that
with an image.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just curious if you worked with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something we're going to talk
about that next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about that next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what your talk will be on next
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cola scan.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cola scan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Move over NASA.
I'm so proud.
[SPEAKER_03]: So proud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you remember when you started talking
about Driscolls?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my talk, can you talk about that and
then like the relevance to cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: culture propagation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I didn't talk about in my
presentation and I'll just introduce here
[SPEAKER_00]: is I am starting a new company,
Atavena.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Atavena is doing is we are going
to be selling clones and I'm in Arizona
[SPEAKER_00]: and worked really hard to get hemp passed,
which finally passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, so, but we're going to be selling
young plants and also unrooted cuttings
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of those mother stock will be
coming from tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is very similar to a Driscolls
model where all strawberries are highly
[SPEAKER_00]: susceptible to disease and viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so every six months or every year
they'll go back to their germplasm,
[SPEAKER_00]: their cryo gene bank, and then they will
start new plants and then they will grow
[SPEAKER_00]: up and then they can take cuts and they
treat each of those plants as moms in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's a really good,
efficient commercial model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why that matters for
Driscolls and it absolutely should matter
[SPEAKER_00]: for us is that they're clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're clean of diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're clean of pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're clean of viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by starting with fresh mother stock
all the time and pushing the grow in the
[SPEAKER_00]: right way, we can actually harvest a large
number of clones per plant in a very small
[SPEAKER_00]: footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to sell them actually as unrooted
cuts is an advantage for a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: because with hemp we can no longer be
bound by the state's boundary lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can ship everywhere and then you can
stick in a lot of roots in your climate
[SPEAKER_00]: and your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What horrifies me is when I hear in
Arizona they just started hemp production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was getting their licenses in
June and July and they immediately rushed
[SPEAKER_00]: out to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was horrifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were working with clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were long.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were way past their peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should have been topped and allowed
to wait, but everyone's so excited to get
[SPEAKER_00]: in the grounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then nothing lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the point?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and then it will also be advised
it's not just a transaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I give a shit and my team,
we give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it will be assisted by us along
the journey to ensure success.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the point of selling a bunch of
clones if I will never ever, ever have you
[SPEAKER_00]: back?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the point?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by assisting in that process,
and then if it's just a stupid idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to plant in Phoenix,
Arizona, outdoors in July, I'm just not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to sell to you, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's just no reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't let you down.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have like off season.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have like an off season, you know,
like a, you know, we're closed for winter
[SPEAKER_03]: months or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're closed for summer months to the
public.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is doing your smart stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can people cultivate outdoors in Arizona?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And tell me about like the different,
like here, you know, it's like Emerald,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Humboldt down here in Topanga,
Malibu, like what's the, where the look,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause like you wouldn't do it in Phoenix,
like where it's desert, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not going to be year round for
outdoor unless you have some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: technology like, so I'll use what I did
previously as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started growing in Arizona,
it, this particular company had an indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grow in the Phoenix area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kind of about two hours away from
Phoenix, there was a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we were hired, they said,
we want to start growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a beautiful growing environment
year round if it's done right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it depends on the crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, well, we want to start
growing outside in July and all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: clones have already been taken and they're
transplanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the greenhouse outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were like, yeah, I would not
recommend doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did instead was we invested in a
retractable roof structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's manufactured by Cravo, but that has
the sides that are screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been into any plant nursery,
a lot of times they'll use those for the
[SPEAKER_00]: bedding plants area where you shop around,
but also has a retractable roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's great about that technology is
you can actually go ahead and screen your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have beautiful percentages of shade
screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can actually close that up
during the hottest time of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also close it up during the
winter months to trap the heat in after
[SPEAKER_00]: that instead of letting it out because
we're a desert, but we also get we're a
[SPEAKER_00]: high desert and we get below freezing on a
regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you couldn't grow year round in Arizona
necessarily unless you were able to trap
[SPEAKER_00]: the heat in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say there was a Haboob that
came through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what a Haboob is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those dust storms that you've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody comes running out and I'm working
out in the grow and someone's like Haboob,
[SPEAKER_00]: Haboob.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Haboob, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were working on the roof of the
structure, the Cravo structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The motor was down for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not the company's fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my dumb ass company's fault for not
paying to have it installed properly
[SPEAKER_00]: anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were two guys, they threw up the
tall slatters you could see and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling 70,000 square foot of roofing as
fast as they could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm recording this whole thing and I
was like, ah, fuck, it looks like hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that wall of like dark brown orange
because it's just coming for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over here, it's blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Death and destruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to close just in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like a windy day inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our entire crop would have been destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have lost everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this wasn't hemp, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also one of the important things that
I services that I'll be offering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent the last couple of years working
on SOPs, so you're not going to find me on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram and Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't do that because yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make sure that when we get
going, it's as optimized as I can get it,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least for right now, based off of the
technology in hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the California areas to be
able to preserve your genetics with
[SPEAKER_00]: cryopreservation, whether it's seed
banking, tissue banking.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Florida or Texas with the,
you know, natural disasters that are
[SPEAKER_02]: happening to be able In that nursery,
everything we had was basically toxins
[SPEAKER_02]: raining all over them from houses and
commercial buildings burning down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough when we don't have insurance,
you know, within companies now,
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully like the insurance will be real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're still figuring that out for
crop insurance, but there's nothing to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect anybody in the event of these
losses and you lose everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we had multiple insurance policies,
but it took forever to like And proving
[SPEAKER_03]: that you did things their way,
that that would have, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: if they have like a crop loss for pests or
something, you have to prove that you fed
[SPEAKER_03]: your plants a certain way and did all of
their outline of things and be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: show it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need redundancy and certain securities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that will also go towards
being able to pull something out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a, you mentioned, you know,
nobody's doing blue dream right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but maybe they will later, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's say it's coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's going to come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're not interested, let's not lose
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's preserve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can pull it out when we're
ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've preserved it when it was
already certified clean of what we could
[SPEAKER_00]: at least test from a panel of pathogens
and viruses at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can pull it out and be like,
it's the flavor of the mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like when disco came back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything comes back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm old enough to see that shit happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen all the fashions even go in this
time for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joan Rivers shoulder pads.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would do shoulder pads probably
again, just because it would be a nice
[SPEAKER_03]: place to rest my head because I'm freaking
tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: My boobs are too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you just don't need to
emphasize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoulder pads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Works for her.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're like, some of the or
actually like the questions that were
[SPEAKER_02]: being asked at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk about some of the like,
are there any interesting questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were interesting questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, one of the questions that was really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long will it take to rescue a
particular strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I really think it will take,
you know, upwards of a year to do a true
[SPEAKER_00]: rescue?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like if it has an identified disease,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I thought that was a really good
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also allowed me to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of R&D still to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, nobody, no lab, no consultant
right now is going to have all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: answers we're going to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the best practices in other
industries that we should absolutely start
[SPEAKER_00]: with?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't, we're not reinventing the wheel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask, do you study other
plants too?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you like cannabis is my jam?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly cannabis is my thing,
but from a, I used to study a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually used to work with
strawberries and orchids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm also very interested in other
medicinal crops of value, not just for the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry, but I'm certainly
interested in pursuing mushroom action,
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation, kava, you know, some of the
other products that, so yeah, basically if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no protocol and there might be
some sort of value, I'm interested in it
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm interested in like beating
myself up for two years to figure out how
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe, you know, somehow offer
that information to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they get smart is barter and
science together, like smarter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hashtag.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, they asked why, you know,
and they really also wanted to know why do
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to take so long?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let a year to clean something up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say, what is your favorite strain
right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's yours right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, always Rosetta, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just say, but let's use Rosetta
then, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something's funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to come out and then I'm going
to take some cuts or maybe you bring your
[SPEAKER_00]: mom to me and then I immediately start
doing crop maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm flushing it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm collecting the drainage, taking it
into the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that I have defoliated,
I collect and I immediately take to the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put that Rosetta plant in quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything should be quarantined when you
bring anything new into your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quarantine everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quarantine everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even seed popping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes into quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until I get a clean test report.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can't get a clean test report and I
at least understand what I'm dealing with,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I will take clean cuts, propagate
actually and put it into a separate
[SPEAKER_00]: quarantine and I get rid of that original
mother right away because I don't want the
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate mess, whether it be soil and all
of the bugs that that brings in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to start actually taking
the fresh new cuts because for me and
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture, I want as many nodes as I
can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times with good propagation
techniques, we can outgrow a lot of things
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be, you know, just like a
little bit bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as we are treating it with
preventative biologicals, whether it be
[SPEAKER_00]: biological pesticides or nematodes or
whatever the problem may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't know what to do until we have
a diagnosed, you know, a test diagnostic
[SPEAKER_00]: to say this is what you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start with a whole new set of cuts and
then I immediately get it into culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I, again, don't know what I'm
dealing with, then I just end up with
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminated culturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I want to, I can't do nodal
culturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do meristematic culturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meristematic culturing takes a little bit
of time underneath the scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you are just taking a very,
very small, very small cut and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: placing it on media.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to take a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say everything just to round,
use a round number, everything let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: takes four weeks, just as a general rule,
about one month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just one month to get that meristem to
all of a sudden be like, I'm living and
[SPEAKER_00]: now I resemble something that looks like
it could be a shoot and it's very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to transfer that into
another media recipe and put it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf for another month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm starting to get growth and
development if I don't get contamination,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I have to grow that enough and get
enough product that I can sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say I have a hundred vessels of
this now and it's taken me a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: months to get to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably several months to do that
because it's serial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So four weeks to get to multiplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let's say it started at one and
now I have two that I can dissect two
[SPEAKER_00]: shoots and I dissect that, let those go
another four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now each one of those have two and I
dissect those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's four weeks, four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's now three months, but we're
growing the number of material,
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of material that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so before I actually have enough
material to send out to the laboratory for
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis, we're looking at about six
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the meristem was viable when I actually
harvested, if things work along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think we as labs should not over
promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should not say I absolutely can rescue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is salvageable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not true all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it depends on if I can work
with you as a grower, is this your only
[SPEAKER_00]: planet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I keep coming out to take fresh new
cuts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I, if I'm failing in the laboratory,
can I come out and start again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, trust relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need that time in the laboratories
to actually work those methods out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm good underneath the microscope,
it's going to take a while to train my
[SPEAKER_00]: staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get good at a microscope and be able to
translate that knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so everybody's new and everybody's
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think that us labs need to be
transparent about where we're at and what
[SPEAKER_00]: our challenges are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Driscoll's, I remember asking one
time, what is your viability percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: for meristem?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said 50% and they smiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, and I was like, 50%,
holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, you just need one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need one to take and be
successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helped me put in perspective
because I felt like I was failing all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wasn't at a hundred percent viability
in my meristematic, uh, culturing,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pull every single little
primordial leaf off and then just get to,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that little America, those little
cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somehow pop that out and not lose
it in the microscope and then plate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that takes practice and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even with, with the best of them,
it doesn't, it doesn't work all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it takes time and it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not what we're doing in the lab as much as
it is working with the third party
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratories to do the virus and,
and, and pathogen indexing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I remember the earlier part of our
conversation and tell you if I totally
[SPEAKER_02]: don't remember it, but you're basically
adding a nursery operation to what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: currently doing tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the logical next step is to have
clones ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the company you're launching.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then will that be a balance between
kind of the host cult of ours that you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys are doing mad science on and breeding
and then say to clients, we can also store
[SPEAKER_02]: your genetics that you love and get them
flown ready and climate acclimated for
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of, all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, one of my partners actually is a,
uh, is an attorney in Arizona and his
[SPEAKER_00]: specialty is intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you were a breeder and you want
it and we do want to sell your genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our attorney, part of the service
is to work with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you just want trademark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you want licensing or maybe you just
want to sell us your, your, your strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: but all of that should be upfront and
delivered to you as the breeder to have
[SPEAKER_00]: the option of what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if it's a royalty, for example,
something that, um, I think we haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: heard enough in our industry is how do we
reward the breeders and how do we pay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the horticulture industry,
when you breed something, if it's the hot
[SPEAKER_00]: new Petunia and it's got this orange,
that is a new hot shit in the market for
[SPEAKER_00]: the spring, that is a licensed,
um, strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every plant sold a royalty goes
back to the breeder or to the company that
[SPEAKER_00]: bred it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These breeders have been working for a
long time on their genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I fucking want to pay him for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, um, there's nothing wrong
with having a business model to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as we're transparent and we say,
we do have these services.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just want and need some tissue
culture or preserve your stock,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that's all that's going to happen
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to work and actually sell your
strain and it off and it's a strain that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can offer in our library and then we
can help you and work with you on that,
[SPEAKER_00]: on that licensing or trademarking and make
sure that either, how do you want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: paid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to just be paid, you know,
uh, a lump sum or are you good with the
[SPEAKER_00]: royalty?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if it's 10 million units sold,
I want to give it away, but I don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: someone else to try to, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's so important to me and,
and, and the people that I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to make sure that anybody can make
money doing what they're have been
[SPEAKER_00]: building and, and working towards their
whole careers, just be transparent and
[SPEAKER_00]: then let's all have a good business and
enjoy what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, it's been a long road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say long road, you get this,
there's been a lot of characters that have
[SPEAKER_00]: come across and said, Hey, do you want $10
million?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, Hey, why don't you come work for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to promise you the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not because it's not been the right
alignment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not been the right fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody on the team gave a shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so everybody on the team
needs to give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here because we enjoy what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not here to rate the industry of all
their knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and so I think, yeah,
intention.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my, that's my discerning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Factor as I age, not as gracefully as
hope, but as I age into my future,
[SPEAKER_03]: I do it loud and messy.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm like, Oh, that's a sermon of does
that person, is that person helping me be
[SPEAKER_03]: the best version of myself?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that includes my work because my work
is so much a part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what are some of the, so in both
state, what actually you're in California
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So California, Colorado, Arizona,
give a shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: To some either readers or cultivators that
you guys like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love coming to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as I come into this show,
there are two people that I immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: contact Jane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You contacted me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Adam, Adam Jacques.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he does a lot for the children and the
whole universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he knows how to breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: He understands how to get to a stable P
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He understands.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number and the time it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a breeder and he understands you're
not going to just do one cross and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sell a bunch of unstable seed lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you had a very, I had a slide about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my mind, a breeder knows that you
need to start with two parents that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been back crossed and are a stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, P one meaning all of the, you,
you self to itself until you get rid of,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you try to get to either all big A,
big A's or all little A's, little A's,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think of your pundit square,
when you have a one parent, you get a set
[SPEAKER_00]: of chromosomes from each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can, when you do that,
you have the probability of getting a big
[SPEAKER_00]: A, big A, big A, little A, big A,
little A and little A, little A.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want to do is you want to back
cross until you really have a very pure
[SPEAKER_00]: line for both your, um, P one and your P
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you cross and then you have to do
back crosses again before you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: stable F F one hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a breeder actually talks like that,
you've got my attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some rush the process to try to get
stuff out the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens after the breeding also,
and that you covered that in your talk
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just the thing of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have data is a big one for me and I know
that is for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, also just your reputation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that who you are as a person goes
into your work the same as it does for all
[SPEAKER_03]: of us and the outcome that that person
produces coupled with data because a
[SPEAKER_03]: person that is passionate about what
they're doing, they want to do a really
[SPEAKER_03]: good job, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're gonna put in the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you were when you were sourcing
the genetics for your California or
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado bros, who were you sourcing them
from?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's that's who I was going to say
who some of my favorite breeders were.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dominion Seed Company and Nerds Genetics
are a bulk of our garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Dominion Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I love is that he has some really fun
moms like I hope it doesn't care if I say,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like, is he the guy we were sitting
with?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's actually that's my love,
Nathan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that's my partner in the
project on his property in Trinity in
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we love Duke and we love Dominion Seed
Company.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's he's he's he's done a lot of the work
and he's a perfectionist, which most most
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders I know are that they won't put
their name on something that they haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: really put so much work into.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he has really cool fun genetics like a
hash plant from Lebanon from 1977.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like really crazy medicine,
medicine that has fun stories behind it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that also just produces these really
intense, unique profiles like an,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, an original skunk, the original
skunk, you know, things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he adds a lot of loud to the
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with Nerds Genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are all very brilliant people.
[SPEAKER_03]: The the guy that I'm really close friends
with, Robbie, went to Colorado College by
[SPEAKER_03]: me, which is a really well known college
for you can't be stupid and go to that
[SPEAKER_03]: college.
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't let you in.
[SPEAKER_03]: They see stupid coming and the name like
Nerds Genetics because they do so much
[SPEAKER_03]: research behind their stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a process and product for him in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was amazing was he gave me back
every little number on my job.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, well, just so you know,
you beat this extractor, this extractor,
[SPEAKER_03]: this extractor and this extractor by this
percentage in your return.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you did this, this and this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this profile was high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, wait, you were giving that
stuff to other people, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, yeah, you know,
and we're talking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was like, wow, you just gave me
almost double the return on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and then I'm like, oh, shit,
I probably just got those extractors in
[SPEAKER_03]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: But being able to see somebody that
they're they're breeding for the purpose
[SPEAKER_03]: of producing concentrates and their seeds
are for the purpose of producing
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like breeders for hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so what what are people breeding for?
[SPEAKER_03]: Certain types of terp terping profiles
that will come come in.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about limonene or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those would be for flowering, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is for flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how it comes through and concentrates,
you know, there are certain things right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love like an herbal herb line.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want that old sage that Adam Dunn had.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want those kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lavender, you know, and there's a
beautiful opportunity for these breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: to to target.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's such a huge need, whether it be
for full terping profiles, whether it be
[SPEAKER_00]: for architecture and hemp for mechanical
harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a certain plant architecture that
goes in the ground that can be harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get some bushy and not a lot of
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of opportunity to actually
are we wanting particular strains that are
[SPEAKER_00]: focused purely for processing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want strains more focused on flower
and different profiles from that regard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there are huge opportunities as
breeders to target those markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's in a goddamn rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not I mean, really a good
turnaround, true turnaround time for
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding new strains that are stable,
true to type.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at three to eight years,
depending.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think there's been a lot of good
breeders out there that have gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: started and are going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't wait to see some of their new
strains coming out here in the next few
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that now people like Adam, it could be
any any cannabinoid except for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now people are making heady hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're like, oh, well,
look, this this fits everybody on the
[SPEAKER_03]: street.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not so scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've got this extensive flavor
profile just the same as cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that fits into holistic health care.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though I totally believe THC is
holistic health care.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, it just I call it lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and I see now how I love that they've
taken that and just gone, hey,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's do this to be able to expand.
[SPEAKER_03]: The places that this medicine can go in a
safe space that everybody can understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll move on to that
reintroducing that THC heavy with flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really excited to work with
breeders in the lab that so there is a way
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually breed and vitro, for example,
with we can use pollen, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: protoplast fusions where you actually
digest the cell wall and you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbing it in half cells, plant cells
that are, you know, haploid basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can actually merge them together
and make a diploid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why not play with that, too?
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is normal things that are
done in other industries that I'm excited
[SPEAKER_00]: to see and play other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm excited to those lavender terms
are going to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And work with I don't come from you know,
as you know, a long pedigree of black
[SPEAKER_00]: market, you know, being part of the
original cast of characters that have come
[SPEAKER_00]: out and created this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am I'm a noob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to work with those characters
who understand the characteristics and the
[SPEAKER_00]: passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, you don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's junk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people who are truly knowledgeable
love it at such an in-depth level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Historically, who understand the plant so
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the people that I am excited to
work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of those people are craft
because we're talking quality stuff here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then also craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The scalability while maintaining quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I love having an R&D lab is
because the lab is not focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial production.
[SPEAKER_00]: R&D labs shouldn't have that focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The R&D labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will always have R&D lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever happens with the bread and butter
of cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the R&D lab is where we get to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's focused on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do I see any of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm no longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone breeding in that direction to
explore those minor cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are.
[SPEAKER_00]: No longer being a part of an analytical
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get to see just kind of the blind
stuff that randomly comes in and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a crazy high on THCV or something
along those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't get to see that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have been talking with and have
clients all over the US and Canada and
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all are on the hunt for that or
have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now everybody's excited and focused
on trying to create strains that have a
[SPEAKER_00]: different profile than just THCs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we now also get to have fun with some
of these real clinical studies and have an
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of more than just anecdotal evidence
of what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know for myself if THCV is going
to help with weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm your first sign up for that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's that study?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be a part of that study.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's hard to get a hold of those
products necessarily unless you know
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just takes time to get it into
the marketplace and make it more available
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the small little circles and
the niches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then on the extraction side,
you need a ton of biomass to get enough of
[SPEAKER_02]: the super obscure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that puts you in different
extraction methods because if it pulls a
[SPEAKER_03]: higher percentage with less work,
hydrocarbon is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you have thousands and thousands of
pounds that you have to run, then ethanol
[SPEAKER_03]: becomes a better thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I'm really interested also from
an R&D lab are certain cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And feed regimes influencing the chemical
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could we as growers actually adopt,
oh, if I'm more interested in bringing out
[SPEAKER_00]: and enhancing this plant's potential on a
secondary or what we think of as secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid or focus on how to grow
towards a desired terpene profile a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: that I believe we'll find that there are
certain cultivation strategies and certain
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient feed regimes that we can do to
skirt that and accomplish that without
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one example would be with tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some earlier research I did when I
was an undergraduate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the PhD student I was working for was
working on increasing the sugar content of
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes by increasing the salt content
and increasing the concentration of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that did was actually create a
more concentrated flavor of more
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated sugars in the tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can measure that by bricks by
taking the tomato off and then crumbling
[SPEAKER_00]: it and just juicing it onto the bricks
reader.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gives you a bricks content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we can measure sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are ways that I think as
cultivators that we can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate and drive and steer plants,
the plant's chemical profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need the ability to.
[SPEAKER_03]: The right people meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to do the R&D that says,
you know what, this is really working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's tweak it just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we then also need to count on the data
that we get from the analytical
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to do tissue analysis of the
plants through its growth and development
[SPEAKER_00]: and of the yield, not just the flower,
but growth and development, because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to see certain parameters that we
can measure throughout the growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: development of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to always wait for flower to
tell us how to steer, what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's just a real need for that R
&D.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be an easy way to actually,
oh, I had no idea this plant had this
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at you, you clever girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: You clever, clever girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a matter of time and money,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And knowing the right people.
Yeah.
