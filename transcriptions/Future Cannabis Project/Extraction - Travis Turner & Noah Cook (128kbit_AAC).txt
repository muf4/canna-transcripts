[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I think it will take a beer I'll
smoke some of that J though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you that much We have a we have
a bong as well to pack I just actually had
[SPEAKER_02]: a broken one of the broken joints we could
pack it No, let's go for it That's what
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying like You're like so late on
that Well, you just weren't didn't let me
[SPEAKER_01]: finish speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, which do you know which one
this is?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's og.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay So this is uh, but it's called
suspicious og, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean Right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh gee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I thought there's something like
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh So yeah, one of the brands that we That
we produce inside of our space is called
[SPEAKER_00]: the bud father bud father is like pretty
like, you know thematically Correct
[SPEAKER_00]: branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know when people like join his
Instagram page goes welcome to the family
[SPEAKER_00]: with two glasses clinking, you know,
like it's pretty ridiculous, but the guy
[SPEAKER_00]: that owned that's the the founder is an
Amazing guy named Dan and so It's one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the products that we're not only branding
here, but we're pushing it out in other
[SPEAKER_00]: states for him to You know, basically
that's kind of our whole theme and where
[SPEAKER_00]: we work is that we do contract
manufacturing So we'll bring brands in
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll give them a An interest on our
license so that they can produce and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll make all their products for them
package them Distribute off to the stores
[SPEAKER_00]: for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of one of our guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you make?
[SPEAKER_00]: All kinds of products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he does pre-roll shatter crumble
eight stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep All prepackaged flour all in a very
Don Corleone and kind of way Okay,
[SPEAKER_04]: so so you guys first of all, where is your
facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Boyle Heights just Soto and Olympic on the
east side of our southeast side of
[SPEAKER_02]: downtown right by the Sears building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I 15,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah our If you ever want to come shoot
something cool like our manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: facility is Probably something outside of
what most people get to see in the space
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 5,000 square feet of automated Plant
processing so you're basically dumping in
[SPEAKER_00]: input on one end and you're pumping out
oil on the other end and Pretty much goes
[SPEAKER_00]: like that all day long every day It's we
we can do about 5,000 pounds of processing
[SPEAKER_00]: a day In that facility and we're building
another one in Compton that can do 40,000
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds a day of Hemp processing It will be
all him focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's gonna have a hemp license
rather than a Cannabis license it's done a
[SPEAKER_04]: microphone With your facility you're
processing for joints for flour for oil
[SPEAKER_04]: for cartridges For live resin rot like
everything so yeah, the only thing we
[SPEAKER_00]: can't do where we're a type six
manufacturer So those live resin products
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff things that take like butane
propane or some sort of Hydrocarbon
[SPEAKER_00]: extract like we don't mess with those
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so hydrocarbon is basically the only
thing you don't do but you alcohol you do
[SPEAKER_04]: co2 you do Do you do solvent lists?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can we have a license for it just not
in our wheelhouse at the moment No one's
[SPEAKER_00]: asked us to do it, but we're totally
equipped to and We can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't make any of those products
right now like we're we're both like
[SPEAKER_00]: purest at heart and we I love like dry
sift rosin I think it's the best one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the best products on the market solvent
list products at least Solvent lists is
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just really hard Nice what do I I
love bubble?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I cut my teeth about eight
years ago was making bubble hash and wash
[SPEAKER_00]: machines in my kitchen
[SPEAKER_00]: My beginnings was purely making bubble so
I had to side-by-side wash machines and
[SPEAKER_00]: for cultivation well, yeah, so I could
Cultivated for a long time first around
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been but I've been cultivating for
about 12 years or I had I have been up to
[SPEAKER_00]: this point I stopped about four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, I haven't stopped actually we
saw one more I Forget about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's shoved away in a corner
somewhere Yeah, and where were you based
[SPEAKER_00]: in Humboldt?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I moved to Arcata I had grown a little
bit, you know in Southern, California
[SPEAKER_00]: Moved to Humboldt went back to school for
a communications journalism degree at
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt State And as soon as I moved up
there, I was like, oh, this is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mecca of everything about ten years
ago I moved to eleven years ago moved to
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt and I'm like, oh, this is like
the Mecca of everything and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely what I want to do with the rest
of my life and Got roped in and so there
[SPEAKER_04]: you were growing and eventually started
Yeah, did start about eight years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: started doing bubble like I said to two
wash machines and a big barrel and with
[SPEAKER_00]: with bubble bags and ice ice hash and
Yeah, but back then like you could go
[SPEAKER_00]: people would just drop off like Pounds and
I mean 40 50 hundred Yeah back Nobody did
[SPEAKER_00]: like they were happy if you came and got
it off their farm because they you know
[SPEAKER_00]: back then if you found trim on a farm It
was the same as finding, you know each one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those pounds of trim counted as a pound
of flour So you get the jail time of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, whatever that weight was and so
people would just give it to me for free
[SPEAKER_02]: Trim with a street value of hundred
thousand dollars, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah after that I got into open
blasting I spent a summer On a farm
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of Garberville just going through
butane cans every day
[SPEAKER_00]: In glass PVC first time in Michigan Yeah
in Humboldt like that you just had access
[SPEAKER_00]: to that kind of stuff like you you know I
had like four or five different glass
[SPEAKER_00]: blowers and they would make they made me a
set of tubes like the PVC is actually like
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what Got me away from cultivating
and actually got like I was starting my
[SPEAKER_02]: first My first personal grow in 2009 in
Michigan they had legalized medicinal in
[SPEAKER_02]: 2008 I was doing my own grow and having a
hard time in a under about 2,000 watts in
[SPEAKER_02]: a little tent and My dad had a buddy that
was also a grower and he was my first
[SPEAKER_02]: caregiver and he we went in and he had
cooked me pulled up a bunch of fan leaves
[SPEAKER_02]: cooked them in the oven blast them through
PVC and and Basically melted this black
[SPEAKER_02]: tar onto a bowl and we sat there and
smoked it and I'd gotten higher than I had
[SPEAKER_02]: ever been on THC and I was like,
well, there's something something to this
[SPEAKER_02]: I and I'm not very good at growing right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's just So let's let's try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I my first you Yeah, I don't just take
it on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so this is basically a brand that
you guys Contract manufacture for so
[SPEAKER_00]: you're yeah, we also own a piece of that
business But yeah, we contract
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer for them as well So like one
of the things we when we pick up brands,
[SPEAKER_00]: we take a bit of the equity Yeah,
it's been cool it's You know, I spent
[SPEAKER_00]: years of my life driving to places to pick
up trim to bring it back to our facility
[SPEAKER_00]: to Process with mixed results and one I
don't know when but like someday one day
[SPEAKER_00]: we just decided like Hey, let's just
actually sit here as much as possible How
[SPEAKER_00]: do we get people to bring us the trim and
then we do what we do with it and then
[SPEAKER_00]: just give back the results and they pay us
to do that and that kind of changed into
[SPEAKER_00]: our model and then we found people who are
into like Doing toll processing and
[SPEAKER_00]: contract manufacturing that didn't have
either didn't have a license or didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have some part of the puzzle a big thing
is it like like we were talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: People didn't realize the farmers didn't
realize the value of the trim They were
[SPEAKER_02]: only selling their pounds and they were
selling their flour and then they didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: realize the value and now you're getting
more educated farmers that realize the
[SPEAKER_02]: value of The stuff they were throwing away
and they would much rather be involved In
[SPEAKER_02]: the end product and the you know,
the advantageous sources of income they go
[SPEAKER_02]: through it instead of just you know,
selling that trim they would much rather
[SPEAKER_02]: get a hand in the market of concentrates
and Start producing a product that you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, that's Getting value out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah getting getting getting value out of
products that they didn't know products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the the conversation kind of
wrapped around We you know, we came from
[SPEAKER_00]: small farmers stock like, you know people
that were doing less than an acre You know
[SPEAKER_00]: like quarter acre or something like in the
same garden as they grew their vegetables
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything else you got in the out in
the sticks and humble and that was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like always our our thing like,
you know, where's the value that we bring
[SPEAKER_00]: to those people and we thought,
you know, hey, let's let's get them to
[SPEAKER_00]: have Some participation in the downstream
economics of like where these products are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to like that's what they're missing
That's why farmers get commoditized and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck in these little small boxes and
Yeah, we figured out a way to where like
[SPEAKER_00]: hey we charge a fee but and and and hey no
problem We'll even sell this end product
[SPEAKER_00]: for you and you get part of those
economics down, you know Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it's basically Commoditizing your
waste streams and it goes further as the
[SPEAKER_02]: science catches up to the industry then
we're able to Realize that there really
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't too much waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean we can we can pull Now we're
looking at for our distillate distillate
[SPEAKER_02]: residue and there's people that are
extremely interested in that and making
[SPEAKER_02]: bioplastics and Your biomass is I mean for
one it could be animal feed it could be
[SPEAKER_02]: burned for energy with inside the plant
these are just streams of value that was
[SPEAKER_02]: considered waste that we used and used to
have to pay to get rid of and now there's
[SPEAKER_02]: more and more companies that are Realizing
the value of these products and creating
[SPEAKER_02]: creating businesses around relieving these
waste streams and also Making valuable
[SPEAKER_02]: products out of them
[SPEAKER_04]: You're gonna have so much material that's
not going into CBE Isolate so Where are we
[SPEAKER_04]: today with for example turn it into
plastic?
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel into rope into clothing I Got to go
to a Hemp show in in BC About eight months
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, and I was blown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I I've been pushing to get into
that market up in British Columbia Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: at the University of Vancouver and they
You know those waste streams exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't been scaled So for instance
there's a guy creating Hemp Crete you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that is stronger than concrete there's
like there was a guy up there that was
[SPEAKER_00]: making batteries out of hemp and biochar
There was obviously a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber guys up there that were doing
everything from you know most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: molding inside car doors now are all hemp
based you know there's a Bunch of really
[SPEAKER_00]: cool products, but it hasn't been scaled
yet, and this was in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Canada is probably like Five years
ahead of us as far as large-scale Hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: production goes, and I assume you need
processing Where the cultivation is
[SPEAKER_04]: happening right like you know I think of
you know the oil industry would be an
[SPEAKER_04]: analogy where you have certain You know
refining extraction and you know
[SPEAKER_04]: transportation distribution to the
refinery It really comes down to logistics
[SPEAKER_02]: of moving material I mean if you could
move if you could have a mobile lab that
[SPEAKER_02]: comes to the farm get stuff into crude and
then and The oil the biomass is it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: biggest taker of energy for for moving
around It's it's it's hefty for what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: pulling out of it If you can get those
valuable space if you can get those
[SPEAKER_02]: targeted molecules out in the field Then
you don't have to worry about other
[SPEAKER_02]: processing down the line you can you can
send Your your waist down for fiber
[SPEAKER_02]: processing Or plastic processing,
but if you can separate things closer
[SPEAKER_02]: Closer to the source it's going to reduce
cost, but as you get to these more
[SPEAKER_02]: precious things say is say if you're
incinerating Your hemp biomass,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're doing graphene production like
it takes nothing to ship you know a gram
[SPEAKER_02]: of Potentially graphene rich material to
you know the other side of the world to
[SPEAKER_02]: actually do research, but it really It's
Logistically it's the big challenges
[SPEAKER_02]: getting the target molecules Processed
early and then moving the waste streams in
[SPEAKER_02]: a proper direction to where you're not
processing them in several different
[SPEAKER_02]: Manufacturing areas you want to do most of
the stuff at the field and then take the
[SPEAKER_02]: different materials the waste streams out
to The the other processors and biomass is
[SPEAKER_02]: the the biggest the the What's 10% of the
rain on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're you know going from going from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Biomass as a whole to crude you're cutting
out 90% of your weight if not more,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's the logistically interestingly
though right now Which is kind of follows
[SPEAKER_00]: along with what we've been?
[SPEAKER_00]: How our thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: process works when we make decisions that
but The price point on some of those bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids or bulk testable coil is is
still so good that a lot of people aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about that the logistics cost is
really like almost nothing comparative to
[SPEAKER_00]: the To the margin if you're a single
source provider right you're a farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going straight into your own
manufacturing facility even if you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: transport thousands of miles to a facility
the Economics are so good right now in
[SPEAKER_00]: this market that It doesn't play a big
role.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not it's not a cost factor that
you're really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god We got to make sure it costs
$2,600 to do a 40 foot container on the
[SPEAKER_00]: back of a semi truck and you can fit about
25,000 pounds of material in the back of
[SPEAKER_00]: that truck and so if you think you know
you're getting 20 kilos off of every
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand pounds that's 400 and something
kilos of finished oil you get off that
[SPEAKER_00]: truck That 25,000 pounds or more you know
and that that equals that 25,000 pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: equals you know and Revenue you know
Millions and millions of dollars worth of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD isolate or or full spectrum this to it
or something like that so right now though
[SPEAKER_00]: people aren't even thinking about that
because it's You know but we our whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing is like efficiency we reuse all our
ethanol over and over again And we clean
[SPEAKER_00]: it every time and we've taken away some of
the heating and cooling elements of the
[SPEAKER_00]: process to make make it cleaner and and
more efficient you know I think in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way eventually like Noah said like
You know farmers want to grow plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: cut those plants down and send that
somewhere But with hemp specific the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you're drying for days you want
to dry in a certain way to preserve your
[SPEAKER_00]: yield and So I think some expertise or
people getting into that market of
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting separating stock and stem for
fiber production from from flour Those are
[SPEAKER_00]: the things I think people are looking at
now for that take that hit in two years
[SPEAKER_00]: from now when Everybody and their sisters
growing hemp and like it's just a big
[SPEAKER_00]: commodity and yeah, I could imagine that
he's really gonna start mattering I could
[SPEAKER_02]: imagine that you know like feed corn was
probably a challenge and getting getting
[SPEAKER_02]: Good separated corn without tons of husks
and biomass that's you know low and low in
[SPEAKER_02]: nutritional value and and those are the
things that we are starting to look at now
[SPEAKER_02]: as the Is just trying to reduce those
efficiencies because eventually the the
[SPEAKER_02]: price for CBD is going to be is you get
more big players in the game It's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: drop significantly so To be what it should
be like if it's exactly make it make it
[SPEAKER_02]: available to everybody it should be it
should be available to anybody with a buck
[SPEAKER_02]: in their pocket to get a little CBD in
their system and
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a thought It's a thought right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's we I mean we haven't built we haven't
built our own out and we haven't Come
[SPEAKER_02]: along and design right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're playing with We're playing within
the confines of what's what we've been
[SPEAKER_02]: given here in the state of California You
have to have a physical address to be
[SPEAKER_02]: using these solvents It's not that's not
really can't transport like it's not easy
[SPEAKER_00]: for a regular guy to transport You know
10,000 gallons of ethanol in the back of a
[SPEAKER_00]: tanker truck You know from one place down
a dirt road to some other place And and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think in the long run and when you start
talking about consumer goods specifically,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Cooking it up, you know in your
garage while you're baking it in your oven
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the house like that though that
probably is not gonna happen for too much
[SPEAKER_00]: longer, you know, if it's still happening
at all and so Where you're doing some
[SPEAKER_00]: processing could be an issue, you know,
like taking a non FDA certified You know
[SPEAKER_00]: tractor trailer and doing that work on the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that works long term maybe
it does for Obviously for hemp and or
[SPEAKER_00]: fiber fiber, but maybe for pharma or
nutritional Supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it flies
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes Yeah, we we really prefer ethanol it's
it's a renewable solvent it's extremely
[SPEAKER_02]: aggressive and it I mean Slightly is
significantly less dangerous than dealing
[SPEAKER_02]: with butane It's not as volatile
aggressive as a solvent just not in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Well, I mean it might it's aggressive
for the salt but it might make you
[SPEAKER_02]: aggressive Yeah, but It definitely is not
the easiest solvent to work with and we've
[SPEAKER_02]: learned that we've learned a lot with
being forced into the the corner that we
[SPEAKER_02]: are with our 6a license we can only do non
volatile solvents and we were really lucky
[SPEAKER_02]: that that ethanol was lumped into that
group if it wasn't we'd be Dealing with a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of co2 and rosin presses but not be
able to do the industrial scale of
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabinoid extraction that we do It does
take an aggressive solvent and with the
[SPEAKER_02]: high pressure systems that co2 has to use
it there's Very very low throughputs
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to what we can do with ethanol
safely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So ethanol If you're kind of like if you
have like each solvent and like checkbox
[SPEAKER_04]: like different capabilities or what
they're good for Large-scale volume is one
[SPEAKER_04]: of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes that co2 I mean obviously rosin
presses you're doing like yeah six inch by
[SPEAKER_04]: cottage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, but you can get some of the
best products ever out of doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know solvent lists the you know water
washes and then drive sifting and then And
[SPEAKER_02]: then rosin and then re rosining with
separating THCA and then and then also
[SPEAKER_02]: saucing out your your your rosin to
letting it stratify and Like the the BHO
[SPEAKER_02]: guys do like that's a lot of work and it
makes the best extra extraction my in my
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion, but If if we want to get
cannabinoids to every everybody that's out
[SPEAKER_02]: there that needs them There's not enough
rosin presses in the world Do you guys
[SPEAKER_04]: ever look at stuff Either that someone
brings you or like if you ever go to a
[SPEAKER_04]: retail shop and just say like wow,
like Whatever these guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to learn what it is because this is
crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We we We love rosin or the solvent list
rosin like the high we would go to you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, jungle boys has a like dry sift dry
sift rosin as Well, and it's and yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's one of the best products ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes a Supercraft product and we pay the
extra price for it I think all those
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies have a specific use or
function, you know, right, you know rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: presses meet that criteria for people who
really want the best Extract as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor as far as capturing the essence of
the of that specific phenol If for sure it
[SPEAKER_00]: costs $100 a half gram or sometimes,
you know $150 that or gram and yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is the I would say it's the the most
top-shelf Yeah boutique product there
[SPEAKER_02]: There's people now that are really
starting to do great things with With
[SPEAKER_02]: hydrocarbons, I mean they've been doing
great things with hydrocarbons,
[SPEAKER_02]: but Now they're they've really learned how
to refine and I've seen a few people
[SPEAKER_02]: actually pulling really strong terpene
profiles from Hydrocarbon extracts
[SPEAKER_00]: colorless like colorless terpene profiles
with colorless oil like Using hydrocarbons
[SPEAKER_02]: and really good good flavor profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean I mostly know The for
terpenes that I was really impressed with
[SPEAKER_02]: dr. Jack Hughes on Instagram He he's
really spent a lot of time at preserving
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes and and pulling and distilling
terpenes out of Crude extracts to in
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping good profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just put so much time into that over
over a lot We met him he was one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: first trade shows we did I actually just
found this business company We saw him at
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegas Vegas as well, but we saw him at
Hemp con in San Bernardino They were the
[SPEAKER_00]: jet.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was in the jetty extracts booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that was him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah was him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I can't believe that I knew But yeah,
I mean the cool thing is we've watched a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch of people like level up over
the course of the last five years on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram like so many people have gone to
a new level of their understanding of how
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to interact with the plant and
and a lot of people have their own little
[SPEAKER_02]: bubbles to they they they find their their
niche so breaking dabs on Instagram is a
[SPEAKER_02]: he's Really When the short path
distillation a game came up he put a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of energy into just figuring out all the
the variables and how To make great oil
[SPEAKER_02]: and and increase throughputs and writing
it all down which is so huge in this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry for people to like write it down
create a very specific SOP and then so
[SPEAKER_00]: people can duplicate that work exactly
like that didn't and Verify the results,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, so it becomes a standard He's a
consultant that that was very very
[SPEAKER_02]: generous and everything that he's put
online eventually Right now he's worked
[SPEAKER_02]: towards, you know commoditizing it some in
some way, but she's great and But there I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know anybody that runs a short path
that doesn't you know tip their hat to
[SPEAKER_02]: what he what he did for the industry and
and another Big hot condenser tech Yes,
[SPEAKER_02]: the hot condenser tech the breaking dabs
hot condenser tech was absolutely a
[SPEAKER_02]: Groundbreaker for the distillation of
cannabinoids because people started
[SPEAKER_02]: realizing that They started selectively
Selectively condensing things before it
[SPEAKER_02]: was all You vaporize you vaporize your
cannabinoids and everything that comes up
[SPEAKER_02]: you condense it all and then you just You
don't want anything to bypass and end up
[SPEAKER_02]: in your trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So He was the one that realized that there
will be things that co-distill and that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's ways of increasing your condenser
temperatures to let them bypass your The
[SPEAKER_02]: drop down for your your oil and they'll
continue as a vapor and then they'll get
[SPEAKER_02]: deposited further down your path But not
in your flask for targeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so basically in distillation if I could
just like cut this down a little Basically
[SPEAKER_00]: in distillation you have a boiling flash
you pour your your crude oil into this
[SPEAKER_00]: boiling flask And as it gets to specific
temperatures it fractions off by
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizing Different compounds inside that
boiling flask.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's THC CBD all your cannabinoids
all your terpenes Depending on their
[SPEAKER_00]: specific boiling point is when they would
fraction off of that main body of oil so
[SPEAKER_00]: what breaking down did was Most people
just had a cold fluid running through
[SPEAKER_00]: their condenser So once that hot oil vapor
would hit the condenser it would this is
[SPEAKER_00]: just so for people who don't know this
stuff I just want to like give them this
[SPEAKER_00]: short story hit that condenser and it
would cool it to a point where it would re
[SPEAKER_00]: solidify right and then And then it would
it would land on a there's a flask that
[SPEAKER_02]: would come off of that path And this is
all done under very deep backing,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you for cannabinoids specifically
correct me if I'm wrong they don't They
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need to be so cold to read that
they're volatile in the sense They want to
[SPEAKER_00]: go back their natural state is oil so you
don't have to bring the temperature up or
[SPEAKER_00]: down So you've got a really low vapor
pressure very low vapor pressure is the
[SPEAKER_00]: better term for it So this hot condenser
tech allowed you to pass more garbage and
[SPEAKER_00]: just really collect A very much cleaner
cannabinoid fraction into your collection
[SPEAKER_04]: flask So it's almost like you can narrow
the band of what you're collecting versus
[SPEAKER_04]: being like a catch-all Correct totally
co-distills like they like you so yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: so like selectively recondensing was
something that people started it that it
[SPEAKER_02]: It jogs something and a lot of people's
might break their brains and got them
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking on another level and Man,
gray wolf to like yeah of man opens like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a there's a couple guys who are
like awesome in this tech community too
[SPEAKER_00]: because they have openly like upset a lot
of people but like Kept this small band of
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the technology side side of
cannabis or specifically in processing
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of hanging on to each other like we
all follow each other to IG We see each
[SPEAKER_00]: other at all these events.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a huge group of people and so
gray wolf and he doesn't even he's not
[SPEAKER_02]: even on Instagram, which is no,
but he he's an old codger that that he's
[SPEAKER_02]: been designing closed-loop systems for
Well, he He's an engineer and the
[SPEAKER_02]: closed-loop systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: He basically open source them on the
internet so people could So it would
[SPEAKER_02]: destroy the ability to make patents around
them so then people could actually Make
[SPEAKER_02]: the machines themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he open source them very To just make
sure that people would be able to make
[SPEAKER_02]: closed-loop butane designs and don't know
if you're familiar with connoisseur
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates the mister extractor and it's
a They it's a very much say something that
[SPEAKER_02]: might cause drama There we you might have
there was a big video series about how
[SPEAKER_02]: this company had owned all these patents
and they tried to patent this stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's really they're not enforceable
patents and there's They got it and he was
[SPEAKER_02]: he's made a Pretty funny video series of
him up in this big no Drew hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's all I know man drew and With a
couple pretty blondes and him in front of
[SPEAKER_02]: a desk overseeing like LA or something and
he talks about and he gives like an
[SPEAKER_02]: hour-long series about how he's He owns
all the patents.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's gonna be the future of the industry
and it was Like it was pretty cringy Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I believe that he's actually gray wolf
has been sued for some of the stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: he put out he's had to deal with No,
actually Skunk farm had gotten bought from
[SPEAKER_02]: another company and there's some really
ugly stuff going on around the open
[SPEAKER_02]: sourcing of that but people have attacked
gray wolf for what he has tried to open
[SPEAKER_00]: source and He's been like copied all over
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you see a closed-loop Butane
extractor like something on it's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: like taken from one of his designs
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost everything out there is based on a
turpinator design The turpinator was a yo
[SPEAKER_02]: a bunch of tri-clamp spools you put the
material in the small ones they have
[SPEAKER_02]: passive passive ones that use hot you
could just put in hot water and ice and
[SPEAKER_02]: recover your butane and But it started out
with just a small little turpinator series
[SPEAKER_02]: on skunk farm research calm and then
eventually he started showing an automated
[SPEAKER_02]: mark 2 version that they worked on to
where it was all pneumatic valves and then
[SPEAKER_02]: they And then they they brought the mark 3
was the basic design that everybody's been
[SPEAKER_02]: working that the early design for the mini
closed-loop that everybody worked on These
[SPEAKER_00]: are hydrocarbon closed-loop Extraction
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just getting the oil off the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so basically you have a column you
pack the the material in the column You
[SPEAKER_02]: pass butane through the column at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all collected with oil under vacuum
and then you heat that and you heat that
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom pot and then you would Pull all the
solvent out And then recover it with some
[SPEAKER_02]: type of condenser or a pump.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the fun days of using apion HVAC
recovery pumps and then eventually it
[SPEAKER_02]: moved to TR 21 HVAC recovery pumps and
then you had companies come in like with
[SPEAKER_02]: the I can't remember the name of the
company, but the CME POL series of these
[SPEAKER_02]: little stainless boxes for recovering
Hydrocarbons, yeah, like most of the pumps
[SPEAKER_02]: like that was the that was the first
approved one I believe there's that and
[SPEAKER_02]: then there's the pneumatic Haskell's that
were built around that as well But these
[SPEAKER_00]: were these most of the pumps that were
used for the first These five years four
[SPEAKER_00]: years were doing it were all like the same
kind of pumps You would pump freon into
[SPEAKER_00]: your AC system Like that's the only thing
that really fit that marketplace and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the technology that you would use that
would be a lot safer Was kind of like you
[SPEAKER_00]: had to go through It was passive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean a lot of people you could just add
heat and add cooling in one spot We had
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble like going to specific companies
and saying hey, you know This is our
[SPEAKER_00]: company and this is what we do and they
wouldn't even they wouldn't sell us
[SPEAKER_00]: anything They've like no you don't fit the
criteria of people that we sell our
[SPEAKER_00]: products to With like pharmaceutical
supplies, you know, like even inert,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm being beat Beating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah getting butane in mass, you know,
like all these lemonine Yeah, and trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it legally, you know, so yeah As
much as possible anyway, we order through
[SPEAKER_02]: a McMaster car, which is one of the best
industrial tool or Parts supplier though,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we have we have an account there But
we're aware that there's other people
[SPEAKER_02]: around that have had multiple accounts
suspended just because they know that they
[SPEAKER_02]: work with the industry and they can't and
it's and like They can't get their
[SPEAKER_02]: Next-day parts because they're no they
shut off their account because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis guys and I mean even a couple
months ago we did a we're trying to do one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those whiteboard videos where it's like
drawing little character and We got like a
[SPEAKER_00]: week into the process with this company in
Utah and then the guy called the designer
[SPEAKER_00]: or the guy was in the video called me and
said Yeah, so we're really sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're gonna have to discontinue
working with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, yeah, the owner went to your
website like it was like this bad thing
[SPEAKER_00]: like our website's super professional and
like, you know describes what we do and
[SPEAKER_00]: he's like, yeah, he's just not into
cannabis and I'm just like Wow All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess I don't want to pay company
Funny enough the guy was like can I just
[SPEAKER_00]: say from a personal standpoint?
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally am into what you guys are doing
I also have this little side business
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, super funny, but yeah, it's still
like it's odd that you know 33 states have
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of cannabis or Hemp or CBD law
in the books right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like it's moving towards federal
legalization sooner than later So it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's odd that like people are still like
it's the devil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I I still look for equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to be extremely When I'm sourcing
equipment, especially through other
[SPEAKER_02]: countries I have to be careful about what
I'm talking about and I just I don't I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't tell them what kind of biomass or
anything like I only talk about parameters
[SPEAKER_02]: or anything because I've gotten so many
times where people get cold feet I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: get any more answering from them,
but Those are usually large-scale
[SPEAKER_02]: suppliers when you have people that are
more research-based Those are the people
[SPEAKER_02]: that are more willing to play and they
they they're really curious but when
[SPEAKER_02]: there's these large companies that really
don't need to go outside and do extra
[SPEAKER_02]: sales like like any any News is bad news
to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just keep it functioning as is their
goal give me like one or two other people
[SPEAKER_04]: who you would consider like innovators and
What their innovation was one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dustin Powers Dustin Powers is Known as
future 4200 future 4200 calm and on
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's One of the biggest Proponents of open
sourcing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's created a huge forum and Well,
he's actually a gang leader it's called
[SPEAKER_02]: the good life gang and It's just a way to
Open up different networking
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put on different networking events
and different different cities we've done
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction mostly extraction but some
cultivation as well and starting move like
[SPEAKER_02]: towards other other parts of it again like
The hemp is becoming a big focus on that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff as well but it started from this
dude going around and like paying
[SPEAKER_00]: consultants to teach teach him something
and getting the SOP for that specific
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and then and then he just Loaded up
his website is a treasure trove of kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the history of how people have been
extracting and Now all these other people
[SPEAKER_00]: just upload there as like, you know,
he was doing he was doing his own
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction he was you know, he was just a
He was a great market kind of guy like us
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he worked he worked for he worked at
skunk farms for a little while like so
[SPEAKER_00]: there there was a connection there of this
mentality from like gray wolf of Open,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know this dedication open source and
then like Dustin came out of that school
[SPEAKER_00]: of thought is for a little bit of
influence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and he He's actually completely
changed The like you The website that he
[SPEAKER_02]: produced was something that now it is the
resource for all all the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: extractors all the big names and also now
Lots of large-scale CBD companies and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know big Chinese China Manufacturers of
equipment are all just getting in there
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean there's advertisement going on
Personally, but it's not an advertised
[SPEAKER_02]: website.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not taking money off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just this just treasure trove of
people just talking about ideas unedited
[SPEAKER_02]: unedited and Like sure he catches Plenty
of flack for the things that he puts out
[SPEAKER_02]: and he tries to promote businesses as he
knows that they're legitimate and if
[SPEAKER_02]: things don't work out He has to take the
brunt of those things and by putting
[SPEAKER_02]: himself out there, it's just it's been a
noble thing and how he how he has given
[SPEAKER_02]: this information to so many people and
Like has to take a beating from time to
[SPEAKER_04]: time Give me something that you came
across on that site in the past month that
[SPEAKER_02]: you forwarded to him We were maybe Delta
10 Delta 10 stuff Delta 10 THC there's now
[SPEAKER_02]: a huge thread regarding that and don't
live when we had fun little for it if
[SPEAKER_00]: we're a layman's background, so So
depending specifically Everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: different and I'll have their own special
ways of affecting But depending on where
[SPEAKER_00]: or how the Different pieces of the
molecule are laid out you you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between THC Delta 9 and THC a
is THC a has a carbolic acid molecule on
[SPEAKER_00]: its tail and Boxel group carboxyl group
And in another thing there's Delta 8 THC
[SPEAKER_02]: which has gotten really popular with the
water clear trend and People would you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, they would throw a bunch of carbon
and some acids and stuff into the Boiling
[SPEAKER_02]: flask and then they'd start distilling it
and it's coming out beautiful water clear
[SPEAKER_02]: they send test results there they send
tests in the labs and then it's you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like Very low percentage of Delta 9 THC
Eventually, we started they've got
[SPEAKER_02]: standards for Delta 8 THC then started
quantifying that there's more THC in this
[SPEAKER_02]: that there is but then there's still a
little missing piece that like you'd see
[SPEAKER_02]: you know 60 to 70 80 percent cannabinoids
and this water clear stuff that you know
[SPEAKER_02]: is all cannabinoids and There's plenty of
isomers and stereo isomers of THC and
[SPEAKER_02]: these are things that happen through
through reaction their reactions that
[SPEAKER_02]: happen through heating and the presence of
acids and bases and given the different a
[SPEAKER_02]: different environmental Things or what was
sprayed on those those that can actually
[SPEAKER_02]: be a big indicator and what's happening
into the reactions as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So So there's all that distillation method
where like you put stuff in a pot It boils
[SPEAKER_00]: at different temperatures and all that
well throw a catalyst in that pot that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know is there like You know people
spray put sulfur on their plants or
[SPEAKER_00]: people, you know certain things get
sprayed on plants and when you Concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: that thing in a hot flask under vacuum
We're fires and fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a whole bunch of ways you
could do that But but to go back to Delta
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 Delta 10 is simply an unknown type of
THC that until recently was It is Yes in
[SPEAKER_00]: different income in different ways they
affect all three of those can affect a
[SPEAKER_04]: single person completely different So
these are kind of cannabinoids that have
[SPEAKER_04]: been only recently discovered.
[SPEAKER_02]: No They've been discovered but they're
only being mass-produced Yes, they really
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah make alum knew and knows about them
and he has and we are just now mass
[SPEAKER_02]: producing them because We have the freedom
of the market to start Start playing and
[SPEAKER_02]: then we also have a competition in the
market to try to make the clearest most
[SPEAKER_04]: beautiful looking oil which you know We're
talking like water like that that color
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it used to be Delta 8 THC Delta I
mean I we can use I'm saying historically
[SPEAKER_00]: historically when they first started
getting this perfectly clear Bottle of oil
[SPEAKER_00]: it was Delta 8 and they would do this
refluxing It's carbon acids and but but
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, and then they would use a catalyst
in the flask that they're boiling in what
[SPEAKER_04]: when we're talking about people who
appreciate the Clearance the
[SPEAKER_04]: see-throughness of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the consumer is that an expert
consumers?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and what is your opinion on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumers have been led to believe that
the clear the oil is Well, and and that
[SPEAKER_00]: clear could come from a lot of different
things It can be cut with another clear
[SPEAKER_00]: oil that it makes, you know, just diffuses
what color is in there There's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: things that can Clarity is definitely an
indicator of people though it's an
[SPEAKER_02]: indicator but the a Slight yellow amber
tint these are little little atomic level
[SPEAKER_02]: Refractions that are happening with
chromophores that hold into the tail end
[SPEAKER_02]: of the molecule.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are what are chromophores uncle
Nella They're they're basically Like
[SPEAKER_02]: atomically Small things that will refract
light at a different color.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have So great by breaking that bond
you like that's when people distill with
[SPEAKER_02]: certain things in the flask you can break
that that chromophore bond and You can
[SPEAKER_02]: also break that bond by Through
chromatography as well, which people
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually developed a method for Delta 9
THC water clear and That was just a method
[SPEAKER_02]: of taking a single past distillate and
then passing it through a series of
[SPEAKER_02]: usually magnesium silicate or fluorosil
actually and then but different color
[SPEAKER_02]: remediating adsorbents that were also
being used to Remediate pesticides and
[SPEAKER_02]: they still are used to remediate
pesticides and it just happened that You
[SPEAKER_02]: make water clear Delta 9 after remediating
pesticides properly as sometimes Depending
[SPEAKER_02]: on the oil and what kind of color and how
and yeah the condition THC 8 and 10 have
[SPEAKER_04]: been known for And They're they're
prevalent in the same way that THC is in
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada like Is it kind of like a is it a
totally different cannabinoid that isn't
[SPEAKER_04]: very low percentages in Well, not so much
on the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a reaction through processing So
you're not gonna have those you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna have a bunch of Delta 8 or Delta 10
any in your flowers You're gonna have it
[SPEAKER_04]: in a kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: It's these little slices but the only way
that's possible is that we've now created
[SPEAKER_00]: these Massive machine that will process a
lot so we get bigger trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we we see information come out
of plant Material from farms all over
[SPEAKER_00]: California grown differently go in
different ways different yields different
[SPEAKER_00]: strengths Different compounds or the
makeup of the cannabinoids in that
[SPEAKER_00]: specific strain like it's really
interesting We get to see a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: so at the same time as we're narrowing the
focus and really like getting to chop down
[SPEAKER_00]: into You know now we just picked up a
machine that will separate out individual
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids So you can collect them
individually It's a centrifugal
[SPEAKER_00]: partitioning chromatography this company
called rhodochron Sorry, sorry THC 8 and
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 are kind of like minor like other
cannabinoids that we've known about but
[SPEAKER_04]: haven't been able to isolate so on the
market are we gonna eventually see like
[SPEAKER_04]: THC 8 tinctures and THC 10 tinctures in
the same way that we see other kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: minor cannabinoid Totally and we've been
seeing mostly We've been seeing a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: THC 8 carts in cartridges and there's a
Subsequently a decent amount of Delta 10
[SPEAKER_04]: THC that's in there Meaning when I buy a
product people are highlighting the THC 8
[SPEAKER_04]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, they're just calling it If
you're buying a cart off the traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: market you they're saying it's one thing
but who knows what really is in that
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridge, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So but because you can take garbage oil
And by turning by doing this process to
[SPEAKER_00]: convert to Delta 8 clean it up to make it
look clear a lot of guys do that because
[SPEAKER_00]: they can buy a really cheap oil get a
little bit of a fraction of that often
[SPEAKER_00]: this really nice looking oil and then it's
just cheaper the way that it's produced
[SPEAKER_02]: then like Water clear Delta 9 it takes
extremely expensive of absorbance and a
[SPEAKER_02]: process to do it with the Delta 8 you
throw some Activated carbon in your flask.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you distill right here,
you can get water clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a few other a few other
parameters to change but You just dump a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of garbage in your flask and then
just mix it with your oil and your oil is
[SPEAKER_02]: coming out nicely That was what a bunch of
people were doing to fix their Dark oil,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in the early days when people
really weren't distilling very well Just
[SPEAKER_04]: quickly when we're talking about fixing
stuff They're as in humble for a I Guess
[SPEAKER_04]: an extraction company that will take your
moldy And so can you guys talk about?
[SPEAKER_04]: like while you may be able to clean moldy
flour is that I Mean that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: are doing I mean moldy flour is like
that's unless it depends on the mold and
[SPEAKER_02]: usually it's gonna be botrytis or If it's
something and those don't leave behind any
[SPEAKER_02]: aflatoxins they're going If it was
something like aspergillus, which is more
[SPEAKER_02]: of a grain mold then that leaves behind
things that that can go into solution
[SPEAKER_02]: molds those molds can all be Filtered out
at a point to my ground range and with
[SPEAKER_02]: proper distillation methods They won't
they don't come out but they they actually
[SPEAKER_02]: are usually undetectable by By the time
our oil is crude not even before it's gone
[SPEAKER_02]: through most of the extra processing
methods and It's still cannabinoids coming
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Long story short.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people that that do do that kind
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do it but we Thoroughly test our end
products just as a an education point
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think when your average person
here is like Someone's taking moldy flour
[SPEAKER_04]: and turning the concentrate you got if
someone made an amazing product Like a
[SPEAKER_04]: concentrate out of what started as moldy
flour and either of you would have any
[SPEAKER_02]: problem smoking that well do you think
about the When you when you get a hard
[SPEAKER_02]: cider do you think about a nice apple or
do you think about that rotten apple
[SPEAKER_02]: that's fermenting?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean The end product is actually the the
rotten apple We're pulling the actual Non
[SPEAKER_02]: biological compounds out of it completely
separating it from the biomass So any of
[SPEAKER_02]: those is the but we leave behind all the
biological compounds that all the DNA is
[SPEAKER_02]: left back behind with biomass And that's
what our process does is to separate
[SPEAKER_00]: target oils from biological compounds So
yes, I would I I do smoke our product I do
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it if it if there is some moldy,
you know Oh, yes, I I smoke it every day
[SPEAKER_00]: Idea, you know going back to where we
started us we got into this small farm
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of mentality and how can we support
this and make this turn this into a
[SPEAKER_00]: business and that was one of the things
like we've actually got to You know save a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple farms by them sending us all their
molding material And like we extracting
[SPEAKER_00]: all the good stuff out of it leaving
behind all the all the garbage and
[SPEAKER_00]: refining it And testing it make sure it's
you know Okay to sell to a consumer market
[SPEAKER_00]: and and we sell it knowing that we did
like a really good job and then that money
[SPEAKER_00]: goes back to that farmer and It's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really cool and they live for
another season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, which is you know And then the day
all you can hope for right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just get to the next one When you were
first growing in Michigan and you were
[SPEAKER_04]: first growing up in Humboldt What were the
genetics that you came into that you were
[SPEAKER_04]: just like?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is amazing I'm from I'm from
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yours is gonna be like mine are gonna
be wacky in names that Mine mine's
[SPEAKER_02]: Williams wonder was that was my baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved Williams wonder and
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Big fat I I don't know how true it is
I was told that Williams wonders like in
[SPEAKER_02]: own an indoor only strain because it has
to be Has to be floured under 12 12 and 12
[SPEAKER_02]: and it won't it won't start outdoor fast
enough and I mean I was in Michigan it
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't matter but it was like a super
strong Lysol and Just It was the bud there
[SPEAKER_02]: was the it wasn't leafy you had really big
leaves and then one day you'd walk in and
[SPEAKER_02]: all of your plants would be hanging over
because they would just plump up at the
[SPEAKER_02]: same time then you'd start after like it
was just really fast really quick and like
[SPEAKER_02]: low maintenance I Did that with super
silver haze as just a good strong thing
[SPEAKER_02]: that was gonna Reduce more deal with mold
because I was you know, a new grower and I
[SPEAKER_02]: needed something to be mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Think for years I grew just a few
strains Platinum Girl Scout cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was platinum OG a Girl Scout cross
that was bunkers just just the most fire
[SPEAKER_00]: just well Every bud was just beautiful
like and it was always dense you get when
[SPEAKER_00]: you grew that strain is like dropping
little Rocks in your in your bucket when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trimming, you know, it's like I can
just pop we're like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the OGs and stuff are a little bit lighter
and so I grew that platinum cookie strain
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew Tahoe OG a cut of Tahoe G Louie the
13th and OG 18 that's how we met.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those are my three strains the Tahoe
Louie and Cookies which were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I you know, I Grew things that I knew
people like and I and I like myself and
[SPEAKER_00]: those strains were all fire like,
you know, pretty heavy indica's Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of hype I mean right I mean,
I think I came from I still love Louie and
[SPEAKER_01]: Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still two of my favorite strains
the Limonene and Tahoe was like So
[SPEAKER_00]: pronounced like you just smell this like
citrus coming off that plant like with
[SPEAKER_02]: that fuel underneath it was and they grew
so and they grew so perfectly form cola
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, chunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and then the Louie's had that
awesome crown and crown of yeah They were
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They purple out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember that whole greenhouse purpled
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was the girl the Platinum Girl
Scout they would too like yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Platinum would just You know get a
little cold at night and they would just
[SPEAKER_02]: go turn into Like the density of a
baseball though I'm gonna transition to
[SPEAKER_04]: the joys of regulation What what's one
regulation that affects you as a
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturer that drives you crazy No
smoking within 50 feet of the building No
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking marijuana on premises The shock of
culture like we you know, we we're
[SPEAKER_01]: Old-school guys like we like to work
around our plants and smoke them So I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know is that the one that but I'm
sure that you've got some other stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: you struggle with I have a really odd odd
take on the Regulations, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I I'm not gonna like have an opinion about
the taxes and all that they're you know
[SPEAKER_00]: debilitating and terrible but a lot of the
other regulations specifically for
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing, you know that kind of
circle around safety and compliance and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like I wanted to get better at
this to like get people better product at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the day and so like if if
someone's pushing that into the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and like Saying no if it's going I mean we
have like this some of the toughest laws
[SPEAKER_00]: on pesticide content Yeah in the US we
have but beyond what the FDA would even
[SPEAKER_00]: say There's some things that have happened
that do make Some barriers to get into it
[SPEAKER_00]: because you got to try a lot harder To get
good product, but they're super important
[SPEAKER_00]: for like making the industry real and like
making consumers have you know a good
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling about what the people that are in
the marketplace are bringing to the table
[SPEAKER_00]: and Just like anything else out there like
all the garbage food that's in the grocery
[SPEAKER_00]: store all these different things like
There's you know, sometimes regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: don't Get followed and people try to you
know cut corners and skirt them But like I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that that spirit of like trying to
get better and having regulations in that
[SPEAKER_00]: sense Push you towards that goal line of
like offering the absolute best product
[SPEAKER_00]: you can I'm cool with it Everything else
past that, you know taxation and like the
[SPEAKER_00]: way they've rolled this out everything
like obviously I'm I'm in it so I have
[SPEAKER_00]: issues like everybody else but I think a
lot something that's overlooked is that is
[SPEAKER_00]: that other work?
[SPEAKER_04]: How'd you guys I think of LA and I think
of per square foot pricing How'd you guys
[SPEAKER_04]: decide to set up a manufacturing facility
in LA versus?
[SPEAKER_04]: 45 minutes north of LA where it's probably
much cheaper So a lot of things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we we met this guy about four years ago
His name was Yuzo Nishihara So Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: big big dude he worked at that time for
one of the largest manufacturers of
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavored hookah tobacco that a huge they
just released this like huge 220,000
[SPEAKER_00]: square foot, you know facility and then
like, you know FDA came out be like no no
[SPEAKER_00]: flavored tobacco you're done and like that
whole market just went And then they came
[SPEAKER_00]: out with pods and now they're all they're
fighting pods over over targeting,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like Juul pod Juul pod Yeah,
they outlawed it outlawed it so that but
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the FDA's got that coming down in
two years Anyways, so like Dijon Clove
[SPEAKER_00]: cigarettes, you know, all these different
things are like those things are all done
[SPEAKER_00]: within two years You won't see any
flavored.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they kept menthol I think there'd
be like riots if like Yeah, right exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: all these southern bells like just pissed
off that's not good for anybody But yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: the so all that regulation where was I
going with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we met this dude he was part of
this big company he Brought us down here
[SPEAKER_00]: on this kind of like pre-con And and we
were so that year we were on a 160 acre
[SPEAKER_00]: farm him and I were running the farm and
we had Mendocino outside of ukiah not too
[SPEAKER_00]: far from Johnny stash's place actually And
so for a year we built ran this farm It
[SPEAKER_00]: was supposed to be like five guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ended up being me and Noah the entire
year like the partner we had was like how
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff things happening not not good things
happening with him and So it was really
[SPEAKER_00]: uncomfortable for like the last six
months, but we just like stuck it out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and we said, okay Where to next and
and I'd been feeling for a year or so like
[SPEAKER_00]: We did this trial run me and Noah
partnered up on this project built our own
[SPEAKER_00]: for our first closed loop system In a car
designed that he did in a carport in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of nowhere in Mendocino and Me
slightly gray wolf design And so I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like man if I think this is where this
industry is going to be the most
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting I think most I don't think
soccer mom's gonna be sitting in their car
[SPEAKER_00]: rolling up to be you know in their minivan
I think they're gonna have a little vape
[SPEAKER_00]: pen or they're gonna have a little topical
or they're gonna take a little pill like
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else does That's not a weed head
kind of kind of person and I was like
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I roll I roll joints a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean my wife like probably smoke a
part of a J every night if I'm like I Have
[SPEAKER_00]: kids I don't smoke till like 8 o'clock at
night So because I don't smoke all day
[SPEAKER_00]: like I take a couple pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like ready to go to bed In years past
my favorite way was splits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Little tobacco and hash or a little bit
of tobacco and some sunflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through a pretty long period of
just like Chewing through concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: because we were making so much we're
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we're doing flavors specifically
We're just like crush flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and then we were doing contract
manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people would bring like a Thousand we
had thousand different strains come
[SPEAKER_00]: through there that we're doing these small
batch like sauce
[SPEAKER_01]: Really like crazy sure like Lemon lime and
just don't candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah became like oh, what does this taste
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this taste like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she's no good But yeah, I would say
now I just I'll smoke a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rarely even hit make ends that much
anymore Don't do the splits at all Very
[SPEAKER_00]: very occasionally like usually when I'm
stoned during the day, I'll smoke a That's
[SPEAKER_02]: that's my primary Intake intake I think I
have a CBD heavy tincture and a THC the
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD is actually like a full spectrum from
hemp and the THC is like a two-to-one
[SPEAKER_02]: ratio of THC distillate to MCT so I I take
those every night and then I'll take a few
[SPEAKER_02]: drops of the CBD air a few droppers
through this of the CBD throughout the
[SPEAKER_02]: day, but The CBD just keeps anxiety a pan
anxiety and I've lower back pain as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: but mostly anxiety down THC helps me sleep
I'm usually so excited about how things
[SPEAKER_02]: went on with the workday I like I love my
factory and when I leave it I Just
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about the next thing that I'm
gonna build there and like I it's hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Take a little as I'm leaving work I take
about a thousand milligrams of THC and
[SPEAKER_02]: then by the time I'm eating my dinner and
everything it's starting to kick in and
[SPEAKER_02]: letting me start to Slow down a little bit
so I can wake up and I've got three white
[SPEAKER_02]: film evaporators that I'm installing one
massive point five and then two point two
[SPEAKER_02]: meter squared wiped films I've got society
the surface area of the of the Cylinders
[SPEAKER_00]: is measured and metered squared and a
point five is like a massive surface area
[SPEAKER_02]: to evaporate off of and We're installing a
falling film evaporator busy be falling
[SPEAKER_02]: film evaporator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully this week when we get less of
the parts and Firing up the centrifugal
[SPEAKER_02]: partitioning chromatography system we also
have Got my chemist working on THC
[SPEAKER_02]: remediation from CBD Material and then
we're also working on converting CBD Yep
[SPEAKER_02]: to take it out of CBD oil to keep it To
keep it full-spectrum To be able to yes,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then also Converting CBD To THC we're
developing standard procedure SOPs around
[SPEAKER_02]: that and then Trying to build equipment to
do that Not commonly and people do do it
[SPEAKER_02]: and it can be done Yeah, and I think that
that's a big future of where don't say
[SPEAKER_00]: that so lightly like a like maybe four
people currently are Doing anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's on such a small scale and it doesn't
actually work correctly so you'll get like
[SPEAKER_00]: half isomers so half your oil will be like
that converted oil some of it'll be some
[SPEAKER_00]: Frankenstein a lot of it don't see
molecule a lot of its Delta and send some
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta 8 so doing it correctly to where you
get a Conversion from a consistent Delta 9
[SPEAKER_00]: THC is like is is a consistent conversion
to it A very specific yield meaning like
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of material that gets converted
is Like changing and so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's the industry shaking
revolutionized everything so you think
[SPEAKER_00]: about those like tens of hundreds of
thousands of acres in Colombia and Chile
[SPEAKER_02]: that grow and imagine the implications
that it makes for When when places
[SPEAKER_02]: actually start legalizing THC like it
takes How many how long to grow a plant
[SPEAKER_04]: and then get it to because currently it's
something that isn't really relevant
[SPEAKER_04]: because you can't grow a hemp farm and
then Process and then convert it to THC
[SPEAKER_04]: and sell it through the teeth Dispense
well not in California, but but in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future wait not the future right now the
USDA just opined on that Anything any
[SPEAKER_00]: compound because of the farm bill derived
from a hemp plant is a legal compound and
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the language In the in the farm
bill there needs no other congressional
[SPEAKER_00]: approval like THC from hemp and CBD for
hemp are perfectly legal compound So that
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like and I think if like the Senate
Majority Leader like McConnell who's been
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing hemp for a long time That is the
back door to legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why cannabis probably isn't Legal
on a federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a crafty old geezer He's like the guy
in every single scooby-doo show,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, oh, well, yeah, you got me this
time Yeah, exactly You don't kid So if I
[SPEAKER_04]: understand correctly you guys see a future
where the massive massive amounts of hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: fields being grown Can be converted to THC
Which could end up in my vape cartridge?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and and actually people are now
starting to grow hemp for terpene profiles
[SPEAKER_02]: if people are worried about flavors and
Cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well flavor profiles can all be done
through breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can eventually isolate those and then
you can isolate the terpenes and Then from
[SPEAKER_02]: there you grow different cultivars for
different cannabinoids and then we start
[SPEAKER_02]: to Isolate these cannabinoids and then we
can form them into a concentrate that is
[SPEAKER_02]: Tailored with the right concentration of
cannabinoids with the flavor profile that
[SPEAKER_02]: that that's all all natural
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually doesn't mean anything
all-natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really no there's really no
definition to all-natural you can Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: we so what it means to me versus you
versus subjective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, ideally I think I mean cannabis
Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I was just saying all-natural and
Like it was a really stupid thing for me
[SPEAKER_02]: to say I didn't mean all-natural I met I
met cannabis derived or hemp derived.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Yeah, so Terpenes coming from the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the word is plant derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're not using cannabis
terpenes, I think you take Plant derived
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and if they're not plant derived
terpenes, they're all oil based synthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, no if it no plant derived
terpenes is what people say about non
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis it's it's either cannabis derived
terpenes or it's Plant derived terpenes is
[SPEAKER_02]: just the way that people skirt though
because it comes from a lot of different
[SPEAKER_02]: plants Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they skirt around that and people say
that all the time So it's all the terpenes
[SPEAKER_02]: out there are plant derived like that and
they're actually molecular the same but
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the profiles like The real thing is
that it's terpene profiles that are
[SPEAKER_00]: important and profiles that come out of
cannabis are way way way more complex than
[SPEAKER_02]: five terpenes they're like and and also
there's Then you're not taking the there's
[SPEAKER_02]: flavonoids and esters that don't come over
in a steam distillation Flavonoids kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: get the short stick people talk about
cannabinoids terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Give a plug to flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do we care about flavonoids?
[SPEAKER_02]: They they're I'm not Completely versed on
their medical benefits, but they are
[SPEAKER_02]: heavier molecules that add flavor to the
profile of cannabis, but because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: All factory terpenes deal specifically
with your olfactory senses where
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoids deal with your Tongue and your
taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes and The molecule is way heavier on the
flavonoids So it's it it does not get
[SPEAKER_02]: distilled out When yeah, it's not part of
the distilled terpenes It's not part of a
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene blend same thing with the esters
as well And these are things that that
[SPEAKER_02]: blend to the entire smell profile We call
it a terpene profile, but it's a it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: smell or it's an experience profile Yes,
yeah, and that's yes and and we don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens when you What kind of
reactions happen when you combust all
[SPEAKER_00]: those different?
[SPEAKER_00]: 180 different compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know But yeah on a medical level like
there's you know, I'm certainly this way
[SPEAKER_00]: back this conference that we're doing is
like Focused exactly on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of fiction out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have a lot of really good
ideas About what cannabis Do what
[SPEAKER_00]: different compounds what you know full
spectrum single isolates, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people have some good ideas But
there is not enough science that are you
[SPEAKER_00]: know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Propping up these ideas or smashing them
to pieces and so like that the conference
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing is really focused on People
who are actually doing that research and
[SPEAKER_00]: finding some answers Can come out and talk
and bring into the attention of the public
[SPEAKER_02]: People are making the oil and you know
this in the gray black and newly white
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like There's a disconnection
between the cutting-edge research and the
[SPEAKER_02]: people that are making the medicine and
once you start connecting those people
[SPEAKER_02]: that is like I think that there's a lot of
great things that can happen you go back
[SPEAKER_00]: to like, you know want to make the best
product like Find out what's in what
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery method?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is best for you know, the doctors are
doing research on that cannabinoid or that
[SPEAKER_02]: group of cannabinoids, you know But we've
got a long way to go in research and like
[SPEAKER_02]: connecting the people that actually are
passionate about About it on the side of
[SPEAKER_02]: making the medicine is really important
with the people that are actually
[SPEAKER_04]: researching and and providing that
medicine Give me one kind of medical
[SPEAKER_04]: scientific research study that's come out
that Has resonated with you and then give
[SPEAKER_02]: me one patent That concerns you That's a
man I wish I had been prepared for that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to go first I'll do the medical
one and you can do the patent one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the the medical one I there's this
guy UCLA and he's part of the Him and his
[SPEAKER_00]: research partner Ziva Cooper Jeff chin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so Jeff chin and Ziva I watched a
talk with him the other day and he did it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a small, you know takes money to
Donate to the UCLA cannabis research fund.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great great place to put some of
that weed money Don't give them cash.
[SPEAKER_04]: They won't take it but they
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so they they did a small study where
they gave someone five I'm gonna get the
[SPEAKER_00]: dosing off because I didn't memorize it
but it was like five milligrams of
[SPEAKER_00]: oxycodone by itself and they would measure
from normal how much pain or the analgesic
[SPEAKER_00]: effect of that five milligrams on them
five Milligrams of oxycodone really didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: do hardly anything right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no noticeable change in there and
they're being able to withstand pain Then
[SPEAKER_00]: they gave them a five milligram dose of
THC and There was a 20% increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: analgesic effect and they could withstand
20% more pain Then they gave them five
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams of oxycodone and five
milligrams of THC together and It had an
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% increase in pain management and at
that low doses of oxycodone like the kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of addiction worries go away it doesn't
but there's a catalytic effect between the
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and the oxycodone working together to
give a enormous boost in analgesic effect
[SPEAKER_00]: and like We are sitting on top of the
biggest like heroin crisis Opioid crisis
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever I call it ever and and and most
most of those addictions start with Over
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribing or overdosing to get the
analgesic effect that they need because of
[SPEAKER_00]: some real pain that's going on in their
body and they get hooked, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh The common story I got in a car
accident got prescribed Vicodin Vicodin
[SPEAKER_00]: led to Percocet Percocet led to this
Prescription yeah, I'm chilling on the
[SPEAKER_00]: streets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's a pretty common story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think Studies like that which until I
heard that I'm like, oh using cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: with with pharma like I Don't know if
that's good or bad, you know, my my humble
[SPEAKER_00]: hippie side of me would say that like
probably Bad, but my scientific mind says
[SPEAKER_00]: man, like I want to see like results Of
some studies like that if you could like
[SPEAKER_02]: it reduces him the amount I mean if if it
if it increases the efficacy, I don't I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't care if it's you know, like I Don't
care who I'm dancing who it's dancing with
[SPEAKER_02]: or what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I care about if it's decreasing the the
need for that other that other component
[SPEAKER_02]: and I guess as a Puritan as a Puritan Like
we it might not seem like it's the best
[SPEAKER_02]: best bet but usually it's just like try to
take the That's the point like fines,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know find out for sure like I'm not
that guy that goes around saying cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely can't kill you cannabis camp
like you harm you in any way like I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know that like I don't think so I've
definitely I should have been harmed if it
[SPEAKER_02]: was I mean I was gonna harm me but I mean
I did see you crawling across About a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred yards on cannabis, but that's cuz
he got he got brave with the dabs No,
[SPEAKER_02]: no.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was lied to by someone this this guy
I have 39th birthday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had he makes me a 39 in oil about you
know This size it was about that much a
[SPEAKER_00]: gram like two grams of oil and I'm like
back then I didn't really smoke oil that
[SPEAKER_00]: much I was a traditional guy and he's
like, yeah, I'm like I'm like that seems
[SPEAKER_00]: like a lie You know, I only spoke like a
little bit of this so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I don't know It's like pretty
much the same and so it ends up he just
[SPEAKER_00]: drops the the circle of the nine Into the
dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, all right took the whole thing
Immediate was like oh, that's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not gonna be a good day and Tried
to get out of his front door on one side
[SPEAKER_00]: of the property was about a hundred yards
from my back door and I made that crawl
[SPEAKER_00]: like across the pond Up a hill like barely
couldn't see couldn't barely move my leg
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, like terrible Vomited ever all
over myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was just the worst night I mean I
didn't seem to the next day and he was
[SPEAKER_02]: very rusted Very rusted actually,
I don't know if it was the next day or the
[SPEAKER_02]: day after the next day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Okay on the hot seat with a harder
question a Patent application or approved
[SPEAKER_04]: patent and actually I'm gonna expand it
that you're either concerned by or like
[SPEAKER_04]: that's totally clever and ingenious and
they deserve that patent cool,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't As for I'm I Don't see much many
enforceable patents that really that
[SPEAKER_02]: concern me there's Yeah, there is like
there's always there's a million ways of
[SPEAKER_02]: skin a cat so technological patents are
They're not a big concern, but the things
[SPEAKER_02]: that really interest me are the the
patents coming out regarding like
[SPEAKER_02]: technological advances regarding
condensation of ethanol that we we use in
[SPEAKER_02]: our processes which a guy that I know
through Instagram I've been He's been
[SPEAKER_02]: developing from Yellowstone extractions
has been developing a method of instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: using chillers to condense ethanol vapors
and a falling film evaporator using
[SPEAKER_02]: diffusion and pressure and then Passing
that heat out just into the atmosphere and
[SPEAKER_02]: really reducing the amount of energy
costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's It was super innovative I've been
talking to the guy for past year and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half as he's been developing this and He's
just kind of giving me a little
[SPEAKER_02]: breadcrumbs along the trail to tell me
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally he were better release this
Patent pending technology that really is
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome for the industrial scale
condensation of ethanol
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to reduce the amount of
electricity that I that I use for
[SPEAKER_02]: recovering ethanol greatly Yes,
yeah totally yeah, I'm gonna I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: buy his systems from him as a and add on
to my system they triple the capacity Of
[SPEAKER_00]: the standard evaporator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah of the standard evaporator And he did
it really well like he it's sexy yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: so is he like the mad scientist you're the
business guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and so He obviously has a wish list
of Toys he wants to play with are you the
[SPEAKER_04]: one who has to approve budgets?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, we kind of argue over it That's been
pretty you know, yeah, there's
[SPEAKER_02]: My my membrane ethanol recovery system
that we developed ourselves We've figured
[SPEAKER_02]: out a way to recover ethanol everybody
thought that to separate ethanol from oil
[SPEAKER_02]: you need to distill it and so there takes
that takes a decent amount of energy to
[SPEAKER_02]: just to vaporize ethanol and then
recondense it so we have developed a
[SPEAKER_02]: method to Mechanically separate ethanol
from our From our crude stream with a
[SPEAKER_02]: fraction of the energy so we use You know
less than 30 amps to recover 150 gallons
[SPEAKER_02]: an hour when That would be an average
around 200 250 amps that 200 220 volts so
[SPEAKER_02]: our energy efficiency is gone through the
roof and It's a technology that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: actually open up the ability for
large-scale ethanol extraction and using
[SPEAKER_02]: Like using ethanol potentially as a
solvent for other industries not not just
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids, but because it's been proven
as a recovery method and it has a It's
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a heavier molecule that takes more
energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't been used much in extraction
industries, but now the fact that It's
[SPEAKER_02]: been proven to be able to separate be
separated in industrial scales There's the
[SPEAKER_02]: potential it'll be used not just in
cannabis oil production, but oil
[SPEAKER_02]: production across several different
industries So this is kind of like how the
[SPEAKER_04]: porn industry led innovation in digital
media monetization We hope so and cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: is introducing new techniques to other
industries that is happening It's
[SPEAKER_04]: grassroots NASA of modern Technological
innovation totally and and and the this
[SPEAKER_00]: Ridiculous thing ridiculously cool thing
about it is that it's all like grassroots
[SPEAKER_00]: oriented Like we're we're two guys who you
know started growing small-scale and then
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of grew grew in this industry
and like I think that's the same for all
[SPEAKER_02]: the the tech guys in our space like most
of this innovation isn't coming from from
[SPEAKER_02]: large companies or Deutsch processor big
research firms like with any Large R&D
[SPEAKER_02]: budgets it's coming from people that are
doing out of passion and necessity It's
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from me smokers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, straight up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah You You You You You You You You
