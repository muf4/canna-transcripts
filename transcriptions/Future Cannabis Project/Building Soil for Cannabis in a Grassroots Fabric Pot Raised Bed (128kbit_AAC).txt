[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here with Eric and Todd from Organics
Alive.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're sort of social distancing,
but we're gonna build some soil from
[SPEAKER_07]: scratch for Tom, who's off camera,
but we'll see him in a second.
[SPEAKER_07]: For his backyard six plant grow,
we got, let me just quickly get the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, baby grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we got a whole bunch of babies ready to
go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, baby girl.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here, all right, so hold on one second.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you play with her?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, I just keep her over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess I'm gonna let you guys,
Gemma, can you be quiet for one second?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm gonna let you guys take it away,
but basically the idea is, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: for home growers in their backyard,
how do you build the soil up?
[SPEAKER_07]: So let you guys take it away.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for, you know, I'd say for kind of
like the beginning stage, get things
[SPEAKER_04]: going, we like to keep it as simple as
possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you begin to get involved with your
plant, get involved with your soil,
[SPEAKER_04]: start to understand a little bit about
soil biology, compost, the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna show you a real easy way to
make a very, very simple and successful
[SPEAKER_04]: soil, and then start to explore into how
you're making your own soil and taking
[SPEAKER_04]: different components and adding them to
different ratios.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as soon as you start getting the hang
of things, getting the flow of things,
[SPEAKER_04]: it just gets funner and funner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to put that together.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the interesting things is you
guys literally went to the, what store did
[SPEAKER_07]: you go to?
[SPEAKER_04]: We went down in near San Clemente.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give them a, what do you call that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a hydro store?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a hydro store.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give them a shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Beach Cities down in Camino Capaz,
Toronto, and just a normal hydro store.
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, we got the most,
I think the most, one of the most popular
[SPEAKER_04]: soils, which is just Fox Farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great soil, but there's some things
we're gonna add to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this way, because we like a different
type of consistency, we like to add some
[SPEAKER_04]: elements.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the elements we're gonna add here
is our premium mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our premium mix from Organics Alive is
worm castings, some really nice vegetable
[SPEAKER_04]: compost, and a little bit of mineral to
add in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the vegetable compost is 30 to one
carbon nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're gonna get into that in a little
bit, but carbon nitrogen is a really great
[SPEAKER_04]: element to kind of look at in regards to
how your biology is gonna grow,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially the bio.
[SPEAKER_04]: The balance of your biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're gonna add that to just a simple
potting soil, and then we're gonna add a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit of the Berger there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just a peat, a normal peat product.
[SPEAKER_04]: We find this good quality and good
consistency as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: But one of the interesting things was when
you went to the hydro store, they were out
[SPEAKER_07]: of like everything, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, they were.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were looking for roots potting soil,
and they were back order on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a couple other companies too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like this year there's quite some
action in both the compost area and the
[SPEAKER_04]: soil area.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's not normal.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you're not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I've never ever seen that kind
of, you know, like a back order on soil
[SPEAKER_04]: like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great news.
[SPEAKER_04]: It means everybody's gardening.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we need.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need more gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you guys determine how much you
need to mix for whatever purpose you're
[SPEAKER_02]: using it for?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we did the simple math on the
container.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a four by four by 16 inch bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's about 20 cubic feet roughly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it'll compact down a little bit
with water as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So doing the math on how many cubic feet
soil to amendment.
[SPEAKER_06]: We like to add our castings at a 10 to up
15 percent ratio.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're starting with, you know,
like you said, good base organic blend.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's already pre amended with a lot
of additives like shrimp and crab meal and
[SPEAKER_06]: different oceanic food sources for the
biology that we have within our castings.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things I really like in here is
the shrimp and the crab meal.
[SPEAKER_06]: It contains chitin.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the way we feed our worms,
we get chitin and cellulose degraders.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are certain microorganisms that
will help to digest and create enzymes
[SPEAKER_06]: that will increase the sugars of the
plants and different responses for overall
[SPEAKER_06]: strength and health and immunity for the
whole system.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's good, good base potting soil to
start with.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then like we were saying, our castings
are a little bit dense.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the mix, we like to add a little bit
of something with a higher porosity.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we went with the Berger through adding
a little bail of this in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has extra perlite and peat,
not as much compost to retain the moisture
[SPEAKER_06]: and give it a little fluff as it comes out
of the bale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the the environment we're creating now,
is this is this good for any type of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants or specific types of plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or can you grow anything here?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really good base mix, to be honest,
for any raised bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely your higher end because
we're buying the best inputs possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get the best outcome in the
end from that, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the idea is over, like you'd start
with kind of a mix that's not jam packed
[SPEAKER_07]: with nutrients and then over time,
because I mean, these are babies right
[SPEAKER_07]: now, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So.
[SPEAKER_06]: So being babies, we want to make sure that
the soil is not going to be hot as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you mix a soil on your own and
you're adding too many different meals and
[SPEAKER_06]: inputs, you could create a hot
environment, which is like an excess of
[SPEAKER_06]: nitrogens and phosphorus that can
potentially burn your roots to your plant
[SPEAKER_06]: and damage the seedling as it goes in.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of our ways to help mitigate that is
through our biology.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once we water and we get the worm castings
and our microorganisms kicking in there,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're going to start consuming all those
excess nitrates and nitrites that could
[SPEAKER_06]: potentially burn your plant when it goes
in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also by using our microbial rich
solution right away, by brewing up that,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's going to be your other great
benefit to mitigate any potential burn or
[SPEAKER_06]: hotness in your soil mix.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that could potentially come from the
soil yard, you not even knowing and them
[SPEAKER_06]: not intending by not fully composting
their compost.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's many issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: That can occur to cause that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you can already see, you know,
the difference in the richness and the
[SPEAKER_04]: color.
[SPEAKER_06]: This really just helps cut that down a
little bit and helps fluff up the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have better water, the water
drainage and water retention at the same
[SPEAKER_04]: time gives it that real nice balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you said your castings were,
what was the word you used?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thick or they were heavy or what did you
say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Castings are in general are a little bit
dense, dense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a little bit dense.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really in soil blends, you know,
10 to 20% is really the threshold,
[SPEAKER_04]: minimum 5%.
[SPEAKER_04]: But depending on how you like the
consistency and how you want to water and
[SPEAKER_04]: where your location is, I'd say the
maximum would be 20 20%.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that 20% density of the entire
blend?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so if you have, you know,
five or four bags or five bags,
[SPEAKER_04]: one of those bags would essentially be a
premium mix of castings.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so with the math being about 20 cubic
feet within the container, we'll add one
[SPEAKER_06]: one or add a little bit of our castings
that will get us to that 10%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at this point in your guys experience,
do you put this together just kind of by
[SPEAKER_02]: feel?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely by experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we've used a lot of the soils on
the market and then I've experienced
[SPEAKER_04]: different densities throughout our time
growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we found that you know, having this
type of consistency is the best for plants
[SPEAKER_04]: because it really gives them an
opportunity to breathe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what's happening with your soil
as they're breathing, they're drying,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're watering.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's almost you want to have that two
day, three day watering period to really
[SPEAKER_04]: make sure your plants are extending roots
and growing real healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, now for the fun part.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what we're going to add now,
and this is kind of the secret sauce of
[SPEAKER_04]: any good soil, blend would be your premium
mix, Organics Life premium mix or a very
[SPEAKER_04]: good worm casting slash vegetable compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always going to be a great addition.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of the biology is going to come
from the worm castings.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want to make sure you have enough
diversity, a good balance of biology to
[SPEAKER_04]: come from those worm castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the bag you have right now,
are the castings just evenly distributed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Throughout the bag?
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is actually a specific ratio.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have 47% worm castings or 52% worm
castings, 47% compost, and the rest being
[SPEAKER_04]: mineral.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we put fossilized kelp in there,
which is great for a calcium magnesium
[SPEAKER_04]: source.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also the biology will use them as
attachment sites to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's your product, right?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you created that mix and you designed
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Developed that, yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: This premium mix we designed in 2002 to
compliment just the pure castings by
[SPEAKER_06]: adding the compost.
[SPEAKER_06]: The compost really adds more moisture
holding capacity, as well as a carbon and
[SPEAKER_06]: nitrogen food source for the
microorganisms in the castings.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what made you guys decide to start
your own nutrient company?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there wasn't really that much
organics on the shelves back in the late
[SPEAKER_04]: 90s and early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a couple companies out there,
but it was mostly a lot of synthetics and
[SPEAKER_04]: indoor hydroponics and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we started to play around with our own
nutrient or our own soil blends.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we started to dig into soils a little
bit, that kind of led us to understanding
[SPEAKER_04]: the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_04]: The soil food web led us to understand how
we can obtain the best biology,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then that took us into vermiculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from there, we started to put together
different feeds for worms, which then
[SPEAKER_04]: inspires the red wiggler to put out a
casting that's high quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys growers as well?
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of how this all started,
just being growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then from there, biology took us into
fermentations, and then that's kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: where the whole line began to take hold.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's been a really fun journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are we creating a living soil
environment?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is kind of the beginning phases of a
living soil, especially adding this type
[SPEAKER_04]: of biology and having the carbon nitrogen
that we're adding via the compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then from here, you'll probably have
great guests that can talk about to cover
[SPEAKER_04]: crops and the diversity of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: When one cycle is done, what are the best
ways to add nutrients back into your soil
[SPEAKER_04]: via cover crops?
[SPEAKER_04]: So our goal is to take this one base.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super simple to put together at the
proper biology via worm castings.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then from there, you'll begin to say,
OK, I want to keep the soil in here
[SPEAKER_04]: because you don't want to keep taking it
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a waste.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it gets expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how to just kind of keep soil alive in
a bed like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really easy, actually,
in a bed like this, a four by four from
[SPEAKER_04]: grassroots.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's perfect for a living bed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we use, actually, for our
gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do most people assume that you need to
create a living soil environment in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I might have assumed that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, what we're doing is we're putting
the right food sources to sustain that
[SPEAKER_06]: microbial process and then the right
microbes so that they're in a balance as
[SPEAKER_06]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we've done is we've added the
premium mix and then added the worm
[SPEAKER_04]: castings as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've done both additions here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the classic soil in the hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you appreciating no shovel or no rake?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, this was an old school method
and we're going to continue with it,
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your worm castings soil is much darker.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pure worm castings.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no compost in that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the pure castings.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pure castings.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the pure worm castings,
which they are certified organic.
[SPEAKER_06]: California Department of Food and Ag,
CCOF as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're inputting in certified organic
inputs.
[SPEAKER_06]: The way we feed the worms, we also exclude
manures and biosolids and other possible
[SPEAKER_06]: contaminants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we get the most pure end product from
that digestion process of the worm.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we use the red wigglers as well for
the castings.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, appreciating no shovel very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so a lot of people talk about,
you know, like bone meal, kelp meal,
[SPEAKER_07]: blood meal, mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, what do you in the early stages,
can you talk about kind of like some of
[SPEAKER_07]: the things that people think they always
need to add that you either do or don't
[SPEAKER_07]: add and why?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a lot of the base soil,
if you look on the ingredients,
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of have a lot of those, or if you
look on the back of the soil, they've
[SPEAKER_04]: added a lot of those ingredients for you
and they're pretty experienced in how they
[SPEAKER_04]: put it together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a good ratio.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to put too much,
too many meals or different blends because
[SPEAKER_04]: it can really get hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those are good additions to add as you
want to add food sources along the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just different stages for the
plant's life as well, because you don't
[SPEAKER_06]: want to use a high nitrogen possible
source right as you go into flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd rather use, you know, a nice
potassium or phosphorus source of an
[SPEAKER_06]: amendment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how is this blend looking now?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's looking great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see like a lightened up a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you want to look for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it like a shade, a color, or when you
know you've reached the consistency that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it'd be water drainage.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you get to the right water holding
capacity for your desire for how quickly
[SPEAKER_06]: it's going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that something you can feel in your
hands?
[SPEAKER_06]: What we can do is we can take a smaller
container, excuse me, and we can simply
[SPEAKER_06]: fill this up and run a quick drainage test
on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we put the water through it and we
find it just sits on top and it's not
[SPEAKER_06]: penetrating, we're going to want to add
some more of our high porosity,
[SPEAKER_06]: pearlite, cocoa, something like that,
vermiculite, pumice, lava rock,
[SPEAKER_06]: something to luff it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: That means you probably put too much of
our castings or the original soil blend
[SPEAKER_06]: itself was rather dense.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of our key.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we bring some water over here to do
it or do it right here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely right on the grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here would be perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hose over here, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You got the hose where I can actually put
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't I just pull the hose over?
OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so can you guys talk about your
vermicompost setup?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like how many square feet of worms do you
have working?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know these rows, if you put them
together, they're about 15 miles long and
[SPEAKER_04]: eight feet wide.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so and they're outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is down in...
[SPEAKER_07]: Where?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is near central California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, coast a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are there particular types of worms
that provide better castings?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we find that the red wiggler is a
great worm because of its ability to
[SPEAKER_04]: compost and the speed at which it
composts.
[SPEAKER_04]: It also its food source is the biology
that's doing the composting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So where do you find them?
[SPEAKER_04]: Red wigglers, you can you can
[SPEAKER_04]: find them online.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can find them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll send you a couple of pounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure if we took a scoop of your soil
right here, you might have some.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Underneath the grass, right in the root
zone.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, I mean, what do you you said
chitin?
[SPEAKER_07]: So is that something you're you're like?
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you putting into the worm?
[SPEAKER_04]: A high chitin diet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anything like a frass that they can
consume?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so what will happen is you have
frass, a type of frass or a shell or a
[SPEAKER_04]: chitin shell that you'll that you'll
pulverize.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what will happen is that will attract
actual chitin degraders.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the red wigglers will consume
those and then encapsulate it in their
[SPEAKER_04]: casting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that now that chitin degrader
that's part of the recycling part of
[SPEAKER_04]: biology is now encapsulated in that worm
casting.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you put it in the soil and water it,
it basically, based on our recipe,
[SPEAKER_04]: it'll come out of that worm casting and
start to eat some of the chitin elements
[SPEAKER_04]: that are in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of the shell that that's kind of
like why we like more seafood,
[SPEAKER_04]: I should say, from the seafood sources
like the shell and the crab that Eric was
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what that does is that that gives
the ability for food for those chitin
[SPEAKER_04]: degraders and they'll start to multiply.
[SPEAKER_04]: And chitin degraders and cellulose
degraders, they release cellulase and
[SPEAKER_04]: chitinase.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those actually help with the immunity
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they search after pathogens.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's chitin cellulose degraders are a
really important part of the biological
[SPEAKER_04]: food web.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So should we test?
[SPEAKER_06]: We are ready for a drainage test.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll go ahead and let it fall in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see it really just absorb into
the soil right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not getting any pooling on top too
much.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're doing a pretty quick watering.
[SPEAKER_06]: And gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went right down?
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So very nice consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, could it drain too quickly?
[SPEAKER_06]: Potentially, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So once you pick it up, you can actually
see how much water holding capacity it has
[SPEAKER_06]: by squeezing it and wringing it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, nice medium, you know, you wouldn't
want this to clump together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to stay together, say when you bounce
it like that, that would mean that you had
[SPEAKER_06]: too much compost or maybe some soil and it
wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it's breaking up like that is what
you want to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you clump it together,
it was too much compost.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would probably more stick together and
wouldn't just fall apart nicely in your
[SPEAKER_06]: hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it wouldn't quite still be able to
mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like basically it's got to be
breathable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it would become very cakey.
[SPEAKER_06]: You wouldn't be able to separate it back
into the fines.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like how cakey is there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is not even cakey at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we can add more water to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have a good reading on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks nice to me for the bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's looking great.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our ratio was about seven and a half
cubic feet of our high porosity mix,
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 cubic feet of the of the amended
potting soil blend, and then two cubic
[SPEAKER_06]: feet of our castings so far.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you had about 20 percent of the the
organics live castings in there,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is a great, great ratio here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets hot, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're up in the hundreds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So having to retain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want to retain a little bit more
moisture just to keep them happy on those
[SPEAKER_04]: hot, hot days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you don't have to continuously
water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll save a lot of water and the plant
will just kind of stay cool over overall.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also container size.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we were planting directly into this
container and I knew that before I was
[SPEAKER_06]: going to be filling, you know,
my six plants, but using this container,
[SPEAKER_06]: she knows what's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that is so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: She sure does.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would probably make a more porous
mixture if it was good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it was for a small container,
I would make it slightly more porous than
[SPEAKER_06]: if it's for the larger bed, because we
want to sustain a little longer watering.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want it to dry out on the outside
real quickly before the middle does.
[SPEAKER_06]: But where this we would if we would afford
more of that breathability within the soil
[SPEAKER_06]: blend.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's for me, it's always custom per
where I'm going with it is that
[SPEAKER_02]: modification follow the larger you get,
like even if you had a larger bed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd want some more moisture in there,
like even like a double that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you think about the soil,
ground itself, that's very retentive,
[SPEAKER_06]: has very high water retention.
[SPEAKER_06]: You only need to water every few days if
you have a good, you know, where we're
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to water every day in these
containers to have it breathe properly in
[SPEAKER_06]: the four by four.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we're back to that every other day,
watering even further out than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when the beginning at the end,
when the plants are really drinking,
[SPEAKER_06]: we'll end up watering more frequently.
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now it's going to hold nice
moisture.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also the way we water the bed is
very important because we don't want to
[SPEAKER_06]: just continue soaking, especially a
seedling when we transplant it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can go into some of those techniques
later.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's all about because too much
water can also be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys have experience with auto auto
flowering plants?
[SPEAKER_06]: We have experience with people with
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some of those.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do we want to move that now?
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's put it in its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what are we going to have?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the process?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say we can drag it to where it's going
to go and we could probably take the whole
[SPEAKER_06]: tarp by corners and everybody just drag
this thing over to it and then hump it in
[SPEAKER_06]: and move forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could possibly try to pick it up and
set it in there and try to pull tarp.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or like a do like a put it in there and
slowly pour, lift it up so it slowly
[SPEAKER_06]: funnels in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two people grab this side, two people from
the back and it will cascade in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Better than handfuls in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we use the bloom as like a topper
when we transplant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is our granular.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to put a little bit in here
so we don't have to go through opening it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's in it?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically our dry soluble fertilizer
just prilled with a bentonite clay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like a slow release form of our
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just do a little dab down in the root
zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this is actually our granular
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was just putting a little bit in a
bowl.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we give it our treatment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is organic, too, because it looks
like marigold.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is organic.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't use any polymers or binders of
any sort within the material.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's the same derivative.
[SPEAKER_06]: As our dry soluble.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's derived from the microbial
fermentation byproduct, which is basically
[SPEAKER_06]: a bacterial, a bacteria process.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have it prilled.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is a slow release formula.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here we have different granular sizes
as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: The small ones will obviously break up a
little bit faster, while the larger ones
[SPEAKER_06]: will take a little longer to digest.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this gives you a nice, you know,
three to four week slow release of our
[SPEAKER_06]: great of our nitrogen granular formula.
[SPEAKER_06]: The five to two.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's a basically a slow release
nitrogen dominant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as once your plant moves into
flower, we're going to leave behind our
[SPEAKER_06]: granular PK as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all it takes is just a little about a
gram, a couple grams per plant around the
[SPEAKER_06]: base and continue watering.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it will give you a continuous slow
release grand PK.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we also have in the granular form
our K formula, the zero to five.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is good to finish with.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can write at flower, hit it with
the granular.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then for your final two to three weeks
of finish, get the get a little bit of K
[SPEAKER_06]: on there for a boost.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll really help harden, harden up those
those flowers and push the push your bulk
[SPEAKER_06]: and your density and your weight in the
end.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as your amount, are you kind of
eyeballing it for this much soil?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, really about a gram per plant on
transplant is about all you really need.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not too much.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very efficient because our fertilizer
has no salt.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually a carbon chain that the
nutrients are are suspended on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it does not get become leached out
of the soil or have to go through any
[SPEAKER_06]: other chelation process.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's already available for the nutrient
and the carbon helps it to suspend and
[SPEAKER_06]: stay in the soil and not become just part
of the grass fertilizer for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so now we'll bring over the
soil and bring it in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll push this here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something tells me that it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fastest to go like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say what else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Guyver style.
[SPEAKER_01]: No shovel methods at the farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you show up to a grow without a
shovel.
[SPEAKER_06]: The cardboard is recyclable.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could actually put a layer of cardboard
down at the bottom, help any grass
[SPEAKER_06]: pressure from coming in, but that's OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always improvements.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we just slip her out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get the.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect calculation by Eric.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.
Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, do you think you guys have done this
before?
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now is this what is this like the
water is going to go in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Will it sit down a little?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is so this is just what you're
looking for exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the good thing about what grassroots
has done is that you can see the stitch
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're looking out before was.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've added this so you can you can be
more consistent, but but you don't get
[SPEAKER_04]: soggy down here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they really thought that through.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a beautiful bed time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's gonna grow some really healthy
plants for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And give it a little press down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Compaction not too much, not too little.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, give him one more week and Eric and
I would make making 64 of these.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grassroots and do the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing help this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're doing help this year down in
San Diego.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a test plot last year, worked with
some different genetics and found the best
[SPEAKER_04]: that works for our area down in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this year we're doing 10 acres.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, CBG, CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, something we're super proud of.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what what genetics did you set up?
[SPEAKER_07]: What were some of the kind of breeders
whose seeds you were trying out?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, we found just through
some of our trials last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, right this year, you definitely
have a a burst of other seeds that have
[SPEAKER_04]: come out in the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll certainly test those.
[SPEAKER_04]: But given last year, we we chose to go
with HGH high grade hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got some great CBG Matterhorn.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then their cherry wine is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, you know, we've tested at 14.4,
so it's definitely an out of a thousand
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: We found not one male.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the feminized process is they've got to
they've got to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing a great job there,
so.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're looking forward to trying all
sorts of different seeds in the coming in
[SPEAKER_04]: the coming year, because there's a lot of
great companies that have been working
[SPEAKER_04]: hard on putting genetics together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're kind of excited where that's
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I missed that you guys work with
genetics companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we we have a farm, so we've been
doing some seed testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we've been doing, you know,
we spent the last 18, 19 months doing seed
[SPEAKER_04]: testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: When people bring their seeds to you to
test them, see how they're doing in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, is that like a do they go a bit on
the down low?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's our information is is it is
that I would.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, some some, you know,
depending on how new the seed is that
[SPEAKER_04]: they're bringing to us or a special,
you know, one of those areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're not allowed to.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't use them as a breed stock,
so we don't seed our, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: so we're not taking other breeder seeds
and creating that as to provide a service
[SPEAKER_02]: for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're also learning exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You all learn together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Elevate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you improve your product through that
process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because other breeders are always
improving.
[SPEAKER_04]: That allows the growers to improve.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it really is a it really is a
friendship that has to take place between
[SPEAKER_04]: growers and breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess my question is, as genetics
changed in our knowledge and especially in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, will will the soil change with
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, will the environment?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think as of right now, the balance of
biology and the soil food web is always
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be the consistent part of
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the process of either genetics or
growing or breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that actually you can using
using the soil food web and the balance of
[SPEAKER_04]: biology and high diversity, you can
probably enhance and disuade some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: genetic maximums that plants have.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we feel, you know, if you have a well
rounded soil, you can definitely produce a
[SPEAKER_04]: better quality seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growers are always talking about realizing
the fullest expression of their genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, so that's what it's all
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had many compliments that allow our
products really enhance the terpene
[SPEAKER_06]: profile, the flavors, the stickiness,
the resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why that's what you're going for.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the holy grail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the kind that's going to stick
to the window when you throw at it,
[SPEAKER_06]: not the kind that breaks the window when
you throw at it, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, what do we want to plant?
[SPEAKER_07]: So we got a four by four.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to do two, three.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, honestly, if you want to save,
what do we have?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we had an odd number.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to take four there.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Four there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have nine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have four autos.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought we could put the autos
separately.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just in small pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's actually a great idea.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you could put four, you can put
the rest of them in here and there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: good possibility one or two might be male
and you pull those out and remain with
[SPEAKER_04]: like three or four.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to be a broken record, but Kevin
had said with autos that when you
[SPEAKER_02]: transplant them into their final home.
[SPEAKER_07]: So.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not putting autos in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they were, that would be their
final home.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Autos like less stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the key to autos is you really have
to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to find a place for the seed and
have it settle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really going to be the best
case.
[SPEAKER_04]: But people are getting better at autos.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we're encouraged.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we basically want to put four in there
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_06]: Four is a healthy number.
[SPEAKER_06]: One on each quadrant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Assuming that 50% may be male.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let's start with four.
[SPEAKER_06]: That way the one in the middle,
you know, doesn't get choked out if they
[SPEAKER_06]: all take off.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you got your four.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to leave it up to you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys are responsible for those babies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Space them out evenly so that each root
gets equal opportunity within the space
[SPEAKER_06]: provided.
[SPEAKER_06]: So section it out into little quadrants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get our cups going.
[SPEAKER_06]: How does that look?
[SPEAKER_06]: Fairly straight to everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gives them all an opportunity to grow in
and grow out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want this to fall over.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're just going to take a little soil
out in preparation for our hole.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are nice small cups,
so we don't need very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: And being that there's not much root mass
in there as well, we want to be real
[SPEAKER_06]: careful on the transplant.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't just drop everything out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be more of a scoop and hold.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are, yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the Pacific Northwest roots.
Great.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Ras, Kaia, Paul sent a whole lot of
these down.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's harlequin crossed with alien
something.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might have to borrow.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my sense is that the harlequin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might have to come back and take some
cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kaia, you can send me some too if you'd
like.
[SPEAKER_07]: My sense, the harlequin is high CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's going to be high CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I would assume the other one is a
high THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of like a down the middle.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blend those two together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots of flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of my favorite things to do is to add
a little extra love right at the root
[SPEAKER_06]: zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Upon transplant, we have one bag left.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's our bloom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually I'd be using the premium mix,
but the bloom is great as well to use in
[SPEAKER_06]: any manner.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has a little bit of soft rock
phosphate in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So instead of our fossilized kelp and
volcanic rock mineral, or sorry,
[SPEAKER_06]: fossilized kelp, we add the soft rock
phosphate as well as a little more fungal
[SPEAKER_06]: dominant compost.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see how fine this material is as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very, very good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well broken down compost material screened
down to an eighth of an inch.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then so really just literally just a
dusting is all it really is going to take
[SPEAKER_06]: right at that root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: What will it do?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, for me, it's a little
concentration of biology and mineral and
[SPEAKER_06]: love right at the transplant zone,
right where the main action is going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: taking place right away for it might be as
a stimulant to stimulate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Little, yeah, a little buffer between the
roots that are about to grow out in the
[SPEAKER_04]: soil that they're being placed in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I'm going to do as well is add
just literally, like we said, that little
[SPEAKER_06]: gram of, of our slow release.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's literally just a couple,
a couple little granulars that's going to
[SPEAKER_06]: allow the roots.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an emerald who does like the bam.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, you really, once again,
this won't burn the plants because it's
[SPEAKER_06]: not salt based.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't have to worry about that root
coming into contact and it potentially
[SPEAKER_06]: burning because it is carbon based and
it's an all organic coloring as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: It may look like a chemical, though it is
not.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's what I was getting at before
because it looks like miracle grow,
[SPEAKER_07]: but obviously it's.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now we have our nice and then maybe
one little final swirl at the bottom to
[SPEAKER_06]: give it that final little bottom of the
whole love and spread everything up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my, you know, who is I'll try one,
you try one, you try one that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: If someone fails, it's on someone else or
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's sensitive.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's, it's usually what,
what we could do is you could take just
[SPEAKER_04]: some, a scissor and kind of slice down the
cut and kind of open it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can, that's the way we can
observe the root and kind of determine how
[SPEAKER_04]: we want to grab something this size.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's nice to go a little bit for
a bigger on the size.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll help establish more root mass,
kind of, kind of put things together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely, but we'll, you know,
we, we can manage that's what growing is
[SPEAKER_04]: adapting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bless you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I continue?
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically just kind of making sure I'm
squeezing out a little bit, not,
[SPEAKER_04]: not affecting any kind of root that might
occur.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can kind of sell just,
just, just as we, just as we thought,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, so you don't have a giant root
zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're going to do is we know we're
not going to affect too much on the bottom
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would, I would probably just give it
a little bit of a side slice too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, the beauty of what Eric just
did is in putting castings on the ground
[SPEAKER_04]: is that even if this does have a little
bit of shock, you know, the biology,
[SPEAKER_04]: once you water that, that biology goes
free and it starts attaching to the,
[SPEAKER_04]: to the root zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're really going to find that the
plant, even if stressed, would bounce back
[SPEAKER_04]: very quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually to maybe not even the trained
eye, you probably wouldn't even realize
[SPEAKER_04]: the stress that it would.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would just, you know, kind of take
that, just make sure we, our handling,
[SPEAKER_04]: because what happens is that tap root is
going to be at the bottom regardless.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just want to make sure there you
go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to set it in and then kind of
recalibrate, hold her up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know we got a little sprinkle on
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my hand is still in contact with the,
the biology there, making sure that the
[SPEAKER_04]: bottom of this tap root is effectively
going to be hitting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll just do is, we'll release
and, and then this is up to the grower to
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of manage this process just a little
bit is you don't want to bury it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, if, if, if you planted a
little too deep or too, a little too
[SPEAKER_04]: shallow, you still have time to kind of
adjust, maybe lean it over and you don't
[SPEAKER_04]: want to strangle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there an ideal amount of stalk do you
want to see?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you see the color starts to change
towards the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets lighter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some strains will be darker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some strains will be lighter, but that's
kind of the indication of where it was
[SPEAKER_04]: coming out from the seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you want to be around that zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to be too, too far up or
too far low, but you can tell if you look
[SPEAKER_04]: real close, you can kind of see some hair
development there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we'll do is we'll just kind of
observe that a little bit and just look at
[SPEAKER_04]: these are babies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we want to treat them as babies too,
you know, so really easy on everything
[SPEAKER_04]: that's, that's done, kind of move things
away, give it some breathing room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this way when you water, things don't
rush in and bury it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll do is yeah, there you go.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've added some FPF.
[SPEAKER_04]: FPF is a fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fulvic acid is a great stimulant.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one has amino acids as well,
and it's really good foliar.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's a great soil drench,
but fulvic acid, amino acids, simple and
[SPEAKER_04]: complex sugars is a great addition.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a small, literally, it doesn't
take much for this fulvic acid to take
[SPEAKER_06]: effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one milliliter per gallon.
[SPEAKER_06]: This being probably less than a pint.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm literally going to, and we don't want
to stress that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to take the tip of this thing,
get it on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really thick.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has a nice consistent viscosity,
but it's a hundred percent soluble.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will become a full part of the water
right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's really literally a drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't need to shake that,
did you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to add a little bit of water and
then I'm figuring that that circulation is
[SPEAKER_06]: going to.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a little, little bit of a shake,
but it, but, but, but it doesn't separate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just a almost out of habit in a
sense, but yeah, a nice shake is never
[SPEAKER_04]: hurts.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have our nutrient filled water and
we're ready to give it a little.
[SPEAKER_06]: And once again, you don't want to water
right on top of it because you could
[SPEAKER_06]: possibly damage it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're just going to get it right
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a generous amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's brand new in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, and the thing about the seed and
cuts is you don't really need to just take
[SPEAKER_04]: a hose and water this whole thing down.
[SPEAKER_04]: The goal is to, again, let, let the roots
know that, that, uh, it has water.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to activate the biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's a surrounding root.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you want to water enough where
there, the water goes just past the,
[SPEAKER_04]: just past the root.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that when it begins to dry out,
the root is going to, it's going to signal
[SPEAKER_04]: it to stretch and try to look for water.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's really the case here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So honestly, that's how much water you
need.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, like babies, you need to just
kind of come out, especially in a hot
[SPEAKER_04]: weather, you come out and just double
check on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe in 105 degrees, it's a
possibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might have to water twice that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're normally not getting up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk temperature for a minute
because sometimes it gets up triple digits
[SPEAKER_02]: here in the middle of the San Fernando
Valley, but you, but like usually it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like nineties, like high 90.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the difference between 103 and
95 or?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like when are they really sweating?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_06]: They really is genetics on that a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you have genetics that are more
tailored to hot dryer climates and ones
[SPEAKER_06]: that are more tropical.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would go into that part to know your
zone, know your climate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we actually have a product that
helps you with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's our fermented castor bean.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what this actually is, is a foliar
spray.
[SPEAKER_06]: It helps by going onto the cell cells on
the leaf surface and diffusing the UV as
[SPEAKER_06]: it penetrates the cell.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's less intercellular heating on
the leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that allows the cell to continue
growing chlorophyll, stay turgid,
[SPEAKER_06]: not become heat stressed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is actually a more heat stress,
maximize light efficiency.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what time of day are you spraying
that?
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd recommend in the morning,
just like early morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just practice when they get a little
older.
[SPEAKER_06]: You go up until flowered up until you see
pistol development.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once a week, every other week is a good Is
it a mist?
[SPEAKER_06]: You mist?
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice mist.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's time we will set you up with all the
gardening tools you need.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what that does.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then can you talk?
[SPEAKER_07]: But you wouldn't start that now,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd start that in like a month or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for 95 to 100 to 3, it just depends
because it could be a 95 and very humid.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be 95 and dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you add wind, if you take out
wind.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now, you probably would be OK at
this point until tomorrow morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you would come out and you would look
at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stick your finger down in this zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: See how deep your water is.
[SPEAKER_06]: You say, OK, I have plenty of water.
[SPEAKER_06]: My roots haven't migrated beyond here yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps it's looking for water.
[SPEAKER_06]: And wait for this top to dry out a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'll And we want to continue
feeding it with this mixture?
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time you water.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first mixture will be FPF.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second mixture, you can add a little
humic acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the third mixture, as they start
to feed, you can use the dry soluble,
[SPEAKER_04]: high nitrogen sources.
[SPEAKER_04]: But generally, for this type of soil and
this type of blend with the worm castings
[SPEAKER_04]: that we added, you really only need plain
water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's not going to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, until the plants really start to
develop, start eating and needing a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit more, you can start to get into the
regimen.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, because Eric put the granulars
in there and a little dust of worm
[SPEAKER_04]: castings, you're going to get everything
that plant needs for at least the first
[SPEAKER_04]: week or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the only reason you would add a
little FPF to the mixture is if your pH
[SPEAKER_04]: may be high on the water you're using,
it helps to bring that down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just a touch, which generally the
canvas plants like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we get the other three in there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cut and pour technique.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess that might be good.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're pretty, there's not much root
anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: The gentle touch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the great thing about this plant is
that it reacts so quickly and then you can
[SPEAKER_04]: react quick enough and help it.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, there actually is a little taproot
already coming down on the bottom of this
[SPEAKER_04]: baby.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can actually see that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually fast because I only put
those in the dirt seven days ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, literally it was a, it had just
popped.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jimmy, did you just put glue down my back?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's not too hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's only hot because we're
doing a little gardening.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, when I was growing into pang,
it would get in the hundreds and it was
[SPEAKER_07]: only really like in the second third of
growth that they just wanted water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like now you water them every couple of
days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kind of have to watch the plant and
it really is a process.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just got to be cognizant of what
you're doing and take care of the babies
[SPEAKER_02]: until they're cut it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did do the slice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just sort of, I think that little
bit of moisture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't fuck it up, Tom.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was telling myself that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to water the next one?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Gemma, how about right here,
but not on the leaves, but around the
[SPEAKER_07]: leaves?
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one could probably use one more
little drink too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to do it over there too?
[SPEAKER_07]: You're the best helper.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great cut.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a double cut.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how you do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So much for using the solo cups.
[SPEAKER_06]: Solo use solo cups.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always feel like next time I want to let
them go longer so that they have like the
[SPEAKER_07]: mass and you can just pop them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, that taproot is really going
to like being in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, it's a win win.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a win win either way.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to wait for them to put the plants
in.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little roll over and then upside down
and let it fall itself out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no Gemma, not yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to have a little patience.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gemma, I like the honesty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Around the leaves, not on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're looking good.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Gemma, why don't you do it on the
leaves?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right around the little circles.
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then let it wait.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to do one more?
[SPEAKER_07]: Great consistency on that soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to do it again?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter, you're up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your pants match the bag of bloom in your
shirt too.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're the same color as the bag of worm
cat right next to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gemma, how are you with the scissors?
[SPEAKER_07]: Should I trust you yet?
Yeah.
That's cause I use the scissors to color.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: very nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That might've been the best one yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Little buddy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you, can you put Gemma, can you push?
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to push some dirt in here?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll hold this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, another note just to add to this
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, not on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's nice to use a mycorrhizae
right in the hole.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's what I was going to ask.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you didn't have any today,
but there's some great companies that make
[SPEAKER_04]: some really good mycorrhizae and that's
definitely something that you'd want to
[SPEAKER_04]: look into.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just different, different foggies
that attach themselves to the roots and
[SPEAKER_04]: start to start.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even at this stage, it's, it's,
it's, it's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they remember not on the,
it'll help to increase the root mass.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll help bring nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll help fight off disease.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mycorrhizae is a great addition to
transplant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll get that time and then we'll,
I mean, so now you just, what,
[SPEAKER_07]: like sprinkle it around?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even now, even there's soluble forms too.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could put it in the, so it penetrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want, it looks like there's a little
more moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want a little more around?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's put a little more in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so talk about kind of your common LA
tap water.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not really a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, you know, uh, tap water is,
is, you know, it's, it varies very much
[SPEAKER_04]: from where you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's, there's different,
there'll be different, uh, mineral content
[SPEAKER_04]: in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be different ECs in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so you, you, uh, you want to be
cognizant.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're, if you're gardening at this
stage, uh, if you're gardening at this
[SPEAKER_04]: stage, you're, there's, there's,
if, and you have beneficial biology,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a good chance that with the
addition of humic, with addition of
[SPEAKER_04]: fulvic, um, you'll be able to minimize
some of the chlorines and chloramines that
[SPEAKER_04]: are in the water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but generally if you, you know,
if you can get one of those hose end,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, just attachments with the carbon
filter and just remove some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: chlorine, that's going to be really
helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's obviously, you know, RO units
that, you know, there'll be wastewater
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, depends on the
sophistication of, of, uh, of your grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but generally for a garden like this,
you know, just a little hose end.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, even if we just got a five gallon,
uh, pail and just let it sit overnight,
[SPEAKER_07]: that would help too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that would help too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have, they have, they have big
filters for the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, those are really, you know,
you can buy those for anywhere from 1299
[SPEAKER_04]: and 1999.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's, yeah, those will have it
online.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll ship online.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your local hydro store should have a good
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Depending on the density of the carbon
that they pack is how many gallons you can
[SPEAKER_06]: filter value.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some do like 10,000, some do 30,000
gallons to help strip, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: a little bit of that, just because we want
to be sensitive of our biology and those
[SPEAKER_06]: chlorines and chloramines are designed in
the water to kill any bacteria.
[SPEAKER_06]: So of course, when it, you know,
goes into the, under our soil,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's potential for it to do harm.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have a practice of continuing to
add microorganisms through our,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, bio packs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And our bio extractor, let's get her up
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy was made for television.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bio extractor Sunday morning
infomercial will allow us to brew up our
[SPEAKER_06]: consistent microorganisms, our microbial
rich solution.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can continue to apply.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beneficial biology throughout the growing
season comes ready to go out of the box,
[SPEAKER_06]: grab our bio pack.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is where you would want to use the
non chlorinated water.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of why I brought this up while
we were talking about the water issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're brewing biology use,
use RO water, use well water, use
[SPEAKER_06]: something that's not going to have any
chlorine or chloramine in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause that will inhibit your
multiplication that we're trying to gather
[SPEAKER_06]: in here in your biology.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once it's in the bed, you have a lot of
food sources and other organic matter and
[SPEAKER_06]: carbon that'll help strip some of that
chlorine and affect the way when you water
[SPEAKER_06]: consistently.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're watering with a hose,
city water, it's not a big deal as long as
[SPEAKER_06]: you're brewing up your biology very well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So inside of this pack has all the
ingredients, slide it, um, put it inside
[SPEAKER_06]: of the bio extractor, brew it up for 24
hours after you pre activate it and you
[SPEAKER_06]: get your plethora of 30,000 different
microorganisms, your balance of biology
[SPEAKER_06]: and continue to feed your plants with it
throughout the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you mean by after you pre activate
it?
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's the pre activation process?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will.
[SPEAKER_06]: We take this, we put a simple cereal bowl
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this one takes about a quarter cup of
water and pour it over.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what it's going to do is absorb into
the, into the mix kit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that moisture allows some of that
slower developing biology to start
[SPEAKER_06]: breaking down the carbs, um, the complex
carbs and it grows more of the fungal and
[SPEAKER_06]: our slow eaters.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have a packet of basically
black strap molasses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this goes in as, as our sugars,
which help feed the bacteria very quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are 16 different ingredients that
go into our mix in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are also certified organic
California department of food and ag CCOF.
[SPEAKER_06]: We put no biosolids or animal manures or
anything like that in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: No chemical fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a pure organic pack.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, then you allow that solution to
brew for 24 hours, your multiplication of
[SPEAKER_06]: biology.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is what it's bigger than a five
gallon.
[SPEAKER_06]: We call this the four gallons.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a four gallon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: You fill it up to the four gallon line.
[SPEAKER_07]: So once, so it is a five gallon kind of
bucket size.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we actually have this the way up.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take the top off.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this one packet, basically once you
mix it up, would you, would you feed this
[SPEAKER_07]: whole bed, uh, over how long a period of
time?
[SPEAKER_07]: So you brew it for 24 hours and you have
your tea and you have your tea.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to use that tea.
[SPEAKER_06]: The sooner you get it from the extractor
into your medium, the better, because,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, you've packed so much biology in here
and there's an air pump inside of this
[SPEAKER_06]: lid.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is an air diffuser.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when it's on, what you're doing is
you're oxygenating the water, creating an
[SPEAKER_06]: aerobic living environment with the
beneficial microbes and all the food
[SPEAKER_06]: sources.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they have oxygen to breathe,
water to live in and food to eat.
[SPEAKER_06]: They multiply through that process.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that material gets in there and
you can either dilute it down one to 10,
[SPEAKER_06]: one to 20, or this stuff is so pure.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you used it fresh, you really,
if you don't dilute it, you won't kill
[SPEAKER_06]: your plan either.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, but it has to be fresh if you're
doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, so how long can the tea last
before you just kind of need to dump it
[SPEAKER_07]: and rinse it out?
[SPEAKER_06]: And you guys, you know, temperature,
there's a lot of variations in tea brewing
[SPEAKER_06]: that in a lot of really, you know,
I'm sure they'll go over those segments in
[SPEAKER_06]: here, but a general, um, practice is I
would say four hours, six hours,
[SPEAKER_06]: eight hours would be maximum.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're don't want it to be in the sun,
keep it in the coolest spot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So once you brewed it for 24 hours,
you basically want to, I mean,
[SPEAKER_07]: we would, and we could, we could use all
four gallons in one application in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would, I mean, you could potentially,
but then you wouldn't be maximizing it's,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, how, what all it could do.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'd recommend a gallon of solution,
uh, diluted into a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead and water this with one gallon
solution and hit all your other plants
[SPEAKER_06]: around the house.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically the grass spray with it as
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a fantastic to give everything a
foliar spray with, um, helps protect the
[SPEAKER_06]: leaf surfaces feed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that you do what?
[SPEAKER_06]: At like seven AM?
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, is there a point in the growth stage
when you want to use your tea or is it
[SPEAKER_02]: using it right away?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, the sooner we can apply the biology,
the better it is for the plants.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we could do it today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: By tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll, we'll go.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have a cereal bowl and some
non-chlorinated water, we can pre-activate
[SPEAKER_06]: and begin kicking us.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you will be treating on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause today is Tuesday.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pre-activating Tuesday, brew Wednesday,
treat Thursday.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this is enough for one,
uh, round.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you guys sell, do you guys sell
like six packs and 12 packs of those?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Each box comes with two.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Comes with, sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: How many two?
[SPEAKER_07]: Two in each box.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jimmy, you want to hold this camera for a
second?
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to aim it at that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of talking.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't need much because it's going to
absorb in like a little cake and what you
[SPEAKER_06]: also, so it'll start off like,
so it'll absorb in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I like to do is after a few
hours, flip it over because gravity has
[SPEAKER_06]: pulled everything to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_06]: That way you flip it over and let it pull
back through the middle again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then let it rest because if you
are manipulating it during this time,
[SPEAKER_06]: you don't allow certain attachments of the
biology.
[SPEAKER_06]: It helps, you know, these are just little
fine practices that you learn over time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's actually going to happen is this
loose material will, will begin to
[SPEAKER_06]: solidify, kind of become one, a more dense
cake.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that cakiness is microbial.
[SPEAKER_06]: Glue is beginning to hold together and the
organic matter bonding.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we want to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the next, like I was saying,
step would be so tomorrow about this time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and if you don't get to it tomorrow
and you don't brew until Thursday or,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, two days, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because as long as you keep this moist,
your biology starting to activate and go.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will use our, our molasses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I like to do is make a little
dent on top, pour the molasses on when
[SPEAKER_06]: it's inside of the, inside of the,
the chimney.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is right before you're ready for
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this would be right before you brew.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to throw it in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to put a little dividend like
that, squeeze the molasses on top of it,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then drop it into the, drop it into
the extractor.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that really just helps us once again,
put that sugar right on top of the,
[SPEAKER_07]: can you just quickly show me where that
goes in?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if we could plug it in,
you guys, we could show the aeration
[SPEAKER_06]: process.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wrong hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it lays on top.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Comes right down and the water level will
come to about midway into the basket.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause there's another thing is you don't
want that biopac to be overly submerged.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want the biopac to end up down
here in the bottom corner because then
[SPEAKER_06]: it's not getting the oxygen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you rotate that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, so I can see the, the markers on the
back.
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you basically want to fill it up to 15
liters.
[SPEAKER_06]: 16 quarts.
[SPEAKER_07]: 16 quarts.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: It runs midway through the chimney and the
chimney is designed to hold the biopac
[SPEAKER_06]: just above the diffuser.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the oxygen comes up and continues to
cavitate and agitate and knock that
[SPEAKER_06]: biology out of the biopac.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we put it in that little pillow
because it helps keep all of your organic
[SPEAKER_06]: matter and sediment in.
[SPEAKER_06]: It allows the biology to escape and it
makes it so that this is a clean solution
[SPEAKER_06]: to use in sprayers and emitters and you
won't be clogging your lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so that was one of, one of our.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How frequently do you want to,
do you want to make tea?
[SPEAKER_06]: I like once a week and in our feeding
schedule, we, we recommend once a week.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and, and do you have different,
like maybe more fungal dominant teas for
[SPEAKER_07]: early in the, in the plant's life cycle
and bacterial dominant teas later in the
[SPEAKER_07]: life cycle?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we go for a balance of biology.
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore the plant is able to help
indicate and process, um, which it,
[SPEAKER_06]: which environment it would prefer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, your tea recipe doesn't
change.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doesn't change from beginning to end.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the, the, what changes is the
plant's indication to the biology to keep
[SPEAKER_06]: the set that it would prefer during that
stage of its growth.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what are some of the all-star bacteria
and fungal organisms, uh, that are
[SPEAKER_07]: currently sleeping right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: 30,000.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, there's so many, they all really,
I wouldn't say they're all important.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the key.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you know, you can buy a bag of
bacterial inoculant and read, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: 16, 24 bacteria strains that are in it,
but really our, it's underneath our feet.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't even count right now,
you know, so that the importance is more
[SPEAKER_06]: having the diversity and everybody fulfill
its role in the, in the, in the,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, in the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this, this is your guys product too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you developed this, was this a trial
and error process?
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went, we went back and forth with,
uh, with labs to develop what ingredients,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, and what elements at what measurements
go in with the castings in comparison to
[SPEAKER_04]: the volume of water and the diffusion of
air.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so all these variables with many
calculations we found, found the magic
[SPEAKER_04]: cake recipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what develops a balance of
biology, high diversity and high chitin
[SPEAKER_04]: and cellulose recyclers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we basically absorbed it all,
flip it over and it's ready to go for the
[SPEAKER_06]: night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should it, is it ideal to keep it out or
put it in the shade, cover it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, not necessarily, you know,
like once again, the dry sun, you want it
[SPEAKER_06]: in your growing environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: You wouldn't want to put it in the
refrigerator or the freezer.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it looks like for now we're,
uh, so should we be giving this kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: like a all around water in?
[SPEAKER_06]: I would recommend a nice little cake it
down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: With the, if you have a good, um,
wand that gives it a nice rain water
[SPEAKER_06]: effect, like it got rained on more than a
jet effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: More, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: More than a, uh, fire hydrant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we'll do one more time is one
more little ounce of love, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Not even on the plant, but once again,
right where those roots are going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: migrating.
[SPEAKER_06]: And looking for that food.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause as we water, it's going to push that
right down into this little top zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: That top inch layer of root zone is some
of the most active and feeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: We would want it to wait till it cools.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your home grow your, you will soon have a
green thumb.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have the training wheels on the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have professionals coming in every
week to make sure that you don't F it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not on the leaves, not on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just go, go in between.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my favorite part of the afternoon
is after it's set the first watering,
[SPEAKER_06]: getting it all ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Tom, you can, you can soak in some
of that compost that's in there too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get that activated a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good technique.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Tom, are you excited to not have to buy
mediocre weed at the dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the most exciting thing to look
forward to.
[SPEAKER_06]: You never know where your dollar is going
that you're spending in essence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that that's, that's really true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I remarked upon that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In one of our recent things is,
you know, as a patient and a consumer,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 30%, where's it all going?
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically for like, so we'll whip up a
tea that we're going to put on in about
[SPEAKER_07]: two days.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in terms of you said,
which one should we be putting like a drop
[SPEAKER_07]: or two into the watering can?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the tea by itself is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just add the tea solo on your
first, first couple of waterings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to get the, the food sources unlocked,
ready for biology to eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once you start to really,
once the plants start to really develop
[SPEAKER_04]: these first set and start to get real
hungry, then you're going to start the
[SPEAKER_04]: nitrogen process with a couple other
additives.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll do a VN dry soluble,
high nitrogen 10 to two.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you'll use a fulvic acid and a
humic acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those three with the tea will be
really, really helpful to kind of keep the
[SPEAKER_04]: plants healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get them what they need.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you, how you're going to have
protein development, carbohydrates,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then also a high nitrogen to really
keep that plant healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the premium mix in there already.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know, you're going to have really
good biology all throughout and then
[SPEAKER_04]: you're adding the, the microbial solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you guys have this written down
anywhere?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then basically, Tom, not on the
leaves, not on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then basically stick to that regimen
until flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, really it's so simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just kind of stick into that regimen,
you know, when you start to move into,
[SPEAKER_04]: when you, when the sun switches,
you start to move into transition into
[SPEAKER_04]: flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then what you're going to do is you're
going to use a 455 in all purpose.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can add a little bit of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can add a little bit of that as you
move in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a 455 where it starts to bring
in a little phosphorus, a little
[SPEAKER_04]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when the, the flowers completely
stop stretching, they start to bulk up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you want to move into a zero 10 eight
where you're completely eliminating the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's going to be plants that in
genetics that definitely still like to
[SPEAKER_04]: have a little bit of nitrogen as they go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can take maybe a half a teaspoon of
this, add it to a teaspoon of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you're going to get, you're going
to get a little bit of both going into
[SPEAKER_04]: flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then once you're familiar with your
genetics, you know, whether they're,
[SPEAKER_07]: they're the type that like that or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could really play with these boxes
based on your genetics and then,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then create your own recipe in a
sense, create your own recipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the VK is a great flower finisher.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's going to kind of, you know,
you want to, you want to fatten those
[SPEAKER_04]: flowers out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to push out some, some yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll move into a VK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some genetics don't like Phos phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, sometimes, you know,
a high Phos might Fox tail the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people don't like the Fox tail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some do just, it's just kind of one of
those taste things, but you'll this high
[SPEAKER_04]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you pull back and, and add just that
high potassium.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's going to help a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these, these will get pretty big,
but honestly, the time of year plus the
[SPEAKER_04]: size of the seed, they're going to be
real, they're going to be nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you can do, Tom, is you can kind
of, and maybe you'll have somebody on
[SPEAKER_04]: there that can, that can explain it really
well, but you can start to prune and start
[SPEAKER_04]: to really train your plants to stay,
you know, you want to have, you want to
[SPEAKER_04]: have some, some, you know, there's some
humidity in the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you definitely want to have a nice
training, kind of bring them out this way,
[SPEAKER_04]: leave a little oxygen through the middle
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this way you don't create any pockets
of stagnant air.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this is just, you know,
this is what's fun about growing is kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of just looking at this and going,
man, this, this looks real chunky.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me take a couple of leaves out at the
bottom and really start to have air flow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And through the bottom, you know,
having a swoop of air come in the bottom
[SPEAKER_04]: through the top, that breathing again,
it's all about that balance and that
[SPEAKER_04]: breathing between the soil and the plants,
both, both atmospheres really.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a, and that's, and that's the
experience, you know, every round of
[SPEAKER_04]: growing, you learn something, you know,
and it's, it's fun when for our business,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's so great that we actually work with
the majority of canvas growers because
[SPEAKER_04]: they have four, four times a year or more
to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: Faster where in conventional agriculture,
agriculture, you have one, one mistake a
[SPEAKER_04]: year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it doesn't grow scale scale,
you know, so, you know, mistakes are
[SPEAKER_04]: really how you can become a better grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: So having four mistakes a year,
you're really, you know, you really start
[SPEAKER_04]: to experience what the plant loves and you
just become better at better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because of that, are you constantly
improving upon these products as well?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, honestly, yeah, that's,
that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we, we, in the beginning,
we're using animal by-product as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we decided, you know, we wanted to
take it a step further and go towards
[SPEAKER_04]: sustainability.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, our fertilizers have zero waste,
both as a fertilizer itself and the
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturing, a lot of animal
by-products, a lot of minerals,
[SPEAKER_04]: these are being pulled from the earth and
are unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you're going to, you're going to
large mines to pull minerals.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're looking for fulvic, you're going
to the Himalayas to pull from the
[SPEAKER_04]: Himalayan mountains.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're, if you're looking for,
you know, animal by-product, you really,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can't do that on a small scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're really going to conventional
farming to pull their waste product,
[SPEAKER_04]: to develop a product that then you can put
into a garden like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we took it a step further in an entire,
not only in our products, but just the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the philosophy of our company,
the culture of our company.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why you see we have
post-consumer boxes for the fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_04]: not plastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So are these vegan?
[SPEAKER_04]: Essentially you could call them vegan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No animal by-product, no mining,
no heavy mining.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no, there's no heavy metals in
these.
[SPEAKER_04]: So not only is it, available to the plant
via carbon, via facilitated, facilitated
[SPEAKER_04]: passive diffusion, but also, you know,
you don't have that breakdown,
[SPEAKER_04]: the salt.
[SPEAKER_04]: So your soil is always going to be rich in
carbon when you use these products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I think the next stage in
organic gardening will be, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: things, these are coming from
fermentations and more biological sources
[SPEAKER_04]: rather than animal sources or heavy mining
sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys are certainly going in that
direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's the direction we're headed.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been working on these for the past
five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a heavy research and development
phase.
[SPEAKER_04]: We slowly brought it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also people want that now too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And are you just applying this stuff at
scale on the 10 acre hemp farm?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all at scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, the, the, you can really,
the scale of this is actually easier than
[SPEAKER_04]: the smaller version.
[SPEAKER_04]: So big farms can use this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the great thing about this,
because it is extracted from microbials
[SPEAKER_04]: and, and, and, and attached to carbon,
it becomes, it's, it's a liquid and then
[SPEAKER_04]: we dehydrate that liquid and becomes
soluble.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it becomes solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't, it doesn't have, it doesn't
rely on ionic reactions to break down.
[SPEAKER_04]: It becomes solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can put it through all irrigation,
through fertigation, tip, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: any kind of a drip tape.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for scale, when you go to a
conventional farmer, which is the goal
[SPEAKER_04]: ultimately is to, is to help them reduce
the synthetic use or chemical use or high
[SPEAKER_04]: salt products is say, Hey, looky,
you don't really have to do anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just add this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's organic and you have to go
through everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it more expensive to produce this more
like costly product?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, at first, three years ago it
was, but now that people have really taken
[SPEAKER_04]: to it and like it, it gives us the ability
to produce more in volume.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then that helps us kind of reduce the
costs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then because we're reducing the cost,
we can get it to scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which allows us to reduce costs even
further.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a virtuous circle.
[SPEAKER_04]: A virtuous cycle.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So costs are coming down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Costs are coming down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, and people are adopting it and
we've had great, great feedback from the,
[SPEAKER_04]: from the grower community.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, absolutely beautiful feedback from
everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you also, did you have customers
international?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we Vietnam, Thailand,
UK, and all the way down to Columbia,
[SPEAKER_04]: to Jamaica, to Trinidad, Tobago,
yeah, all over, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard they're bringing some righteous
acreage on in Columbia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're, we're, it took a little
while, but people are adopting the
[SPEAKER_04]: products down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Governments are letting them come through
once they learn what they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the, the process of sending things
down there has become much easier.
Definitely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of taxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe essentially double the price before
it hits the land.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think episode number one of Tom's
green thumb is in the books.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in the books.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have our team from Organic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're eventually going to fill them
up and we've got to put more plants in
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: We thought we were going to have that off
camera.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have some of the, we do have some
of the Fox farm that we could put in some
[SPEAKER_07]: of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so with that stuff, like we just took
a bag of Fox farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd put which, which ones you,
you added the worm castings sort of the
[SPEAKER_07]: base mix.
[SPEAKER_07]: What, what should we just put like a
spoonful of into?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you wanted to have a similar
consistency, these are a little smaller.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you actually probably want to have a
little bit more water retention given the
[SPEAKER_04]: size of the pots, but basically just add,
take a, and since you're using these types
[SPEAKER_04]: of pots, I'd probably go 10% worm castings
of our worm castings in, in like a Fox
[SPEAKER_04]: farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a roots or something at the store.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good quality soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you would do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Add a little granular to the root zone,
take a little worm casting dust in the
[SPEAKER_04]: dust and that in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'd get some mycorrhizae out of
that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause this time we didn't have it,
but you can still add it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not too late.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do people go to check out more about
you guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it organicsalive.com?
[SPEAKER_04]: Organics Alive garden.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also our Instagram, which is at
organics alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, we've, you know, we've we're
having a good time farming and yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: you got to send us some pictures from the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're, we're documenting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to smoke some of your hemp
flowers for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're excited.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's already growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, it's already praying.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, look at that thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just, you know, they're just like,
Oh, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, but you don't recon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean already.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they were.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is, that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great site to see that when they
start to reach for the sun, that means the
[SPEAKER_04]: soils re you know, the roots are reaching
for soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's, it's, it's going to be good.
[SPEAKER_04]: A good garden, Tom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is exciting.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I think Tom, we need to,
I mean, we don't necessarily need to do it
[SPEAKER_07]: today, but we should get basically some
soil and.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what we'll do is we'll leave all
the pounds behind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause for this garden, you really,
it's going to be such a minimal amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this will stay for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll leave the pints as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you could just.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we'll do is there's a,
there's a feed chart.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this we should just throw in his
garage, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll throw that in the garage with.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Tom, should we put a little more water?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that totally fine?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it just needs to be moist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really just kind of that quarter cup,
just to kind of get things moist and
[SPEAKER_04]: activated.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it stays nice and cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, out here is actually not that
bad.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just in that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice under here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those four plants, really, this is
going to be all you need for the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: three months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This, this, this little package here will
get you through no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to leave you that
bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then maybe if we come back for
another, you know, part three or four,
[SPEAKER_04]: what you want to do, Tom, is you want to
come back when, when they start to flower
[SPEAKER_04]: and give them a nice top dress with this
and another round of castings and compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and this will really help,
you know, reinvigorate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's soil.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will be here a week or two.
[SPEAKER_04]: And honestly, if traffic keeps up like
this, we can be up here at no problem to
[SPEAKER_04]: help out honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where are most of your guys orders?
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of bigger farms actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're, we're, we do some retail
too, up in Humboldt, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: here and there scattered, but honestly we
go direct to farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in some shops here and there all
pretty much all over the country,
[SPEAKER_04]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was wondering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there's no limitation to where you
can sell your products and how,
[SPEAKER_02]: so you could go into grower growing stores
anywhere, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Going stores, our e-commerce is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is, is that like in health and you've
been in business how long?
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, you know, we started this
business in 2002.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eric and I started doing stuff a long
time, you know, but 2013 is really when we
[SPEAKER_04]: started to ramp up and, you know,
really started to turn it into a.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is your just like generally like how
many employees do you guys have right now
[SPEAKER_04]: at this moment?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're working on the farm with 13
employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good number.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is your focus taking care of your
customers or also growing your business
[SPEAKER_02]: and brand?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to growing the business,
growing the business by brand by taking
[SPEAKER_04]: care of our customers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we actually are, our reputation
means a lot to us.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we, you know, we, isn't that,
is that how business is growing now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's honestly, so growers talk grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a small community.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, our name really means a lot to
us.
[SPEAKER_04]: How we treat our customers is,
is paramount to what we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our customer service, we answer calls,
we hit the DMs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it was Nick Tomasini who gave you
guys the shout out because I was like,
[SPEAKER_07]: give me, for me, I was kind of like,
I know you and Scott and whoever probably
[SPEAKER_07]: like don't use a lot of commercial
products, but not everybody's you guys and
[SPEAKER_07]: knows what the fuck they're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you were a Tom Himes wanting to do
stuff in his backyard, like what do you
[SPEAKER_07]: approve of?
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and so he mentioned you guys,
because I think I had originally said to
[SPEAKER_07]: him, I was like, you know, what do you
think of a down to earth, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Down to earth soil amendments.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's, that's more like the
meals and the animal, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: so that's not really what you guys do.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you working in like Santa Barbara,
those farms?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Santa Barbara, Salinas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you do everything like you do like DAP
and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: From oranges to apples to cannabis to hemp
to small to large.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we even went through a period
which people have adopted the business,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we used to help the pine trees repel a
pine bark beetle by injecting that tea
[SPEAKER_04]: into the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's so much you can do with
biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I forgot to ask was kind of
like, sometimes people, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: people talk about like building your soil
and then letting it sit for six months
[SPEAKER_07]: because it's way too hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is not way too hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've done that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've actually let it sit at the soil
yard.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because your stuff is not the main
component.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the like 2% additional stuff or five,
10%.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what was the ratio of worm castings in
here?
[SPEAKER_04]: 10%.
[SPEAKER_07]: 20%.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we did 20%.
[SPEAKER_04]: 20%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's nice and thick.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This will be, it'll be a nice,
nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me look before you get close to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That one.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a wasp.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't get near that guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not going to come after you as long
as you don't go after him.
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically what we can do is we can put
like, I have a two, like one that's only
[SPEAKER_07]: two feet wide by four.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you could put like, to me,
like what I want to build here is what a
[SPEAKER_07]: home would be, which is the tomatoes,
the basil, the, you know, the squash,
[SPEAKER_07]: the, and then just like a couple of
cannabis plants around.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like the wife's happy,
the husband's happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, there's only one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we got, we got
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's our next episode is actually
companion planting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have the biology and then we get
some other components that are working in
[SPEAKER_06]: unison with that right set of biology on
the, you know, it all, it all combines to
[SPEAKER_06]: each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just get one marigold or like a,
in each corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, but just, you know, you get those
little single ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're not going to take over these
guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want them to, to be able to have
room to grow up, but then your marigold
[SPEAKER_06]: can fill in because you'll be right in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, wait a little bit on marigolds.
[SPEAKER_02]: These things will grow very fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all ready.
