[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys have any questions?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so it sounds to me like there's been
a lot of this kind of like talk down,
[SPEAKER_06]: this is an assessment of how things are,
this is what needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I kind of take things with a different
approach, which is like how can we design
[SPEAKER_06]: a project, we usually call them
businesses, that do something that creates
[SPEAKER_06]: some value that people find compelling.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they, you know, having a new,
having a new something, service of product
[SPEAKER_06]: usually, that changes people's behavior is
something that, I mean it's one of the few
[SPEAKER_06]: things that I can say capitalism has going
for it, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is a model that we see happening
all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We, you know, we stop using our Discman
and we start using our iPod, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean it's something that we do all the
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So then the question is like, how do you
design, how do you design this project in
[SPEAKER_06]: a way so that it's compelling?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we've talked a lot about
technology here, but what I've not heard
[SPEAKER_06]: is like basically the market, people,
people, you know, need stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of them want to do things in a
better way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people want to do things in a more
inexpensive way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people want to do both.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anytime that someone has asked,
shall we do like, shall we have a law
[SPEAKER_06]: passed or should we change some
regulations?
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of heard some reticence about that,
which I think is wise because at least in
[SPEAKER_06]: the culture of this country, people a lot
of times don't like being told what to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, on the other hand, in California,
we kind of, we, I think, I think what's
[SPEAKER_06]: going on is that we hold, we do hold the
environment in such a high regard,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, regardless of kind of like
political persuasion that we realize that
[SPEAKER_06]: like tourism is important.
[SPEAKER_06]: We like to breathe clean air.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of us have seen the environment you
know, worse here at times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we've seen the environment worse in
other places.
[SPEAKER_06]: We see what's going on news.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're really excited that we have this
place where we care about the environment
[SPEAKER_06]: and we're kind of willing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the same everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're willing to say, okay, yeah,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be willing to pay five cents
for a plastic bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to revolt this time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But other places, you know, people don't
like being told what to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we either align enough people to do
what we need to do which is when I say
[SPEAKER_06]: what we need to do is accelerate the
de-industrialization of our economy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool to think about cool little
technologies, but I'm here to tell you
[SPEAKER_06]: that most of the technologies that are
going to save us are probably pretty old.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've understood them for a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, and yeah, every once in a while
we get a new, we get a new cool trick.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we get a combustion engine.
[SPEAKER_06]: We get nuclear power.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, sometimes we figure out good
things to do with these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes we kind of bungle around for
a little while.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fossil fuels, you know, there's time and
place for certain aspects of fossil fuels.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's lots of other alternatives.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's questions of technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's questions of product.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, how do we, how do we put
together a value offering?
[SPEAKER_06]: But typically you take in lower value
feedstocks and you try to find the highest
[SPEAKER_06]: value purpose for those feedstocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of business plans that people talk
about in this space in the kind of space
[SPEAKER_06]: of sustainability.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you just kind of like do that dot to
dot, it's like people are trying to take
[SPEAKER_06]: something high value and make something
low value out of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's backwards.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not how you make a business.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not how you make money.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so then there come some situations
where it's kind of really hard to find how
[SPEAKER_06]: to make a business.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where, you know, regulation may
come in where we say, maybe we need a
[SPEAKER_06]: carbon tax.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we need different ways of,
of managing fuel credits and, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: things like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: The people in this room really need to get
tight with their language because it
[SPEAKER_06]: really is important to be able to explain
to people what organic is to agriculture
[SPEAKER_06]: versus what organic is to a chemist.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or to waste.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what bio-based can mean.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, talking about hydrogen and
some of the energy stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, you know, I really appreciate
the people coming from a lot of different
[SPEAKER_06]: perspectives, but they're, there are some
key words that all of us kind of need to
[SPEAKER_06]: get on the same page with, you know,
so that we can, we can be good advocates.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a hand raise in the back there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just to add on to the businesses.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do have some sort of business
project or startup, there's an incubator
[SPEAKER_07]: in downtown LA called grid110.org.
[SPEAKER_07]: A great friend of mine called Mickey,
she runs it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sort of a partnership of Mayor
Arsetti.
[SPEAKER_07]: So their deadline is on February 1st.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a no-cost equity program.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have tons of mentors and they usually
do events every two, three weeks or so
[SPEAKER_07]: with other VCs and accelerators and other
incubators.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Grid, grid what?
[SPEAKER_07]: grid110.org.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to give respect to the
information and what you have brought out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the language is so difficult too,
because I work in education and outreach
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to my job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have to find the language that
people understand when it just comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even just on the organic thing,
I pushed my company and I keep pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like always putting S on the end of
organics, because I'm not going to say
[SPEAKER_01]: this is organic waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because in our industry,
we refer to it as organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not that language in our
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, it's not an industry term that I
can change, but I can, I can at least try
[SPEAKER_01]: to manipulate it in a way that is not
going to hopefully have another layer of
[SPEAKER_01]: confusion added to it for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're completely right when it comes
to language and us share, and my best
[SPEAKER_01]: friend, his husband is a pharmacist and
she's a nurse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we always get in these
conversations, especially about organic
[SPEAKER_01]: and other terminology, because we come
from different worlds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that I think is a solid point,
a solid issue that you brought up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also talked about demand, a product
demand or the demand of the individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you made a comment, if I can,
if I remember it correctly, it's like some
[SPEAKER_01]: people want to do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some people want to do the bad
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people, not the bad thing,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, that was my brain going,
but, but some people want to do maybe for
[SPEAKER_01]: the environment, other people,
that's just not where they're thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what they're trying to put food
on their table.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to get through their daily
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to do their two jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to maybe just come home and
relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: That the concept of making sure that I buy
the one product that's made out of this
[SPEAKER_01]: with this, and it's going to go here is
not the thing they're thinking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we create product,
if I'm getting this right, and how I took
[SPEAKER_01]: it, is that when we're looking at creating
a product in order to meet the demand of
[SPEAKER_01]: what is out there in the communities,
people want better options for water
[SPEAKER_01]: bottles or getting their water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a level, two things I
wanted to say, I think there's a level of
[SPEAKER_01]: demand that we have control over as
businesses, as entrepreneurs, that I see
[SPEAKER_01]: happening too, where it's like,
here's this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you should use this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should be using products that
do X, Y, and Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think sometimes we can change that
demand because that demand is put on us
[SPEAKER_01]: anyways by the corporations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That demand is put on us by commercials
and what we see out in the, and I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about our chips and our pizzas and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think we see this product and we say,
I want that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think we have control in changing
that narrative as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then also, for me personally,
and we're talking about, and I didn't say
[SPEAKER_01]: it earlier, but we're talking about,
oh, there's these little things that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can use for water.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first thing came to my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, that's a cool idea,
but why is it that, why is the demand not
[SPEAKER_01]: on water scarcity and why is the demand
not on why we have water issues to begin
[SPEAKER_01]: with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it that we still have issues in
Flint, Michigan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it that we still have, we had water
issues in Willowbrook and Compton where
[SPEAKER_01]: they couldn't even drink their water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do they have to buy these little pods
in the first place in order to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: meet the demand that they need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it that we have to have a demand
for water bottles period because it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: sold to us that our water is not
drinkable?
[SPEAKER_01]: If our water's not drinkable, why is it
not drinkable?
[SPEAKER_01]: If our water's not accessible,
why don't we have drinkable, accessible
[SPEAKER_01]: water fountains throughout?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're asking a lot of questions,
and I think the solutions, I mean,
[SPEAKER_06]: the answers to all of the rhetorical
questions that you're presenting,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think have concrete answers that we
could put up on a whiteboard right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's pointing to our whiteboard.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like people, so I'm kind of
saying, at least for a moment,
[SPEAKER_06]: can we take an empirical approach and say,
okay, people do like convenient single use
[SPEAKER_06]: or maybe low repeat reuse containers that
are low cost.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe what we might consider having a
conversation about is like change
[SPEAKER_06]: management and thinking about the
psychology of change because I think that
[SPEAKER_06]: it's like, I sounded like someone was
aligning biodiesel, but back when we were
[SPEAKER_06]: focused on biodiesel, we were really
excited that there was this possibility
[SPEAKER_06]: that we could take some of the output of
farmers and offset some of our petroleum
[SPEAKER_06]: fuel use.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then what it turned out, the way that
it all resolved, because you might wonder,
[SPEAKER_06]: where did all of the biodiesel activists
go?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they went away because the state of
California and a few other states said,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know what, instead of like,
you want us to use 100% biodiesel,
[SPEAKER_06]: you want us to use 20%, you know what,
we're just gonna make everybody quit like
[SPEAKER_06]: 85% and all of the diesel supply.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we got our three to 5% biodiesel in
California, and you might say,
[SPEAKER_06]: well, that's not 20%, that sounds like it
really sucks, but for the amount of
[SPEAKER_06]: biodiesel and the amount of emissions
decreases that you get proportionately for
[SPEAKER_06]: each percentage of that biodiesel when you
only put three to 5% biodiesel in the
[SPEAKER_06]: petroleum fuel supply, you get this really
awesome reduction in particular manner.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's kind of a success.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we can say it's not perfect,
but it's like on the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so long story short, and I'd like
to hear what you have to say about
[SPEAKER_06]: biodiesel, but the only reason why I pick
it up is that we moved on into,
[SPEAKER_06]: we realized, okay, well actually,
chemicals might be more of an opportunity,
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's a lot of what we're talking
about today is biochemicals, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: how to take different feedstocks,
convert them into something valuable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm kind of thinking, well,
you know, technology, but technology is
[SPEAKER_06]: probably not gonna change all that much,
but people's minds are what we really need
[SPEAKER_06]: to be thinking about changing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm not a marketer, I'm actually an
introvert, I don't love being in a
[SPEAKER_06]: windowless place, but that's where I spend
a lot of my time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of sounds like you're talking
about the economic, and there's a lot to
[SPEAKER_04]: unpack there, I'm gonna do my best.
[SPEAKER_04]: The economics of being a sustainable
business aren't all that attractive,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of the time, to be completely honest
with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really not.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really have to drill down.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: The amount of material that you need and
the minimums that a lot of these
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturers need are, it's daunting,
it's very daunting, honestly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a long road, and I think,
coupled with the economic discussion,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're talking about a cultural and a
social impact as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So doing those two things in concert,
hopefully you'll have a successful
[SPEAKER_04]: business, there's no guarantees,
but at the end of the day, I think there
[SPEAKER_04]: is a growing demand for consumers,
as a consumer, I should say, that they're
[SPEAKER_04]: demanding that these things change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the economics of a sustainable
business is what's driving these huge
[SPEAKER_04]: brands like the Loop Play and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That, unfortunately, and H&M, and that
unfortunately is what drives a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: social currency and a lot of the cultural
aspects of the world we live in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think you can't ignore one without
the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're trying to be a sustainable
business, without looking at the
[SPEAKER_04]: economics, like, okay, cool, I'll see you
when you're collecting your welfare check
[SPEAKER_04]: in a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not gonna do well.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are just worried about the cultural
aspect of it, without the economics,
[SPEAKER_04]: same scenario.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or just the environmental.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just the environment, yeah,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why it's a trifecta.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not two, it's like three.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's social equity, economics and
environment, or profits, people,
[SPEAKER_05]: planet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's helpful to come back to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just simple, reduce, reuse,
recycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just becomes a quick mantra that you
can just catch yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is what I'm doing profitable, potentially?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it good for people?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it good for the planet?
[SPEAKER_05]: If those things, yes, yes, yes,
then maybe there's a business kernel in
[SPEAKER_05]: there that you can deal with.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was a gaffer, that is, a chief
lighting technician.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before that, an electrician, and then I
was a DP.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, so I spent 30 years behind the
camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the last bit of it in the early 2000s,
we would demand biodiesel in our
[SPEAKER_05]: generators in Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wouldn't get it in Tennessee,
but I would get it here in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it took a little while.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was red dye, and we had to convince the
generator operators to go to there and
[SPEAKER_05]: say, yes, you can do this, it will not
break your warranty.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you may have been part of that
policy, but in California, it was very
[SPEAKER_05]: clear, it will not break the warranties.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it took a year or two, and it took
basically getting celebrities,
[SPEAKER_05]: whoever was the most prominent producer,
actor on the set, to throw a hissy fit.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to use biodiesel on these shoots.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And basically, 90% of the industry of the
generator operators in Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_05]: And today, sometimes, I don't know,
I've been out of it for a few years since
[SPEAKER_05]: I shifted over from film tech to clean
tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I drove a biodiesel for like 10 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I drove biodiesel 100, 99.9,
all over California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason it changed was because of
the diesel leak, an underground leak in
[SPEAKER_05]: Northern California.
[SPEAKER_05]: The diesel leaked from a regular petroleum
diesel leaked into the ground from an
[SPEAKER_05]: underground tank.
[SPEAKER_05]: The lobbyists that wrote the rules to
address that made it so that biodiesel
[SPEAKER_05]: could not be stored underground.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so therefore, I used to drive around
and go to my B-99 stations and get
[SPEAKER_05]: biodiesel all over Southern California,
eight places.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I had to shift and go only where they
could have above ground storage tanks,
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's not in the city.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd have to drive out to Sun Valley,
get my biodiesel, and then come back to
[SPEAKER_05]: Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's one by Golden Road.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could go up and down my neighbor's
alleyway, and I could get biodiesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you got some biodiesel?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My boyfriend's actually on the board for
the biodiesel co-op for Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Jack Eit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been out of town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have had these issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're not going to go on
biodiesel, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They financially regulated them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would meet the regulations,
and then there'd be another regulation,
[SPEAKER_01]: and another regulation, and another
regulation, which was making it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, but there's a different outcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: The outcome is that we got shut down
because of the way the lobbyists wrote the
[SPEAKER_05]: rules in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we didn't have a strong enough team up
there to rewrite those rules to allow
[SPEAKER_05]: underground storage tanks to be stored
underground.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I look at this as a case study of
market creation, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's what I'm talking about in
terms of thinking about demand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad that you brought up the
influencer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, yeah, we can make cool shit
happen if Leonardo DiCaprio says,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, we have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I saw Cyril from Parly for the Oceans,
if you're familiar with that company.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the ones that created the thread
from ocean plastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: For Adidas, for their shoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Parly's first product.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going further now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're really focusing on kind of
creating a culture, P-A-R-L-E-Y.
[SPEAKER_03]: And their next step is really focusing on
creating a movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one thing that the founder said
recently was that, and I think it's very
[SPEAKER_03]: catchy, and I love it, that purpose is the
new luxury.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that once these influencers start
doing this, and like that Kenya Tech's
[SPEAKER_03]: little bag I gave you, it's like $250 or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like this stuff does cost more
money a lot of times because it's in R&D.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone brought up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if these influencers of all
different sorts can show off how great
[SPEAKER_03]: these products are and that they are cool
and that there should be a demand for this
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, then I think it's a very beneficial
way to be helping new products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming from the big company perspective,
I think giving a little pat on the back to
[SPEAKER_00]: whoever it may be for actually trying to
move in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a big CPG company or a big
retailer that any of you can say they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing something cool and innovative and
interesting and here's what it is?
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say that most of them have little
cool things that they're trying to do from
[SPEAKER_06]: time to time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean, one of the things that has been
kind of interesting is plant model.
[SPEAKER_06]: From Coke, so this is an example where
they use one of the ingredients to make
[SPEAKER_06]: PET.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more affordable to make it from a
bio-based source.
[SPEAKER_06]: So ethylene glycol, that's 30% of PET
bottles.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they looked at the math and then they
teamed up with some other startups and
[SPEAKER_06]: they said, well, can we make 100%?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so a startup that I worked for for a
few years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eventually their collaboration with Coke
on plant bottle and a couple of other
[SPEAKER_06]: companies, they said, yeah, if we wanted
to, we could make a 100% bio-based PET,
[SPEAKER_06]: polyethylene terepally.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the economics don't work.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our plant bottle that we use now or
that we see in the market now,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's 30% bio-based.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it says plant bottle, most of them do.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I think all of them do.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you get a little bit of 30%,
you get to slap plant bottle, the logo on
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's definitely, they get a
marketing lift because people are like,
[SPEAKER_06]: oh, well this is, I don't have to feel as
evil about having my sugar fix here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's an example where, but it's like,
you can find almost every brand owner you
[SPEAKER_06]: can find has done, they have one press
release at least that they're doing
[SPEAKER_06]: something cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the question is, is this enough?
[SPEAKER_06]: And the answer is no, it's not enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, I think that is an example of
that not being enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: The CNA, which is a large fashion company
in Europe, they, I think last year
[SPEAKER_03]: released the first completely certified
cradle to cradle t-shirt for like $5 or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like really, really cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that sounds like a great thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I was, when I learned about this,
I was sitting next to a small small
[SPEAKER_03]: fashion company owner.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's like, how, like thinking of like
this pina tex costs, this pina tex bag is
[SPEAKER_03]: $250.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, how can I compete?
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, if, if this shirt's $5 and
it's awesome and they're, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: subsidizing it with all kinds of other
sales of stuff, like how can a small
[SPEAKER_03]: sustainable business compete with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's a good question,
but it's still- They're competing right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're competing with fast fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's $5 shirts all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's cradle to cradle certified.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like, that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all your, but it's still a $5 shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause most people aren't going to go into
a store and be like, oh, it's a cradle to
[SPEAKER_02]: cradle certified.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to buy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and I might, but they still have the,
they still have the competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: The competition is there no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not based on the sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's based on price, based on market
demand.
[SPEAKER_08]: Policy in LA around zero waste.
[SPEAKER_08]: Specifically for zero waste.
[SPEAKER_08]: Zero waste is a broad terminology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero waste is a broad terminology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So city of Los Angeles falls state
regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to be seeing organics
recycling at most of the, cause we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about what's the largest piece of
material going to a landfill was the
[SPEAKER_01]: largest piece of material causing methane
gas out of a landfill.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And truly that's what you need to target
hardcore, but that's already regulated at
[SPEAKER_01]: the state level and that the jurisdictions
start to, and that's part of zero waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've gotten this really weird
skewed idea of what zero waste is because
[SPEAKER_01]: of social media and people with their jars
of trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So zero waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lot more comprehensive than
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the organics recycling, you're going to
be seeing across Los Angeles, Southern
[SPEAKER_01]: California, all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The city of Los Angeles passed a franchise
agreement that says one, there's 11 zones
[SPEAKER_01]: and each zone can only be serviced by one
hauler, by one trash company for the
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses and the multifamily residential
of four or more units or five or more
[SPEAKER_01]: units, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have to work with the city in
order to make sure that they're meeting
[SPEAKER_01]: the state goals and those diversion goals,
the regulations on organics and things of
[SPEAKER_01]: that nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a lot more education
and outreach.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's information that's going to be
able to be provided to the businesses that
[SPEAKER_01]: they didn't have before because that was
not regulated because the hollers didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to provide that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the businesses are getting
one-on-one communication with the
[SPEAKER_01]: recycling coordinators in order to be able
to help them through the process and help
[SPEAKER_01]: them reduce their waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a 10-year plan, so it's not going
to happen overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the city of Los Angeles definitely
passed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The city has their, they have their LA
plan, their plan, plan, PLA in.
[SPEAKER_08]: The city has a plan.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: so the city has a, it's called the plan,
PLA in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's their, that's their
sustainability plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zero waste is part of that element,
but they have to work on the different
[SPEAKER_01]: elements on how to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're, it's not, everything's not
written into that plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we have to have all white roofs and
we have to make sure that we have more
[SPEAKER_01]: green space and then we have to,
the franchise, the concept of the
[SPEAKER_01]: franchise is part of that plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's different elements that they're
doing in order to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you talk about zero waste,
I'm kind of assuming that maybe you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about waste in general,
like plastics or foam or something of that
[SPEAKER_01]: nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not part of that plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that comes, anything that they
push forward on is going to come from
[SPEAKER_01]: within that plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're going to look back at the
plan and say, we want to push on this
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of regulation because it meets the
needs of this plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to probably at this
moment, see a foam ban in the city of Los
[SPEAKER_01]: Angeles because I know personally,
cause I'm, I'm sort of working in that
[SPEAKER_01]: circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sort of, I am working in that
circle that they're looking at a larger,
[SPEAKER_01]: more comprehensive look about how we
manage and, and, and use our waste or the
[SPEAKER_01]: products that we're putting out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that conversation has not all fully
been laid out, but it is one that is
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, if we're, if we're going to talk
about chemistry, it'd be polystyrene,
[SPEAKER_01]: expanded polystyrene, but polystyrene is
without the, without it being expanded in
[SPEAKER_01]: the foam sense that we know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extruded.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is that you can,
here's the, here a little tidbit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make any plastic into foam because
all you have to do is just extrude it in
[SPEAKER_01]: the specific manner to where it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was just going to add that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the city, so basically, you know,
from the city plan, the city, the
[SPEAKER_05]: department of public works, LA department
of public works has their LA sanitation
[SPEAKER_05]: department inside of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have policies and, and,
and that's an interesting space to be in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is sanitation is municipal solid
waste and sewage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sanitation is not going to be pushing on
those regulations that look at like
[SPEAKER_05]: product control.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the city, and then, and then the
county actually does a lot more in that
[SPEAKER_05]: direction than the city does.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really the county.
[SPEAKER_01]: The county one's not out yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the county one, they're just doing the
community meetings on and pulling in
[SPEAKER_01]: people from different industries to have a
conversation on the county sustainability
[SPEAKER_01]: plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you won't find that one online.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you will find the city of LA plan
online.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so, so, so the zero waste.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so Pam, like the zero waste definition
that you gave is like, is, is,
[SPEAKER_05]: is the right definition, but then there's
sort of the generic, don't put anything in
[SPEAKER_05]: the landfill.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is no away, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we can't throw things away anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we, you know, live our lives if we
can't throw things away?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, I think, you know, going back
to like the personal story part of the
[SPEAKER_05]: personal journey, you know, how do you do
that with your family?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you, how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like, it's very,
it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what is, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, so from this other huge other
layer is look at like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, but, but, but from the corporate
level, you look at like Walmart,
[SPEAKER_05]: Walmart, by definition, they, they,
they, they zero wasted their corporation
[SPEAKER_05]: between like 2003 and 2008.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, they reduced by 90% what they used
to throw away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they don't throw out their chair,
their, their whole supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they don't take 90% organics,
organics, all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, but a lot, a lot of what was left in
that, not that last 10% was organics
[SPEAKER_05]: because that's the messy part.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's hard to, that's the hardest part.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were just simply, they used to just,
you know, use their crates once and throw
[SPEAKER_05]: them away boxes inside of boxes,
inside of boxes, inside of boxes for
[SPEAKER_05]: what's going to, the consumer is going to
use.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they just designed better systems
to use less weight throughout the,
[SPEAKER_05]: from China, from India to the store.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just, they cut that by 90% what used
to get thrown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll also know that zero waste has to
do with when, when companies say that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's zero waste, but they're not
certified zero waste, like through true,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the zero waste certification that
same thing as USGBC lead certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for zero waste, that, that
certification only looks at the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks at the brick and mortar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't look at the, the supplies that
are coming in unless they're toxic and how
[SPEAKER_01]: that impact was upstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're what the waste situation
was up there with the health and community
[SPEAKER_01]: situation, social situation was up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't look at how it is on the
back end either.
[SPEAKER_01]: How, what happens to it when it leaves,
if it is actually recyclable, if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: reusable, if it's durable, they don't look
at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just, they're looking at the brick
and mortar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have companies, maybe like
Walmart and a few others that I have in my
[SPEAKER_01]: name, in my head on that name that will
say we're zero waste companies because
[SPEAKER_01]: they've defined what zero waste means.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've defined what recyclable is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've defined that if we burn 60% of the
materials coming out of our facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was a definition of, of 90%
reduction to landfill without
[SPEAKER_05]: incineration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was, you know, there's many
companies that burn most of their,
[SPEAKER_01]: their stuff and call it zero waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's countries that do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweden.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gasification is, is burning.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to, so this is where Sweden's not
gasification.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's important to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if you've defined
organics even once tonight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, anybody has anyone defined organic
organic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so as opposed to this, which we would
not, would not be organic.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not a rigorous definition.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can define it for the waste industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the waste industry, when we say
organics matter and what, like when the
[SPEAKER_01]: waste characterization comes out by the
state, or even by the EPA and they have
[SPEAKER_01]: the pie chart and they say, what's in our
landfill?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll say, what's the recyclables?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the organics and what was the
landfill?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they'll get all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But C and D as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they, but they then pie charted out
and they'll say this percentage in the
[SPEAKER_01]: landfiller or the overall municipal solid
waste was X, you know, these are the pie
[SPEAKER_01]: charts.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it says organics, what they're
talking about, what falls under that is
[SPEAKER_01]: yard trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant matter, food scraps, wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it does get sticky for us too,
because sometimes depending on the study,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll also throw the paper and the
cardboard in there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So did that, you know, as you could be
composted pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the waste industry, that's what it
means.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I completely understand from a science
and chemistry background that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: another time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of saying like, what is the
definition that we can all like
[SPEAKER_06]: participate in in this moment?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not, I'm not here to, I mean,
I want to make it clear that I'm not here
[SPEAKER_06]: to like, gotcha anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just trying to, I'm trying to get us
all so that we're on the same page,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the same issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the same issue because I have to
define it too, when I go out and do
[SPEAKER_01]: education.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as far as gasification and
burning, so burning is bringing in oxygen
[SPEAKER_06]: so that you have, you know, as complete
combustion as possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically you're turning solid things
and carbon atoms into carbon dioxide,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then gasification is where you do that
in a much more controlled way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you are introducing oxygen into this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're kind of like partially burning
things, but you're not burning everything
[SPEAKER_06]: up to gas.
[SPEAKER_06]: And instead you're ending up with,
well, in some cases you are ending up with
[SPEAKER_06]: gas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you're ending up with gas and
some, some materials, some solid materials
[SPEAKER_06]: that come from, if, if polymers are gas
type, for instance, you might end up with
[SPEAKER_06]: some, some stuff that you can make
something else out of.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make sure everyone can get going
if you need to, but I'm super glad that we
[SPEAKER_03]: were able to have a discussion and you're
super welcome to stay and chat with
[SPEAKER_03]: Jessica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
