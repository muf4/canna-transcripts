[SPEAKER_04]: I come from a mixed martial arts
background.
[SPEAKER_04]: I played sports my whole life,
fought in the UFC for several years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And being around other people who got
addicted to opioids, that scared me.
[SPEAKER_04]: At an early age, there was a close family
friend of ours that we grew up with who,
[SPEAKER_04]: his life was pretty much shattered by
being addicted to opioids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that always had an effect on me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So any time there was something that was
going to be prescribed to me for an injury
[SPEAKER_04]: or for pain, I just was always afraid of
taking it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really never did anything at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even Advil, my brother got addicted,
not addicted, but got a bunch of ulcers
[SPEAKER_04]: from taking Advil all the time,
because we were doing jiu-jitsu and mixed
[SPEAKER_04]: martial arts all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he was taking Advil all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got a bunch of ulcers.
[SPEAKER_04]: That scared me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I just avoided pretty much taking
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you're doing something like mixed
martial arts, in a lot of ways,
[SPEAKER_04]: the training is more difficult than the
fight itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the UFC, you can kick, you can
knee, you can elbow, you can punch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're doing this with four ounce
gloves.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the training for it is brutal.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're training two, three times a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're sore all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're hurting all the time, not to
mention you're taking some blows to the
[SPEAKER_04]: head even before you even get into the
cage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very difficult on the body.
[SPEAKER_04]: And being around the various mixed martial
arts gyms, kickboxing gyms, boxing gyms,
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a lot of nightmare stories of kids
and men who were addicted to opioids and a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of promising careers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Were thrown away because of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that definitely had an impact on me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a reoccurring theme through all
the different gyms that I was around.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of the fighters used them
recreationally as a party drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Vicodin and Percocets were mixed with
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of craziness ensued because of
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I just saw a lot of lives
shattered because of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even had a very negative perception of
marijuana and cannabis as well coming out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Michelle was talking about how
really our perspectives guide us in
[SPEAKER_04]: everything that we do and see.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kind of had that negative view of
cannabis and really didn't try it until I
[SPEAKER_04]: think I was like 28 years old when I was
kind of I guess in the beginning earlier
[SPEAKER_04]: part of my UFC career.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it definitely helped me in a variety
of ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dealing with pain and I guess seeing
things in a different way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it didn't have those addictive
qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cassima was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Played 12 years in the NFL.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a fun career.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of injuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of war stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't bore you with the minute details
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, I've seen a lot of people
that have been dependent on drugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be in Advil, ibuprofen,
mixing caffeine with ibuprofen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know at one time I was doing three
Advils and a Red Bull before practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in the middle of practice,
you get another Red Bull and it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more Advil, depending on how your game was
the day before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dictate whether or not you took
Vicodins or Percocets, Flexerol.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give you muscle relaxers,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The worst thing about the NFL is being on
a weight trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're playing in New England.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cold as hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You play a rough game and then you got to
get on a flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to fly all the way back home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you guys have seen
football players in person, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys are pretty big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember my rookie year,
I'm sitting next to Tony Fennotti.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's about 6'8", 3'70".
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just being polite on his weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's probably close to 400 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sitting next to the guy and he's
got some edible candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked him, I was like, you know,
what are these for?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, oh, these are my little weed
candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, why do you take
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the thing that I knew about weed
was bad, bad, bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's against the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, man, I need something that's
going to help me with this inflammation in
[SPEAKER_00]: my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, because by the time the wheel's
up on this plane, my hand's going to swell
[SPEAKER_00]: up to twice the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally, I watched his body just
bloat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what it was from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then he told me that he was taking a
lot of Percocets and Vicodins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was getting a lot of bloating,
water retention, edema, especially in his
[SPEAKER_00]: lower legs and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just seeing what damage can be done
with opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that a lot of players were
taken like candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you mentioned about the doctors
overprescribing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our team physicians would just give you
whatever you needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, especially not before a game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys that couldn't sleep or whatnot,
they would sit there and give out
[SPEAKER_00]: Ambien's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no, I mean, there's supposed
to be a protocol for prescribing somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: something like, what are the side effects
of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Announce to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they have a contraindication with
other medications people are taking or
[SPEAKER_00]: predisposed positions that might cause a
psychotic break, which I took Ambien one
[SPEAKER_00]: time and one time only.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember taking it and I woke up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the middle of the night,
and my room was in disarray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my roommate was sitting over on the
side of the room, looking like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the hell is wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I don't know what happened,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, you just woke up yelling,
screaming, and throwing the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You threw this through the desk,
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you're insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's wrong with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And come to find out that Ambien had
caused some type of issue in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it was from,
but probably from the years of banging my
[SPEAKER_00]: head into another person.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I definitely was one of the
people growing up that I was a straight A
[SPEAKER_00]: student.
[SPEAKER_00]: My whole schooling career.
[SPEAKER_00]: And always looked at drugs as bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you hear all the stories about reefer
madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back in the day, your mom was saying,
oh, that's the gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it leads you to all this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to be dumb if you smoke
this or you take this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just kind of avoided it my whole
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never really did any research on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't use my scientific mind to sort of
figure out what the possibilities could be
[SPEAKER_00]: from using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sort of go through my whole career
playing college.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people give NFL flack for what
they give the players.
[SPEAKER_00]: But college is 10 times worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you've got to keep your athletes
out there making money for the school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And athletes are not getting compensated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are they doing when they can't get
access to the drugs is they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: find whatever's cheap on the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, you know, that's what you get when
you go on the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know when I was in college,
I was taking Celebrex for joint pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation, get to the league.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're taking Vicodin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vicodin's made me sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had to take because I was in pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was no alternative for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the time, you can't take any
cannabis products because it's against the
[SPEAKER_00]: rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even CBD was a banned substance as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the NFL, their banned substance is
extensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, basically, if you want to get big,
you've got to eat a lot of potatoes and
[SPEAKER_00]: veggies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's certain proteins you can't
take because of contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that has anything to do with any
kind of supplement is very regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, you can eat amino acids or
vitamin C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, that's what we're left with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of guys in the NFL are cannabis
users.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to name any names.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep the anonymity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of guys use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, from the 12 years I spent in the
league, I would say probably 70% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the league use cannabis in some
form or fashion, whether it's edibles or
[SPEAKER_00]: ingestibles or smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not until I started to research
about what it does in the body that I
[SPEAKER_00]: learned that the Tripp V1 was the
transient potential cation channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subfamily 5 is involved with pain
perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Michelle had mentioned earlier about
your emotional pain versus physical pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know in the NFL, your job is on the
line every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's stress in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stress causes pain, emotional pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to have a job?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to feed my kids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to keep the lights on in my
house?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that stress allows you to build up
more tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have tension, you get
injured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's physical pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're dealing with twofold problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have that stress,
it keeps your body from being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I noticed that smoking cannabis
allows you to relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets that mood to calm down a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember sitting with some of the
players in the little smoke session.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, no, I'm going to try this just
because I want to see what the hoopla is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, there's different strains that
can do different things in the bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the overall synopsis of the story was
I found that my legs and my knees stopped
[SPEAKER_00]: hurting.
[SPEAKER_00]: My ankles stopped popping when I walked up
the stairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually was motivated to study my
playbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke a little sativa, and then that
brain starts to get firing.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now all of a sudden, I'm studying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I was told growing up was it
was going to make you lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be able to do
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get munchies and get fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to become a loser in
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't know that you could smoke
sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, you want to clean
your house and organize your garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to mow the lawn and buy new
curtains and change the blinds and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of applications for
marijuana that they're just touching the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of it, as far as cancer research
and epilepsy, seizures, medications,
[SPEAKER_00]: and things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just for the average lay person who
just wants to feel good, that emotionally,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sad today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you take something that's an
SSRI, you're going to get depleted with
[SPEAKER_00]: your serotonin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to be even more depressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's no way to rebound from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're pissed off about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The depression causes you to drink or it
causes you to be angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you've got a whole host of other
problems, besides the fact that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: back hurts and you stubbed your toe on the
couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're yelling at your kids
because they didn't clean up after they
[SPEAKER_00]: got done playing the Legos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know it's a little PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get a little weed for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have a little weed for that later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just remember throughout the course
of my career, trying to find ways to feel
[SPEAKER_00]: better, but also adhere to the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm stickler for adhering to the
rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, when the rules don't
benefit you as a person and it's putting
[SPEAKER_00]: your job stake on the line, you have to
get creative and find ways to better
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know for you guys, I would probably
smoke 10 joints before I get into a ring
[SPEAKER_00]: fighting those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remarkable how they could do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a helmet for my job, which I
protected my head, kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for you, what would be something that
one of the benefits of cannabis as it
[SPEAKER_00]: relates to recovering after a fight,
like post fight recovery?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, in mixed martial arts,
obviously you're sore a lot, but also,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's important to see what
you're doing in a different way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it certainly opened up my
mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost wish I did more of it while I was
fighting because I see it so differently
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're always looking for the latest and
greatest techniques, the best ways,
[SPEAKER_04]: most efficient ways to train.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really felt that cannabis opened up
my mind to see things very differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as far as just how to be creative,
some guys take it in a very black and
[SPEAKER_04]: white approach as far as how they train
for a fight.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go in, you hit pads, you spar,
and that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked seeing it as more of a creative
process.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, for that reason, cannabis was
very valuable.
[SPEAKER_04]: But certainly as far as recovering from
fights and recovering from heavy training
[SPEAKER_04]: sessions and whatever injuries I had,
it was very important for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also didn't sleep well.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can imagine, getting ready for a
fight of another dude who is training
[SPEAKER_04]: across the world and getting ready to beat
you up, that can be a pretty stressful
[SPEAKER_04]: situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes, you know, sleeping was
difficult for me because you're also,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm an analyzer and to a fault.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd be thinking about, you know,
how I should be approaching this fight or
[SPEAKER_04]: what I should be doing or watching video
and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it did help me relax a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And where it gets tricky, especially now
in the UFC, is that they do have drug
[SPEAKER_04]: testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish they had more drug testing when I
was fighting because a lot of guys,
[SPEAKER_04]: in my opinion, were using a lot of PEDs
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, with the fight game now,
USADA is involved in testing protocols.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while you are, and it's a great thing,
is that when you're not in, when you're
[SPEAKER_04]: not preparing for a fight, let's say,
I think it's like seven days, I think is
[SPEAKER_04]: the standard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Within seven days, you can't use
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're in a non-training camp or
you're not getting ready for a fight,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can use marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the fact that they're just seeing it
now like that is a big change than when I
[SPEAKER_04]: was fighting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think they are seeing more benefits
to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're opening up their mind more to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in the day, if, you know,
when I was fighting, if you were caught
[SPEAKER_04]: using cannabis, you would be suspended for
three months, six months, sometimes a year
[SPEAKER_04]: or more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in mixed martial arts, you know,
when I was fighting, you weren't making a
[SPEAKER_04]: whole lot of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: These aren't guys that are making millions
and millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you have the potential to kind of make
that but back in the day, it really wasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: like that unless you were an elite
fighter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was tough.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know on a lot of fighters, you know,
getting, you know, testing positive for
[SPEAKER_04]: something, you know, you're out for a
year, you're not gonna be able to pay the
[SPEAKER_04]: bills.
[SPEAKER_04]: So things are changing in a positive
direction and it's good to see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, there's even a lot of
fighters that are, you know, now being
[SPEAKER_04]: sponsored by CBD companies and different
cannabis companies and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a very different landscape than it
was even, you know, three, five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that if they were able to
sponsor NFL athletes or NBA athletes with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis products, I mean, well,
not only one where they make a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: money, but two, I think they would get the
word out because a lot of people have that
[SPEAKER_00]: stigma still.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't use marijuana or this,
that, whatever is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden now hemp is legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farm bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're working on scheduling for
cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know for a fact that once people
start using the proper vernacular and how
[SPEAKER_00]: to speak about it properly, I think that
it'll be monumental as far as pushing it
[SPEAKER_00]: for, for scheduling to become more
prevalent where we're now schedule two as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to schedule one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that people are apprehensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Roger Goodell is apprehensive about
it because they have such heavy policies
[SPEAKER_00]: on people who have been smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Josh Gordon got spent 10 times or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ricky Williams took a year off to go on
sabbatical to smoke and he knew something
[SPEAKER_00]: we didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, okay, my body is getting beat
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to go fix it and repair it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't realize the benefits of it
until I myself started partaking in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized that, you know,
staying calm, being able to sleep,
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to eat, you know, sometimes
when you're nervous or you're frustrated
[SPEAKER_00]: or injured, you're, you're depressed or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have the same eating habits and
you eat bad or you're impulsively eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now like when you, you get the
munchies, I don't know if you've had
[SPEAKER_00]: munchies before, but you eat, I'm sure I
have healthy food in my house,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, I'm eating properly and
eating, eating more than what I would if I
[SPEAKER_00]: was stressed out, I wouldn't be eating.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember I had a coach and he was in his
forties and he would be sparring and
[SPEAKER_04]: training with us for hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing that in your forties?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, I smoke weed, you know,
I smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I'm able to keep up with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm relaxed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not using as much energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I tell you what, he was one of the
best guys in the gym.
[SPEAKER_04]: Training and sparring, even in his
forties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he moved amazingly well and he could
train for a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a few USU fighters and I will
definitely not say their names.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them are very vocal about their
use, but some of the guys that do
[SPEAKER_04]: triathlons and they were explaining to me,
they were saying, you know, when I get
[SPEAKER_04]: tired, you know, I'll be in the middle and
I'll start my run.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I take my pen out and I just
hit the pen and I'm gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just get focused and it was just
blowing, it was blowing my mind because I
[SPEAKER_04]: never used and trained.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did after I stopped fighting and I found
huge benefits to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I understood what they were saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I almost, in a weird way,
I almost feel like it's cheating in some
[SPEAKER_04]: ways because I'm so not in my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just in the moment and I'm training
and I'm creative.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's almost not fair when I'm training
with someone because I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's another reason why I wish I was
using a little bit more when I was
[SPEAKER_04]: fighting because I never used and trained.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in that regard, I definitely found
benefits after I was done fighting when I
[SPEAKER_04]: retired.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of guys, you know, use and are
very active and are performing even
[SPEAKER_04]: better.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is a performance enhancer in a lot
of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen a couple of guys that would
smoke regularly and it was like something
[SPEAKER_00]: they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day they wake up, smoke,
get off of practice, they smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple of them told me that it
actually dulled the pain, increased their
[SPEAKER_00]: pain threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you said, I think it is kind of
cheating because all the guys that were
[SPEAKER_00]: never injured, they were always at
practice, they were always focused,
[SPEAKER_00]: having a good time, were the guys that
smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know if it's because
they're just relaxing, living life.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just out there getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, you know, you start to
realize that their inflammation is worse,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're less pain and they're functioning
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's amazing to see that the people
that are using were the ones that were
[SPEAKER_00]: actually doing good and the ones that
weren't were the ones that were feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: the pain and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they teach you growing up is that,
oh, it's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke, it's going to ruin your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get cancer, which I
haven't known anybody that has passed away
[SPEAKER_00]: from cancer, from smoking weed or overdose
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have too much of an edible and
you feel like you're going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is true.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't actually die.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually, I wanted to ask Michelle a
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've heard anything
about the effects of it helping brain
[SPEAKER_04]: trauma or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there were some studies out on it
and I'd be curious, probably relevant to
[SPEAKER_04]: what me and Kasim do, but I'd love to hear
about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is actual research on having THC
in your system when you have a brain
[SPEAKER_05]: injury.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're in a car accident,
for example, you have THC on board,
[SPEAKER_05]: your brain will actually recover faster
than if you didn't have THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, that's one thing that we can
say if you're going to have repeated blows
[SPEAKER_05]: to the head, you want THC in your system.
[SPEAKER_05]: I studied neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I studied how these newborn brain cells
can help recover your brain from brain
[SPEAKER_05]: injury.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's definitely something to it
where you don't know about CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would assume the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have CBD in your system and you get
hit in the head, I think that your brain
[SPEAKER_05]: is going to recover faster.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why there's a lot of research
that's happening and I don't know if you
[SPEAKER_05]: guys are involved with athletes for care,
but they're studying these things.
[SPEAKER_05]: What happens to your brain?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you have a traumatic brain
injury and you use CBD, is your brain
[SPEAKER_05]: functioning better?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's ways that we can actually study
this with brain scans.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is an exciting time and I hope
that, you know, we'll find out all the
[SPEAKER_05]: answers soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I actually I went to the brain
treatment center down in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife noticed a decline in my mental
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always consider myself pretty high
intellect, a nerd, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would be talking with her and she
said I would be mumbling or have gibberish
[SPEAKER_00]: or I would slur my speech or I would like
tail off of my thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't notice it myself,
but then she recorded me and showed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, yeah, that's kind of
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard myself speak like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would be talking so fast and I was
speaking faster than when the words could
[SPEAKER_00]: come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd be on the next word, did it finish
the first word.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't notice that at first,
but then I went to the brain treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did give me a picture of my brain,
showed me the activity of my alpha waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the doctor who was in charge of
the whole brain treatment center,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's actually a former Navy SEAL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's been through traumatic brain
injury and stuff like that from the
[SPEAKER_00]: percussions of explosions and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he told me, while you're doing this
treatment, in between the days that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do your treatments, smoke a lot of
weed or take CBD, full spectrum CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: just take a ton of it and then come in and
make sure you load up on before you come
[SPEAKER_00]: in, hour before your session.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the brain treatment center does,
they put a test the magnet, an order to
[SPEAKER_00]: test the magnet on your frontal lobe
because all the damage that we do in your
[SPEAKER_00]: brain from concussions and whatnot,
NFL, most of them come from frontal
[SPEAKER_00]: collisions on your frontal lobe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the front of the brain starts to slow
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the back of the brain is a little
faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that signal that goes to the front of
your brain that is in charge of emotional
[SPEAKER_00]: control, emotional stability, sleep,
alertness of tenderness, and all those
[SPEAKER_00]: would decline from all the brain injuries
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So frequency would be slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it was at 11 megahertz in the
back and seven in the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like a huge issue with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it says what the beta waves and
the theta waves that are in my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says literally you have a ton of alpha
waves that are flying everywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're not in sync with the front of
your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have a lot of the theta
waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically it's almost like you're
sleeping, but you're awake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like you're in a zone,
but you're not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, when you smoke the weed and
the CBD, it's going to allow your brain to
[SPEAKER_00]: focus all of those alpha waves to get to
the same frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it actually benefited a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know at first, and there's no
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, this is something we just
stumbled across, because they have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of guys that smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they told me that they feel better when
they're smoking weed and they're taking
[SPEAKER_00]: the treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's huge that I think you mentioned
more about the research that's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, a lot of holding up of research
on patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've been smoking weed since,
what, 400 AD, people smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of guinea pigs that are
out there who just have to speak more
[SPEAKER_00]: about it and put the information out there
for people to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people don't know that this
medication combined with cannabis can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually improve the medication's potency
and efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just people being able to say it out
loud and having forums like this in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to speak and engage in conversation,
they'll be able to explain their personal
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can go to people who are doing
research can actually have that firsthand
[SPEAKER_00]: experience of what's going on with your
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I get my mom pure CBD extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has a full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helped regulate her blood sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't know that it could help with
diabetes, but apparently it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my little trial and error for
that part.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing just how many different
benefits there are to cannabis and CBD and
[SPEAKER_04]: THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a really bad rib injury right around
Christmas time, 2018.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just got over it probably about a
month or so ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that allowed me to
keep training throughout because I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: know, I keep training through pain
sometimes is it was the CBD, CBD creams
[SPEAKER_04]: and oils.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just a game changer for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And without me, I don't know, having to
use something like opioids and it's crazy
[SPEAKER_04]: because we don't have UFC, like teams of
doctors that prescribe stuff to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have our own personal doctors.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not organized, I guess, like the NFL
teams, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my father, who's a physician,
they're very quick to, what do you need
[SPEAKER_04]: for pain?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a Vicodin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's Percocets.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be nice to get people to kind of
change their perceptions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, Michelle was talking about
what education sometimes it doesn't work
[SPEAKER_04]: on people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with that, but I also think that
it helps as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Educating people on really what are the
benefits?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is going to happen if you use
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is your life going to be over?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you gonna be really lazy?
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people just have these crazy
perceptions and crazy ideas on everything,
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think education is key.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't work on everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are gonna believe what they're
gonna believe, but I do think there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of benefits to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's forms like this that I think will
hopefully help and educate people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's monumental for UFC fighters,
MMA in general, because you guys have a
[SPEAKER_00]: fight here, and then the next fight's not
for what, six or seven months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people take more fights in a
year, but I mean, in doing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think masking pain while training,
because if you get injury and it prevents
[SPEAKER_00]: you from training for about five days,
that five days is huge because the fight's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with NFL, we have like 16 games,
and you can come out and somebody will go
[SPEAKER_00]: in for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's backups.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no backups in fighting,
so you got to do it all yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that right there in and of itself just
shows the power.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said a lot of people are getting
sponsored by CBD companies now because it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see athletes that are benefiting
from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of the fighters that are
sponsored that are taking CBD or say that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's monumental for just joint training.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I imagine getting into the ring
and you want to roll on the ring and
[SPEAKER_00]: jujitsu, and your knees are aching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, and it's a great point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not to say it's easier necessarily,
but in the NFL, if you're not able to play
[SPEAKER_04]: on a Sunday, you wait and you're able to
play the next Sunday, and you're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your contract guarantees you a certain
amount of money, not the case in fighting.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not able to go that Saturday
night, well, good luck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you get to fight another three
months, or maybe you don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of times you don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the only way you're really
going to get paid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sponsorship has changed significantly in
the UFC.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a time where you kind of looked
like you had NASCAR shorts.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had sponsors all over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you can't really do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's other ways to go about those
sponsorships.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all you got.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're not able to fight,
you're not getting paid.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not able to pay the bills.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of guys are dealing with a lot
of pain and have to fight with major
[SPEAKER_04]: injuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have to grow up in a weight class,
I think that cannabis could help,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a little more, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the huge thing is, like you guys
had mentioned about education,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think speaking from a scientific
background or speaking from a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: background would actually help the
community as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think ways that we can benefit each
other is speaking about it openly with
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are against it and using the
vernacular that we use in the industry to
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of become lame in terms so they can
understand what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you go to someone and say,
oh, your leg hurts, why don't you just
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke a little weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or as you tell them, if you get those
cat-iron channels that help your body
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the pain so it slows down that
synaptic firing from that muscle area
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're getting hurt, the pain slows
down the firing to your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll feel a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Tylenol, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like Tylenol, but it smells funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my mom was adamantly against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know, you're taking all
these medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got high blood pressure medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got diabetic medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got pain medication for arthritis
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you know, if you just take a
little of this stuff right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll feel a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, I don't do that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you feel weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, actually, this is CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's non-psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if I'm not going to get high,
then it's not weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, mom, it's not weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mike knows my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was the one that would stick with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that would smoke weed and come in
the house, you get out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a pothead and this and that,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are this and that, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to educate her on what CBD was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through the course of educating her on
that, then she became an advocate for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she started to tell her friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the word just spreads like wildfire to
where I have one of her 65-year-old
[SPEAKER_00]: friends call me and say, hey, can I get
some of that weed you gave your mom?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's funny, but I mean,
it's a blessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're able to share that
knowledge and information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It benefits somebody else's life who
otherwise would be going through pain or
[SPEAKER_00]: taking some type of opiate that is not
beneficial to their body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people take a lot of Vicodin,
they can't go to the restroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of crucial to when you're a
fine-tuned athlete.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to get nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get muscle breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're taking Vicodin,
you can't pass the stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's amazing how things have
changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I own a couple mixed martial arts
and jiu-jitsu gyms, one in Boston,
[SPEAKER_04]: one here in LA.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we sell CBD products for them to use
on their body.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we believe in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been helpful to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just amazing how things have
changed in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things are changing in Massachusetts as
well, obviously, in regards to the
[SPEAKER_04]: perceptions and the laws regarding
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's been great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought Boston would be the last place
on Earth to ever have.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was surprised by it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your favorite form of way to use
the medicine?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or what's most effective for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, I think, as far as creams or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, creams, tinctures, capsules,
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suppositories.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, suppositories.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are my faves.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do enjoy smoking it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do edibles as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I find a lot of benefits to just the
oils and the creams for pain, joint pain
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually retired in 2011.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of back pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that really helped
me was smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was so much pain that it hurt if I
sat down.
[SPEAKER_04]: It hurt if I stood up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It hurt if I moved.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was extremely helpful and allowed
me to function on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And little by little, I'm able to work my
way back into training.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm the kind of person that if I'm not
doing martial arts, I'm miserable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get depressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I need that as an outlet for me
physically and creatively.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cannabis has allowed me to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most fun I had is when I start to
learn about different strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa, indicus, hybrids, the percentage
of each one, whether using the tincture or
[SPEAKER_00]: the full spectrum isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a lot of fun to learn all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm just going around saying,
hey, use this cannabis because it's good
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're actually able to break it down
scientifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And say, well, use this right here because
a sativa is going to give you the head
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can stimulate your mental
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or your body's hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a long day at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're sore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on your feet all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swing a little indicus to help you relax
and get you ready for bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think just much like I did with
sports and learning the playbook,
[SPEAKER_00]: I sat there and learned everything I
needed to know about cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sort of figure out a game plan for
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was talking earlier about the
athletes not being able to be paid for the
[SPEAKER_00]: training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that athletes are the big
sounding board for the general public,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially fighters, because everybody
loves the fighters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fighters just, when a fighter walks in the
room, you just want to be his best friend
[SPEAKER_00]: because you know he can kick your ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I think that fighters have the
ability to not only be like the
[SPEAKER_00]: spokespersons forward, but they're
educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just much like they know their sport.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can know cannabis and sort of talk to
the layperson about using it and how to
[SPEAKER_00]: use it and why it's important.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious to find out what they do in
the NFL if you are caught smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: You hit a little bit on it with Gordon,
but what do they do?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the protocols?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what are the protocols in place to
protect the player?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how does that all go down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you get fined.
[SPEAKER_00]: First offense, you get fined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they put you in the substance
abuse program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to pee in a cup every week,
probably like three times a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people go through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you get fined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then second offense, you get a
four-game suspension.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get put into the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to meet with the psychologist
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then third offense, I think it's an
eight-game suspension and a fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could possibly get conduct
detrimental.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it escalates each time you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, Josh Gordon was continually
getting in trouble for smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, he was just always ready to
play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every game, he was there and ready to
play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that cannabis was a huge part
of his ability to be relaxed and
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he moved effortlessly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I swear to God, it's because of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, they don't really want
to get rid of you because you smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have their rules that they have
in place that they have to adhere to,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of, to me, it shows that
they want to allow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can't allow it because of the
back pressure they get from the general
[SPEAKER_00]: public, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they'll prescribe opioids really
quickly.
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the heartbeat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, take this toward all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can that be changed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or how do you see that changing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just got to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The NFL players union has to rally
together behind the people who have the
[SPEAKER_00]: lawsuits against NFL for the damage that's
been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's walking evidence of people in
the community now that are former players
[SPEAKER_00]: that are walking around with pain,
that have problems with their body because
[SPEAKER_00]: of all the opiates they've taken and all
the stuff they put in their body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was a time where I was
playing a game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a really good year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were 14-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were just playing at a high level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was putting DMVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was putting DMSO and ketoprofen on my
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And DMSO is not clear by the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not good for your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the side effects are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably in another 20 years, I'll
probably have another leg growing out of
[SPEAKER_00]: my body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever it took to be on the field,
that's what everybody's mentality is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't lose my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you got this, I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be able to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And players are not going to stand up for
themselves because they're so focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to survive that they're not focused
on what the damage is being done and the
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term effects of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the alumni has to jump back in
and say, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at my body.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 55 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are dying from heart attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's because of all the stuff they put
in their body.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are having dementia at 60,
Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a high prevalence of people who have
brain issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just now sort of rolling out
packages to help with that disability
[SPEAKER_00]: plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of lawsuits still
against the NFL because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that they would just look at
the books and say, if we start allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: people to take CBD, start allowing people
to use cannabis, there's a lot of money
[SPEAKER_00]: that saves us in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, from a business perspective,
I would just look at the brass tacks of
[SPEAKER_00]: the numbers and just say, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably more profitable for us to do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, oh, well, you know,
they're smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're promoting weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's promoting it to the kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say, well, what about all the beer
commercials you have out here?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about all the damn cores you pass
down in the stadium?
[SPEAKER_00]: They see daddy drink all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And daddy gets mad and starts yelling at
mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't see daddy smoke weed and go
and yell at mommy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not being an advocate on that fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, just from plain and simple,
just looking at what's going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they just need to step up and say,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's going to come from the
community, the people who are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: living it, like living in the pain that
are using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to use a proper language when
they're speaking and sort of convince
[SPEAKER_00]: people that this is the right way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That or we get the fighters to go out
there and tell you, if you don't take
[SPEAKER_00]: this, I'm going to kick your ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you queue them up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about the letter?
[SPEAKER_01]: You wrote a letter to the commissioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote a letter to Roger Dale just
stating that, like I said, I'm a nerd.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to learn stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once I started learning and going
through all this information, I had some
[SPEAKER_00]: family members that were going through
chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed the huge benefits of
cannabis with chemotherapy and cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: patients and helping relieve pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, if it can relieve pain
for cancer, then it can relieve pain from
[SPEAKER_00]: a guy that's coming off of an ACL injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the pain, it makes you
apprehensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're apprehensive, you play slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you play slower, you're more
susceptible to getting another injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want you to play fast at a high
level without thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to do that, you have to
disregard your body pain receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put all that in the letter,
stating to Roger Dale, this is the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that we preach in the locker room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, play fast, play hard,
play smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that when you're
concentrating on your injuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you're taking all these
other drugs, it makes you lethargic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you dull, sluggish, moody.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing you want is the quarterback
to be pissed off at you and moody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're not getting the ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say something to him that he doesn't
like in the locker room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go out in the field, and now he's
not throwing the ball to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you wonder why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he's pissed at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is he pissed at you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: His hormones are off because he's taking
all these damn pain meds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm talking to Roger Dale and saying
that there's a huge issue with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the players are looking to fight
these pain problems they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the alumni are suing the NFL
because of all the pain meds they took and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the steroid injections to give them
cortisone shots to their knees that just
[SPEAKER_00]: caused their knees to go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the older players,
they walk like the Frankenstein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sad to see that they didn't have
the same type of opportunities that we do
[SPEAKER_00]: now as far as the medical science involved
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that CBD is going to be the
lifesaver of the NFL when they start
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did take it off the bench
substance list now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBD is off the bench substance list in
the NFL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're able to take CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has to be, I think, hemp-derived,
a leaf, if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the THC levels are still something
that they monitor in the NFL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that once they learn that it's
less of a headache if you allow them to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke weed, then if you take that away
from them, they resort to other ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: curing the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know there's a lot of athletes
that give control for DUIs because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: legal to drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when your body hurts, you're just
going to drink a lot to dull the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then that alcohol stays in your
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next day and the day after that,
now your brain is catching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your body is still catching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going into another week of
pain, bringing the baggage from the week
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that once they learn that
cannabis is the solution as far as helping
[SPEAKER_00]: your body, it's just better overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Roger Goodell didn't respond to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I keep harassing him every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every chance I get, Peter asked me to
come and speak about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, put me on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mention it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's something that we've got to
put pressure on them to see that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are advocating for it,
not because we're potheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what their favorite go-to is,
oh, we're potheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when Trump's like, oh,
it's a witch hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, let's just get down to what it really
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that's going to help
everybody as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start learning about it,
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being more open about it so that we can
get the people that need it the best help
[SPEAKER_00]: they can get that's out there on the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kassim, I had a question for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I mentioned earlier dealing with a
couple NFL teams and seeing these doctors
[SPEAKER_02]: who were kind of excited to be whatever
around whatever, the various teams.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just curious if you can talk as a
player, what did you see in terms of the
[SPEAKER_02]: doctor-patient relationship?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how much were the drugs just being
distributed by the trainers or just there
[SPEAKER_02]: for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how much was there really medical
oversight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much medical oversight.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I got later on in my career,
they did around 2009 to 2011, they stopped
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing certain drugs to be in the locker
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was more of a clearance to
get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No evaluation, a sign, a waiver,
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that was just to cover their
ass, not because they really cared about
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of, it's funny,
the doctor actually feels the power of
[SPEAKER_00]: having multi-million dollar athletes
depend on them for something to make them
[SPEAKER_00]: feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just sort of like the drugs
pusher versus the user kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that some of the doctors really
gloated in the fact that they had that
[SPEAKER_00]: power to, this guy's future hall of famer,
but his knees are hurting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I give him this and he feels good and
he plays good because I gave him his
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's sort of positively unfortunate in
their minds that they're doing the right
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, but they're not seeing the
long-term effects of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just getting the temporary glory
of being the drug pusher as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: your actual medical overseer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The oversight wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a couple of doctors started to
get in trouble where they started to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually look into the books and see
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it became more of a pressing issue,
especially after concussion issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started looking at medical overall as
a whole in the league.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think now it's a little more
regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little less that they give,
but it's still opiate based.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that they just,
the drug companies, I think, give them
[SPEAKER_00]: direct access to the locker rooms and they
just give them the products and it's in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you're up here, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems to me, just from my simplistic
way of looking at it, that it's kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: like a two-pronged attack that needs to
take place of changing the perspective,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also battling all the money with Big
Pharma and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: How realistic is it in the NFL,
for example, of changing the way that they
[SPEAKER_04]: deal with things like cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I think there's a structural problem
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The money is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about the greed of Big Pharma 15,
20 years ago, but we don't talk about how
[SPEAKER_02]: much Big Pharma is still spending to keep
the pressure on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do think it needs to be a
multi-pronged attack.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking earlier about public
awareness and advocacy, but I also do
[SPEAKER_02]: think, going to the courts, we've seen how
effective that was in the concussion
[SPEAKER_02]: litigation in the NFL.
[SPEAKER_02]: We currently have these opioid lawsuits
that are going to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think actually drawing attention,
whether it's former players, wherever it
[SPEAKER_02]: is, drawing attention using the courts is
just another critical way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think it's going to be a constant
battle because there is no lobby in this
[SPEAKER_02]: country spending more money and throwing
more people at favorable treatment than
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was actually part of a MedMed
commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was going to be the first cannabis
commercial ever on TV, but the networks
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't allow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's because some of the other
pharmaceutical companies that have their
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial ring on the same platforms
didn't like the separation and how it was
[SPEAKER_00]: shot, because the commercial was shot to
show you the laws that have happened
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the course of our country's
history and also how medical marijuana and
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational cannabis also are
contributing to the tax platform and
[SPEAKER_00]: reshaping the way we think about what the
normal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it normal to be drugged up on these
drugs that, if you look at Humira,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got 10,000 side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're going to fix this problem
and give me 10,000 other problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in my head, that's what I'm
thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what a lot of people are going
to start to see once they realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is a better solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see pharmaceutical
companies spending money on
[SPEAKER_00]: counter-attacks to try to suppress that
information, because I see it happening
[SPEAKER_00]: now where I'm in the brokering space,
the brokering of the commodities in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you see a lot of pharmaceutical
companies have their misinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was misinformation about CBD
coming from China.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, oh, there's metals in it,
or it's bad, or it's fentanyl,
[SPEAKER_00]: or it's contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: In actuality, it was testing out at a
higher percentage than the domestic
[SPEAKER_00]: product was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was just a way for them to ensure
that the market wouldn't be flooded with
[SPEAKER_00]: more product that can compete with their
medicines that they're trying to peddle
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was going to say, we're going to
see the flip come as soon as the DEA,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Controlled Substances Act,
changes and makes cannabis a Schedule II
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled substance, and big
pharmaceuticals can start acquiring all
[SPEAKER_02]: these cannabis startups.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when we're going to see the flip
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But until then, exactly as you say,
we're just seeing one impediment after
[SPEAKER_02]: another.
[SPEAKER_02]: How close is that to happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a dangerous question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been hearing a rumor that the Trump
administration is saving a Hail Mary or
[SPEAKER_02]: not, but for the pre-election,
pre-2020, to make a change in the status.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most people think it's going to be
within the next, we're not more than five
[SPEAKER_02]: years away.
[SPEAKER_02]: But another piece that's important to
remember is that the legal infrastructure
[SPEAKER_02]: that criminalizes cannabis, it starts with
the Controlled Substances Act,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's also the Bank Secrecy Act,
and it's a whole series of federal laws
[SPEAKER_02]: that need to change to create an
environment in which cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: normalized for every other form of
medicine in this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a super conspiracy theorist,
and I swear that the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: companies are in cahoots with the
scheduling process in order to prevent it
[SPEAKER_00]: from going to Schedule II until they have
their patents that they're designing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you can corner the market
before it becomes a market, then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: already light years ahead of every other
small company that can come in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: try to take over market share.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that a lot of companies,
GW Pharmaceutical was the one that went
[SPEAKER_00]: and came up with Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're light years ahead of everybody
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other companies that are trying to
compete with them are going to try to sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of stall the ability for the rest of the
small people to come in and get patents on
[SPEAKER_00]: items so that they can get the patents
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you roll out the market, and then
they're able to corner it like they are
[SPEAKER_00]: cornering the opiate market.
[SPEAKER_04]: How strong are the lobbying efforts on the
cannabis side of things?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of work to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, the cannabis community just
hasn't put the money and put the people in
[SPEAKER_02]: place for the kind of lobbying that we
need.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's certainly a huge effort that we
still need.
[SPEAKER_02]: To some extent, in the various state
capitals, it's getting better,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why, for me, talking about the
opioid crisis is a way of sort of forcing
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you ask why did Congress
finally turn on hemp-sourced cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: in the Farm Bill, I don't think it was
great activist lobbying by the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: community as much as it was just the
absurdity, the tragedy of keeping people
[SPEAKER_02]: from doing research that needs to be done
and blocking access to a therapeutic at a
[SPEAKER_02]: time when people are dying from opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you rather see de-scheduling or
re-scheduling?
[SPEAKER_02]: De-scheduling or re-scheduling is a huge
... It depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you on the medical?
[SPEAKER_02]: The adult use community, obviously,
the push for recreational cannabis is a
[SPEAKER_02]: move for de-scheduling, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Treating cannabis like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, I spend a lot of time working
on the medical therapeutic uses,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't know why we can't have both.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would like to see cannabis treated
as serious medicine because I think that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going to put the funding,
whether it's academic medical centers or
[SPEAKER_02]: big pharma, putting the money into really
understanding and unlocking the potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, I'm a re-scheduling fan,
but I realize there's room for multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: viewpoints.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be a de-scheduling fan just to the
fact that, for the banking aspect of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of good people that have
good companies that are doing good
[SPEAKER_00]: business to put good product out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scheduling is what's causing the
banking issues because these federally
[SPEAKER_00]: insured banks are not allowed to,
under the Bank Secretariat Act,
[SPEAKER_00]: to deal with cannabis companies and the
CBD companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though CBD is 50 state legal,
it's still being treated as if it's THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of misinformation or
apprehension in order to prevent people
[SPEAKER_00]: from getting their traditional bank
accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can really see a positive
growth in our GDP with de-scheduling,
[SPEAKER_00]: because then if you're able to de-schedule
it, then banks can go and accept that
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get the tax revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get businesses that are up and
running.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have employment that goes up because
there's more jobs, more bud tenders out
[SPEAKER_00]: there to be able to help you get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be a good thing for the
community as a whole.
[SPEAKER_05]: They talk about the children as one of the
reasons why football players maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: shouldn't have access to THC, like that
stigma around it, because they view you as
[SPEAKER_05]: heroes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually think that there's an
opportunity to talk about teenagers that
[SPEAKER_05]: play sports that, like football,
like MMA, they have a developing brain and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's getting injured.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are your views on cannabis or CBD use
in teenagers that are getting head
[SPEAKER_05]: injuries?
[SPEAKER_05]: Should we be giving CBD to varsity
football players?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that was one of the concerns
that they were talking about, was the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's teenagers that are using it
and does it cause issues, psychosocial
[SPEAKER_00]: issues or mental health issues involved
with use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the apprehension was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The statement I think they said was the
brain is still developing, so it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: react the same way as a mature brain does
with THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what their conclusion was on
that, but if you're going to play
[SPEAKER_00]: football, I had guys when I was in high
school that were smoking weed that were
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the fastest on the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were always on the field and they
were playing and they were good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their grades weren't good because they
weren't putting the effort in class
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were knuckleheads,
but I don't think it was because of weed
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally think that there's younger
adults who may have a benefit from using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, whether it be CBD or THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a proponent for it because I think
that if you're going to do the damage and
[SPEAKER_00]: if there's a way to fix it, then it should
also be offered too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a tricky one because we get into
the medical aspects of it of how does it
[SPEAKER_04]: affect a developing brain and all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know enough about that,
but I think like anything else,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's how it's used and how responsible
they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a big proponent for young kids
hitting each other in the head full on,
[SPEAKER_04]: getting ready to be a mixed martial
artist, but I think that should probably
[SPEAKER_04]: come a little bit later, again,
because of the developing brain.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a tricky one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been playing football since I was 12
years old, so I can't even count how many
[SPEAKER_00]: concussions I probably had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you guys very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will get this video out there in front
of Roger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
