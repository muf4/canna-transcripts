[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to go ahead and bring the
hearing to order.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome to the joint legislative hearing
of the assembly committees on government
[SPEAKER_11]: organization, business, and professions
and health to provide an overview of
[SPEAKER_11]: vaping, tobacco, and cannabis products,
health effects, and deficiencies in
[SPEAKER_11]: regulation and current law.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to begin by welcoming the
committee members and thanking them for
[SPEAKER_11]: being here, our witnesses, and certainly
the general public for your attendance
[SPEAKER_11]: today.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to thank the staff from the
respective committees for putting together
[SPEAKER_11]: an in-depth agenda on this important and
timely topic.
[SPEAKER_11]: This joint informational hearing will be
the first of two hearings on the subject
[SPEAKER_11]: of e-cigarettes and vaping.
[SPEAKER_11]: Today's hearing will provide an overview
of the issues related to vaping,
[SPEAKER_11]: including the health effects and
regulatory landscape with testimony
[SPEAKER_11]: provided by medical professionals,
tobacco and vaping experts, and state
[SPEAKER_11]: government regulators.
[SPEAKER_11]: The hearing will also look into the
growing popularity of e-cigarettes and
[SPEAKER_11]: vaping and examine the overall impact on
youth and general consumers.
[SPEAKER_11]: E-cigarettes and vaping devices with $7
billion in annual sales have become part
[SPEAKER_11]: of a daily life for millions of Americans.
[SPEAKER_11]: Vaping has risen dramatically in
popularity around the world from 7 million
[SPEAKER_11]: users in 2011 to over 35 million users
today.
[SPEAKER_11]: As this happens, traditional tobacco
smoking rates continue to decline.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, recent studies have found that
more than half of American adult
[SPEAKER_11]: e-cigarette users are under 35 years of
age, fueling concern about the popularity
[SPEAKER_11]: of vaping among young people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Youth access and use has skyrocketed with
the proliferation of flavors attractive to
[SPEAKER_11]: teenagers such as bazooka, Joe bubble gum,
cotton candy, and gummy bears.
[SPEAKER_11]: Federal statistics show a significant
increase in vaping among teens between
[SPEAKER_11]: 2017 and 2018.
[SPEAKER_11]: More than one in four high school students
reported vaping in the past month,
[SPEAKER_11]: up from one in five students in 2018.
[SPEAKER_11]: E-cigarette use among middle school
students has also increased.
[SPEAKER_11]: Federal health officials are calling this
troubling trend an epidemic and fear that
[SPEAKER_11]: teenagers who vape will eventually start
smoking.
[SPEAKER_11]: But now, as a legislature, we're not only
faced with the issues of rapid rise in
[SPEAKER_11]: teen e-cigarette use, but a national
outbreak of mysterious lung injury cases
[SPEAKER_11]: associated with the use of vaping
products.
[SPEAKER_11]: The CDC now reports there have been 1,300
vaping illnesses and at least 26
[SPEAKER_11]: nationwide linked to the use of
e-cigarettes and vaping.
[SPEAKER_11]: There were no more than 200 new cases
reported just last week, and the CDC told
[SPEAKER_11]: Congress this morning that these
statistics are unfortunately expected to
[SPEAKER_11]: increase considerably in the near future.
[SPEAKER_11]: The median age of deceased patients was 49
years old.
[SPEAKER_11]: The range was from 17 to 75 years old.
[SPEAKER_11]: According to recent findings by the CDC,
most of the patients impacted by these
[SPEAKER_11]: illnesses reported using THC-containing
products, suggesting THC products are
[SPEAKER_11]: playing a role in these illnesses.
[SPEAKER_11]: That said, some patients have reported
using both THC products and nicotine
[SPEAKER_11]: products, as well as a smaller number
reported using only nicotine products.
[SPEAKER_11]: Similar testing on the samples collected
or received by the FDA shows a variety of
[SPEAKER_11]: products or product components,
with different ingredients or delivery
[SPEAKER_11]: systems making this investigation
especially challenging.
[SPEAKER_11]: Authorities are still gathering
information, but according to recent
[SPEAKER_11]: reports, patients with the conditions seem
to be overwhelmingly male, around 70
[SPEAKER_11]: percent, with 80 percent of patients under
age 35.
[SPEAKER_11]: According to the CDC, their investigation
is ongoing, and no single brand,
[SPEAKER_11]: product, substance, or additive has been
linked to all cases.
[SPEAKER_11]: While the cause of the outbreak remains
unknown, the CDC warns against the use of
[SPEAKER_11]: any e-cigarette or any vaping product.
[SPEAKER_11]: Aside from the recent lung illnesses
outbreak, the long-term health effects of
[SPEAKER_11]: continued e-cigarette and vaping use
remain unknown as the scientific community
[SPEAKER_11]: continues to study the health hazards
posed by these technology.
[SPEAKER_11]: Bottom line, we still do not have all the
answers, but as a legislature we must get
[SPEAKER_11]: a grasp on the multiple cases surrounding
e-cigarettes and vaping.
[SPEAKER_11]: We must consider the health and safety
concerns, impacts on youth, black market
[SPEAKER_11]: and enforcement issues, and areas of
inadequate state regulation and oversight.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to identify where existing efforts
have failed, and discuss expert
[SPEAKER_11]: recommendations to reverse the deeply
concerning epidemic of youth e-cigarette
[SPEAKER_11]: use and vaping use, impacting children and
families across California.
[SPEAKER_11]: Today we will serve as an opportunity to
establish a consistent set of facts,
[SPEAKER_11]: so that we're all operating off the same
set of facts, and highlight the best
[SPEAKER_11]: available information we currently have.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would now ask Chairman Low for his
opening remarks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Mr. Chair,
and again, thank you very much to the
[SPEAKER_03]: collective work of our respective
committees, and forming this and putting
[SPEAKER_03]: this together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that this is just the beginning of
the conversation that we have to be as
[SPEAKER_03]: responsive to consumer protection and the
constituencies that we represent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Similarly, within the respect of business
and professions, you hit it on the head,
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Chair, but in regards to the state of
California and cannabis, part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: crisis on vaping is with respect to the
failure of the regulatory system to which
[SPEAKER_03]: the legal access to quality regulated
cannabis products throughout the state is
[SPEAKER_03]: relatively limited.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, as we well know, roughly three
quarters of cities and counties have
[SPEAKER_03]: banned licensed cannabis retailers,
ceding those areas to unlicensed,
[SPEAKER_03]: unregulated, untaxed, and untested illicit
market operators.
[SPEAKER_03]: Similarly, we also know that the
identifying root causes and impacts of
[SPEAKER_03]: these illness will have an impact on those
responsible actors within the legal and
[SPEAKER_03]: the illicit market, and we need to hold
them respectfully to account.
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, we are looking at what to
do to protect individuals in the
[SPEAKER_03]: marketplace and average Californians.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may also be of consideration that we
explore a moratorium on additives,
[SPEAKER_03]: which appears to reflect industry's best
practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, as a state, are a port of entry for a
lot of vaping supplies of the United
[SPEAKER_03]: States, and I know that we have a
particular important role with respect to
[SPEAKER_03]: the industry as a large state and the
nation's supply chain of the illicit
[SPEAKER_03]: marketplace in both cannabis and nicotine
vaping products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I very much look forward to the
testimony from our public representatives
[SPEAKER_03]: and look forward to the continued
conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much to the chairs here,
and I think Chairman Gray actually framed
[SPEAKER_07]: this discussion very, very well as a
starting point.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll be brief.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really want to hear from our experts
this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do have some comments.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the explosion in popularity of
e-cigarettes, e-cigarette use has been a
[SPEAKER_07]: problem for some time, with staggering
numbers of youth becoming addicted to
[SPEAKER_07]: nicotine.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the last several weeks, it's become all
too clear that we have a much bigger
[SPEAKER_07]: problem on our hands with the outbreak of
lung illness and injuries and death and
[SPEAKER_07]: the questions around exactly what's
causing this.
[SPEAKER_07]: My colleagues and I are committed to
working on all aspects of this issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: As you've heard, this hearing is just a
first step.
[SPEAKER_07]: I break this into two different,
in my mind, the way I look at this,
[SPEAKER_07]: and there are many aspects to this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am concerned about, one, the number of
young people that are starting to vape,
[SPEAKER_07]: period, whether it's nicotine or THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two, the illness that we're facing,
the public health crisis that we're facing
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think as we start hearing about
this, I think those are separate issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: In many ways, there is some crossover,
but that's how my weird compartmentalized
[SPEAKER_07]: mind works.
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that, I'm happy to introduce our
first panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd ask them to please come up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Eliza Tong and Kimberly Vagadori,
who will give us an overview of the vaping
[SPEAKER_07]: and e-cigarette industry and discuss the
prevalence of products use.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you in advance.
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_36]: Dear assembly members, my name is Eliza
Tong, and I am speaking today as a
[SPEAKER_36]: practicing physician and tobacco research
expert.
[SPEAKER_36]: For identification purposes, I work at
University of California Davis.
[SPEAKER_36]: Today, Ms. Homer Vagadori from the
California Youth Advocacy Network and I
[SPEAKER_36]: will share some brief background
information about understanding the new
[SPEAKER_36]: vaping epidemic for California The word
epidemic has been used for years to
[SPEAKER_36]: describe how tobacco is the leading
preventable cause of death.
[SPEAKER_36]: Now the word epidemic is being used for
vaping with the sharp rise in youth rates,
[SPEAKER_36]: the massive proliferation of products,
and shocking new cases of
[SPEAKER_36]: vaping-associated pulmonary injury and
deaths.
[SPEAKER_36]: First, I'll highlight some key points for
the regulatory and health landscape.
[SPEAKER_36]: Next, Ms. Homer Vagadori will highlight
the impact on youth and young adults.
[SPEAKER_36]: This is what I call my greatest hit
slides.
[SPEAKER_36]: But looking back, lessons from the past
about marketing and science are important
[SPEAKER_36]: for understanding what is going on today.
[SPEAKER_36]: So in the 50s and 60s, when scientific
studies that first started linking smoking
[SPEAKER_36]: cigarettes to lung cancer emerged,
the tobacco company started running these
[SPEAKER_36]: historic advertorials called a frank
statement to cigarette smokers to create
[SPEAKER_36]: doubt by disputing the study findings,
saying experiments with mice were not
[SPEAKER_36]: regarded as conclusive for lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_36]: They also ran ads showing doctors here
promoting products.
[SPEAKER_36]: They also stated they'd believe their
products were not injurious to health and
[SPEAKER_36]: that they would cooperate for public
health.
[SPEAKER_36]: And then growing over time, all the
scientific evidence 10 years later,
[SPEAKER_36]: it took the first landmark Surgeon
General's report in 1964 to synthesize all
[SPEAKER_36]: that biological and epidemiological
evidence, concluding that smoking does
[SPEAKER_36]: indeed cause lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_36]: Subsequently, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_36]: Congress adopted laws for health warnings
on cigarette packages and advertising bans
[SPEAKER_36]: in the broadcast media.
[SPEAKER_36]: However, tobacco control work continues
today at the Centers for Disease Control
[SPEAKER_36]: states due to the quote, the addictive
nature of tobacco and powerful economic
[SPEAKER_36]: forces promoting its use.
[SPEAKER_36]: Now in the 70s, 80s, the next couple
decades, the industry started trying to
[SPEAKER_36]: develop and market new products as less
harmful to smokers.
[SPEAKER_36]: But it was actually the evidence that
non-smokers could also be harmed that had
[SPEAKER_36]: the most impact.
[SPEAKER_36]: Some folks in the room may not have been
alive during this time, but that
[SPEAKER_36]: advertisement on the left-hand side with
the disco lady shows that the industry
[SPEAKER_36]: sold low tar cigarettes, mild,
light, ultralight cigarettes as less
[SPEAKER_36]: harmful because we knew that tar caused
cancer when it was painted on the backs of
[SPEAKER_36]: mice.
[SPEAKER_36]: Maybe this was a way to get less cancer.
[SPEAKER_36]: However, these cigarettes were also
machine tested for lower levels of tar,
[SPEAKER_36]: but that's not really what happened when
people actually used these products.
[SPEAKER_36]: So it did not actually reduce the health
risks of smoking and it took us years to
[SPEAKER_36]: figure that out.
[SPEAKER_36]: So in real life, smokers could change
their way they smoke because they were
[SPEAKER_36]: trying to get a lot more nicotine and they
could actually get the same amount of
[SPEAKER_36]: chemicals or even more than the
machine-based numbers suggested.
[SPEAKER_36]: So as time went on in the mid-1980s,
the Surgeon General came out with a report
[SPEAKER_36]: on the growing, again, the growing
scientific evidence that second-hand smoke
[SPEAKER_36]: exposure caused harm to non-smokers and,
in fact, caused lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_36]: This evidence helped stimulate a broad
array of change from if some of you in the
[SPEAKER_36]: room may remember, no smoking sections,
which people jokingly say is like having a
[SPEAKER_36]: no-peeing section in a pool because it
doesn't really work, to now what we have
[SPEAKER_36]: for smoke-free policies that protect
non-smokers.
[SPEAKER_36]: So in California, we are very fortunate
that in 1999, with our first tobacco tax,
[SPEAKER_36]: that we created a comprehensive tobacco
control program to change social norms
[SPEAKER_36]: around smoking, reduce product
availability, and protect public health.
[SPEAKER_36]: Instead of only focusing on treating
individual smokers, this approach has been
[SPEAKER_36]: widely recognized internationally as one
of the greatest public health successes to
[SPEAKER_36]: this day.
[SPEAKER_36]: Now the 90s to the 2000s were marked by
lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_36]: Whistleblowers helped bring internal
tobacco industry documents to light that
[SPEAKER_36]: were previously protected through
attorney-client privilege.
[SPEAKER_36]: These internal documents were in stark
contrast to the picture in the upper right
[SPEAKER_36]: where the tobacco industry CEOs at the
time testified in front of Congress,
[SPEAKER_36]: I believe nicotine is not addictive.
[SPEAKER_36]: Subsequently, the state attorney generals
sued for Medicaid costs for
[SPEAKER_36]: tobacco-related disease, leading to what
is called as the Master Settlement
[SPEAKER_36]: Agreement.
[SPEAKER_36]: At the federal level in 2006, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_36]: Department of Justice ruled that the
industry violated the racketeering and
[SPEAKER_36]: corrupt influence organization's law,
concluding that the industry, quote,
[SPEAKER_36]: continues to engage in and execute a
50-year scheme to defraud the public on
[SPEAKER_36]: health effects and marketing to children.
[SPEAKER_36]: And then for years afterwards,
the industry argued against federal
[SPEAKER_36]: penalties, and it took over a decade later
in 2017 for them to finally air,
[SPEAKER_36]: quote, corrective court-ordered
statements, some of which are seen on the
[SPEAKER_36]: lower right.
[SPEAKER_36]: And so these ran kind of in late night TV,
black and white.
[SPEAKER_36]: You can still see some of them on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_36]: However, a study showed that only 40% of U
.S.
[SPEAKER_36]: adults were actually aware of these
corrective statements.
[SPEAKER_36]: But the range of what they had to state
included acknowledgment that nicotine was
[SPEAKER_36]: indeed addictive.
[SPEAKER_36]: Low tar, light, ultralight, mild,
and natural cigarettes actually lacked
[SPEAKER_36]: health benefits and were deceptively
marketed as less harmful.
[SPEAKER_36]: Cigarettes were manipulated to maximize
nicotine delivery and that there is no
[SPEAKER_36]: safe level of exposure to secondhand
smoke.
[SPEAKER_36]: So now we come to the Food and Drug
Administration.
[SPEAKER_36]: In 2009, they were given authority to
regulate tobacco products, and this
[SPEAKER_36]: included the manufacturer, distribution,
and marketing of tobacco products.
[SPEAKER_36]: So FDA is supposed to approve that new
products are not worse than cigarettes
[SPEAKER_36]: before they go to market.
[SPEAKER_36]: They're also supposed to approve any
products making cessation or reduced harm
[SPEAKER_36]: claims go through their office as well,
and products like Juul have not done,
[SPEAKER_36]: for example.
[SPEAKER_36]: Flavors and cigarettes have already been
banned through this regulation except for
[SPEAKER_36]: menthol cigarettes due to industry
pressure.
[SPEAKER_36]: However, this led to the rise of new
products.
[SPEAKER_36]: That were not, quote, cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_36]: Some you can see on the far upper right
that did not have to follow rules made for
[SPEAKER_36]: cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_36]: With brown paper wrapping, you could
suddenly have a cigarillo or little cigar,
[SPEAKER_36]: and you don't have to follow the flavor or
packaging rules that were made for
[SPEAKER_36]: cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_36]: Electronic cigarettes were on the rise as
well, but it took years for the FDA to
[SPEAKER_36]: finalize what's called the, quote,
deeming rule to begin regulation.
[SPEAKER_36]: That was in 2016, and the FDA delayed
implementation of that until 2022 for
[SPEAKER_36]: manufacturers to submit information and
improve their products.
[SPEAKER_36]: But now with public pressure, as you all
may well know, this has been moved up to
[SPEAKER_36]: next year.
[SPEAKER_36]: This one's a little bit complicated,
but let me walk you through this.
[SPEAKER_36]: So throughout the years, California's
success story is that cigarette smoking
[SPEAKER_36]: prevalence rates have declined faster than
the rest of the country.
[SPEAKER_36]: But the news now is that vaping and
marijuana use rates are rising,
[SPEAKER_36]: especially in young adults.
[SPEAKER_36]: So this data focuses on the general adult
population, as Ms. Homer Vagadori's going
[SPEAKER_36]: to describe youth and young adults,
since California has a tobacco 21 law not
[SPEAKER_36]: to sell to persons under 21.
[SPEAKER_36]: So the bar chart shows on the far right
that in 2017, our California prevalence
[SPEAKER_36]: for any tobacco use was almost 15%.
[SPEAKER_36]: On the far left, you'll see cigarettes,
that's 10%, and only 3% for vaping that
[SPEAKER_36]: little bar, the second bar from the left.
[SPEAKER_36]: However, younger people who are aged 21 to
29 years old, they vape at much higher
[SPEAKER_36]: rates, with 11% in 2017 and 13% in 2018.
[SPEAKER_36]: End users may use or switch across
multiple tobacco products, and in the US,
[SPEAKER_36]: over half of e-cigarette users are current
smokers.
[SPEAKER_36]: Marijuana use on the right in adults,
especially young people, is also rising,
[SPEAKER_36]: with over one in four young adults over
21.
[SPEAKER_36]: Similarly, co-use of marijuana and tobacco
is rising now with one in eight young
[SPEAKER_36]: adults over 21.
[SPEAKER_36]: So with the slow federal regulatory
landscape for vaping, it's difficult to
[SPEAKER_36]: know what's actually in these e-cigarette
products and their aerosol, despite what
[SPEAKER_36]: they're labeled as.
[SPEAKER_36]: This is a graphic from the CDC,
where they note that products that are
[SPEAKER_36]: marketed as even having no nicotine have
been found to contain nicotine.
[SPEAKER_36]: So studies to date show that this aerosol
is not water vapor, which is what many
[SPEAKER_36]: people think in the public.
[SPEAKER_36]: Instead, this aerosol is a chemical
mixture that can contain propylene glycol,
[SPEAKER_36]: volatile organic compounds, carcinogens,
heavy metals, flavors, and ultrafine
[SPEAKER_36]: particles.
[SPEAKER_36]: Ultrafine particles, for example,
are just some of the substances that can
[SPEAKER_36]: have immediate harmful effects.
[SPEAKER_36]: So all of us who've experienced the
California smoky fires, for example,
[SPEAKER_36]: or freeway air pollution, those things
are, the ultrafine particles are known to
[SPEAKER_36]: cause inflammation that's important for
heart and lung function in particular.
[SPEAKER_36]: Even if some products contain less of
these harmful ingredients, the CDC has
[SPEAKER_36]: underscored this does not mean it is a
safe product.
[SPEAKER_36]: There is, in fact, no safe tobacco
product.
[SPEAKER_36]: We've already learned that low tar
cigarettes, as defined by a machine,
[SPEAKER_36]: doesn't mean it's a safer product.
[SPEAKER_36]: We are still learning how heating and
inhaling chemicals in these products
[SPEAKER_36]: affect the human body.
[SPEAKER_36]: So despite having been banned in
cigarettes, flavors and their marketing of
[SPEAKER_36]: flavored tobacco products are concerning
for the rise in use and their harmful
[SPEAKER_36]: health effects So just a couple examples
here.
[SPEAKER_36]: So menthol has been most notably been
targeted towards the African-American
[SPEAKER_36]: community contributing to tobacco-related
health disparities.
[SPEAKER_36]: Beyond being just a flavor preference,
the growing evidence about menthol is that
[SPEAKER_36]: its numbing properties make it easier to
initiate and inhale.
[SPEAKER_36]: Its chemical properties make it harder to
quit because it's actually working on the
[SPEAKER_36]: nicotine receptors.
[SPEAKER_36]: And there's an associated carcinogen with
these oils called polygons.
[SPEAKER_36]: And there's a recent JAMA article that
says there are levels that are higher,
[SPEAKER_36]: way higher in e-cigarettes than actually
what's in regular cigarettes or also FDA
[SPEAKER_36]: levels for food.
[SPEAKER_36]: And it's been banned as a food additive,
as a synthetic chemical.
[SPEAKER_36]: Other flavors that are appealing to
children include fruit candy or sweet
[SPEAKER_36]: flavors, as has been noted.
[SPEAKER_36]: But these have safety standards that are
meant for eating, not for inhaling.
[SPEAKER_36]: Growing evidence shows that these flavors
by themselves and in combination can harm
[SPEAKER_36]: health, such as with lung function,
blood vessel cells and white blood cells,
[SPEAKER_36]: which is important for your immunity.
[SPEAKER_36]: Dicetyl, which is found in three quarters
of e-liquids, is associated with
[SPEAKER_36]: bronchiolitis obliterans and irreversible
lung disease described in workers from
[SPEAKER_36]: butter popcorn factories.
[SPEAKER_36]: So the high potency of nicotine levels and
marijuana's psychoactive component,
[SPEAKER_36]: THC, in these vaping products is really
alarming.
[SPEAKER_36]: In fact, the Surgeon General has released
warnings to young adults for both of these
[SPEAKER_36]: components because the developing brain is
especially vulnerable through age 25.
[SPEAKER_36]: Nicotine itself is not harmless with
potential for cardiovascular effects,
[SPEAKER_36]: seizures, and even poisonings.
[SPEAKER_36]: It's used in pesticides.
[SPEAKER_36]: With vaping, new nicotine salts and
e-liquids have high bioavailability and
[SPEAKER_36]: are more easily absorbed with less aerosol
than regular cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_36]: And regular cigarettes, the industry had
used ammonia to basically free base higher
[SPEAKER_36]: levels of nicotine to be absorbed in your
body.
[SPEAKER_36]: In fact, that diagram on the right is from
the CDC and it shows one small Juul pod of
[SPEAKER_36]: e-juice contains at least as much nicotine
as one pack of cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_36]: But again, as noted, it may be even
higher, depending on how you use it.
[SPEAKER_36]: Newer products that you have even higher
e-liquid concentrations of nicotine may be
[SPEAKER_36]: from refillables.
[SPEAKER_36]: And as more people vape marijuana,
the Surgeon General has put out a warning
[SPEAKER_36]: that THC concentrations have increased
three fold over the past couple decades.
[SPEAKER_36]: So these health effects of vaping,
these high potency nicotine and marijuana
[SPEAKER_36]: products including in combination and how
heating might be different than burning,
[SPEAKER_36]: this is all learning for everyone
including the medical profession and this
[SPEAKER_36]: is an ongoing natural experiment in
humans.
[SPEAKER_36]: So as mentioned, now this past summer with
the vaping associated pulmonary injury,
[SPEAKER_36]: all this combination of the Ryzen vaping,
nicotine, and marijuana has brought us to
[SPEAKER_36]: this stage.
[SPEAKER_36]: So every week the CDC is reporting more
cases.
[SPEAKER_36]: So as mentioned earlier, 1,300 cases,
over 100 cases in California, 26 deaths
[SPEAKER_36]: including three in California,
King County, Tulare County, and LA County.
[SPEAKER_36]: And this isn't just a youth problem
because the median age of death is 49
[SPEAKER_36]: years old and the range is 17 to 75.
[SPEAKER_36]: And again, the CDC states no single
product or substance has been linked to
[SPEAKER_36]: all cases.
[SPEAKER_36]: Although most reported vaping THC,
it's only about a third exclusively and
[SPEAKER_36]: well over half reported vaping nicotine.
[SPEAKER_36]: So the CDC has come out to say to the
public, people should not use vaping
[SPEAKER_36]: products with THC.
[SPEAKER_36]: Consider that as well for nicotine
products also.
[SPEAKER_36]: Other recommendations are not to buy
vaping products off the street or modify
[SPEAKER_36]: or add substances.
[SPEAKER_36]: However, many people get their products
socially from others so it's hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_36]: Regardless of the investigation,
the CDC emphasizes that young people
[SPEAKER_36]: pregnant women and never should not vape.
[SPEAKER_36]: There is no safe tobacco product use and
THC is associated with a wide range of
[SPEAKER_36]: health effects, especially in heavy users
and we're still learning about that to
[SPEAKER_36]: this day.
[SPEAKER_36]: It's worth noting also that secondhand
smoke exposure in nonsmokers has become an
[SPEAKER_36]: increasingly important issue.
[SPEAKER_36]: So the CDC image on the left describes how
the Surgeon General has concluded that
[SPEAKER_36]: aerosol from vaping can contain harmful
substances and use in public places
[SPEAKER_36]: undermines existing protections for
non-users.
[SPEAKER_36]: Back in 2006, there was a Surgeon
General's report that concluded there is
[SPEAKER_36]: no risk-free level of exposure to
secondhand smoke in non-users.
[SPEAKER_36]: This is especially important for heart and
lung health.
[SPEAKER_36]: And on the right hand side is an image
from California's tobacco control programs
[SPEAKER_36]: new secondhand dangers campaign where they
describe over the past two years,
[SPEAKER_36]: secondhand marijuana exposure has
increased by 86%.
[SPEAKER_36]: Secondhand vape exposure has increased by
67%.
[SPEAKER_36]: And it's worth noting also that 30% of
California youth in 2018 also report
[SPEAKER_36]: exposure to secondhand smoke, vapor and
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_36]: So these smoke and tobacco-free policies
that protect public health now need to
[SPEAKER_36]: consider vaping including marijuana.
[SPEAKER_36]: So wrapping up, smoking cessation has a
strong evidence base that it works.
[SPEAKER_36]: Counseling support and medications can
help people quit for good.
[SPEAKER_36]: However, it's because of the highly
addictive nature of nicotine it can take
[SPEAKER_36]: at least 8 to 12 really good attempts for
someone to quit for good.
[SPEAKER_36]: And providers are told they should ask
about tobacco use and exposure,
[SPEAKER_36]: advise to quit and advise about health
harms and refer to counseling support and
[SPEAKER_36]: offer medications.
[SPEAKER_36]: We are still trying to learn what to do
about vaping.
[SPEAKER_36]: It's not even a requirement for us to ask
about vaping.
[SPEAKER_36]: But our state quit line now, the
California Smokers Helpline at UC San
[SPEAKER_36]: Diego, they have now stepped up as our
free statewide resource to help not only
[SPEAKER_36]: help people quit smoking but also with
vaping and this includes for teens.
[SPEAKER_36]: There are seven FDA approved tobacco
cessation aids to assist with nicotine
[SPEAKER_36]: withdrawal symptoms over two to three
months.
[SPEAKER_36]: And most people are familiar with the
nicotine patch, lozenge or gum.
[SPEAKER_36]: But there are also other faster acting
modalities like the nasal spray and
[SPEAKER_36]: inhaler, none of which are meant to go
into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_36]: This is like the back of your throat and
cheek absorption.
[SPEAKER_36]: And none of these are meant to be for long
term either.
[SPEAKER_36]: So when the US e-cigarettes are not
approved as a smoking cessation,
[SPEAKER_36]: it's not even a requirement for us to ask
about vaping.
[SPEAKER_36]: So we are still trying to learn what to do
about vaping.
[SPEAKER_36]: So with that, I'll transition to Ms. Homer
Bagidori.
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you so much for the opportunity to
speak today.
[SPEAKER_27]: My name is Kim Homer Bagidori and I'm with
an organization that works statewide on
[SPEAKER_27]: tobacco control issues with youth and
young adults.
[SPEAKER_27]: And we also work with all of our colleges
and universities in the state on smoke and
[SPEAKER_27]: tobacco free policy initiatives.
[SPEAKER_27]: Today I'm going to highlight and summarize
for you the national and state data we
[SPEAKER_27]: have on youth and young adult use.
[SPEAKER_27]: I do want to note that this is tobacco
heavy because that's my area of expertise,
[SPEAKER_27]: but it's also what we have a lot of
research on.
[SPEAKER_27]: So looking at current use, we know at the
national level that we saw our peak in
[SPEAKER_27]: youth vaping in 2015.
[SPEAKER_27]: And we started to go down in 2016 with a
slight uptick in 2017.
[SPEAKER_27]: Much of this is due to the types of
devices that were available on the market.
[SPEAKER_27]: Prior to the new devices that we have,
we like to say there were three types of
[SPEAKER_27]: products.
[SPEAKER_27]: Cigalikes are the first.
[SPEAKER_27]: They look just like little cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_27]: The second are the vape pens, which now
we're hearing from young people are really
[SPEAKER_27]: only being used as wax pens to vape THC
solutions.
[SPEAKER_27]: And then the third were the mods in the
tanks.
[SPEAKER_27]: And part of the challenges with these
products were they were not very good at
[SPEAKER_27]: delivering nicotine solution.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so individuals were not getting
satiated when using them and trying to use
[SPEAKER_27]: them other than other tobacco products.
[SPEAKER_27]: In 2018, that all changed with the
introduction of the new pod-based
[SPEAKER_27]: products.
[SPEAKER_27]: There are two things that changed with
these products.
[SPEAKER_27]: The first was the size of the device,
which is very problematic for young people
[SPEAKER_27]: because they're easy to hide.
[SPEAKER_27]: And because they're also smaller,
the batteries are smaller, there's less
[SPEAKER_27]: aerosol that is emitted from them.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so they're very, very difficult to
detect.
[SPEAKER_27]: The second was the type of solutions
that's in these products.
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's a nicotine solution.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a salt solution.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's easier to consume, and it's
significantly higher in nicotine solutions
[SPEAKER_27]: than the other products before these.
[SPEAKER_27]: These are the products that young people
have been using, and these are the
[SPEAKER_27]: products that are responsible for this
epidemic that we are now recognizing at
[SPEAKER_27]: the national level.
[SPEAKER_27]: So within a one-year period, we saw an
increase of one and a half million
[SPEAKER_27]: students, youth students, who increased
their use of these products with vaping.
[SPEAKER_27]: And the greatest increase was seen among
high school students.
[SPEAKER_27]: Looking at the recent data that was
released from the national government,
[SPEAKER_27]: this is preliminary data, and more will be
coming soon, but it's showing that we are
[SPEAKER_27]: continuing to see an increase in youth
vaping of tobacco products.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so in 2018, when the alarms went off,
we saw an increase up to almost 21% that
[SPEAKER_27]: has jumped again to nearly 28%,
and this is past 30-day use.
[SPEAKER_27]: So this is not ever used.
[SPEAKER_27]: This is regular 30-day use.
[SPEAKER_27]: What's also troubling is the types of
products that young people are using.
[SPEAKER_27]: So we know in 2016, there were over 15,000
unique flavors of vaping devices on the
[SPEAKER_27]: market, and we know that young people were
most likely to use candy-flavored or
[SPEAKER_27]: fruit-flavored, but in 2019, we've seen a
jump of young people using mint and
[SPEAKER_27]: mentholated products.
[SPEAKER_27]: So we have a lot to celebrate with our
cigarette smoking.
[SPEAKER_27]: We've done some phenomenal work to get us
down to 2%.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's a historic low, but that is not the
same with all tobacco products.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so specifically looking in California,
the data in 2018, which we saw as much as
[SPEAKER_27]: we're dealing with right now, data a year
ago can be archaic when we're dealing with
[SPEAKER_27]: this problem, but what we have is nearly
11% of teens reported past 30-day use of
[SPEAKER_27]: vaping devices, and you can see with the
yellow in this chart the majority of the
[SPEAKER_27]: products that are being used, regardless
if it's vaping or another tobacco product,
[SPEAKER_27]: is a flavored product.
[SPEAKER_27]: Data from the California Student Tobacco
Survey also shows that youth use of
[SPEAKER_27]: marijuana is high.
[SPEAKER_27]: So there was not any significant changes
from 2016 to 2018 in use, but it's
[SPEAKER_27]: important to note that marijuana use among
teens is still higher than tobacco use and
[SPEAKER_27]: also higher than e-cigarette use.
[SPEAKER_27]: The survey, the questions that were asked
on the survey asked students who reported
[SPEAKER_27]: vaping what types of products they vaped,
and they did ask if they vaped THC
[SPEAKER_27]: solutions, and 21%, close to 22% of teens
did report vaping THC products in
[SPEAKER_27]: California.
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, looking at young adults, we see a
similar trend in that cigarette smoking is
[SPEAKER_27]: going down, e-cigarette use is going up,
and marijuana use has gone up
[SPEAKER_27]: significantly.
[SPEAKER_27]: We, again, have been successful in trying
to reduce combustible products,
[SPEAKER_27]: but the same can't be said for vaping
devices.
[SPEAKER_27]: What's interesting, and I've been working
with colleges and universities for over 18
[SPEAKER_27]: years, is that for a long time we've been
seeing the use of tobacco use rates go
[SPEAKER_27]: down with college students, so we can
predict that if somebody does not go to
[SPEAKER_27]: college, that their likelihood of smoking
cigarette is higher than somebody who is
[SPEAKER_27]: in college.
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, that has been completely reversed by
this trend in vaping.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so college students now have
significantly higher rates of vaping
[SPEAKER_27]: nicotine solutions and vaping marijuana
products than individuals who do not go to
[SPEAKER_27]: college.
[SPEAKER_27]: One challenge with this specifically,
too, is that our colleges and
[SPEAKER_27]: universities, many in California which are
now smoke and tobacco free, have an influx
[SPEAKER_27]: of students who are addicted to these
products who are now going to their
[SPEAKER_27]: campuses and are in need of support to
help them quit.
[SPEAKER_27]: They're going to smoke and tobacco free
campuses, but our K through 12 campuses
[SPEAKER_27]: are smoking tobacco free and young people
are still using these products.
[SPEAKER_27]: So when we look at literature specific to
why young people use tobacco products and
[SPEAKER_27]: specifically vape, we have evidence that
shows that young people vape because it's
[SPEAKER_27]: their norm.
[SPEAKER_27]: So if their friends are using these
products or if they have family members
[SPEAKER_27]: who use them, they're more likely to use
them.
[SPEAKER_27]: What's interesting is if you talk to a
young person, if you talk to college
[SPEAKER_27]: students, to youth, their perception of
what the use is is significantly higher
[SPEAKER_27]: than what it actually is.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so that makes them believe that it's
completely normalized to use these
[SPEAKER_27]: products.
[SPEAKER_27]: What's interesting, many of the young
people that we work with have not been
[SPEAKER_27]: exposed to secondhand smoke indoors.
[SPEAKER_27]: They've grown up in a smoke-free
California.
[SPEAKER_27]: So the norm of cigarette smoking is not
there.
[SPEAKER_27]: But we've completely reversed that.
[SPEAKER_27]: So we're not going to be able to do that
with vaping because young people are
[SPEAKER_27]: seeing it and they think everybody does
it.
[SPEAKER_27]: If you ever talk to a teen and you ask
them, do you know people that vape,
[SPEAKER_27]: they say, yes, everybody is vaping.
[SPEAKER_27]: Also with flavors.
[SPEAKER_27]: So flavors was a high indicator of why
people are using these products to
[SPEAKER_27]: experiment with flavors.
[SPEAKER_27]: And when we ask, we do focus groups with
young people and we ask them about the
[SPEAKER_27]: products that they use.
[SPEAKER_27]: And all of the young people we talk to say
they use products because of the flavors.
[SPEAKER_27]: They taste good.
[SPEAKER_27]: And flavors in the vaping devices,
but also in combustible products,
[SPEAKER_27]: it masks the harshness of the smoke.
[SPEAKER_27]: And it makes them believe that it's not as
bad.
[SPEAKER_27]: We've had unflavored cigarette products
since 2009 with the exception of
[SPEAKER_27]: mentholated products.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so there's a lot of misperceptions
around the harms of many of these
[SPEAKER_27]: products.
[SPEAKER_27]: And e-cigarettes are also included in
that.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's important to note as well that when
we did our focus groups with youth,
[SPEAKER_27]: while we talk primarily about tobacco,
every conversation we have with a young
[SPEAKER_27]: person wraps back into marijuana.
[SPEAKER_27]: And while young people have mixed feelings
on the safety of e-cigarettes,
[SPEAKER_27]: the majority of young people we talk to
believe that marijuana was completely
[SPEAKER_27]: safe.
[SPEAKER_27]: So another reason for this is the access
to tobacco products.
[SPEAKER_27]: So when Juul started to become popular in
2017-2018, the Truth Initiative did a
[SPEAKER_27]: national study specific to individuals who
had reported Juul use to find out where
[SPEAKER_27]: they were getting these products.
[SPEAKER_27]: And as you can see, the majority of young
people reported that they were getting
[SPEAKER_27]: them in the retail environment and getting
them locally.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so when we look here in California,
our biggest offenders of retailers that
[SPEAKER_27]: are selling tobacco products are actually
the tobacco and vape shops where young
[SPEAKER_27]: people are not allowed in.
[SPEAKER_27]: And yet they are selling at rates higher
than levels of any other retailer.
[SPEAKER_27]: So some of the concerns that we have from
an organization that works with young
[SPEAKER_27]: people, the first is we have extensive
data to show that young people who
[SPEAKER_27]: experiment with vaping or young people who
do vape are significantly more likely to
[SPEAKER_27]: become tobacco users, use the combustible
products that they have not been using,
[SPEAKER_27]: but will start using, or use marijuana
products.
[SPEAKER_27]: We also know that the young people who are
vaping today would not have considered
[SPEAKER_27]: smoking a cigarette.
[SPEAKER_27]: They would not have been at high risk for
tobacco use, and now they are because of
[SPEAKER_27]: their vaping behavior.
[SPEAKER_27]: We also know that e-cigarette rates are
continuing to grow, and use of combustible
[SPEAKER_27]: cigarettes is decreasing or staying the
same in some parts of the population.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's also important to know, as Dr. Tong
had said, that the products that young
[SPEAKER_27]: people are using today have significantly
higher levels of nicotine than the
[SPEAKER_27]: products of the past.
[SPEAKER_27]: What's hard about these products,
we don't know what young people are using.
[SPEAKER_27]: So unlike a cigarette that you would buy,
you would smoke it, and then it would be
[SPEAKER_27]: extinguished and would be done,
these products are used and students are
[SPEAKER_27]: sharing them.
[SPEAKER_27]: When we talk to teens about their use and
we ask them if they own the products,
[SPEAKER_27]: they say no.
[SPEAKER_27]: What happens is they leave class,
their friend does a puff-puff and then
[SPEAKER_27]: passes the product to them, and then they
puff-puff and pass it back.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so they are sharing devices and
sharing different solutions, and
[SPEAKER_27]: oftentimes they have no idea what they're
actually vaping.
[SPEAKER_27]: What's also interesting is in 1998,
after the master settlement agreement was
[SPEAKER_27]: signed, we saw a change in tobacco use
behavior among young people, where young
[SPEAKER_27]: people would experiment with tobacco
before the age of 18, and if they became
[SPEAKER_27]: addicted, they would do so in their young
adult years.
[SPEAKER_27]: And that has shifted.
[SPEAKER_27]: In my time in tobacco control,
this is the first time that we have young
[SPEAKER_27]: adults or youth that are actually
self-identifying as being addicted to
[SPEAKER_27]: tobacco and seeking help and quitting.
[SPEAKER_27]: And we're trying desperately to figure out
how to get them that help.
[SPEAKER_27]: Oftentimes, they may not be ready to quit,
but at least motivating them for those
[SPEAKER_27]: quit attempts is critically important
because they are addicted.
[SPEAKER_27]: Levels of addiction are very different as
well.
[SPEAKER_27]: And again, we don't fully understand how
much nicotine individuals are getting.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's based on the products they're using.
[SPEAKER_27]: The bioavailability of those products,
the frequency of use, and that is still
[SPEAKER_27]: not a perfect science to understand that.
[SPEAKER_27]: So California communities are responding.
[SPEAKER_27]: This data is already outdated as another
ordinance was passed earlier this week,
[SPEAKER_27]: but as of Friday, there were 44 local
jurisdictions that had ordinances that
[SPEAKER_27]: specifically related to flavored products.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's important to note that much of this
work was started early on in response to
[SPEAKER_27]: FDA not including menthol in the ban on
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_27]: So much of this work started to try to
eliminate mentholated products from the
[SPEAKER_27]: market and has since expanded to include
all vaping products.
[SPEAKER_27]: Other products, such as hookah,
the majority of hookah bars in our state
[SPEAKER_27]: are actually within a mile of a college
and university campus.
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's not surprising that college
students have the highest rates of hookah
[SPEAKER_27]: use in our state.
[SPEAKER_27]: So when we look at this, more and more
communities are starting to amend their
[SPEAKER_27]: tobacco retail license or adopt ordinances
specifically banning the sale of all
[SPEAKER_27]: flavored tobacco products, although some
do have exemptions.
[SPEAKER_27]: We do have now it's four ordinances,
but previously three ordinances that ban
[SPEAKER_27]: the sale of electronic smoking devices.
[SPEAKER_27]: San Francisco and Richmond have
limitations on theirs.
[SPEAKER_27]: If FDA were to approve these products,
Livermore's ban is a complete ban with no
[SPEAKER_27]: end date.
[SPEAKER_27]: And then of course, Beverly Hills passed
an ordinance that bans the sale of all
[SPEAKER_27]: tobacco products in their community with
the exception of three cigar bars that
[SPEAKER_27]: were left as an exemption to allow use and
sale within those bars.
[SPEAKER_27]: So in summary, we do have an epidemic.
[SPEAKER_27]: We know that we have a history of working
with an industry that has utilized tactics
[SPEAKER_27]: to try to dissuade the conversation on
public health.
[SPEAKER_27]: The new e-cigarette companies have
employed many of these same strategies and
[SPEAKER_27]: they're under federal litigation for that
right now.
[SPEAKER_27]: There are numerous health concerns with
all of these products, as Dr. Tong had
[SPEAKER_27]: mentioned, the high potency of these new
pod-based products, both with nicotine but
[SPEAKER_27]: also THC, is very alarming.
[SPEAKER_27]: We see some of the products we had,
our team's been doing focus groups for
[SPEAKER_27]: years and annually we ask them about the
products that they see and what products
[SPEAKER_27]: they use.
[SPEAKER_27]: The pens, the second generation pens that
were previously used for vaping nicotine
[SPEAKER_27]: solutions are now primarily used by young
people as wax pens and they know exactly
[SPEAKER_27]: where to get the cartridges and how to get
them.
[SPEAKER_27]: We know that youth and young adult vaping
has continued to increase and as new data
[SPEAKER_27]: from the federal government shows,
it is continuing.
[SPEAKER_27]: And we know that the burden of this
problem is currently existing at our K
[SPEAKER_27]: through 12 schools and our colleges and
universities where young people are using
[SPEAKER_27]: these products and the health systems are
also trying to identify how do we help
[SPEAKER_27]: these people quit using them.
[SPEAKER_27]: But there is a response from our local
communities in California to respond and
[SPEAKER_27]: there are a number of individuals
throughout the state that are working to
[SPEAKER_27]: try to reduce these rates and to support a
tobacco-free California.
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for your presentation.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's both very informative and pretty
alarming, quite frankly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to open this up to the members
for questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Questions from Mr. Gray?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, thank you for your presentation.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm curious about the attention and you
went over the local ordinances at the city
[SPEAKER_11]: and county level throughout California and
I noticed every one of them deals with
[SPEAKER_11]: flavored tobacco and e-cig use,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yet during your presentation, unless I
read that wrong, it occurred to me that
[SPEAKER_11]: the highest use seems to be marijuana
products and or vaping amongst teenagers,
[SPEAKER_11]: which seems consistent since the outbreak
of this public health crisis, at least
[SPEAKER_11]: with the illnesses and the reported
deaths.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've had numerous conversations with
school officials in my district.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every one of them has suggested that the
great majority of products that they
[SPEAKER_11]: confiscate from young people at the high
schools have marijuana in them.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's curious that the public policy
response, starting with the president all
[SPEAKER_11]: the way down to the local level as you
brought your presentation, is exclusively
[SPEAKER_11]: focused on e-cigs when that's not
apparently the number one drug.
[SPEAKER_11]: However, certainly a significant
contributor, which also was noted in your
[SPEAKER_11]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do you think that is?
[SPEAKER_27]: So in California we have our tobacco tax
dollars are used to fund a comprehensive
[SPEAKER_27]: tobacco control program to address tobacco
control ordinances.
[SPEAKER_27]: A similar program for marijuana does not
exist in the state.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you think if a program did exist,
that might drive more of these local
[SPEAKER_11]: ordinances and efforts, maybe calls for
the banning of flavored marijuana,
[SPEAKER_11]: for example.
[SPEAKER_27]: I can't comment on that specifically,
but I can note that California does have
[SPEAKER_27]: one of the most successful tobacco control
programs in the world.
[SPEAKER_27]: And it's been extraordinarily successful
in reducing tobacco use in our state,
[SPEAKER_27]: as well as changing norms around tobacco
use in the state.
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems concerning.
[SPEAKER_11]: I ran into several young people vaping in
my district over the past 30 days and took
[SPEAKER_11]: the time to kind of chat with them about
what they were doing and what product they
[SPEAKER_11]: were using.
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the things I found kind of
shocking, and maybe something we could
[SPEAKER_11]: come to expect given the publicity and the
press reporting and some of the
[SPEAKER_11]: information out there, is that they were
all under the impression that marijuana
[SPEAKER_11]: vaping was safe and that tobacco vaping
could kill you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I assume they got that impression from the
news reports and some of the information
[SPEAKER_11]: put out there by advocacy groups and
others kind of exclusively focused on
[SPEAKER_11]: tobacco.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it seems like a danger when clearly we
don't quite know what's causing it and the
[SPEAKER_11]: public health warnings to not vape,
period, until we have a better idea or
[SPEAKER_11]: perhaps we don't get a better idea and
people shouldn't be vaping at all.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's absolutely an unsafe or
critically unsafe product.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it strikes me that that's a dangerous
public health outcome when you have young
[SPEAKER_11]: people not informed about the real
dangers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Would you agree?
[SPEAKER_27]: Correct, yes.
[SPEAKER_27]: And again, I'm not in charge of funding
decisions in the state of California,
[SPEAKER_27]: but I do want to note we have an
incredible tobacco control program who
[SPEAKER_27]: has, obviously when we talk to young
people, I want to note that even though we
[SPEAKER_27]: have seen increases in vaping among young
people in California, it's lower than the
[SPEAKER_27]: national level.
[SPEAKER_27]: So the work that's being done to address
tobacco control in the state is done well
[SPEAKER_27]: and we are making good successes.
[SPEAKER_27]: But I can't speak to the marijuana
prevention and public health aspect of
[SPEAKER_27]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Cooper.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, for Ms. Vagadori.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope I pronounced your name right.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a non-profit, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you guys get money.
[SPEAKER_09]: And really the big issue is I agree with
what Mr. Gray said.
[SPEAKER_09]: Over $2 billion in tobacco tax revenue is
bought in by the state and yet less than
[SPEAKER_09]: 3% is used for enforcement.
[SPEAKER_09]: So while you pat yourself on the back for
what you guys have done, it's a different
[SPEAKER_09]: model now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Things have changed with the vaping.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of that money, and I'm reading
the information here about some paperwork
[SPEAKER_09]: where most of that money that goes to the
cities and counties goes for education or
[SPEAKER_09]: training, but not for enforcement.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's really the big issue with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this legislature, what do you want to
do to deal with this issue?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the black market, they're in there
to make money and make profits off other
[SPEAKER_09]: people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll talk about it later on,
but we've got to change that model with
[SPEAKER_09]: this.
[SPEAKER_09]: We know it's an epidemic.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're saying this.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yet 3% is insufficient.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know the AG allocated $38 million this
year for CDPH and DOJ.
[SPEAKER_09]: But once again, as far as shoulder tap
operations that law enforcement does,
[SPEAKER_09]: that's not getting done that much.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are a whole host of issues with
this.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I put the blame on the state for a lot
of these issues that have come up for a
[SPEAKER_09]: long time for a myriad of issues.
[SPEAKER_09]: But how do you, I guess, rectify that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think more money should be given
towards enforcement?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you're saying the rates are low.
[SPEAKER_09]: But now, obviously, it's increasing with
the vaping.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in my opinion, on the enforcement end,
more should be allocated, because
[SPEAKER_09]: obviously, this education part is working
only so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the training is only working so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you can go to a pot shop,
or without a pot shop, but a head shop,
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the black market is out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So these kids can go anywhere in the black
market and get it that they're going to
[SPEAKER_09]: sell.
[SPEAKER_09]: So do you favor or support more funding
for the enforcement end?
[SPEAKER_27]: So I can't speak to that.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I can't take a position on it.
[SPEAKER_27]: But I can say that I know the Department
of Justice is here, and that they'll share
[SPEAKER_27]: the work that they've been doing with the
grants that they've been given out.
[SPEAKER_27]: The good thing that's happening with the
funding from Prop 56 with the combination
[SPEAKER_27]: of funding for Department of Justice,
Department of Education, Department of
[SPEAKER_27]: Public Health, there's a lot of new
partnerships to try to bring allies and
[SPEAKER_27]: enforcement from the schools and then also
from the Department of Public Health and
[SPEAKER_27]: community together to identify how to come
about that.
[SPEAKER_27]: But I'm not an expert on the enforcement
end.
[SPEAKER_27]: So I ignore.
[SPEAKER_27]: Can I speak to that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, at the end of the day, the
enforcement still happens at the local
[SPEAKER_09]: level.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love DOJ.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've worked with them for a long time.
[SPEAKER_09]: DOJ passes the money, so it's your local
sheriffs and police departments that do
[SPEAKER_09]: all these operations.
[SPEAKER_09]: So like I said, the funding is inadequate
and has been for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_36]: If I may just add also, it depends on the
social norm of the whole society.
[SPEAKER_36]: So we know that kids are not always just
going to the stores to buy it.
[SPEAKER_36]: They're getting it maybe from their
parents, or at least some of the
[SPEAKER_36]: confiscated products have been even
amongst friends or family.
[SPEAKER_36]: So we have to address the whole society
and not just target and punish young
[SPEAKER_36]: people.
[SPEAKER_36]: But think about the whole of society and
also the public health good that we're
[SPEAKER_36]: trying to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, in my background, I spent 30 years
in law enforcement, and there are
[SPEAKER_09]: thousands of shops in LA that are black
market shops.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's relatively easy for a young person
to go to a black market shop and buy it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And like I said, these cartridges are
produced in China, but they're filled up
[SPEAKER_09]: here in California, be it cannabis or
nicotine.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it happens here in the good old USA.
[SPEAKER_09]: So like I said, the issue is you can't
just bury your head in the ground to those
[SPEAKER_09]: illicit shops that are out there in the
thousands.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. McCarty.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is so overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't even know where to start.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's so many pieces, and I appreciate.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, first of all, thank you to the three
chairs for bringing this together.
[SPEAKER_17]: When it came up, I think it was late
August, early September, before we saw a
[SPEAKER_17]: lot of this movement.
[SPEAKER_17]: So certainly it's very timely.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the issues and frankly, the questions
that are arising come by the day,
[SPEAKER_17]: if not by the hour.
[SPEAKER_17]: I do think that this overarching topic is
important, as you said, Dr. Wood.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's kind of how I said it,
but you articulated it very wisely.
[SPEAKER_17]: That is the youth epidemic, and we see the
romanticism with the flavors, which I'll
[SPEAKER_17]: get to in a second.
[SPEAKER_17]: For this other question that Mr. Gray
talked about is this whole issue of the
[SPEAKER_17]: all the vaping, is it safe in the first
place?
[SPEAKER_17]: Should we be permitting it?
[SPEAKER_17]: So I know that there's legal elements of
it, and some say it's the illegal pieces,
[SPEAKER_17]: but how do you differentiate?
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that that is a real question
we have to offer, ask ourselves.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I want to start with first as far as
the product as a whole.
[SPEAKER_17]: We saw your great PowerPoint and the
decline in smoking rates across our
[SPEAKER_17]: country here in California.
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of the pushes of the industry of
this is an alternative.
[SPEAKER_17]: And they have said that it's a safe
alternative, and the FDA, of course,
[SPEAKER_17]: came at them and said, you can't say that.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, my understanding, I just saw this
advertisement came up on someone's email
[SPEAKER_17]: yesterday, and they sent it to me,
and it says it's a satisfying alternative.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I guess they're changing their
language.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not a safe alternative, but it's a
satisfying, I guess that's not necessarily
[SPEAKER_17]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_17]: So as far as the alternative, what does
the public health world say about that as
[SPEAKER_17]: far as alternative to standard tobacco and
smoking use?
[SPEAKER_36]: Right, so I think that's why underscoring
what the CDC has emphasized, there's no
[SPEAKER_36]: safe tobacco product, and we're learning
about the wide range of health effects of
[SPEAKER_36]: THC as well.
[SPEAKER_36]: What I tell my patients is your lungs are
meant to breathe clean air, and so my goal
[SPEAKER_36]: as a provider will be to help you quit for
good.
[SPEAKER_36]: So as an alternative, I would probably say
let's try to get you to zero and have
[SPEAKER_36]: clean lungs.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, it's somewhat similar to years ago.
[SPEAKER_17]: They came out with filters, and they said
filtered cigarettes are safer,
[SPEAKER_17]: and potentially marginally safer,
but are they safe?
[SPEAKER_17]: So my understanding, when they first came
out with the patches and the gum,
[SPEAKER_17]: there were prescriptions to get them.
[SPEAKER_17]: You couldn't buy them over.
[SPEAKER_17]: Over the counter?
[SPEAKER_17]: Has that ever been talked about as having,
if there is an alternative to having it
[SPEAKER_17]: utilized by people in medicine,
like you, through a pharmacy as opposed to
[SPEAKER_17]: these little shops that we see around
town.
[SPEAKER_36]: Right.
[SPEAKER_36]: So how to quit, especially when nicotine
is so addictive, these medications,
[SPEAKER_36]: those five nicotine replacement
medications are meant to help people with
[SPEAKER_36]: withdrawal symptoms, which are especially
worse in the first couple of weeks,
[SPEAKER_36]: anxiety, irritability, you know,
I've seen people want to leave the
[SPEAKER_36]: hospital against medical advice because
they can't go out for a cigarette,
[SPEAKER_36]: but it can really lead to a lot of
agitation.
[SPEAKER_36]: So those medications are meant over two to
three months to help you, help your brain
[SPEAKER_36]: unlearn the nicotine addiction and to
learn new behaviors to replace the product
[SPEAKER_36]: that you were using.
[SPEAKER_36]: So, you know, I've heard in the news media
like, well, maybe people trying to quit
[SPEAKER_36]: vaping should go back to cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_36]: No, we have medications that are time
tested.
[SPEAKER_36]: But what we're facing here is a new
high-potency nicotine that even as a
[SPEAKER_36]: provider, I don't even know quite how to
dose people.
[SPEAKER_36]: I can only just hope to try to titrate up
to what their needs are until their own
[SPEAKER_36]: symptoms are abated.
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then to the youth piece, and now you
talked about this, Kimberly, so it's
[SPEAKER_17]: advertising is a big bit.
[SPEAKER_17]: And literally last night I was driving
through my district and we see these shops
[SPEAKER_17]: all over there.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we know that there's the youth element
with the flavor and we've seen reports
[SPEAKER_17]: that LGBT community have higher numbers
for this.
[SPEAKER_17]: Literally I saw a shop with the pride
colors.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure you can see it.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a blueberry vape shop.
[SPEAKER_17]: Blueberry vape and smoke on Watt Avenue.
[SPEAKER_17]: And just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's exactly what we're talking about,
the population, and it's targeting the
[SPEAKER_17]: community to come right in knowing that
there's this romanticism.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that I have 11-year-old girls,
and they were selling Girl Scout cookies
[SPEAKER_17]: right over here at Safeway.
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of my daughters saw somebody come
hang out and vaping that cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_17]: She's like, daddy, it smells really good.
[SPEAKER_17]: It smells like it tastes really good too.
[SPEAKER_17]: 11-year-old.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, these kids have everything
around them.
[SPEAKER_17]: They see it's cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: They have the advertising.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so this is incredible.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a crazy, crazy epidemic and it's
coming from all different angles.
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, it's coming upon us to
really act.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know there's no one solution.
[SPEAKER_17]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's not one bill, one thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: I know we talked about this last year.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a package of things on the menu to
do to tackle this.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that we're doing this today,
the conversation.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're hopefully going to be pushing some
policy in the near future.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cities are stepping up and doing it too.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I don't think that one flavor ban or
policy is going to end, you know,
[SPEAKER_17]: even if you go after the shops.
[SPEAKER_17]: And Mr. Gray and I had some amazing
presentations this past year talking about
[SPEAKER_17]: the shops that are getting the stings.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not the grocery stores.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the little ma and pa shops.
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're the ones that are having the
huge, huge numbers.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so having more enforcement there,
like Mr. Cooper said, I think is part of
[SPEAKER_17]: the solution.
[SPEAKER_17]: But even if we shut down that,
you know, kids are smart.
[SPEAKER_17]: They figure out mom's password to Amazon
and buy stuff online.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so it's going to take a multitude of
ways to go after this.
[SPEAKER_17]: So the last topic I want to discuss is I
understand that it's a nuanced issue with
[SPEAKER_17]: the non-tobacco vaping.
[SPEAKER_17]: And first of all, I don't even know how
many, if there is.
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it prevalent for the cannabis vaping
and flavors?
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we know that?
[SPEAKER_27]: So I tried to get data on the vaping
specifically of THC and flavor THC.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I do not believe that that exists.
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.
[SPEAKER_17]: So as Mr. Gray suggested, if we did have
across the board no flavor for tobacco and
[SPEAKER_17]: cannabis, we don't really know how much
that would impact the cannabis vaping
[SPEAKER_17]: products.
[SPEAKER_27]: Potentially.
[SPEAKER_27]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_27]: My expertise is not in THC side.
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'm not aware of what percent of vaping
devices are sold in flavors and what
[SPEAKER_27]: percent of young people are vaping
flavored wax pens or THC devices.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the last issue, and this is the
question, which I think is the question
[SPEAKER_17]: we're asking about the illnesses.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's mainly from the THC products.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the industry is saying, hey,
that's not our product.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the illegal black market product
that's coming over.
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're not having the same metals in
there that we have tested and so forth.
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know the science.
[SPEAKER_17]: I may be messing that up.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I would assume that people who use
this product, they use it all.
[SPEAKER_17]: They're not pure.
[SPEAKER_17]: They just do one or the other.
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's hard to tell which one was the
culprit.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so is there a way to have a safe
nuanced way for the cannabis product and
[SPEAKER_17]: go after the devices that are really
causing harm?
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we understand that?
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what I was getting at?
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes, but I think that's why the CDC has
come out saying out of all the 500 and so
[SPEAKER_36]: things they could get from the cases that
were sick and they couldn't find one
[SPEAKER_36]: substance or one product to call it upon.
[SPEAKER_36]: That's why they're still making that very
strong statement, everyone please just
[SPEAKER_36]: stop vaping until we try to figure this
out.
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't think we really know.
[SPEAKER_36]: And so far, there's no suggestion to say
there is a safe device or way of vaping or
[SPEAKER_36]: what chemical.
[SPEAKER_17]: So the medical community is with the CDC
and saying with all the questions and not
[SPEAKER_17]: enough answers, we should just do a
timeout on all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_36]: I think that would be the safest thing for
public health.
[SPEAKER_17]: And is there ongoing research that enables
you to see if the devices that are legally
[SPEAKER_17]: sold do have some safety requirements in
them?
[SPEAKER_36]: So this is where the FDA regulation is
supposed to come into play, where the
[SPEAKER_36]: manufacturers are supposed to submit
information about their products and the
[SPEAKER_36]: effect on health.
[SPEAKER_36]: So that's why that deadline, that
moratorium is now being up to next year.
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know our later panel has our
Department of Public Health, so
[SPEAKER_17]: potentially these issues will be addressed
there as well.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have Ms. Lamone, Mr. Lowe,
and then Mr. Cooper again.
[SPEAKER_28]: Great, thank you.
[SPEAKER_28]: I appreciate the conversation.
[SPEAKER_28]: I think for me, I first started thinking
about this in 2011-12 when I was on a
[SPEAKER_28]: school board.
[SPEAKER_28]: And we did not know if our tobacco policy
for student conduct actually covered
[SPEAKER_28]: vaping.
[SPEAKER_28]: It was very confusing then.
[SPEAKER_28]: We didn't know if the law allowed for
that.
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think since then, the school
districts have evolved in the thinking.
[SPEAKER_28]: And I know some of my colleagues have
touched upon issues of enforcement or
[SPEAKER_28]: impact, health impact.
[SPEAKER_28]: But one of the things that I heard in this
presentation repeated was the lack of
[SPEAKER_28]: understanding and education, which I find
to be one of the harder things to do,
[SPEAKER_28]: to educate the public.
[SPEAKER_28]: And so I just wondered if you could speak
to what you're seeing in terms of best
[SPEAKER_28]: practice as educating the youth or public
about this.
[SPEAKER_28]: Certainly, there have been articles.
[SPEAKER_28]: Clearly, the articles have not had an
impact.
[SPEAKER_28]: There has been an impact on mass number of
minors decreasing their use, at least not
[SPEAKER_28]: with the data that you presented.
[SPEAKER_28]: So what are the best practices?
[SPEAKER_28]: What is California doing well to try to
educate minors and adults about the
[SPEAKER_28]: impact?
[SPEAKER_27]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_27]: So again, to refer back to the tobacco
control program we have here in
[SPEAKER_27]: California.
[SPEAKER_27]: So the focus of that program is to
denormalize the use of tobacco control.
[SPEAKER_27]: And part of that is by engaging
communities to change the norms of the
[SPEAKER_27]: access to tobacco, the exposure to
tobacco, the advertising and marketing to
[SPEAKER_27]: various tobacco products and retail
environments.
[SPEAKER_27]: Also, there's a lot of work happening at
the local level to change the number,
[SPEAKER_27]: the density of retailers and communities,
the location of those retailers,
[SPEAKER_27]: moving them away from schools.
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's one part of it.
[SPEAKER_27]: The second side is to do the media
campaign and to try to engage parents and
[SPEAKER_27]: adults and young adults around not just
the dangers of the products, but what's
[SPEAKER_27]: happening within communities and tobacco
industry tactics.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so that work is continuing.
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's just the side that the
Department of Public Health has.
[SPEAKER_27]: The Department of Education, who is also a
partner in this work, then does the school
[SPEAKER_27]: work specifically.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so their funding through their tobacco
use prevention education program then goes
[SPEAKER_27]: to try to train teachers and educate
parents and administrators on the problems
[SPEAKER_27]: and problems of these products.
[SPEAKER_27]: What caught us off guard was how quickly
these products grew.
[SPEAKER_27]: And as Assemblymember Gray noted,
that oftentimes when we go into schools
[SPEAKER_27]: and we ask what products young people are
using, I remember I was actually in Madera
[SPEAKER_27]: County and talked to some law enforcement
who were working with high school students
[SPEAKER_27]: and learned that all of the products they
confiscated were wax pens.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I was surprised by that.
[SPEAKER_27]: But when we talked to students,
we find out that they are constantly
[SPEAKER_27]: trying to be ahead of the game.
[SPEAKER_27]: So when we focus just on Juul,
parents know what Juuls are.
[SPEAKER_27]: So they're looking for Juuls.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so then kids go to Soren or they go to
Novo or any of the other new products.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so it's trying to get the bigger
picture and not just focus on a product,
[SPEAKER_27]: but trying to create healthier communities
by removing the products and then by
[SPEAKER_27]: having media campaigns to make people
aware of them.
[SPEAKER_27]: And as was also noted, a lot of the
comprehensive policies at local
[SPEAKER_27]: jurisdictions are creating not so much on
the sales, but on the use of these
[SPEAKER_27]: products.
[SPEAKER_27]: I know that the majority of our colleges
and universities in the states have
[SPEAKER_27]: comprehensive policies that cover the
inhalation or use of any combustible or
[SPEAKER_27]: vaporized product on their campus.
[SPEAKER_27]: And the idea is that if we can remove the
use from being visible, that will change
[SPEAKER_27]: the norm and then that will then change
people's use because it's not normalized
[SPEAKER_27]: to use it.
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's a really comprehensive program
that communities are working on,
[SPEAKER_27]: community coalitions across the state.
[SPEAKER_27]: The Department of Public Health has a
really robust and very successful media
[SPEAKER_27]: campaign.
[SPEAKER_27]: And then the Department of Education is
working within the schools to try to
[SPEAKER_27]: address it from all approaches.
[SPEAKER_27]: And really trying to engage all community
members, including parents, to make them
[SPEAKER_27]: aware of these.
[SPEAKER_27]: And then really helping to equip them and
to equip trusted adults to be able to ask
[SPEAKER_27]: the question about use, to advise and
encourage quit attempts, and then to refer
[SPEAKER_27]: them to services that can help them quit.
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_28]: It clearly sounds that there's no doubt
that it's comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_28]: I think my concern is that despite how
comprehensive it is, the problem is
[SPEAKER_28]: outpacing the potential solution.
[SPEAKER_28]: And so I'm just wondering if our
definition or understanding of
[SPEAKER_28]: comprehensive is going to have to adapt to
a problem that's evolved at a very fast
[SPEAKER_28]: and deep way.
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think I'm trying to grapple with
that.
[SPEAKER_28]: So I appreciate the feedback.
[SPEAKER_36]: May I add that the doctors need to be
educated as well.
[SPEAKER_36]: We don't know how to ask and treat these
things.
[SPEAKER_36]: And what the kids are doing, we don't even
know.
[SPEAKER_36]: They're the same parents who are the
providers who are trying to keep up or may
[SPEAKER_36]: not know that this problem is out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you very much, Dr. Tong and
Kimberly, for your presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will admit to you that your presentation
scared the crap out of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we have done such hard work in
trying to address this public health
[SPEAKER_03]: crisis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it seems to be coming right back
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the sense of urgency is very real.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wanted to maybe perhaps call your
attention to the slide that you provided
[SPEAKER_03]: to us with respect to one third of tobacco
shops and vape shops sold to minors in
[SPEAKER_03]: 2018.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your graphic here, about 34% of usage
comes from tobacco and vaping,
[SPEAKER_03]: vape shops specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that of one third going to that of
minors.
[SPEAKER_03]: We heard earlier about that of locals and
school districts and the challenges of
[SPEAKER_03]: local municipalities trying to tackle this
issues of bans outright.
[SPEAKER_03]: And oftentimes at the state level,
we battle on that of local control versus
[SPEAKER_03]: the state coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's clear to me that the locals are
not necessarily in control.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I've had an opportunity to meet
when we're now out of session with local
[SPEAKER_03]: school districts and board members,
this is the number one issue that they are
[SPEAKER_03]: hearing and seeing about, that they are
not able to tackle this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're asking specifically for
additional help from the state to try to
[SPEAKER_03]: tackle this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any guidance or insights with
respect to that of locals and the role of
[SPEAKER_03]: state versus locals?
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, seeing that the lack of
enforcement specifically going to selling
[SPEAKER_03]: to minors of one third going to tobacco
stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any sense on the observations
or mechanisms that you're hearing as you
[SPEAKER_03]: are engaged in talking to those most
impacted?
[SPEAKER_27]: I know a number of jurisdictions are
adopting stronger tobacco retail licenses.
[SPEAKER_27]: Many don't have retail licenses right now
and are looking at adopting them with
[SPEAKER_27]: stronger fees associated, stronger
penalties, and then also the inclusion of
[SPEAKER_27]: flavor bans.
[SPEAKER_27]: The focus on the flavor ban is because we
know that young people are initiating
[SPEAKER_27]: tobacco use because the products are
flavored and they seem less harmful as a
[SPEAKER_27]: result.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so by eliminating those products,
it's eliminating products that are
[SPEAKER_27]: attracting youth to purchase them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, but as we have sort of seen the
trends given your presentation,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a relatively small segment of local
municipalities that have actually taken
[SPEAKER_03]: action.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet the impacted populations seems,
you've also shown the percentage continues
[SPEAKER_03]: to rise.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, I think maybe do you have any
insights with respect to do you believe
[SPEAKER_03]: that local jurisdictions are actually
doing what they can and should be doing to
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of tackle this issues given the rates
and then also given the statistics of that
[SPEAKER_03]: of enforcement going to minors?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because again, local cities we hear all
the time, local control, but they're
[SPEAKER_03]: clearly not in control.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the minors are being sold these
products.
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that some jurisdictions in the
state have a stronger history of adopting
[SPEAKER_27]: strong tobacco control ordinances.
[SPEAKER_27]: And we see that with those jurisdictions
having policies in place now.
[SPEAKER_27]: I know that there is a lot of work being
done throughout this state, but I know
[SPEAKER_27]: that there are regions where it may not be
happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you off the top of your head,
you just referenced a number of
[SPEAKER_03]: jurisdictions that have comprehensive
policies that may be doing better with
[SPEAKER_03]: respect to that of enforcement and some of
these policies, are any jurisdictions?
[SPEAKER_27]: I can't speak to the enforcement piece,
but I know that we know specifically the
[SPEAKER_27]: Bay Area has been the champion for
flavored ordinance.
[SPEAKER_27]: We know that Los Angeles has recently,
the county has recently had an ordinance.
[SPEAKER_27]: The city is looking at an ordinance,
the city of Sacramento's, which just went
[SPEAKER_27]: into effect.
[SPEAKER_27]: So definitely more of the urban
communities have ordinances that are
[SPEAKER_27]: already adopted or closer to adoption.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Cooper.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to follow up to Mr. Lowe's
question on those ordinances.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have them in place, but you walk
around downtown outside, people are still
[SPEAKER_09]: vaping, be it Sacramento, LA, or San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want to go back to the doctor.
[SPEAKER_09]: CDCs that take a break from vaping.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's just unrealistic.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think when people are involved in
addiction, be it tobacco, alcohol,
[SPEAKER_09]: or illicit drugs, it is just tough to kick
no matter what.
[SPEAKER_09]: FDA is saying, hey, vaping is better than
smoking tobacco.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've got a whole group of people out
there, and I think it's unrealistic to do
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe 10 years from now or whatever,
we find out more information on this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no timeline really, and I'm sure
it's not going to happen anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_09]: So being realistic, they're not taking a
break.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess when asking the doctor,
vaping, if it's not from the black market,
[SPEAKER_09]: is still safer than smoking tobacco then?
[SPEAKER_36]: So I think this is where the FDA
regulation of e-cigarettes is still not
[SPEAKER_36]: there.
[SPEAKER_36]: And this is for the manufacturers to
submit information about health.
[SPEAKER_36]: So I don't think we can even make that
statement that it's safe.
[SPEAKER_36]: And right now, the CDC is saying there is
no safe tobacco product.
[SPEAKER_36]: And we know that inhaling these chemicals
with vaping can have immediate health
[SPEAKER_36]: effects.
[SPEAKER_36]: So as the surgeon general has noted,
even for non-users, secondhand aerosol has
[SPEAKER_36]: harmful constituents.
[SPEAKER_36]: So I think what we're seeing right now is
maybe what you're referring to is does
[SPEAKER_36]: maybe having less carcinogen in some of
these products, maybe does that mean less
[SPEAKER_36]: harm?
[SPEAKER_36]: And I think that's why I'm trying to also
show this is maybe what was thought for
[SPEAKER_36]: low tar before.
[SPEAKER_36]: But it takes years for the scientific
evidence to keep coming out.
[SPEAKER_36]: And every day, there's a lot of evidence
about immediate biological effects,
[SPEAKER_36]: and it'll take a few years to get
epidemiology data.
[SPEAKER_36]: So I think that's where a lot of the
public confusion is, where they think
[SPEAKER_36]: these are newer, safer, cleaner products.
[SPEAKER_36]: They don't make you smell.
[SPEAKER_36]: It must be better.
[SPEAKER_36]: But I think we are now finding out there
is still a lot of learning to do with the
[SPEAKER_36]: science.
[SPEAKER_36]: And so far, the science is showing this is
not a safe product.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for some of the previous vaping pins
from nicotine part that went through FDA,
[SPEAKER_09]: they were approved through the FDA and
tested?
[SPEAKER_09]: What did the manufacturer submit to the
FDA?
[SPEAKER_36]: Right.
[SPEAKER_36]: So I think in 2016, the deeming rule by
the FDA is that it has authority to
[SPEAKER_36]: regulate e-cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_36]: But right now, whatever's on the label,
it's not regulated.
[SPEAKER_36]: That hasn't been implemented yet.
[SPEAKER_36]: So that's why they've started trying to
move up that moratorium to say,
[SPEAKER_36]: start submitting what's actually in these
things.
[SPEAKER_36]: The FDA does fund what's called TCORs,
these tobacco centers, of regulatory
[SPEAKER_36]: science that have been producing some of
this scientific evidence.
[SPEAKER_36]: And it needs to be compiled.
[SPEAKER_36]: And they're also informing the FDA about
these products as well.
[SPEAKER_36]: So it's still early stages to say that we
even know what's in these products and the
[SPEAKER_36]: effects on human health.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the media's been all over this,
and they've submitted a lot of test
[SPEAKER_09]: samples for testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And from what I've seen in the media,
all their test samples that came back were
[SPEAKER_09]: from the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it tobacco or cannabis, and not
legitimate manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you look at this, I mean,
a lot of it comes from earlier,
[SPEAKER_09]: I talked about the brick and mortar.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like 74%.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of it comes from the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it seems to me, just as a layman,
that that is a big issue with it,
[SPEAKER_09]: where a lot of these products do come
from.
[SPEAKER_36]: No doubt that's something that needs to be
regulated.
[SPEAKER_36]: And as you were mentioning, we need the
Department of Justice to also help with
[SPEAKER_36]: this.
[SPEAKER_36]: But I think it's very challenging,
because the products that the CDC
[SPEAKER_36]: investigation has done, it's not even all
of the cases that they've been able to get
[SPEAKER_36]: the products and test.
[SPEAKER_36]: So they don't know, and that's what they
conclude is, right now there is no single
[SPEAKER_36]: product or substance.
[SPEAKER_36]: But at the same time, they're saying,
please ask some of these questions about
[SPEAKER_36]: where are people getting it?
[SPEAKER_36]: How are they using it?
[SPEAKER_36]: What are they filling it up with?
[SPEAKER_36]: And they're asking doctors to ask these
questions to help it out.
[SPEAKER_36]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone else?
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead, and I'll go last.
[SPEAKER_11]: So my colleagues have inspired some
additional questions for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things, the debate or the
discussion, the dialogue in the state
[SPEAKER_11]: legislature here in California this year
was predominantly, on one hand,
[SPEAKER_11]: folks that wanted to focus on the
moratorium or the banning of flavored
[SPEAKER_11]: e-cig products.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the other legislative effort we had
was to focus more on the oversight
[SPEAKER_11]: regulation, taxation of e-cigs,
as we do in traditional tobacco.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was involved as one of the authors on
the oversight regulatory approach,
[SPEAKER_11]: and the inspiration for that was,
frankly, traditional tobacco.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've seen in traditional tobacco
education oversight regulation taxation
[SPEAKER_11]: has been a successful recipe to reduce
consumption with youth and the general
[SPEAKER_11]: public.
[SPEAKER_11]: And sometimes we don't need to be smarter
than ourselves up here, but rather look at
[SPEAKER_11]: effective practices and then replicate
those.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so at one point, we had a bill before
the legislature that of the 15,000
[SPEAKER_11]: reported tobacco flavors, e-cig flavors
that were out there, would have restricted
[SPEAKER_11]: the sale of 14,997 of them, consistent
with traditional tobacco, where you have
[SPEAKER_11]: menthol and traditional tobacco flavors
available, but not some of these flavors
[SPEAKER_11]: that we discussed earlier.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the committee that I serve on
regulates not only tobacco, but alcohol as
[SPEAKER_11]: well.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would point to prohibition in the
early part of the last century as an
[SPEAKER_11]: example of where moratoriums bans aren't
necessarily always effective.
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, sometimes they serve to
exasperate the black market.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now, as we're faced with real health
concerns, that all evidence thus far seems
[SPEAKER_11]: to point to black market products.
[SPEAKER_11]: I haven't seen, I haven't read a lot that
suggests the legal THC and or tobacco
[SPEAKER_11]: products were caused.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, they may be, and there's a lot yet to
learn, but we certainly know that some of
[SPEAKER_11]: these black market products have caused
some damage.
[SPEAKER_11]: So do you agree, or do you not agree,
based on your work, that regulatory
[SPEAKER_11]: oversight education taxation wouldn't be a
good direction to go for e-cigs,
[SPEAKER_11]: just as we've done with traditional
tobacco?
[SPEAKER_11]: Or do you share the view that we ought to
do something entirely different and do
[SPEAKER_11]: more of a prohibition-style ban on
products?
[SPEAKER_37]: Is this for both of us?
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a softball question, in case you
were.
[SPEAKER_36]: I can repeat that for you, if you want.
[SPEAKER_36]: Well, I think this is, personally,
and I'm just speaking for myself,
[SPEAKER_36]: I mean, I think this is something,
I mean, vaping is so new.
[SPEAKER_36]: All these health effects and health harms
are just growing.
[SPEAKER_36]: We have to look at every single option.
[SPEAKER_36]: I mean, for sure, to control whatever we
can is most important.
[SPEAKER_36]: I think we're learning even to,
as a provider, the opiate epidemic is very
[SPEAKER_36]: much on all of our minds, and this is
something we are tasked very heavily to
[SPEAKER_36]: do, and that was under a medical model and
not a market model.
[SPEAKER_36]: So even that, we know that addiction is a
very challenging thing, that people get it
[SPEAKER_36]: from many different sources, and a
comprehensive approach is very much
[SPEAKER_36]: needed.
[SPEAKER_27]: And I would say the same.
[SPEAKER_27]: In regards to the type of work that's
being done, we know, and we look back to
[SPEAKER_27]: 2009, we know that when we remove flavors
from cigarettes, here in California,
[SPEAKER_27]: every population had a decrease in
cigarette consumption, with the exception
[SPEAKER_27]: of African Americans who have the highest
rates of mentholated use.
[SPEAKER_27]: So we know that there was a positive
impact by removing those flavored
[SPEAKER_27]: products.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so it could only be assumed that when
we look at the two different issues,
[SPEAKER_27]: and I agree with Dr. Wood, that we have an
issue of youth vaping and that increasing,
[SPEAKER_27]: and then we have the issue of the
illnesses.
[SPEAKER_27]: But looking specifically at the youth
vaping side, that removing youth-friendly
[SPEAKER_27]: products and flavored products from the
market would have an impact on youth use
[SPEAKER_27]: of the products, and eventually their
transition to other tobacco products down
[SPEAKER_27]: the road, which is what the research is
showing us.
[SPEAKER_11]: I tend to agree with that comment,
which is why we designed the bill that we
[SPEAKER_11]: were working on to reflect tobacco
exactly, which is banning flavors outside
[SPEAKER_11]: of traditional tobacco flavors,
menthol and traditional tobacco.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that did work, and seems like could
work.
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, the other efforts on flavors are
different than what you just described.
[SPEAKER_11]: The other question I had is the
availability and popularity of Nicorette.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason I ask the question is when
I first learned about the e-cigarette
[SPEAKER_11]: vaping epidemic, I went and wanted to see
all of these crazy flavors, like Captain
[SPEAKER_11]: Crunch, and Bubble Gum This, and Ice Cream
That.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I went to the Juul website and
started looking.
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't find any of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had been told, oh, there's all these
crazy 15,000 flavors.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I went on the website and found
fruit, mint, and several others.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I looked at a couple other
company websites and found similar
[SPEAKER_11]: results.
[SPEAKER_11]: What struck me about that is I was
familiar through some friends and family
[SPEAKER_11]: with folks who had used Nicorette in the
past, and it struck me that they were very
[SPEAKER_11]: similar to Nicorette flavors.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I went and looked, and I was right.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're the same type of fruit,
mint, same types of flavors that were
[SPEAKER_11]: offered in these products.
[SPEAKER_11]: Why have we not seen an epidemic of
Nicorette use amongst teens?
[SPEAKER_11]: If in fact, just being logically
consistent that flavors drive consumption
[SPEAKER_11]: in teens, then I would assume we should
have a Nicorette epidemic.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't believe we have one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Any thoughts on that, Doctor?
[SPEAKER_36]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_36]: So usually nicotine gum or lozenge is
usually two milligrams of nicotine.
[SPEAKER_36]: We're talking these Juul pods that the
manufacturer says has like 56 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_36]: And that's supposed to be the equivalent
of at least one pack of cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_36]: So when you're having flavors,
flavors is just one part.
[SPEAKER_36]: It's the marketing and it's also the taste
that masks maybe whatever bitterness.
[SPEAKER_36]: Even in nicotine gum or lozenge,
patients say there's some peppery taste
[SPEAKER_36]: that bothers them and the mint numbs it
and masks that.
[SPEAKER_36]: So I think that's why we're talking about
the high potency nicotine plus the peel of
[SPEAKER_36]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_36]: And that combination I think is something
that's way different from these vaping
[SPEAKER_36]: products than with the medication that the
FDA oversees for quitting tobacco.
[SPEAKER_27]: And if I can just add to that.
[SPEAKER_27]: So a couple of other points.
[SPEAKER_27]: So in the newest data that we have,
it's still preliminary data.
[SPEAKER_27]: But from the National Youth Tobacco
Survey, we've seen an increase,
[SPEAKER_27]: a significant increase in youth use of
mentholated vaping devices and mint vaping
devices.
[SPEAKER_27]: And a decrease in fruit and candy is
significantly lower.
[SPEAKER_27]: So we are getting to a point where young
people are switching to mint or starting
[SPEAKER_27]: with mint products.
[SPEAKER_11]: On the nicorette side... When you say
products, you're talking about vaping
[SPEAKER_11]: products, not gum, right?
[SPEAKER_27]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_27]: So on the gum side, there is no standard
for use of nicotine replacement therapy
[SPEAKER_27]: products for use with minors.
[SPEAKER_27]: Those products are not marketed to minors.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so when we look at Juul, who I think
we can call them out for, and they're
[SPEAKER_27]: currently again under investigation for
the practices of the marketing that they
[SPEAKER_27]: did do to youth specifically.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so that's a huge difference is that
access to these products, they're a lot
[SPEAKER_27]: more attractive to youth than gum that's
being promoted by providers.
[SPEAKER_27]: And then also the invasive marketing of
these new devices on social media sites
[SPEAKER_27]: and specifically to youth and young
adults.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that might point us back in the
direction of restrictions on marketing,
[SPEAKER_11]: education, taxation, increased oversight
and penalties, all those things that might
[SPEAKER_11]: dial in on accessing those products,
make it more similar to a nicorette
[SPEAKER_11]: product that's more restrictive in its
availability.
[SPEAKER_11]: What it also, just to follow up on your
thought, Doctor, brings up, and we did not
[SPEAKER_11]: discuss this, at least not that I'm aware
of, and perhaps some other chairs or
[SPEAKER_11]: members did discuss it, was the focusing
on the nicotine content, which I think you
[SPEAKER_11]: bring up this kind of excessive nicotine
content.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe we need to focus taxation,
moratorium, prohibition, provisions on the
[SPEAKER_11]: amount of nicotine contained in a product.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's something we haven't looked at,
but do you think that might be an
[SPEAKER_11]: effective avenue to go down?
[SPEAKER_36]: I think that's worth exploring on the
e-liquids and trying to understand what's
[SPEAKER_36]: in them and also we know people are price
responsive.
[SPEAKER_11]: The closest we got to that, I know the
bill that I was working on with some of my
[SPEAKER_11]: colleagues, we were looking at a taxation
approach that would have been based off of
[SPEAKER_11]: the nicotine content in the product.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm going to go back and take another
look at that based on your comments here
[SPEAKER_11]: today.
[SPEAKER_36]: I think also, just to note, just like with
the TAR, whatever's registered in the
[SPEAKER_36]: machine, we still need to learn what's
actually going on with the humans as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: My final question, I wasn't sure I heard
your answers on prohibition, for a
[SPEAKER_11]: prohibition or a ban versus regulation,
oversight, taxes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of laid that out there and I didn't
hear you guys answer that.
[SPEAKER_36]: As a provider, I'm not sure that's usually
my realm.
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm here to educate about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fair question.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just curious on your opinion given
your involvement.
[SPEAKER_36]: Well, I think time is telling that these
products are not safe and so it's worth
[SPEAKER_36]: looking at every angle that we're
understanding these with the vaping
[SPEAKER_36]: associated pulmonary injury.
[SPEAKER_36]: We still have a lot to learn that if the
CDC is saying to stop vaping, what are our
[SPEAKER_36]: options?
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't know that that's called
prohibition, but I think it's called,
[SPEAKER_36]: how do we act for public health?
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: A few questions to follow up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just one comment and a comment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Gray and I agree and disagree on
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: That may or may not be obvious to people,
but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: But he pointed out that we talked about
banning the 14,997 flavors and still
[SPEAKER_07]: leaving others out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But my understanding from Tobacco Free
Kids is that when you leave ment and
[SPEAKER_07]: menthol on the table, you've still got
50%.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the preference for 50% of users.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, to me, is kind of a problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's data that was fairly recent.
[SPEAKER_07]: That came out in August, I believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my numbers may not be exact,
but I think ment was somewhere around 32%
[SPEAKER_07]: and then you add menthol in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the number's still high.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in other words, that's why Mr.
McCormick and I, in particular,
[SPEAKER_07]: were looking at a ban on all flavors.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when we're talking about the FDA and
safety, and you mentioned T-Corps,
[SPEAKER_07]: T-Corps?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that what you said?
[SPEAKER_07]: T-Corps?
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems counterproductive.
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems wrong that we would ask the
industry to provide us with its safety
[SPEAKER_07]: data, considering the history of the
industry and how they've been deceptive on
[SPEAKER_07]: tobacco throughout the time tobacco has
been out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've failed to see why, yes,
the FDA's pushing that up.
[SPEAKER_07]: But how do we get other data out there
that isn't potentially biased?
[SPEAKER_07]: It feels a little like the fox guarding
the hen house, quite frankly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just feels backwards, especially in
this arena with a history of not being
[SPEAKER_07]: truthful on issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why would we then take the same people and
have them conduct the research and then
[SPEAKER_07]: say, oh, you know, this is safe?
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_36]: Well, there are a lot of contradictions in
the history of tobacco control.
[SPEAKER_36]: And I think this whole vaping epidemic is
making us try to examine everything from
[SPEAKER_36]: what we know and what we're seeing now.
[SPEAKER_36]: I just want to point out that some of
these T-Corps can serve in terms of
[SPEAKER_36]: independent review.
[SPEAKER_36]: So I've had colleagues at UC San Francisco
where there's a new product called Icos
[SPEAKER_36]: that is a heat not burn product.
[SPEAKER_36]: It's not vaping.
[SPEAKER_36]: It's heating.
[SPEAKER_36]: And they submitted through the FDA
approval to market.
[SPEAKER_36]: And the folks at these centers looked at
the data independently and came to some
[SPEAKER_36]: different conclusions.
[SPEAKER_36]: So for example, this product that heats
not burns tobacco versus regular
[SPEAKER_36]: cigarettes, when they looked at the
industry data, they showed there was
[SPEAKER_36]: actually 200 to 1,000 percent higher of
over 50 constituents out of 100 chemical
[SPEAKER_36]: constituents in this heat not burn product
compared to regular cigarettes and even
[SPEAKER_36]: higher liver function tests, liver
inflammation from blood tests than regular
[SPEAKER_36]: cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_36]: So I think these T-Corps that are helping
the FDA understand what is important data
[SPEAKER_36]: for regulatory science play very critical
roles.
[SPEAKER_36]: But they are not industry.
[SPEAKER_36]: They are typically universities that are
providing data and also can help with
[SPEAKER_36]: independent review of data as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the interest of time, I do have some
other comments.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to hit on them.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know we've got a lot of big agenda
ahead of us here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think with regards to Mr. Lowe's,
you talked about really a small number of
[SPEAKER_07]: cities that have actually taken action.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think in a short amount of time,
the fact that almost 10% of California
[SPEAKER_07]: cities have taken some action on flavors I
think is significant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think you're going to see that
number grow if there is an action from
[SPEAKER_07]: either the federal government or the
state.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think part of that is just people
saying, whoa, we got a problem here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to do something.
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe it's not the right thing to do,
but it's better than doing nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think that you're going to see
more and more of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I, too, hear that this is like the number
one issue in school, vaping.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it isn't distinguished between vaping
tobacco and vaping cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's vaping.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all lumped together.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the number one issue I hear from
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have done a marvelous job on
education-related tobacco.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it shows by the number of the
percentage and how that actual traditional
[SPEAKER_07]: tobacco use had continued to go down.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the stark change between 2017 and 18
and then now into 19, I've got to wonder
[SPEAKER_07]: if it isn't just because of the trendy
little device.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those original devices were pretty clunky
and big and hard to hide.
[SPEAKER_07]: And mom would see that, what the heck is
this thing?
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's a much easier to conceal
something like the Juul devices.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that makes it cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wonder how much of that is an issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think now we're also, we are hearing now
that in the public health emergency,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll call it right now, with the illnesses
that are happening, kids are taking a more
[SPEAKER_07]: cautious approach about that, some kids
anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Females more than males because I think
guys think they're invincible,
[SPEAKER_07]: period.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think that at least for new
starts and those that are currently or
[SPEAKER_07]: quote unquote addicted continue to do that
because it's an addiction.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's almost impossible to walk away from.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think one of the challenges that we face
in the education, certainly in the
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis space, is the promise of Prop 64
was revenue for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have a time lag now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the revenue isn't what we expected
from the taxes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we're kind of a little bit behind
the scenes on that, from my perspective.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we don't have programs either.
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe we piggyback off of the
successful programs that you've been
[SPEAKER_07]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the resources to move that haven't
been as available yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a son who's now 23.
[SPEAKER_07]: He said throughout middle school and high
school that cannabis was much more
[SPEAKER_07]: accessible and much more consumed than
tobacco was.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the numbers that you're talking
about usage doesn't surprise me too much
[SPEAKER_07]: based on that and what I hear from other
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as far as taxation, whether we're
taxing nicotine products or cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: products, maybe even different labels.
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe we go at some point to,
I think isn't there some sort of a sticker
[SPEAKER_07]: or something on tobacco products?
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we go that way with cannabis at some
point.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that doesn't help us with the illicit
market.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that I think will continue to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll help distinguish between the two
markets.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know that that helps us with
the illicit market until there's better
[SPEAKER_07]: enforcement.
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, that's smart.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to comment, I threw a lot
out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, most of it wasn't a question.
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, thank you for your comments.
[SPEAKER_27]: I do have two follow-up comments.
[SPEAKER_27]: So one is on the cool factor of these
devices.
[SPEAKER_27]: Certainly, it's very cool.
[SPEAKER_27]: We work with young people who are engaged
in working on these ordinances in their
[SPEAKER_27]: local communities.
[SPEAKER_27]: And they have come and shared with us that
they shy away from telling their peers
[SPEAKER_27]: what they're working on because it's not
cool to be an anti-tobacco person right
[SPEAKER_27]: now because vaping has become the norm.
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's an issue.
[SPEAKER_27]: But the issue is that even if it was just
a cool trend for a little bit,
[SPEAKER_27]: it's a cool trend with a highly addictive
solution.
[SPEAKER_27]: So now young people are addicted.
[SPEAKER_27]: So even if they don't want to use it
anymore, as you had mentioned,
[SPEAKER_27]: this is an addiction, not a habit.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so now we're dealing with something
that was cool who has created a new
[SPEAKER_27]: generation of nicotine addicts.
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's a big issue.
[SPEAKER_27]: The other thing, we've been talking a lot
about vaping, as that's the intent of this
[SPEAKER_27]: hearing.
[SPEAKER_27]: But also just to note that the flavors,
that we saw cigarette smoking going down
[SPEAKER_27]: over the last many years.
[SPEAKER_27]: And much of that can be attributed to FDA
and removing the flavors.
[SPEAKER_27]: It can be attributed to the amazing work
that's happened here in California.
[SPEAKER_27]: But it's important to note that tobacco
use of other products was not changing or
[SPEAKER_27]: was increasing with youth and adults.
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's the other flavor tobacco
products.
[SPEAKER_27]: And oftentimes, young people will smoke
their marijuana with a flavored cigar
[SPEAKER_27]: wrapper.
[SPEAKER_27]: And so the connection there is all of the
flavored tobacco.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not simply flavored nicotine
solutions.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's an issue with young people.
[SPEAKER_27]: It's the flavoring in all of the products.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it seems our comments have drawn up
more questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Mr. McCarty and then Mr. Rivas.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, the first thing about the cities I
just wanted to mention, Dr. Wood,
[SPEAKER_17]: is there's 10% right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I would say the population-wise,
it's probably close to 25, 30 with LA,
[SPEAKER_17]: San Francisco, LA County, the city of LA,
on the verge, and other big cities.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so some of the rules are different.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's one thing, like we saw with
plastic bags and menu labeling.
[SPEAKER_17]: If we have all these jurisdictions with
slightly different laws, it's mass
[SPEAKER_17]: confusion for consumers.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think industry is probably enough.
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's have one statewide policy.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_17]: But on the tax skin regulation,
I get what you're saying, Chairman Gray.
[SPEAKER_17]: But there's some products that when
there's moderate use, taxing regulation
[SPEAKER_17]: oversight makes sense, like alcohol,
moderate use.
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't tax, regulate, and have policy
for cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine,
[SPEAKER_17]: because we know it's unsafe for any subset
of humans, kids especially.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the safety thing is the question
here.
[SPEAKER_17]: And one thing we haven't talked about yet,
and I want to ask you, last question here,
[SPEAKER_17]: is the tobacco minor setting is very
different than this product, or the
[SPEAKER_17]: nicotine.
[SPEAKER_17]: The high dosage has a huge impact on young
people and their development.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's still the depression, anxiety,
and behavioral issues.
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's one young man that's suing
Juul, talking about what led to his
[SPEAKER_17]: lifestyle change.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's a public health issue that has
cost upon society and health care costs.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so that piece we haven't really talked
about yet.
[SPEAKER_17]: Is the impact it has just on the actual
young people.
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you talk about that for a second?
[SPEAKER_36]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_36]: So I think when the Surgeon General is
talking about the developing brain,
[SPEAKER_36]: he's also addressing mental health issues.
[SPEAKER_36]: And I thank you for bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_36]: And it's nicotine and marijuana.
[SPEAKER_36]: And it's not to say that it's not
important for older people.
[SPEAKER_36]: It's just that this is especially
important for the next generation.
[SPEAKER_36]: So I think those are very excellent points
you bring up.
[SPEAKER_36]: That it's not just physical health.
[SPEAKER_36]: These pulmonary injury cases are alarming.
[SPEAKER_36]: But it's the whole person that we need to
look at.
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Rivas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate the information.
[SPEAKER_05]: I come from, prior to my time in the
assembly, I was a school discipline
[SPEAKER_05]: manager.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I saw this epidemic right before my
eyes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw anything and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so obviously, this is a very complex,
complex issue and a discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: We probably make it worse by all the
dialogue you've heard up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably made it more complex.
[SPEAKER_05]: But certainly it seems like we're racing
against the clock.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like this epidemic is getting
worse day by day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And based on all this conversation up
here, it's very easy to get lost in the
[SPEAKER_05]: weeds of this complex issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's obviously a lot that we do not
know.
[SPEAKER_05]: But based on what we do know, we do know
that there is a public health problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: That there's a crisis.
[SPEAKER_05]: That we have more than 1,000 cases of lung
illness that have been reported in people
[SPEAKER_05]: under 35 years of age.
[SPEAKER_05]: 16% of those patients are under 18 years
old.
[SPEAKER_05]: 21% are between 18 and 20 years of age.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as of this morning, 29 deaths related
to this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously, as I mentioned,
it's easy to get in the weeds based on
[SPEAKER_05]: this conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talk about enforcement.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could talk about flavors and
non-flavors.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could talk about THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could talk about the nicotine.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could talk about taxation.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the only thing that we really do know,
the one thing we can point to is that the
[SPEAKER_05]: one thing we could point to related to the
cause of all these illnesses and the
[SPEAKER_05]: deaths is vaping.
[SPEAKER_05]: That all reported patients have a history
of using vapor products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so to me, standing up here,
we've got all the information.
[SPEAKER_05]: We look at what other states are doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know what our governor did through
executive action.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it seems to me, absent a complete van
of all vaping products, flavor,
[SPEAKER_05]: not flavor, all vaping products,
nothing is going to be, unless we have
[SPEAKER_05]: that, nothing is going to be enough to
prevent future illnesses until we
[SPEAKER_05]: absolutely know what is causing these
illnesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so in the meantime that we're rolling
out all these public awareness campaigns,
[SPEAKER_05]: that we are adopting regulations and build
a policy framework, a regulatory framework
[SPEAKER_05]: to address this crisis and find the most
effective solution or however many ideas
[SPEAKER_05]: it's going to take, unless we have an
absolute ban, it seems to me that we're
[SPEAKER_05]: going to keep reading about more
illnesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to keep reading about more
deaths.
[SPEAKER_05]: Aside from the public health cost impact,
the treatment of some of these people is
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be astronomical.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I represent a rural area where we lack
health care services.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so understanding availability of
treatment, let alone the cost,
[SPEAKER_05]: is a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess my question is, absent a
complete ban, this is only going to get
[SPEAKER_05]: worse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or not true?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_36]: I think I'll comment that every week my
slides are outdated because these cases
[SPEAKER_36]: are rising.
[SPEAKER_36]: And this is, these are young people who,
and some of them, as you're noting,
[SPEAKER_36]: hospitalized in the ICU, very expensive,
cost of care.
[SPEAKER_36]: They're lucky they're young because they
can walk out.
[SPEAKER_36]: The people who are dying are middle-aged.
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, how do we stop this?
[SPEAKER_36]: I think this is why we're coming together
today.
[SPEAKER_36]: But to anticipate the health professions
are going to be able to take care of this,
[SPEAKER_36]: it has to be more upstream.
[SPEAKER_36]: And as I think everyone's noted today,
a very comprehensive approach.
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, I think it's the cat's out of
the bag already.
[SPEAKER_36]: And, you know, what can we all do together
to help control the epidemic?
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you both very much for kicking this
off.
[SPEAKER_07]: We much, very much appreciate the
information.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Chairman Lo, we'll introduce our
second panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as we then clear the table for
the next panel, the next panel is how
[SPEAKER_03]: vaping and electronic cigarettes are
regulated in California and what more
[SPEAKER_03]: needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our panelists, Susan Finnelli,
Acting Director of the Department of
[SPEAKER_03]: Public Health, Lori Ajax, Chief of the
Bureau of Cannabis Control, Nicholas
[SPEAKER_03]: Maduros, Director for the California
Department of Tax and Fee Administration,
[SPEAKER_03]: Karen Leaf, Senior Assistant Attorney
General for Tobacco Litigation and
[SPEAKER_03]: Enforcement Section.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, Herinder Kaput,
Senior Assistant Attorney General for the
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis Control Section.
[SPEAKER_03]: And members and colleagues, just as a
point of notification that it's been an
[SPEAKER_03]: hour and 45 minutes in our first panel
discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that we have this panel and an
additional panel after that, followed by
[SPEAKER_03]: public comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that we'll try to be very direct
with some of our comments and the interest
[SPEAKER_03]: of time to be able to get as much
information as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So having said that, might we first begin
then in order here?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we begin with Susan Finnelli,
please.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good afternoon, Chairs and members.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Susan Finnelli, Acting Director for
the California Department of Public
[SPEAKER_12]: Health.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been asked today to speak about the
role of the Department of Public Health in
[SPEAKER_12]: tobacco and vaping regulation.
[SPEAKER_12]: First, I want to start with, as you're
aware, Governor Newsom did issue the
[SPEAKER_12]: executive order and gave specifically
asked the Department of Public Health to
[SPEAKER_12]: launch a $20 million statewide digital and
social media public awareness campaign to
[SPEAKER_12]: educate youth, young adults and parents
about the health risks of vaping.
[SPEAKER_12]: Developing recommendations to reduce the
availability of vaping devices to persons
[SPEAKER_12]: under 21 years of age, including the
establishment of warning signs about the
[SPEAKER_12]: health risks of vaping, both in
advertising and at retailers.
[SPEAKER_12]: Increased enforcement regarding illegal
sales of vaping products and specifically
[SPEAKER_12]: e-liquid flavors.
[SPEAKER_12]: To youth.
[SPEAKER_12]: In addition, CDPH was charged to make
recommendations regarding the
[SPEAKER_12]: establishment of standards for nicotine
content and uniform packaging for purposes
[SPEAKER_12]: of including nicotine content in the
calculation of taxes.
[SPEAKER_12]: For today, no recommendations have been
finalized at this time.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we continue to explore all
comprehensive set of options as we look to
[SPEAKER_12]: address this issue.
[SPEAKER_12]: We will release an advertising campaign
dissuading young people from vaping.
[SPEAKER_12]: Raising awareness of the new outbreak
associated with vaping and denormalizing
[SPEAKER_12]: all tobacco use in California.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that campaign is set to start next
week.
[SPEAKER_12]: As you heard this afternoon from the first
panel, the numbers around youth vaping are
[SPEAKER_12]: very concerning.
[SPEAKER_12]: In 2018, the high school smoking
prevalence in California was 2% compared
[SPEAKER_12]: to 8% nationally, but we're afraid that
progress is going to go the other way.
[SPEAKER_12]: At the same time, we are seeing this
alarming rise in the number of school-age
[SPEAKER_12]: children using electronic cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_12]: E-cigarettes were the most commonly used
tobacco product among California high
[SPEAKER_12]: school students.
[SPEAKER_12]: 86.4% of high school tobacco users
reported using a flavored tobacco product.
[SPEAKER_12]: The cost of smoking in California is
estimated at $18.1 billion or $4,603 per
[SPEAKER_12]: smoker.
[SPEAKER_12]: All Californians are paying these costs,
not just the smokers.
[SPEAKER_12]: Most recently, this vaping outbreak raises
greater concerns for youth as well as
[SPEAKER_12]: adults.
[SPEAKER_12]: In the next panel, Dr. Charity Dean from
our Acting State Health Officer will share
[SPEAKER_12]: information about the outbreak and the
health impacts.
[SPEAKER_12]: So next I'm going to turn to our role in
regulating both tobacco and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: First off, I want to start by emphasizing
that much of the regulatory control,
[SPEAKER_12]: as you heard in the first panel,
resides with the Federal Food and Drug
[SPEAKER_12]: Administration for Tobacco Products.
[SPEAKER_12]: CDPH programs focus on education,
prevention, and use reduction in addition
[SPEAKER_12]: to enforcement and limiting access to
youth.
[SPEAKER_12]: CDPH administers two tobacco-related
programs, the California Tobacco Control
[SPEAKER_12]: Program and the Stop Tobacco Access to
Kids Enforcement Act, or STAKE.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Tobacco Control Program is
comprehensive statewide tobacco use
[SPEAKER_12]: prevention and reduction program.
[SPEAKER_12]: It conducts health education interventions
and behavior change programs at the state
[SPEAKER_12]: level in the community and in other
non-school settings with a focus on
[SPEAKER_12]: changing the role, the community norms
influencing behavioral change regarding
[SPEAKER_12]: tobacco use.
[SPEAKER_12]: This program consists of a statewide media
campaign, statewide and community tobacco
[SPEAKER_12]: use prevention and reduction programs
conducted by local health departments and
[SPEAKER_12]: nonprofit agencies and statewide
tobacco-related surveillance and
[SPEAKER_12]: evaluation activities.
[SPEAKER_12]: Through this program, CDPH provides money
for conducting smoking cessation programs
[SPEAKER_12]: and approximately $14.3 million annually
to local jurisdictions and grant projects.
[SPEAKER_12]: The single largest provider of smoking
cessation assistance in California is the
[SPEAKER_12]: Smokers Helpline that operates with a
budget of $9 million annually from CDPH
[SPEAKER_12]: and receives another $1.4 million from
First 5 California.
[SPEAKER_12]: The California Smokers Helpline provides
cessation counseling and support in seven
[SPEAKER_12]: languages and for the hearing impaired.
[SPEAKER_12]: It offers support via the telephone,
chat, text messaging, and apps.
[SPEAKER_12]: It also provides counseling tailored to
e-cigarette and smokeless tobacco users
[SPEAKER_12]: and it provides assistance to teens and
pregnant women.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pursuant to the executive order,
our tobacco control program will increase
[SPEAKER_12]: surveillance activities to monitor
awareness and perceptions of vaping of the
[SPEAKER_12]: outbreak.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Stop Tobacco Access to Kids
Enforcement Act is the state program is a
[SPEAKER_12]: law enforcement program focused on
decreasing illegal tobacco sales to
[SPEAKER_12]: persons under 21 years of age by
conducting inspections at tobacco retail
[SPEAKER_12]: facilities, awarding grants to local law
enforcement agencies for tobacco retail
[SPEAKER_12]: inspections and training, and conducting
tobacco-related retail inspections for the
[SPEAKER_12]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_12]: Food and Drug Administration.
[SPEAKER_12]: We will be increasing the compliance
checks through the Stake Act with the aim
[SPEAKER_12]: of reducing illegal sales to youth.
[SPEAKER_12]: Prop 56 provides an additional $6 million
to increase our enforcement activities
[SPEAKER_12]: under stake.
[SPEAKER_12]: In 2016, the minimum legal tobacco sale
age was moved to age 21.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yet in 2018, the statewide rate of illegal
tobacco sales to underage adults was 19%.
[SPEAKER_12]: The rate of illegal tobacco sales was
higher for e-cigarettes at 22%.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now I'm going to turn to a very different
role that we have in manufacturing
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: The Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch is
very different in contrast to tobacco
[SPEAKER_12]: control where the majority of regulatory
control rests with the federal FDA.
[SPEAKER_12]: California regulates nearly every aspect
of the state's cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_12]: CDPH houses the Manufactured Cannabis
Safety Branch, which enforces a strict
[SPEAKER_12]: regulatory framework established through
Prop 64, Medicinal and Adult Use Cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: Regulatory Safety Act, MALCURSA,
and regulations for cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_12]: This authority includes general cannabis
manufacturing oversight, packaging and
[SPEAKER_12]: labeling, advertising and marketing,
manufacturing and regulations regarding
[SPEAKER_12]: prohibiting products and emergency orders.
[SPEAKER_12]: CDPH and other state departments and
agencies continue to work to bring
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis businesses into the legal
marketplace, but as we acknowledged in the
[SPEAKER_12]: first panel, that's still a problem.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just so you know, MALCURSA has built-in
provisions that reduce youth access and
[SPEAKER_12]: prevent products with harmful contaminants
from being sold to consumers.
[SPEAKER_12]: These include age-restricted retailers.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cannabis retail stores are only available
for adult 21 years of age and older.
[SPEAKER_12]: Testing requirements for pesticides,
heavy metals, microbials, and residual
[SPEAKER_12]: solvents under the BCC.
[SPEAKER_12]: Government warning statements outlines a
government warning statement that must be
[SPEAKER_12]: on every cannabis product and alerts
consumers to potential effects.
[SPEAKER_12]: Advertising restrictions and in
regulations, we further clarified those
[SPEAKER_12]: statutory protections to require good
manufacturing practices by cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: manufacturers, requirement to disclose all
of the ingredients, prohibitions that
[SPEAKER_12]: labels and products cannot be attractive
to youth, manufacturers cannot add
[SPEAKER_12]: nicotine or caffeine to their products,
requiring the universal symbol on vape
[SPEAKER_12]: cartridges, and a prohibition against
health claims on those products.
[SPEAKER_12]: In closing, we continue to work through
the Health and Human Services Agency and
[SPEAKER_12]: the Governor's Office to address the
outbreak and to reduce youth use of
[SPEAKER_12]: tobacco and cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_12]: We look forward to continuing our work
with the legislature with stakeholders to
[SPEAKER_12]: address the public health concerns.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much for the opportunity to
present today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms. Ajax.
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_31]: Chairs and committee members, thank you
for inviting me to participate in this
[SPEAKER_31]: important discussion.
[SPEAKER_31]: My name is Lori Ajax, and I'm the chief of
the Bureau of Cannabis Control.
[SPEAKER_31]: As one of the state agencies responsible
for regulating commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_31]: licenses, including distribution,
micro businesses, retailers, and testing
[SPEAKER_31]: labs, the Bureau of Cannabis Control has
been closely following the outbreak of
[SPEAKER_31]: health illnesses being reported across the
country that have been linked to vaping.
[SPEAKER_31]: The Bureau supports Governor Newsom's
executive order in September, taking
[SPEAKER_31]: direct action to address this public
health crisis.
[SPEAKER_31]: All cannabis and cannabis products legally
sold in California must come through a
[SPEAKER_31]: supply chain of only licensed cannabis
businesses, starting at cultivation and
[SPEAKER_31]: ending with the sale to consumer.
[SPEAKER_31]: This is important because all licensees
must comply with requirements that put
[SPEAKER_31]: public safety first.
[SPEAKER_31]: The most crucial public health related
step in the legal supply chain is
[SPEAKER_31]: mandatory regulatory compliance testing.
[SPEAKER_31]: Before any cannabis or cannabis product
can be sold by licensed retailers in
[SPEAKER_31]: California, it must go through rigorous
testing for contaminants such as
[SPEAKER_31]: pesticide, mold, heavy metals,
processing chemicals, residual solvents,
[SPEAKER_31]: and other harmful ingredients.
[SPEAKER_31]: For example, cannabis and cannabis
products are tested for 66 pesticides and
[SPEAKER_31]: 20 residual solvents and processing
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_31]: In conjunction with the Department of
Pesticide Regulation, the Bureau has set
[SPEAKER_31]: levels for these contaminants that cannot
be exceeded in cannabis or cannabis
[SPEAKER_31]: products.
[SPEAKER_31]: These levels are set based on what are
considered a safe amount for human
[SPEAKER_31]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_31]: Only after a testing laboratory has
confirmed that the cannabis or cannabis
[SPEAKER_31]: product does not exceed any of these
limits, can it be distributed to retailers
[SPEAKER_31]: for sale to consumers.
[SPEAKER_31]: Cannabis and cannabis products that cannot
meet testing standards must be destroyed.
[SPEAKER_31]: While no single substance or product has
yet been linked to the cases involving
[SPEAKER_31]: vaping-related illnesses, it has been
reported that many of the cases involve
[SPEAKER_31]: the use of THC-containing products,
particularly from the unlicensed market.
[SPEAKER_31]: Therefore, to assist with addressing the
vaping health issues, the Bureau,
[SPEAKER_31]: in cooperation with other state entities,
is focused on unlicensed activities
[SPEAKER_31]: that involve the use of THC-containing
products.
[SPEAKER_31]: The Bureau, the Cannabis Enforcement Unit
within the Department of Consumer Affairs,
[SPEAKER_31]: the California Department of Public
Health, the California Department of Tax
[SPEAKER_31]: and Fee Administration, and local law
enforcement agencies are currently working
[SPEAKER_31]: together to identify and shut down
unlicensed retailers, distributors,
[SPEAKER_31]: and manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_31]: The Cannabis Enforcement Unit provides
sworn peace officer service to investigate
[SPEAKER_31]: unlicensed activity complaints received by
the Bureau.
[SPEAKER_31]: The Bureau and the Cannabis Enforcement
Unit are working together to prioritize
[SPEAKER_31]: complaints involving illegal cannabis
vaping products.
[SPEAKER_31]: In the last six weeks, the Cannabis
Enforcement Unit served 12 search warrants
[SPEAKER_31]: that involve illegally manufactured vaping
products.
[SPEAKER_31]: The search warrants were served on
unlicensed cannabis retailers,
[SPEAKER_31]: distributors, and manufacturers in
conjunction with local law enforcement
[SPEAKER_31]: agencies.
[SPEAKER_31]: During these operations, 21,000 pounds of
cannabis goods were seized with a retail
[SPEAKER_31]: value of $51 million.
[SPEAKER_31]: This included the seizure of 20,000 vape
pens and vape pen cartridges.
[SPEAKER_31]: The most recent case you may have heard in
the media is about the seizure of cushy
[SPEAKER_31]: punch products.
[SPEAKER_31]: I can assure you that the situation is
being actively investigated.
[SPEAKER_31]: However, I'm not able to provide any
further details about this during my
[SPEAKER_31]: testimony today, as this investigation is
ongoing.
[SPEAKER_31]: In addition to stopping unlicensed
retailers and counterfeit cannabis
[SPEAKER_31]: products, it is critical to educate
consumers about how to identify a licensed
[SPEAKER_31]: retailer.
[SPEAKER_31]: The Bureau is overseeing a statewide
public information campaign called Hashtag
[SPEAKER_31]: Get Weedwise.
[SPEAKER_31]: The campaign includes extensive outreach,
educating consumers about the risks
[SPEAKER_31]: associated with cannabis purchase from
unlicensed businesses, and ensuring they
[SPEAKER_31]: understand that only cannabis and cannabis
products purchased from licensed retailers
[SPEAKER_31]: have passed state regulatory testing.
[SPEAKER_31]: The Bureau is highlighting how a consumer
can use the capotcheck.com website to
[SPEAKER_31]: verify the business's license before
making a purchase.
[SPEAKER_31]: The campaign also is making it clear to
unlicensed businesses that they will be
[SPEAKER_31]: prosecuted for their activities unless
they cease operations or get licensed.
[SPEAKER_31]: The Bureau supports the governor's efforts
to confront the youth vaping epidemic and
[SPEAKER_31]: address this ongoing public health crisis.
[SPEAKER_31]: The Bureau will continue to work with the
legislature to ensure these products are
[SPEAKER_31]: safe for consumers.
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you again for having me here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Nicholas Maduras from the California
Department of Tax and Fee Administration.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Chairman and members of the
committees.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Nick Maduras.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the Director of the California
Department of Tax and Fee Administration,
[SPEAKER_08]: CDTFA.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a mouthful to say the California
Department of Tax and Fee Administration.
[SPEAKER_08]: CDTFA administers about 37 tax programs
for the state of California.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our largest is the sales and use tax
program, but we also administer the
[SPEAKER_08]: tobacco taxes for the state of California.
[SPEAKER_08]: Today, I'll focus on those two programs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to first start out by discussing
how those tax programs work, then briefly
[SPEAKER_08]: outline our enforcement methods.
[SPEAKER_08]: And lastly, I'll highlight some of the
challenges we face as we crack down on
[SPEAKER_08]: untaxed and illegal vape products,
both in the tobacco and cannabis realms.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the tobacco tax programs, we have three
basic categories of tax programs.
[SPEAKER_08]: We administer cigarette taxes,
tobacco product taxes, and cigarette and
[SPEAKER_08]: tobacco products licensing fees.
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year, the department brought in and
administered about $74.4 billion in tax
[SPEAKER_08]: revenue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of that, $2.1 billion is related to these
tobacco tax and fee programs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Other tobacco products, which are the
non-cigarette taxes, accounted for about
[SPEAKER_08]: 13% of that revenue, or $200 million.
[SPEAKER_08]: $181 million in FY18-19.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are taxes derived from,
historically, it was cigars, smoking,
[SPEAKER_08]: tobacco, chewing tobacco, and snuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: With Prop 56 in 2016, electronic
cigarettes and vape products were added to
[SPEAKER_08]: that definition of tobacco products.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it is only since then that we have
been taxing those vaping products as OTP
[SPEAKER_08]: or other tobacco products.
[SPEAKER_08]: We estimate that last year, the tax
revenue from those programs, from vaping
[SPEAKER_08]: products, amounted to about $56 million.
[SPEAKER_08]: Starting next year, we will have exact
numbers as we're changing our returns to
[SPEAKER_08]: require that vaping products be separately
listed on the tax returns.
[SPEAKER_08]: The rate on OTP, including vaping
products, is set based on the tobacco,
[SPEAKER_08]: the cigarette tax rate.
[SPEAKER_08]: So cigarettes are taxed at $2.87 per pack
in the state of California.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, it started out as three cents back in
the 50s, and we're up to $2.87.
[SPEAKER_08]: What we do annually is we take that $2.87
and we add 50 cents to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're at $3.37 per pack.
[SPEAKER_08]: We divide that by 20, which is the number
of cigarettes in a single pack.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get 16.85 cents.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we divide that number each year
by the average weighted cost of a single
[SPEAKER_08]: cigarette.
[SPEAKER_08]: This year, that means that OTP,
including all of these tobacco vape
[SPEAKER_08]: products, are taxed at a rate of 59.27%.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, one curious thing about the way the
California tax is are set up is that that
[SPEAKER_08]: average wholesale cost, which is the
denominator in the equation, rises each
[SPEAKER_08]: year because of inflation, which means
that the tax rate on other tobacco
[SPEAKER_08]: products actually goes down each year.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is, to me, a strange outcome that we
have.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, in addition to that tax,
we also have the Cigarette and Tobacco
[SPEAKER_08]: Products Licensing Program.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which licenses annually about 31,000
retailers, 300 wholesalers, and 800
[SPEAKER_08]: distributors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, on the tobacco side of the equation,
we administer the sales and use tax
[SPEAKER_08]: program, which applies to these tobacco
sales, as well as the excise tax and the
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivation tax.
[SPEAKER_08]: Last fiscal year, all of those programs
together brought in about $480 million,
[SPEAKER_08]: and to date, since adult legal cannabis
have brought in about $637 million.
[SPEAKER_08]: The excise tax is, again, a very
complicated one at the moment.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 15% based on the wholesale cost plus
markup rate that CDTFA determines each
[SPEAKER_08]: year, which is currently set at 60%.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not a 15% on the actual price paid
by the consumer.
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be much less than 15%.
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be much higher because,
obviously, the actual markup varies in
[SPEAKER_08]: transactions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, so those are the tax programs we
administer.
[SPEAKER_08]: How we enforce them, we have three basic
methods, inspections, investigations,
[SPEAKER_08]: and audits.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have 10 inspection teams dedicated to
tobacco enforcement, and now, through a
[SPEAKER_08]: BCP last year, to cannabis enforcement as
well around the state.
[SPEAKER_08]: Their job day in and day out is to do
inspections of retailers to make sure that
[SPEAKER_08]: all of the products in those stores is tax
paid.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the case of cigarettes, as was
mentioned earlier, all of the tax paid
[SPEAKER_08]: materials have stamps.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every pack of cigarettes in the state has
to have a tax stamp, and actually,
[SPEAKER_08]: the tax is paid when the distributor
purchases that stamp in places at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: For other materials, our inspectors go in
and have to ask for the invoices,
[SPEAKER_08]: and the retailers have to prove to us that
the material is tax paid.
[SPEAKER_08]: If they can't prove it, then we seize the
material.
[SPEAKER_08]: Since July of this year, our inspectors
have done about 2,500 inspections.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the past two months alone, we've done
146 inspections of vaping specific
[SPEAKER_08]: retailers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of those 146, we've had 17 seizures of
products amounting to about $290,000 of
[SPEAKER_08]: value.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, that's on the tobacco side of the
house.
[SPEAKER_08]: On the cannabis front, we've done about
200 inspections since July and
[SPEAKER_08]: participated in 75 search warrants,
as Lori mentioned.
[SPEAKER_08]: We partner often with BCC and Consumer
Affairs, as well as local law enforcement
[SPEAKER_08]: all around the state.
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition to those visits, our outreach
program, because of the scope of the
[SPEAKER_08]: problem we're dealing with, we've had our
outreach teams around the state also doing
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis visits.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've done about 758 since July.
[SPEAKER_08]: In those cases, we're actually visiting
not just permit holders, we're visiting
[SPEAKER_08]: any cannabis seller that we can find.
[SPEAKER_08]: Due to sites like Weedmaps and others,
people aren't hiding their retail
[SPEAKER_08]: activity.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some real challenges on both of
these fronts, and I'd like to just address
[SPEAKER_08]: those very briefly.
[SPEAKER_08]: On the tobacco side, the lack of stamping
outside of cigarettes is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's much easier to go into a store and
see that all of the product is stamped,
[SPEAKER_08]: and actually the stamps contain
information our inspectors have,
[SPEAKER_08]: devices which allow them to read the
stamps, and you can tell who the
[SPEAKER_08]: distributor was, when it was distributed,
a lot of background information on each of
[SPEAKER_08]: those stamps.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, on the vaping side, the tax rate is
lower, I think, than you would anticipate,
[SPEAKER_08]: because the tax is based on the wholesale
cost.
[SPEAKER_08]: The wholesale cost of some of these
products is relatively low, and so if a
[SPEAKER_08]: vaping cartridge is the equivalent of one
pack of cigarettes, in many instances,
[SPEAKER_08]: the tax on a vaping cartridge is much less
than the $2.87 tax on a pack of
[SPEAKER_08]: cigarettes, so that's an issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're also seeing there's a lot of ease of
market entry in the vaping sector.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've seen people can go online,
order materials for their stores,
[SPEAKER_08]: they can sell the nicotine liquid
separately from the other liquids,
[SPEAKER_08]: and people can mix them at home.
[SPEAKER_08]: Only the nicotine liquid is taxed
currently, not any of the other vaping
[SPEAKER_08]: flavored juices.
[SPEAKER_08]: If they're sold separately, once they're
combined, then it's all taxed,
[SPEAKER_08]: but otherwise only the nicotine liquid is
taxed.
[SPEAKER_08]: The penalties have historically been
pretty low for noncompliance, and that
[SPEAKER_08]: actually goes on the cannabis side as
well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our inspectors, at least, are operating in
a world where the penalties are often
[SPEAKER_08]: misdemeanors, where it's very difficult to
get local law enforcement to even want to
[SPEAKER_08]: get involved in a misdemeanor case,
and the fines are pretty low, even for
[SPEAKER_08]: failure to let our inspectors in to see
your books.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a $5,000 fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: If somebody's operating on the far side of
the law and making millions of dollars
[SPEAKER_08]: acting illegally, the prospect of my
auditors with their pocket protectors
[SPEAKER_08]: showing up and knocking on the door,
and the potential misdemeanor that,
[SPEAKER_08]: in some cases, has been reduced down to
$400 by local courts is not a real threat
[SPEAKER_08]: to many of these folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: On the cannabis side, the illegal market
is very large.
[SPEAKER_08]: The way we have traditionally approached
enforcement is cumbersome and slow.
[SPEAKER_08]: It relies largely on the criminal justice
system, which is slow and difficult.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's difficult to build the cases.
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes time.
[SPEAKER_08]: With thousands of illegal operators around
the state, I don't think that's a method
[SPEAKER_08]: that serves the state best, and we're
looking at other ways, other things that
[SPEAKER_08]: we can do.
[SPEAKER_08]: With tobacco, we're also studying
stamping.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're working currently on a thorough
review in light of the governor's
[SPEAKER_08]: executive order, which we'll be presenting
to him at the end of this month,
[SPEAKER_08]: that we'll review all of these options and
see if we can't find a better way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I look forward to your questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, two representatives from the
attorney general's office, one in the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis control section and also in the
tobacco litigation and enforcement
[SPEAKER_03]: section.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much, Chairman Lowe,
as well as Chairman Wood and Chairman Gray
[SPEAKER_20]: and committee members.
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is Karen Leif.
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm here on behalf of Attorney General
Javier Bucera.
[SPEAKER_20]: I am the head of the tobacco litigation
and enforcement section within the
[SPEAKER_20]: California attorney general's office.
[SPEAKER_20]: My colleague here, Harinder Kapoor,
is the head of cannabis control section
[SPEAKER_20]: within the California attorney general's
office.
[SPEAKER_20]: So the two of us are here to represent the
attorney general, and my colleague
[SPEAKER_20]: Harinder will be speaking to you about the
cannabis side of the vaping issues while I
[SPEAKER_20]: will focus my remarks on the tobacco side.
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me say that we're very grateful to
have this hearing because it calls
[SPEAKER_20]: attention to what we view as a very
important public health issue.
[SPEAKER_20]: Others have already spoken to the severe
health issues that have surfaced with the
[SPEAKER_20]: use of vaping devices in recent months,
as well as the huge spike in underage use
[SPEAKER_20]: of electronic cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think I need to repeat that at
this time except to remind all of us that
[SPEAKER_20]: according to the 2019 National Youth
Tobacco Survey preliminary data,
[SPEAKER_20]: we're now nationwide at a point where more
than one out of four high school students
[SPEAKER_20]: is using electronic cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_20]: This is the most popular form of tobacco
use among young people today.
[SPEAKER_20]: And this is, from a public health
standpoint, extremely alarming because it
[SPEAKER_20]: threatens to reverse much of the great
work and progress that has been done over
[SPEAKER_20]: many years to reduce tobacco use in the
United States, the product that kills more
[SPEAKER_20]: Americans than any other product.
[SPEAKER_20]: It is the single largest source of
preventable death and disease in our
[SPEAKER_20]: country.
[SPEAKER_20]: Claiming the lives of 480,000 Americans
every year.
[SPEAKER_20]: And all this has occurred in the face of a
regulatory environment here in California
[SPEAKER_20]: that, at least with respect to tobacco,
is fairly robust.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I will turn my remarks to that now.
[SPEAKER_20]: Under California law, electronic
cigarettes are considered tobacco
[SPEAKER_20]: products.
[SPEAKER_20]: As such, they are subject, as my colleague
here, Nicholas Maduro said, to state
[SPEAKER_20]: excise taxes and state licensing laws,
state smoke-free laws, state underage
[SPEAKER_20]: sales laws, and remote sales laws.
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm sure I haven't given a full list.
[SPEAKER_20]: But there's fairly comprehensive
regulation of electronic cigarettes at the
[SPEAKER_20]: state level.
[SPEAKER_20]: In addition, many local communities have
adopted ordinances to regulate electronic
[SPEAKER_20]: cigarettes in one fashion or another.
[SPEAKER_20]: Mainly this comes in the form of local
retail tobacco license ordinances.
[SPEAKER_20]: But in some instances, it is legislation
that is specifically directed at
[SPEAKER_20]: electronic cigarettes or flavored
products.
[SPEAKER_20]: At least seven counties in more than 30 or
32 cities in the state regulate in this
[SPEAKER_20]: fashion.
[SPEAKER_20]: At the federal level, electronic
cigarettes are regulated, but to a lesser
[SPEAKER_20]: degree.
[SPEAKER_20]: The Federal Food and Drug Administration
has regulatory authority under the Federal
[SPEAKER_20]: Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco
Control Act, which was passed in 2009.
[SPEAKER_20]: And under their deeming regs, electronic
cigarettes are within their regulatory
[SPEAKER_20]: ambit.
[SPEAKER_20]: However, the FDA has adhered to an
enforcement policy which has allowed
[SPEAKER_20]: electronic cigarettes to be sold and
marketed in the United States,
[SPEAKER_20]: including in California, without going
through the required pre-market approval
[SPEAKER_20]: process by the FDA.
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, I have seen in news reports to the
federal government, in fact, that the FDA
[SPEAKER_20]: is reviewing that enforcement policy and
may change it, especially with respect to
[SPEAKER_20]: flavored electronic cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_20]: But we haven't seen anything definitive
from that agency at this point.
[SPEAKER_20]: I would note that electronic cigarettes
are not subject to federal excise taxes,
[SPEAKER_20]: nor are they subject to a number of other
federal laws that apply to other tobacco
[SPEAKER_20]: products, such as the PAC Act,
which governs interstate internet and mail
[SPEAKER_20]: order sales of cigarettes and smokeless
tobacco, or the Federal Contraband
[SPEAKER_20]: Cigarette Trafficking Act, which governs
smuggling of cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_20]: With that, I want to talk about the
Attorney General's own role with respect
[SPEAKER_20]: to tobacco.
[SPEAKER_20]: This role dates back several decades.
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, to really the mid-1990s when
California, among a large number of other
[SPEAKER_20]: states, sued the major cigarette
manufacturers for a host of wrongdoing,
[SPEAKER_20]: but most notably their decades-long
conspiracy to deceive the American people
[SPEAKER_20]: about the health risks of the products and
the addictiveness of nicotine.
[SPEAKER_20]: Those lawsuits were resolved by the Master
Settlement Agreement, which at the time
[SPEAKER_20]: was the largest civil settlement in
American history.
[SPEAKER_20]: It imposes a number of ongoing obligations
on the part of the signatory
[SPEAKER_20]: manufacturers, particularly in the areas
of advertising and marketing, but they
[SPEAKER_20]: also obligate the manufacturers to make
payments to the settling states in
[SPEAKER_20]: perpetuity, so long as they continue to
manufacture and sell their products in the
[SPEAKER_20]: domestic stream of commerce.
[SPEAKER_20]: The California Attorney General's Office
has had a unit now for 20 years that has
[SPEAKER_20]: overseen their compliance with this really
landmark agreement.
[SPEAKER_20]: We have not hesitated to sue individual
manufacturers when we thought that they
[SPEAKER_20]: did not comply with their obligations
under that agreement, so we have sued and
[SPEAKER_20]: won on issues such as youth targeting and
free sampling.
[SPEAKER_20]: We have overseen their compliance with
payment obligations, and they are
[SPEAKER_20]: substantial.
[SPEAKER_20]: To date, California has received $16.5
billion in payments from the signatory
[SPEAKER_20]: manufacturers, and in 2019 alone,
California received just shy of $850
[SPEAKER_20]: million.
[SPEAKER_20]: In addition to making sure that the
companies that are part of the Master
[SPEAKER_20]: Settlement Agreement live up to their
obligations under that agreement,
[SPEAKER_20]: the staff within the California Attorney
General's Office enforces a state law
[SPEAKER_20]: called an escrow statute that applies to
the manufacturers that are not part of
[SPEAKER_20]: that settlement agreement.
[SPEAKER_20]: There are certain obligations that they
have based on their sales here in
[SPEAKER_20]: California.
[SPEAKER_20]: We are thankful we have another state law
called the Tobacco Directory Statute that
[SPEAKER_20]: shores up our ability to enforce both of
those laws.
[SPEAKER_20]: That law obligates the Attorney General's
Office to create and maintain a public
[SPEAKER_20]: list on our website of all the cigarette
manufacturers and brands that are lawful
[SPEAKER_20]: for sale in the state.
[SPEAKER_20]: And there is a screening process that my
staff and I do with respect to every
[SPEAKER_20]: single cigarette manufacturer that wants
to be listed on that directory to make
[SPEAKER_20]: sure that they have satisfied the
statutory requirements, which include a
[SPEAKER_20]: showing that they've complied with their
financial obligations, and they're
[SPEAKER_20]: compliant with other laws such as state
licensing statutes.
[SPEAKER_20]: So we have that as a tool I can tell you,
based on my own experience, that it has
[SPEAKER_20]: served California well.
[SPEAKER_20]: It is a gatekeeping function that has been
very valuable in being able to assure that
[SPEAKER_20]: the cigarettes that are sold in California
are lawful for sale in California and to
[SPEAKER_20]: make those out there in the field easily
identify the rogue brands and rogue
[SPEAKER_20]: manufacturers that qualify as contraband.
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, the MSA, the Tobacco Directory,
and the Esco Scouchet don't apply to
[SPEAKER_20]: electronic cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_20]: That said, the California Attorney
General's Office has been active with
[SPEAKER_20]: respect to electronic cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_20]: Among other things, the California
Attorney General's Office staff have
[SPEAKER_20]: overseen the compliance of electronic
cigarettes sellers that sell over the
[SPEAKER_20]: internet to make sure that they're
compliant with California's Stake Act and
[SPEAKER_20]: other laws that apply to them.
[SPEAKER_20]: And in 2019 so far, this year alone,
we have issued more than 40 warning
[SPEAKER_20]: letters to retailers that are selling
through the internet that have sold to
[SPEAKER_20]: underage customers or are otherwise not
compliant.
[SPEAKER_20]: We have also not hesitated to sue e-cig
companies for other forms of wrongdoing,
[SPEAKER_20]: including false advertising and youth
targeting, and we have judgments against
[SPEAKER_20]: two.
[SPEAKER_20]: We also work closely with other state
agencies, including CDTFA.
[SPEAKER_20]: We share information with them about
businesses that we have reason to think,
[SPEAKER_20]: maybe operating without required state
licenses or potentially violating their
[SPEAKER_20]: obligations to pay the state excise taxes
that are owed.
[SPEAKER_20]: And in addition, the California Attorney
General's Office, or more precisely,
[SPEAKER_20]: Attorney General Becerra, has urged the
FDA to step up its own enforcement with
[SPEAKER_20]: respect to electronic cigarettes to act.
[SPEAKER_20]: More aggressively, in the name of public
health.
[SPEAKER_20]: Earlier this year, Attorney General
Becerra, along with several other state
[SPEAKER_20]: attorneys general, urged the FDA to
prioritize enforcement of all flavored
[SPEAKER_20]: electronic cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_20]: So the Attorney General is on record that
this is an important area of enforcement.
[SPEAKER_20]: I would add that thanks to Prop 56,
the California Attorney General's Office
[SPEAKER_20]: has a new-ish role in supporting local law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_20]: The Prop 56, as has been noted,
is, among other things, increases the
[SPEAKER_20]: state excise tax on cigarettes and other
tobacco products.
[SPEAKER_20]: It earmarks the revenue for a number of
purposes, including $30 million a year
[SPEAKER_20]: that is allocated to the Department of
Justice for distribution to local law
[SPEAKER_20]: enforcement for enforcement of state and
local laws that deal with illegal and
[SPEAKER_20]: underage sales of tobacco.
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's a particular focus on sales and
use by minors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms. Leaf, may I ask you to conclude your
remarks so that we can get on to the next
[SPEAKER_03]: be fantastic?
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_20]: I was really just about finished.
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate your patience.
[SPEAKER_20]: The program has funded more than 200
grants to date, and that has funded a
[SPEAKER_20]: variety of local agencies, police
departments, sheriff's offices,
[SPEAKER_20]: local school districts.
[SPEAKER_20]: Many of them are using the grant funds for
dealing with electronic cigarette issues
[SPEAKER_20]: in their own communities.
[SPEAKER_20]: So with that, I will just note that
there's more information on our public
[SPEAKER_20]: website, and thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_33]: Good afternoon, Chairman Gray,
Chairman Low, and Chairman Wood and
[SPEAKER_33]: committee members.
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you for convening this hearing and
your leadership on this very important
[SPEAKER_33]: issue.
[SPEAKER_33]: I am going to cut some of my remarks,
so in light of the time.
[SPEAKER_33]: Again, my name is Harinder Kapoor.
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm the Senior Assistant Attorney General
for the Cannabis Control Section in the
[SPEAKER_33]: Office of the Attorney General.
[SPEAKER_33]: This is one of the newest sections in the
office, and I want to just give you a
[SPEAKER_33]: little bit of background on what this
section was set out to do.
[SPEAKER_33]: The section was formed by Attorney General
Becerra in 2018.
[SPEAKER_33]: We represent the licensing agencies,
the Bureau of Cannabis Control,
[SPEAKER_33]: California Department of Food and Ag,
and the California Department of Public
[SPEAKER_33]: Health in civil and administrative
matters.
[SPEAKER_33]: We also work with enforcement agencies
such as the California Highway Patrol,
[SPEAKER_33]: the Department of Fish and Wildlife,
State Water and represent them in their
[SPEAKER_33]: cannabis enforcement activities.
[SPEAKER_33]: We also provide guidance to a number of
state agencies, including the Department
[SPEAKER_33]: of Consumer Affairs, the Cannabis
Enforcement Unit.
[SPEAKER_33]: We also advise the Attorney General on
matters impacting legal commercial
[SPEAKER_33]: cannabis operations in California.
[SPEAKER_33]: Recently, the Attorney General supported,
actually he continues to support a strong
[SPEAKER_33]: regulated market.
[SPEAKER_33]: And with this in mind, AG Becerra recently
signed on to several letters in support of
[SPEAKER_33]: federal legislation, namely the Safe
Banking Act and the States Act.
[SPEAKER_33]: In addition, he provided support for
comment for FDA to engage in research on
[SPEAKER_33]: CBD and other cannabis-related products.
[SPEAKER_33]: You've heard all about the regulations,
so I won't go into that except to say that
[SPEAKER_33]: California does have a comprehensive
regulation of cannabis, cannabis products,
[SPEAKER_33]: and cannabis sales.
[SPEAKER_33]: Now, to reiterate, California has some of
the most rigorous standards for testing
[SPEAKER_33]: cannabis and cannabis products that are
sold in the regulated marketplace in this
[SPEAKER_33]: state.
[SPEAKER_33]: Unfortunately, we still have a very large
unregulated and illegal market.
[SPEAKER_33]: And they continue to sell products in the
state that are of an unknown origin and
[SPEAKER_33]: have not been tested.
[SPEAKER_33]: I, again, will not repeat the CDC
information that you've heard several
[SPEAKER_33]: times.
[SPEAKER_33]: Except to say that we need to keep in mind
that the CDC has been unable to link the
[SPEAKER_33]: outbreak to a single product or substance.
[SPEAKER_33]: However, we will acknowledge that most of
the patients reported a history of using
[SPEAKER_33]: THC-containing products.
[SPEAKER_33]: Fewer reported nicotine-only products.
[SPEAKER_33]: But the CDC also reports that the patients
reported that they didn't purchase the THC
[SPEAKER_33]: products from licensed, regulated,
marketplaces.
[SPEAKER_33]: They obtained them from other sources.
[SPEAKER_33]: It might have been friends, family
members.
[SPEAKER_33]: No one knows where they came from.
[SPEAKER_33]: So as you all know, Proposition 64
resulted in the reduction of many offenses
[SPEAKER_33]: as making them infractions or
misdemeanors.
[SPEAKER_33]: So when it comes to regulating the
unlicensed marketplace, it's become a
[SPEAKER_33]: little difficult for prosecutors and law
enforcement to pursue these cases.
[SPEAKER_33]: As you also know, several sections of the
Health and Safety Code reduced crimes to
[SPEAKER_33]: infractions and misdemeanors.
[SPEAKER_33]: There really aren't too many felonies
except maybe sale to minors.
[SPEAKER_33]: If you can attach a felony to another
offense, fraud, environmental impact,
[SPEAKER_33]: you have more weight to pursue a
prosecution.
[SPEAKER_33]: The legislature also includes in Mccursa
Business and Profession Code 26038,
[SPEAKER_33]: which allows civil penalties of up to
three times the amount of the license fee
[SPEAKER_33]: for each violation of unlicensed
commercial activity.
[SPEAKER_33]: And most recently, as part of the trailer
bill, you added a code section,
[SPEAKER_33]: Business and Profession Code section
26031.5, which also permits a licensing
[SPEAKER_33]: authority to issue citations to licensed
or unlicensed operators.
[SPEAKER_33]: The citation can include an order of
abatement and or administrative fines not
[SPEAKER_33]: to exceed $5,000 per violation for a
licensee and $30,000 per violation for an
[SPEAKER_33]: unlicensed person.
[SPEAKER_33]: Again, each day of violation constitutes a
separate violation.
[SPEAKER_33]: By recent estimates, 80% of the cannabis
industry in California remains unlicensed
[SPEAKER_33]: and unregulated.
[SPEAKER_33]: We are now 22 months into licensing.
[SPEAKER_33]: Those businesses, we could argue,
that intended to come into the legal
[SPEAKER_33]: regulated market have already done so or
are in the process of doing so by having
[SPEAKER_33]: obtained provisional licenses,
submitted annual license applications,
[SPEAKER_33]: and or submitted applications to local
jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_33]: Based on the volume of illegal businesses
continuing to operate in California,
[SPEAKER_33]: any meaningful enforcement requires
sufficient resources and coordination of
[SPEAKER_33]: efforts.
[SPEAKER_33]: In the past several weeks, we have heard
from law enforcement offices from
[SPEAKER_33]: throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_33]: What we've heard is, where enforcement
does take place, it is questionable as to
[SPEAKER_33]: what impact it is having due to the
limited ability of prosecutors to take
[SPEAKER_33]: meaningful action against those in the
illegal, unregulated marketplace.
[SPEAKER_33]: Again, currently, violations of the law
that are only based on cannabis violations
[SPEAKER_33]: are generally infractions or misdemeanors.
[SPEAKER_33]: For an unregulated business earning
potentially thousands of dollars,
[SPEAKER_33]: as Mr. Maduro has also indicated,
those fines may be viewed as the cost of
[SPEAKER_33]: doing business and might not have any
impact on deterring continued
[SPEAKER_33]: participation in the illegal, unregulated
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_33]: In many instances, retail pop-up shops are
shut down one day and reappear the next
[SPEAKER_33]: day several doors away.
[SPEAKER_33]: In one recent meeting with law enforcement
representatives, this was described as
[SPEAKER_33]: plain whack-a-mole.
[SPEAKER_33]: So while providing licensing agencies with
enforcement tools, there remains a gap for
[SPEAKER_33]: meaningful enforcement.
[SPEAKER_33]: Again, the criminal penalties being
infractions and misdemeanors for
[SPEAKER_33]: unlicensed, again, I want to focus on
unlicensed only, it's not having an
[SPEAKER_33]: effect.
[SPEAKER_33]: The attorney general supports both a
strong, regulated cannabis market and
[SPEAKER_33]: efforts to ensure the success for the
legal marketplace in California.
[SPEAKER_33]: And we welcome the opportunity to further
discuss how this can be done.
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate the comments that were given.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then again, we'll get into comments
and questions from members of the joint
[SPEAKER_03]: committee.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just as a reminder to committee
members that we still have an additional
[SPEAKER_03]: panel as well as public comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll first begin with Dr. Wood.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much to all of you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate the information.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can sense that you are all somewhat
overwhelmed by the enormity of the
[SPEAKER_07]: challenges that we face.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did hear Ms. Ajax, you said that you
were actively working with manufacturers
[SPEAKER_07]: and retailers and so on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't hear deliveries.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you enforcing against delivery
drivers?
[SPEAKER_07]: So illicit delivery operations as well?
[SPEAKER_31]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_31]: When we talk about retailers, we include
delivery.
[SPEAKER_31]: Yes, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a huge number of unlicensed
deliveries and that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do wonder where they're getting
their products because there's no
[SPEAKER_07]: storefront to trace it back to in many
cases.
[SPEAKER_07]: So with regard to the, and I know you
can't talk about the cushy punch thing,
[SPEAKER_07]: and so I'm not going there, but it does
make me wonder how many other operations
[SPEAKER_07]: are out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you guys are, shutting down
illicit operations, are you testing any of
[SPEAKER_07]: the products that come out of those stores
to see are those products in line with
[SPEAKER_07]: current standards?
[SPEAKER_07]: I would guess that they're not.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I kind of, while I would like to think
not, I kind of wonder how many more cushy
[SPEAKER_07]: punches there are out there, quite
frankly, with the value of product that
[SPEAKER_07]: may not pass testing and needing an outlet
to recoup the money that goes with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a little frustrating that we don't have
much in the way of enforcement tools,
[SPEAKER_07]: it sounds like, to other than citations
and misdemeanors, which are hardly even a
[SPEAKER_07]: slap on the wrist, it feels like.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was more of an editorial comment,
but if you haven't, obviously,
[SPEAKER_07]: if you have any comment on that.
[SPEAKER_31]: So depending on the, you know,
we get many complaints on unlicensed
[SPEAKER_31]: activity and now, especially with all the
media surrounding the vaping crisis,
[SPEAKER_31]: we get a lot of complaints.
[SPEAKER_31]: So we work together with the Department of
Public Health, and if we feel something
[SPEAKER_31]: needs to be tested, we are working in
partnership with them to have that product
[SPEAKER_31]: tested.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: With regards, Mr. Maduro is from CDTFA.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as we talk about the taxation,
those are also sort of a slap on the wrist
[SPEAKER_07]: as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought people in general kind of frayed
about the tax collectors and informers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know I am.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very careful about my returns and
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I got the impression it feels like
that maybe some people aren't in some of
[SPEAKER_07]: these industries.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I too, if somebody threatened me with a
misdemeanor as a nerdy middle-aged fellow,
[SPEAKER_08]: would be afraid.
[SPEAKER_08]: But alas, those people earning lots of
money in the illegal cannabis market don't
[SPEAKER_08]: seem afraid.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the tie here to the vaping,
in my mind, is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: the products that are being sold that are
untaxed are also untested.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the real, I just want to make
sure for those watching.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's the key.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do think, in my mind, it is both the
criminal sanctions, but to bring a
[SPEAKER_08]: criminal case takes so long, and it's
really difficult when we've got thousands
[SPEAKER_08]: of these.
[SPEAKER_08]: In my mind, what needs to happen is there
need to be civil penalties or tax
[SPEAKER_08]: penalties that are allowed to be put on
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they're put on in error,
people can appeal.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just think that even going to a
felony is not going to address the scope
[SPEAKER_08]: of the problem, because it will take so
long to get through the number of illegal
[SPEAKER_08]: operators that we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_08]: out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are trying all sorts of ways in the tax
realm, including assessing taxes and
[SPEAKER_08]: telling people, you know, you won't give
us your records.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've determined that you owe the state a
million and a half dollars, and we'll take
[SPEAKER_08]: your house and all of your possessions and
everything else, because we are trying to
[SPEAKER_08]: figure out what the best way to,
I mean, A, they do owe the money to the
[SPEAKER_08]: state, but we need to figure out what the
best way to proceed is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not sure that what we've always
done is what will work in this situation.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it sounds like you have a pretty big
tool belt, but not a lot of tools.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one way to put it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thinking along these lines is,
and this is more of a question for the
[SPEAKER_07]: Attorney General's office, because,
and linking this to vaping, which is
[SPEAKER_07]: really what this is about, but this is
bringing up some other issues of concern.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Chairman Gray and I were
commenting together 22 months into this,
[SPEAKER_07]: and we have 80 percent of the market
unlicensed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty appalling, and I would imagine
for those people in the licensed market,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's pretty frustrating, extremely
frustrating, to know that they're playing
[SPEAKER_07]: by the rules, and we've got this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I understand, and it feels like all of
you have tool belts and not enough tools,
[SPEAKER_07]: and not enough resources to buy the tools.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so on, so it is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to ask a question, and I don't
know the answer, but I am curious,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I don't know how this equates in the
rest of the world, so I'm going to ask
[SPEAKER_07]: that same question.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we were to find that there was an
entity or someone who was adding something
[SPEAKER_07]: to the vaping liquids that was causing
this outbreak, that has caused great
[SPEAKER_07]: bodily harm, and death in some cases.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've decriminalized so much around
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: What would the recourse for the AG be?
[SPEAKER_07]: How would you prosecute that case,
or would you be able to prosecute it based
[SPEAKER_07]: on the laws under Prop 64?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know the answer, but I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason I say that, I would bet that if
you were growing lettuce or spinach
[SPEAKER_07]: somewhere, and you did something,
and you added something there,
[SPEAKER_07]: and people died across the United States,
you'd be pretty responsible for that in a
[SPEAKER_07]: whole number of ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, is this industry going to have the
same level of responsibility as the
[SPEAKER_07]: lettuce industry, or the spinach industry,
or Tylenol, or anything else out there,
[SPEAKER_07]: because they've added a product to
something that caused great bodily harm
[SPEAKER_07]: and death?
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, as I indicated, if you can attach a
cannabis violation to something else,
[SPEAKER_33]: it becomes a felony.
[SPEAKER_33]: So I think in the case of a death,
you can attach it to a different law.
[SPEAKER_33]: That would create a felony violation.
[SPEAKER_33]: It wouldn't just be a manufacturing
cannabis violation anymore.
[SPEAKER_33]: It would be something more than that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there would be recourse if some
entities or whatever were found to be
[SPEAKER_07]: adding something that caused this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether knowingly or unknowingly,
I mean, creating a public health hazard.
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, I think you would differentiate
between knowingly or unknowingly,
[SPEAKER_33]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, obviously, they know they're adding
it, but they may not know the
[SPEAKER_07]: consequences.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there would be consequences.
[SPEAKER_33]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like there would be for lettuce
growers.
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, or a cultivator who uses deadly
pesticides and cultivation.
[SPEAKER_33]: You can attach it to environmental harm,
or some other felony crime.
[SPEAKER_33]: And pursue it that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there cases being pursued with
cultivators who are using banned
[SPEAKER_07]: pesticides and that have been caught?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because now you've linked those things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are those other cases actually being
prosecuted now, or charged, or are those
[SPEAKER_07]: misdemeanors?
[SPEAKER_33]: Well, my office is renewing several cases.
[SPEAKER_33]: I really can't comment on what we will end
up charging.
[SPEAKER_33]: But as I said, we do work in conjunction.
[SPEAKER_33]: With State Water and Department of Fish
and Wildlife.
[SPEAKER_07]: And because those are environmental,
those are different laws that people have
[SPEAKER_07]: to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_33]: They have water codes you can attach.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Gray.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Chairman Low.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to do my best to condense some
of these questions.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I may provide some questions to the
panel in writing postcommittee.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because there's a lot I want to get into.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know in the interest of time I'll
try get to the key points as I see them.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to start over here with the
Department of Public Health.
[SPEAKER_11]: During our process of constructing AB
1639, which is legislation myself,
[SPEAKER_11]: and several of my colleagues, and several
of these members up here on the committee
[SPEAKER_11]: worked on, we brought in the Department of
Public Health.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we brought in ABC and talked about
what sting operations and enforcement
[SPEAKER_11]: activities were occurring.
[SPEAKER_11]: When the ABC came in, it was 35,
40, 45,000 sting operations they were
[SPEAKER_11]: actively involved in.
[SPEAKER_11]: When DPH came in, they said, we don't
know.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they told me, oh, we're issuing grants
to local law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_11]: Asked how much money it was.
[SPEAKER_11]: It didn't seem significant.
[SPEAKER_11]: My impression that I'm left with,
the Department of Public Health is not
[SPEAKER_11]: doing much for enforcement in the area of
tobacco throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_11]: And frankly, the grants were given to
local law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_11]: They weren't very enticing for local law
enforcement to get involved in.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's your response to my impression?
[SPEAKER_12]: So I can tell you about what we do at the
state level.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have about 4,000 visits to retailers
every year.
[SPEAKER_12]: Of those in 2018, we had 340 first time
violations, which ended up in suspension
[SPEAKER_12]: of licenses, 10 second time violators,
and one third time violator.
[SPEAKER_12]: At the local level, we really do more of
the training of law enforcement of what
[SPEAKER_12]: they would do.
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have information about what
specifically the number of local law
[SPEAKER_12]: enforcement visits.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I can try and get that for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, certainly, I think if you don't,
you need to find out.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we need to give you the tools either
to find out and to conduct more sting
[SPEAKER_11]: operations.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because again, we don't need to reinvent
the wheel.
[SPEAKER_11]: We know that what we do in the area of
alcohol has been fairly effective.
[SPEAKER_11]: Law enforcement knows how to do this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think part of the problem is that we
have the enforcement at a non-law
[SPEAKER_11]: enforcement agency.
[SPEAKER_11]: But nonetheless, I think we make some
improvement there.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'll be happy to work with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd like some feedback when I provide
the legislation and approaches we're
[SPEAKER_11]: taking.
[SPEAKER_11]: Secondly, actually, I think you may have
answered that.
[SPEAKER_11]: How many licenses were removed?
[SPEAKER_12]: There were no licenses removed.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was one that could have been
removed, except that the business shut
[SPEAKER_12]: down.
[SPEAKER_11]: So no licenses removed?
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: From the state level, I don't know about
the local level.
[SPEAKER_11]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to move on now to Bureau of
Cannabis Control.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to begin with the flavor issue.
[SPEAKER_11]: I recently visited a dispensary to take a
look at a dispensary from a flavor
[SPEAKER_11]: viewpoint.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm going to go ahead and read you
some of the flavors that were displayed on
[SPEAKER_11]: the board of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: Banana split, blueberry milkshake,
wedding cake, ice cream cake, key lime
[SPEAKER_11]: pie, purple punch, peanut butter breath.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm curious as to your perspective,
given that flavors are a major concern for
[SPEAKER_11]: some of my colleagues as it relates to
e-cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the perspective on these flavors?
[SPEAKER_11]: If e-cigarette flavors are driving teenage
consumption and underage consumption,
[SPEAKER_11]: then I would assume that is true with
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: But are there no restrictions?
[SPEAKER_31]: So a lot of those could be also strain
names that they use.
[SPEAKER_31]: It's not always necessarily flavors.
[SPEAKER_31]: They do have cannabis terpenes.
[SPEAKER_31]: But most of the time, what we see those
are strain names.
[SPEAKER_31]: And so we do look at, especially from the
Department of Public Health side,
[SPEAKER_31]: any packaging can't be attractive to
children.
[SPEAKER_31]: They can't advertise to children.
[SPEAKER_31]: But for most of these, those would be
cannabis flour we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_31]: And so restrictions on packaging,
again, would be still can't be attractive
[SPEAKER_31]: to children.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, whether or not those names represent
a flavor or a strain, I think as far as
[SPEAKER_11]: we're talking about marketing,
the name of a product is, in fact,
[SPEAKER_11]: marketing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And those certainly at least strike me at
first blush.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm going to try to learn more about
this as directed towards young people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or perhaps not.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe the flavors aren't the key issue.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm certainly open to that.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've been debating that all year long.
[SPEAKER_11]: How many cannabis licenses have been
suspended or removed this past year?
[SPEAKER_11]: In the past 22 months?
[SPEAKER_31]: So most of our licenses at the Bureau are
provisional licenses.
[SPEAKER_31]: So we issue a variety of disciplinary.
[SPEAKER_31]: If we go into a retail inspection and we
find violations, we can issue a notice of
[SPEAKER_31]: comply.
[SPEAKER_31]: We can also suspend or we can also revoke.
[SPEAKER_31]: We've done some suspensions, like for
example, for a sales to minor that we had
[SPEAKER_31]: with delivery of a licensed retailer.
[SPEAKER_31]: Most of the time, we are trying to get our
retailers or any of our licensees to
[SPEAKER_31]: comply with our regulations.
[SPEAKER_31]: If there's a public safety issue,
then we will revoke the license.
[SPEAKER_31]: Or in some cases, the licensee will cancel
their license or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_31]: So we've had several of those.
[SPEAKER_31]: I don't have the exact numbers,
but I can certainly provide those to you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And how many sting operations have been
conducted on underage purchases?
[SPEAKER_31]: So that's handled by the sworn law
enforcement part of the Bureau under the
[SPEAKER_31]: cannabis enforcement unit at the
Department of Consumer Affairs.
[SPEAKER_31]: And I can certainly get those for you as
well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'll wait for those answers and then
we'll have some follow up.
[SPEAKER_11]: Department of Tax and Fee Administration.
[SPEAKER_11]: I had the opportunity as a young staff,
legislative staffer in this building to
[SPEAKER_11]: work on the tax stamp program.
[SPEAKER_11]: Working with then government organization
share, Jerome Horton.
[SPEAKER_11]: And my understanding, having followed that
program over the years, is that it's been
[SPEAKER_11]: pretty effective in addressing black
market sales of tobacco products.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wanted to get your take on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it has been effective in
cigarettes, which is all it applies to in
[SPEAKER_08]: addressing black market sales.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that kind of takes me to my next
question, which is in our bill that we've
[SPEAKER_11]: been working on, we've been trying to move
in the direction of a tax stamp program
[SPEAKER_11]: for vaping products or e-cigarette
products, knowing that it was effective in
[SPEAKER_11]: dealing with the black market.
[SPEAKER_11]: Traditionally, one would assume we could
accomplish the same thing with
[SPEAKER_11]: e-cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you see what hurdles, challenges,
tools are needed in order to accomplish
[SPEAKER_11]: that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't think we could just sort of
lift and shift the same tax stamping
[SPEAKER_08]: regimen that we have there into vaping for
a few reasons.
[SPEAKER_08]: One, cigarettes are all taxed at $2.87 per
pack.
[SPEAKER_08]: The tax on other tobacco products is based
on this wholesale cost calculation.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not, you couldn't sell just a
single value stamp and say that that's
[SPEAKER_08]: your stamp for every product if you wanted
it to be an actual tax stamp.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other issue is that the packaging on
these other products, the size,
[SPEAKER_08]: the number of items contained,
is also not the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: With cigarettes, every single pack is 20
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there are machines that are developed
that open the boxes and stamp everything,
[SPEAKER_08]: and it becomes very efficient.
[SPEAKER_08]: That said,
[SPEAKER_08]: in my mind, one of the major things that
could be addressed here is tracing where
[SPEAKER_08]: the product came from and ensuring that
it's tax paid and ensuring that it's not a
[SPEAKER_08]: counterfeit product.
[SPEAKER_08]: And those could be achieved with a stamp
that is required that is not necessarily a
[SPEAKER_08]: stamp that the distributor buys from us
for a certain tax amount, although that's
[SPEAKER_08]: possible, but you would have to have
varying values.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is a little bit more complicated,
but I do think, and this is one of the
[SPEAKER_08]: things that the governor's asked us to
look at that we'll be reporting out to him
[SPEAKER_08]: later this month, that it's possible to
design a system that would accomplish
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will also say that I believe that
initial getting the cigarette tax stamp up
[SPEAKER_08]: and running took, I think, three years,
which is a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd also like to come up with something
that we could do more quickly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are the same issues we were
struggling with, and AB 1639 was trying to
[SPEAKER_11]: figure out how to fast track the tax stamp
program as it relates.
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, funny enough, the issue that
stalled our legislation in the state
[SPEAKER_11]: senate this year was, in fact,
the issue you raised on equivalency.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I released language in early August
that attempted to create a more equivalent
[SPEAKER_11]: tax between traditional tobacco mistakes
that we were going to put into AB 1639.
[SPEAKER_11]: When the senate found out about that,
the senate rules committee refused to
[SPEAKER_11]: grant us a hearing on the legislation as
they didn't want to address a tax at this
[SPEAKER_11]: time.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we're going to be coming back first
thing in the year to still work on that
[SPEAKER_11]: issue, and I'm going to provide you the
language that we have to get your
[SPEAKER_11]: feedback.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd also like some additional feedback on
the issues you raised about noncompliance
[SPEAKER_11]: with taxes and how we might assist in
amping up the penalties.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Chairman Wood raised that,
and I think that's something we'd all like
[SPEAKER_11]: to have some potential solutions on.
[SPEAKER_11]: That certainly can be a very effective
method of addressing black market
[SPEAKER_11]: activities.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd be happy to provide you any
assistance we can.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you'll take a look at the equivalency
tax that I proposed in August and see if
[SPEAKER_11]: that meets the mark?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: Department of Justice.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the thing that concerns me the
most, I've got about six questions here,
[SPEAKER_11]: but the thing that you raised on the
inconsistencies in the way we're treating
[SPEAKER_11]: these different products and the penalties
and tools available to you to enforce,
[SPEAKER_11]: and how that was, as I understood it,
made further difficult by some of the
[SPEAKER_11]: criminal justice reforms that this body
and this state have enacted in the past
[SPEAKER_11]: decade.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that an accurate depiction of what you
said?
[SPEAKER_33]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd like to see some recommendations
from the DOJ and from our attorney general
[SPEAKER_11]: on what steps the legislature can take to
give you those tools so as to have proper
[SPEAKER_11]: enforcement.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think many of my colleagues will be
interested in that as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: With that, I will do my follow up with all
of you and provide you the draft language
[SPEAKER_11]: that we have prepared that's going to be a
consistent approach to vaping,
[SPEAKER_11]: tobacco, and marijuana, as well as
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we have the know-how.
[SPEAKER_11]: You may not all have all the tools you
need, but we need to know what those tools
[SPEAKER_11]: that are missing are.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we need to get a consistent
approach.
[SPEAKER_11]: To all of these products.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because what we're doing now is there's
certain legislators in this building who
[SPEAKER_11]: are with one hand banning flavored tobacco
and with another hand encouraging us to
[SPEAKER_11]: smoke marijuana and moving vehicles.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to get a more consistent policy
here.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some real intellectual dishonesty
with what we're doing in this area.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we need your assistance.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think a lot of issues have been
raised here today that don't make a lot of
[SPEAKER_11]: sense.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we need to get on the same page.
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for your testimony.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll turn it back to Chairman Love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Mr. Gray.
[SPEAKER_17]: Next up, Mr. McCarty followed by Mr.
Cooper.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think in the interest of time,
I prefer getting to the next panel.
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Cooper.
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with Mr. Gray.
[SPEAKER_09]: This body is consistent at being
inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_09]: And really, the penalties mean nothing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're talking about the misdemeanor
$5,000 fine.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the same as someone breaking a
window, someone's window or doing a lawn
[SPEAKER_09]: job.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_09]: No one's going to jail, county jail,
to spend any time for misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the time it's plea bargaining in
court, your fine will be $1,000 or $500.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a real reality.
[SPEAKER_09]: So why not do it?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we have a lot of good businesses
that are following the law and that are
[SPEAKER_09]: productive businesses.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have that bad element, too,
we've got to deal with.
[SPEAKER_09]: And just like cushy punch, they had one
foot in their legal and one foot in the
[SPEAKER_09]: black market.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we try to deal with that all the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: We know that 60% of the marijuana in
California goes out of state.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sacramento is grow house central in the
entire country.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's frustrating for law enforcement,
they'll do a power search for it because
[SPEAKER_09]: of power usage, hit the house,
deal with electricity, where it's mud or
[SPEAKER_09]: PG &E will, and they'll leave the
marijuana in the house.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're leaving thousands and thousands
of plants that are out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And those plants make it back into the
black market.
[SPEAKER_09]: So how do we change that?
[SPEAKER_09]: I had a bill in 17 that would have
addressed this.
[SPEAKER_09]: It did with civil funding for the state
agencies and helped cities develop
[SPEAKER_09]: legitimate cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_09]: That bill was going to die in public
safety because you can't get any of these
[SPEAKER_09]: bills out of public safety in either
house.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's really what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's crazy some of the things that go
on with this.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a big issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we shouldn't throw the baby out with
the bath water.
[SPEAKER_09]: But how do we do it?
[SPEAKER_09]: These folks that are in the black market,
you find them and punish them because the
[SPEAKER_09]: last administration said, hey,
we're not signing any law that puts
[SPEAKER_09]: anybody in jail or prison.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got a new governor.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm excited about him, and I want to thank
him for allowing his team to come out here
[SPEAKER_09]: and work with law enforcement to try and
figure out how they can solve this problem
[SPEAKER_09]: and how to attack it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he's been collaborative, and hopefully
we'll see more big things from the
[SPEAKER_09]: governor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Warning letters and citations,
they don't care.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're making so much money.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm talking the black market, not the
legal market, black market.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're in the business to make money by
selling product.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the more you make, the more you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's worth it for the penalties.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like no harm, no foul.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why not keep going?
[SPEAKER_09]: You're making tens of thousands of dollars
every day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why would you stop that?
[SPEAKER_09]: But in this legislature, right now,
there's no penalties for anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't want to do asset forfeiture.
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of these guys are making big,
big money.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you have to use asset forfeiture.
[SPEAKER_09]: Legislature doesn't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So how do we change that?
[SPEAKER_09]: How do we get it done?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully the AG will come out and help
with some of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do have a question for Mr. Maderos
on the issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_09]: As far as the open vape system that goes
untaxed, how do we change that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, for the non-tobacco element of the
vape, one could change the definition of
[SPEAKER_08]: tobacco products to include that,
those other liquids.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or if you went to nicotine, based tax,
then whatever the nicotine portion is
[SPEAKER_08]: would be taxed at presumably a fairly
robust rate.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if you mixed it, it wouldn't make
any difference because you were just
[SPEAKER_08]: taxing that nicotine portion, but not at
the same calculation that we're using
[SPEAKER_08]: currently.
[SPEAKER_09]: And for Ms. Ajax, in your opinion,
how bad is the cannabis black market
[SPEAKER_09]: impacting legitimate cannabis business?
[SPEAKER_31]: Well, it's probably the number one
complaint that we get.
[SPEAKER_31]: The complaints coming into the Bureau is
the unlicensed market and how it's
[SPEAKER_31]: directly competing with our licensees.
[SPEAKER_31]: And I think we all agree with you that
enforcement is a top priority.
[SPEAKER_31]: And we all work here together very well to
combat that and partner together to make
[SPEAKER_31]: sure we're attacking the illegal market.
[SPEAKER_31]: But it is very prevalent here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have sufficient resources?
[SPEAKER_31]: I think between all of us working together
as a state, we do have substantial
[SPEAKER_31]: resources.
[SPEAKER_31]: I think we're still learning the scope of
the problem.
[SPEAKER_31]: And again, we feel it's a top priority.
[SPEAKER_31]: One of the things that all of us
collaborate, and it's not just the people
[SPEAKER_31]: at this table, it's with CDFA and local
law enforcement, has been huge with
[SPEAKER_31]: assisting us with some of these,
serving these search warrants.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what about your resources at BCC?
[SPEAKER_31]: We have resources.
[SPEAKER_31]: We're still building our structure.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll cut you off there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never heard any department head in my
five years here come forward and say,
[SPEAKER_09]: no, we don't have sufficient resources
because we know who their boss is.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I get this.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't want to diss your boss.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I understand that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to be politically correct.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's a big issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'll be honest with one thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: The state, the pay sucks.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when Governor Brown gutted B&E,
Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement,
[SPEAKER_09]: there's a lot of expertise here that has
gone, that has been gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no expertise with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So narcotics is not something you learn
overnight.
[SPEAKER_09]: I spent 10 years there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it takes a long time to develop that
expertise.
[SPEAKER_09]: So most folks are in local agencies that
have that expertise.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the state, it's tough to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: The pay sucks.
[SPEAKER_09]: And with PEPRA, it's just very different
versus the cities and counties.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the tough part you deal with,
is finding the folks that are capable that
[SPEAKER_09]: can do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So to me, it goes back to local law
enforcement to have those folks be an
[SPEAKER_09]: integral part of this, to deal with this,
to have the expertise that need the
[SPEAKER_09]: funding there to make these investigations
and do them.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got thousands of illegal storefronts
in LA.
[SPEAKER_09]: With the right resources, they can do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then also changing it on the,
when you get marijuana or you run into
[SPEAKER_09]: marijuana, whatever flower, whatever they
call it, do destruction right away.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the reason law enforcement doesn't
seize cannabis or flower or whatever is
[SPEAKER_09]: because you have to store it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you get thousands of plants to store
in a warehouse for a year or six months,
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not feasible.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why law enforcement doesn't take it
versus having an immediate destruction
[SPEAKER_09]: order.
[SPEAKER_09]: You destroy that and all the implements
associated with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you've got a doctor's note,
then we'll leave you your 11 plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're taking everything else.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's got to change that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Until this body gets off its butt,
nothing's going to change in this
[SPEAKER_09]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_09]: It starts in the legislature.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you can't get a bill for a
hearing in a damn committee, that's the
[SPEAKER_09]: problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is a problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have great bills that come through
that are reasonable, not crazy stuff,
[SPEAKER_09]: but they don't want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's going to happen in the
committee.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's really what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, Mr. Cooper,
Dr. Wood.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just really briefly, I just want to
say thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I feel like you, I sound harsh,
but I really appreciate the work you're
[SPEAKER_07]: doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel like you're swimming upstream
all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we gave the industry tools to come
into compliance.
[SPEAKER_07]: We gave time for people to come into
compliance.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's frustrating that 80% of the
industry has chosen not to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that we don't have the tools to
enforce against that.
[SPEAKER_07]: In a more expeditious way, maybe that's
the right way to say it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it feels like whack-a-mole probably in
some places.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's unfair to the folks that have
gone through all the hoops and to do it
[SPEAKER_07]: right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thank you for everything you all are
doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I get into any final closing
comments, did any of the five of you wish
[SPEAKER_03]: to share any observations or responses to
any of the dialogue that was previously
[SPEAKER_03]: made on this dais?
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing none, no?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also want to echo those comments and the
deep appreciation, as Dr. Wood and a
[SPEAKER_03]: number of my colleagues, on the work that
you are doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please interpret our comments as saying
that we want to best understand how to
[SPEAKER_03]: best empower and equip you with the tools
necessary and the resources necessary to
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to do the jobs that you know is
important to do for the largest regulated
[SPEAKER_03]: market in the world, arguably.
[SPEAKER_03]: Similarly, along those lines, it's clear
that you have all stated some deficiencies
[SPEAKER_03]: in the areas of opportunity and the lost
opportunities that you have had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And would like to tell you to help create
a greater sense of urgency.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've talked about the lack of
enforcement, a slap on the wrist,
[SPEAKER_03]: comments like just normal modes of
operating procedure for many of these
[SPEAKER_03]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to come to us and say, this is what we
are seeing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need the authority, the legislative
support, to be able to tackle these
[SPEAKER_03]: issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also clear to me that there are a
number of various entities that oversee
[SPEAKER_03]: this of enforcement and within cannabis
vaping alike.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also talk about local control and state
position as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps my colleagues may also join me in
exploring then perhaps a consolidation
[SPEAKER_03]: into departmental status to make sure that
we have a uniform approach to some of
[SPEAKER_03]: these areas so that we have a sense of
consistency, accountability, and
[SPEAKER_03]: transparency so that we can have a sense
of how we are tackling this all in one
[SPEAKER_03]: house as well, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the efficiencies, I think, as Mr.
Cooper also mentioned, is very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Similarly, I also want to make a point
that we oftentimes in this legislative
[SPEAKER_03]: body have sought to try and address many
of these different issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, when we talk about that of local
control, cities saying that we want to
[SPEAKER_03]: maintain local control when, in fact,
I say again, cities are not in control.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are unlicensed dispensaries
operating all the time in many different
[SPEAKER_03]: places.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when we then say, let us help open
up the regulated market for a bill
[SPEAKER_03]: proposal on commensurate licenses,
on ABC licenses in cities, that bill does
[SPEAKER_03]: not pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also saw a bill prohibiting delivery.
[SPEAKER_03]: That bill did not pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw a piece of legislation to lower
excise tax.
[SPEAKER_03]: That did not pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are attempting to do what we can.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I think is going to be helpful is
if you help provide us the specifics and
[SPEAKER_03]: saying that justification is very clear,
which I would suggest and argue but leave
[SPEAKER_03]: it to public comment, that is actually in
unison to that of what you're hearing from
[SPEAKER_03]: industry, which is the regulated and the
industry that is represented in this
[SPEAKER_03]: audience also say we want to join in
lockstep.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are willing to pay our taxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are willing to pay our fees.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know who the bad actors are.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to be in the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they feel like they are not surviving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only is that that individuals are
dying, as we all know, but small business
[SPEAKER_03]: owners are also dying.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there needs to be a greater sense of
urgency.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we implore you to help create that
sense of urgency for us, because we want
[SPEAKER_03]: to work within the state budget to help
give you more tools and resources and
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also want to change the legislation to
help empower you so that you can go after
[SPEAKER_03]: the bad actors alike.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also message very clear to the
administration that this is an
[SPEAKER_03]: informational hearing that has engaged
with broad public support of all
[SPEAKER_03]: stakeholders so that when you see pieces
of legislation that comes from us,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is getting the administration
involved and stakeholders alike.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, we want to work hand-in-hand
with each and every one of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've provided us some good tools and
recommendations alike.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, we need to create a greater
sense of urgency for this, because this is
[SPEAKER_03]: of immense importance to not only public
health, but to the future that will
[SPEAKER_03]: transcend long before, long after we will
be here, respectively, in these chairs,
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, deep appreciation for all of
your commitment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we look forward to continuing working
with you again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Chairman Loh.
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you again to the panel.
[SPEAKER_11]: At this time, we're going to move to the
final panel of the day.
[SPEAKER_11]: What are the health effects associated
with vaping and electronic cigarettes?
[SPEAKER_11]: And what more needs to be done?
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd welcome Dr. Charity Dean,
Assistant Director, Acting State Public
[SPEAKER_11]: Health Officer from the Department of
Public Health, if you could come up.
[SPEAKER_11]: And present your testimony, please.
[SPEAKER_11]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Good afternoon, chairs and members.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm Dr. Charity Dean, Acting State Public
Health Officer at the California
[SPEAKER_15]: Department of Public Health.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for allowing me to provide an
update on the vaping-associated pulmonary
[SPEAKER_15]: injury.
[SPEAKER_15]: The current status of the vapy outbreak is
alarming.
[SPEAKER_15]: Nationally, there have been 1,299 cases
and at least 26 deaths.
[SPEAKER_15]: The National Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention report 76% of patients
[SPEAKER_15]: self-report using THC.
[SPEAKER_15]: Today, new data was posted on the
California Department of Public Health
[SPEAKER_15]: website, cdph.ca.gov, and I'm going to
discuss it.
[SPEAKER_15]: We've had 133 cases in California,
3 deaths.
[SPEAKER_15]: The median age of cases has been 27.
[SPEAKER_15]: All of those cases have been hospitalized.
[SPEAKER_15]: Of those, 43% required care in the
intensive care unit and 28% required
[SPEAKER_15]: mechanical intubation.
[SPEAKER_15]: 78 of those cases have been interviewed.
[SPEAKER_15]: This means that they self-report to the
person interviewing them what they used
[SPEAKER_15]: and where they obtained the product.
[SPEAKER_15]: The cases report vaping or dabbing mostly
cannabis products in waxes, oils,
[SPEAKER_15]: and other forms.
[SPEAKER_15]: Of the 78 interviewed, 81% self-report
using THC, 38% used CBD, 47% used
[SPEAKER_15]: nicotine.
[SPEAKER_15]: Most used a combination of these and only
10% reported using only nicotine.
[SPEAKER_15]: There was one case that did self-report
purchasing from a confirmed licensed
[SPEAKER_15]: retailer.
[SPEAKER_15]: Many aspects of that are being
investigated and that investigation is
[SPEAKER_15]: still ongoing.
[SPEAKER_15]: The remaining cases who self-reported
during the interview stated that they had
[SPEAKER_15]: purchased their vaping products from
illicit street vendors, pop-up shops,
[SPEAKER_15]: social contacts, or unverified sellers.
[SPEAKER_15]: And by unverified sellers, we mean
retailers that either could not be located
[SPEAKER_15]: or could not be verified as having a
license.
[SPEAKER_15]: There are multiple patterns of lung injury
which are emerging based on the medical
[SPEAKER_15]: findings from tissue biopsies,
autopsies, and blood work.
[SPEAKER_15]: Many of these are now emerging in
published literature.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to list a few that you may have
heard of in the media.
[SPEAKER_15]: Exogenous lipoid pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_15]: The theory behind that was that inhaling
vaporized oils can cause this clinical
[SPEAKER_15]: syndrome that can be seen on some of the
clinical specimens like lung washings.
[SPEAKER_15]: Chemical pneumonitis or chemical
inhalation injury.
[SPEAKER_15]: Acute eosinophilic pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_15]: Bronchiolitis obliterans.
[SPEAKER_15]: Diffuse alveolar damage.
[SPEAKER_15]: Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
[SPEAKER_15]: All of these involve acute lung injury and
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you can see that there are now a number
of different clinical syndromes that are
[SPEAKER_15]: emerging, not just one.
[SPEAKER_15]: The challenge there is that multiple
patterns of lung injury suggest multiple
[SPEAKER_15]: mechanisms, which in turn suggests that
there may be multiple different causes,
[SPEAKER_15]: different chemicals leading to this,
not just one.
[SPEAKER_15]: Extensive laboratory testing is being
done.
[SPEAKER_15]: Nationally, there are published and
anecdotal reports from labs at the federal
[SPEAKER_15]: and state level.
[SPEAKER_15]: All of them agree that at this point there
is no single device, substance,
[SPEAKER_15]: product, or device type that has been
identified as the cause of the outbreak.
[SPEAKER_15]: Vitamin E acetate has been recovered from
some products, but not all.
[SPEAKER_15]: The California Department of Public Health
received 146 cartridges or pods,
[SPEAKER_15]: which were voluntarily surrendered by
patients, and the extensive testing is
[SPEAKER_15]: ongoing.
[SPEAKER_15]: There are many unknowns.
[SPEAKER_15]: One I would highlight is the unknown of
what happens when you mix chemicals
[SPEAKER_15]: together, heat that mixture, and
aerosolize it, which may create new toxic
[SPEAKER_15]: compounds, the effect of which on the lung
tissue is unknown.
[SPEAKER_15]: Another unknown are variables intrinsic in
the devices themselves, heating elements,
[SPEAKER_15]: batteries, refillable cartridges,
and metals.
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, the combination of these with
heat may be creating unknown substances
[SPEAKER_15]: that we don't even know to test for.
[SPEAKER_15]: The California Department of Public Health
has had a robust response to this
[SPEAKER_15]: outbreak.
[SPEAKER_15]: The Medical and Health Coordination Center
was activated in August.
[SPEAKER_15]: It is now activated at level two.
[SPEAKER_15]: We have issued three CAHEN alerts
statewide, multiple health advisories,
[SPEAKER_15]: including to the public and to healthcare
professionals.
[SPEAKER_15]: We issued a press release and have been
very responsive to media inquiries.
[SPEAKER_15]: From the beginning, from August,
from the first day, we've collaborated
[SPEAKER_15]: with our national partners at the federal
level, with the CDC, with other states
[SPEAKER_15]: that were reporting clusters, with our
local health jurisdictions, and with
[SPEAKER_15]: providers in California.
[SPEAKER_15]: Across our departments, multiple centers
have been involved.
[SPEAKER_15]: They have all come together to offer staff
and expertise to respond.
[SPEAKER_15]: I especially want to mention the work of
our state public health laboratories,
[SPEAKER_15]: where it's been a team effort to
synthesize and test various chemical
[SPEAKER_15]: hypotheses.
[SPEAKER_15]: Description of the emerging clinical
syndrome includes respiratory symptoms
[SPEAKER_15]: such as cough, shortness of breath,
chest pain, and GI symptoms, including
[SPEAKER_15]: abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting,
diarrhea, but it also includes fever,
[SPEAKER_15]: fatigue, and weakness.
[SPEAKER_15]: Patients present with low oxygen levels,
which is why many of them need to be in
[SPEAKER_15]: the intensive care unit with supplemental
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_15]: They have an abnormal chest x-ray.
[SPEAKER_15]: Many have an abnormal CT scan as well,
showing bilateral infiltrates on both
[SPEAKER_15]: sides of their lungs, not just one.
[SPEAKER_15]: The unknown, I'm sorry, the long-term
health effects are unknown.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because this is an emerging clinical
syndrome, we're looking very carefully at
[SPEAKER_15]: what's happening right now, but what
happens when these patients leave the
[SPEAKER_15]: hospital?
[SPEAKER_15]: How quick is their recovery?
[SPEAKER_15]: Will they have lifelong adverse health
effects on their lungs?
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't know that yet.
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the challenges is this is a
diagnosis of exclusion, which is why I
[SPEAKER_15]: mentioned the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_15]: In order to make the diagnosis of a VAPE
case, you have to first rule out
[SPEAKER_15]: infectious causes or other plausible
causes.
[SPEAKER_15]: This will be a challenge during upcoming
influenza season.
[SPEAKER_15]: So how do we find the cause?
[SPEAKER_15]: The public health approach to this,
as it is to many other outbreaks,
[SPEAKER_15]: is a combination of examining the
epidemiology data, the clinical syndrome,
[SPEAKER_15]: the course of illness in the patient,
the patient's clinical specimens,
[SPEAKER_15]: and of course the laboratory analysis of
the vaping products themselves.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it will be that information
dovetailing together that will get us
[SPEAKER_15]: closer to an answer.
[SPEAKER_15]: It could take years for the medical and
scientific community to definitively
[SPEAKER_15]: determine what the causes are.
[SPEAKER_15]: Public health recommendations for the
public are important, and we've been
[SPEAKER_15]: sharing them in our publicly shared press
release and health alerts.
[SPEAKER_15]: Number one, we recommend that the public
refrain from vaping no matter the source.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is always a risk when you inhale a
foreign substance into your lungs,
[SPEAKER_15]: and the risk of vaping now includes death.
[SPEAKER_15]: It can be difficult for consumers to
distinguish between regulated and
[SPEAKER_15]: unregulated products, considering there
are counterfeit labels that can be very
[SPEAKER_15]: deceptive.
[SPEAKER_15]: Number two, for those who choose to vape,
only purchase from a verified,
[SPEAKER_15]: licensed retailer.
[SPEAKER_15]: Number three, for someone who has recently
vaped and is experiencing some of these
[SPEAKER_15]: symptoms, they should seek care
immediately, and they need to share their
[SPEAKER_15]: honest and thorough vaping history and
products used with that provider.
[SPEAKER_15]: And number four, if you stop vaping,
do not switch to cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_15]: Instead, please consider using an
FDA-approved quitting treatment.
[SPEAKER_15]: That concludes my remarks.
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for allowing me to come today,
and I'll take any questions you might
[SPEAKER_15]: have.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Doctor.
[SPEAKER_11]: At this time, we'll bring it back to the
committee for any questions, comments.
[SPEAKER_07]: Doctor?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, first of all, thank you very much,
and I've been thinking about the
[SPEAKER_07]: challenges as we do enter cold and flu
season, and how you distinguish that,
[SPEAKER_07]: and the complications that may arise from
a person who does have a cold or the flu,
[SPEAKER_07]: and how much one plus one might equal
three, and that's not a good thing in this
[SPEAKER_07]: case.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, appreciate your comments around that.
[SPEAKER_07]: People that are self-reporting,
are they volunteering the product that
[SPEAKER_07]: they've used if there's any residual left
for testing?
[SPEAKER_07]: And how many people are actually doing
that, or is it consumed and all gone
[SPEAKER_07]: before they get to you?
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: Some patients are voluntarily turning over
the product and their vaping device.
[SPEAKER_15]: And those are sent to the California
Department of Public Health to conduct
[SPEAKER_15]: testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so all the results, it takes a while
to do that, obviously.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been a very complex analysis,
and we are looking at some of those
[SPEAKER_15]: results, but it really is in the beginning
stages of a comprehensive laboratory
[SPEAKER_15]: analysis, considering how many chemicals
have to be tested for.
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, thank you for your
testimony.
[SPEAKER_11]: When we first contacted the department and
looked into, at that time, the reported
[SPEAKER_11]: cases, my recollection was 62 out of 63
cases were reported THC with one case
[SPEAKER_11]: unknown.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I heard you say earlier, 81 percent
THC.
[SPEAKER_11]: So have there been more cases?
[SPEAKER_11]: Has that information changed since I last
spoke with the department?
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't remember that exact week because
the data's changed.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's changing so rapidly.
[SPEAKER_15]: But yes, you are correct.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now, 81 percent of the cases
self-report using THC.
[SPEAKER_15]: The nuance is that many of the cases are
combining the THC with CBD and with
[SPEAKER_15]: nicotine.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so if you were to add up the
percentages, the data that we published on
[SPEAKER_15]: our website today, you'll see it doesn't
add to 100 percent because many of them
[SPEAKER_15]: are combining the substances together.
[SPEAKER_11]: And in the media reports, the lung
illnesses have at least it's been
[SPEAKER_11]: suggested or linked to black market
products.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've had a lot of discussion about
that today.
[SPEAKER_11]: Have there been any cases of lung illness
or death for that matter who have used
[SPEAKER_11]: legal cannabis products exclusively?
[SPEAKER_15]: I can only speak to the data that we have
for California.
[SPEAKER_15]: Of the 78 cases who were interviewed in
California, there was only one case whose
[SPEAKER_15]: self-reporting self-reported exclusively
purchasing from licensed retailers.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's important to note that when we do
these epidemiology interviews for any
[SPEAKER_15]: outbreak, we're asking patients to use
their best recollection and self-report to
[SPEAKER_15]: the interviewer.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so we look at every aspect of that,
and that's still being investigated.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that was only one case that
self-reported exclusively legal retailers.
[SPEAKER_11]: Everyone else, we can assume, based on
their self-report, non-legal products or
[SPEAKER_11]: at least some non-legal products.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_15]: The rest who self-reported, even the ones
who may have mentioned a brick and mortar
[SPEAKER_15]: location, those were not able to be found
or not able to be verified as licensed.
[SPEAKER_11]: And how many of them report exclusively
using nicotine vaping products and no THC
[SPEAKER_11]: or marijuana products?
[SPEAKER_15]: Only 10 percent of the 78 who were
interviewed.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: I asked my staff to do a little research.
[SPEAKER_11]: It struck me as odd.
[SPEAKER_11]: Vaping is not an activity that only occurs
here in the United States, but yet I've
[SPEAKER_11]: heard nothing or read nothing about death,
illness, etc.
[SPEAKER_11]: due to vaping outside of the United
States.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you speak to that at all?
[SPEAKER_11]: Have you seen any evidence or reports
worldwide?
[SPEAKER_15]: There have been a handful of cases
reported in Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not aware of these clusters or
outbreak emerging in other countries.
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that strike you as odd?
[SPEAKER_15]: It strikes me as interesting.
[SPEAKER_15]: And as we look at all the possible causes
in the United States, including our EPI
[SPEAKER_15]: data, our patients, the clinical labs,
that's something that we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_15]: What changed and why now?
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your time and appreciate the
answers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a quick follow-up, and I appreciate
your line of questioning there,
[SPEAKER_07]: so I think it's really valuable.
[SPEAKER_07]: You said someone reported, we had one
person report that they had purchased from
[SPEAKER_07]: a licensed regulated cannabis facility.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that verified that that indeed was a
licensed facility or was that the
[SPEAKER_07]: patient's recollection because they
thought it was a licensed facility?
[SPEAKER_15]: That investigation is still ongoing.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll tell you that we share, we as public
health, when we get those reports from
[SPEAKER_15]: patients that were interviewed,
we share them with BCC so that they can be
[SPEAKER_15]: investigated.
[SPEAKER_15]: In that one case, the brick and mortar
location that was mentioned was confirmed
[SPEAKER_15]: to be licensed, but aspects of that are
still being investigated.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Law.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate the comments that you made,
and if I remembered correctly,
[SPEAKER_03]: you had indicated that the data is still
inconclusive, but that you are very much
[SPEAKER_03]: looking to the distinction on what has
been recently introduced and that when
[SPEAKER_03]: there is a conclusion into hopefully
finding the culprit, that information will
[SPEAKER_03]: be readily available.
[SPEAKER_03]: For members of the public, when that time
comes to which then given your research
[SPEAKER_03]: that you do find conclusive evidence of
where the culprit is, what then transpires
[SPEAKER_03]: so that we can ensure that consumers will
be protected?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that come from executive order?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that come from the administration
then working with the legislature?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you see that happening?
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that would depend on what the
culprit was.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not clear that it's just the
substance or just the device.
[SPEAKER_15]: It could even be a combination of them,
so it seems that the ability to stop the
[SPEAKER_15]: outbreak and remove the culprit,
substance, or device will depend on what
[SPEAKER_15]: it is.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now, a number of hypotheses are
being looked at.
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything's on the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, and so given any of those
combinations, and that is the conclusion,
[SPEAKER_03]: the conclusion to which is causing harm
and death, what then transpires?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then do we see the administration and
executive order?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does then the legislature, you come to the
legislature and saying, okay, here's what
[SPEAKER_03]: it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please pass legislation.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you see, do you have a sense on how
that would then move forward?
[SPEAKER_15]: My sense is that if we knew what was
causing this, that swift action would be
[SPEAKER_15]: taken and all options would be considered.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Rivas.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Based on what you mentioned, I find it
startling that this could take years to
[SPEAKER_05]: find out what the culprit is.
[SPEAKER_05]: But based on where we are now,
it seems like this is obviously an
[SPEAKER_05]: evolving issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you mentioned, the data seems to be
changing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every state is handling this crisis as it
is from day to day in their own way.
[SPEAKER_05]: We as a state, based on the executive
order that the governor signed,
[SPEAKER_05]: is that enough?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that response enough for our state with
this crisis moving forward?
[SPEAKER_15]: Many options are being considered to
respond to this crisis.
[SPEAKER_15]: The recommendations in response to the
executive order are still being finalized,
[SPEAKER_15]: but many options are on the table,
including swift actions, thorough options
[SPEAKER_15]: to address the outbreak, and the youth
vaping epidemic.
[SPEAKER_15]: Even though these are distinct issues,
the outbreak of vaping lung injury and the
[SPEAKER_15]: youth vaping epidemic, they are related.
[SPEAKER_15]: There is some crossover, as I think Dr.
Wood had pointed out at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_15]: The recommendations being considered take
a broad approach and everything's on the
[SPEAKER_15]: table.
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Wood.
[SPEAKER_07]: Finally, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: The more I sit here, the more we hear,
the more questions you come up with.
[SPEAKER_07]: But considering that actually vaping has
been around for a while, and not just
[SPEAKER_07]: nicotine, but also cannabis, does it not
surprise you that suddenly this is
[SPEAKER_07]: happening?
[SPEAKER_07]: This just feels like this is isolated to
something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there have been other things.
[SPEAKER_07]: We go back to several years ago,
and the cannabis industry, vaping's been
[SPEAKER_07]: going on for a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: Certainly with nicotine, it's been going
on for a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: But all of a sudden, whoosh, something's
not right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that obviously is unusual.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that surprise you in some way?
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_15]: And as we discuss this with other states
who were facing a similar outbreak
[SPEAKER_15]: situation since August, that question
emerged.
[SPEAKER_15]: The increase in cases that we're seeing,
is it an artifact of us looking for them?
[SPEAKER_15]: Had they been there all along?
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe in California, the answer is no.
[SPEAKER_15]: That this is something new that we're
seeing that we haven't seen before.
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't know the cause yet, so we don't
know why, but we're looking at multiple
[SPEAKER_15]: theories and asking what changed to cause
this spike in cases.
[SPEAKER_15]: There are reports in the literature
reporting similar vaping lung injury cases
[SPEAKER_15]: from before August of 2019, but not even
close to the number that we're seeing now.
[SPEAKER_11]: That kind of brings me back to the vitamin
E acetate.
[SPEAKER_11]: You mentioned that was an ingredient not
found in all cases.
[SPEAKER_11]: But what do we know about the effects of
inhaling vitamin E acetate?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, the effects of what?
[SPEAKER_11]: Of inhaling vitamin E acetate.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we know anything?
[SPEAKER_15]: Not a lot.
[SPEAKER_15]: So one of the challenges of investigating
possible culprits like vitamin E acetate
[SPEAKER_15]: is that it's not just the substance
itself.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it might be safe when ingested.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can eat it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe it's a vitamin.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it's something that we think may
have health benefits when eaten.
[SPEAKER_15]: But when you heat it up and you vaporize
it and you inhale it into the lung,
[SPEAKER_15]: the effects that it has on the lung
tissue, on the little air sacs,
[SPEAKER_15]: is unknown.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so looking at each culprit,
even as vitamin E acetate is considered,
[SPEAKER_15]: isn't just testing the actual liquid
itself.
[SPEAKER_15]: It involves testing what happens when it's
vaporized.
[SPEAKER_15]: What are new compounds created?
[SPEAKER_15]: And then what happens when it's inhaled
into the lung?
[SPEAKER_15]: What does the tissue damage look like?
[SPEAKER_15]: What do the cells look like?
[SPEAKER_15]: That's one of the reasons why getting to
the bottom of this could take time,
[SPEAKER_15]: because it could involve studies over a
period of time using animal models looking
[SPEAKER_15]: at a wide range of toxins that are heated
to the point of being vaporized and then
[SPEAKER_15]: inhaled into the lungs.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think your original question was what
is the effect of vitamin E acetate?
[SPEAKER_15]: A theory was that that may have been what
was causing the lipoid pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_15]: That is being examined and studied and yet
unknown.
[SPEAKER_11]: And my understanding is it's not,
it is at this time a legal ingredient for
[SPEAKER_11]: legal cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that correct or is it in fact a banned
ingredient?
[SPEAKER_11]: Have we taken any action on that to your
knowledge?
[SPEAKER_15]: On vitamin E acetate?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not included in the list of things
that manufacturers must test for.
[SPEAKER_11]: Any other questions, comments before we
make our, I've inspired another one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, and it is the back and forth and it
is one of the challenges with,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to speak specifically to
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's one of the challenges with
this industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are things in the history that have
been used in the past that were safe on
[SPEAKER_07]: other things.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's a pesticide called Eagle
20 or I may be saying it wrong,
[SPEAKER_07]: but was used on leafy vegetables and other
kinds of things and it was safe.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you actually burned it,
it liberated cyanide.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's obviously not safe and that was
not known by other people.
[SPEAKER_07]: So because we're not testing for it now
through the Bureau, there may be other
[SPEAKER_07]: things that emerge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Vitamin E acetate on its own may be
perfectly safe, but in this setting,
[SPEAKER_07]: it may not and so it is particularly
challenging as people are probably
[SPEAKER_07]: experimenting quite frankly and adding
things to products to enhance them in some
[SPEAKER_07]: way.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is not an unusual occurrence or
this isn't an isolated incident with the
[SPEAKER_07]: industry and part of that is the challenge
of doing research and being able to see
[SPEAKER_07]: what truly is safe and what truly isn't.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your testimony.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think at this time we will take any
public comment.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, see we have significant interest in
public comment.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to ask you in light of the
length of the hearing here to try to
[SPEAKER_11]: confine your comments to around one
minute.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much and go ahead and begin.
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_22]: I really, we really appreciate the
opportunity to talk with you today.
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you to the chairs and the
committee.
[SPEAKER_22]: My name is Lindsay Robinson.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm the executive director of the
California Cannabis Industry Association.
[SPEAKER_22]: We represent about 500 members across the
state and roughly 15,000 employees.
[SPEAKER_22]: The legal cannabis industry is extremely
concerned about the current vaping issues
[SPEAKER_22]: as well as counterfeit products flooding
the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_22]: We're committed to building consumer
safety and confidence and our focus is on
[SPEAKER_22]: public safety.
[SPEAKER_22]: We look forward to a continued partnership
with the regulators, the Newsom
[SPEAKER_22]: administration and the legislature.
[SPEAKER_22]: As you all know the legal cannabis
industry vigorously tests all of its
[SPEAKER_22]: products.
[SPEAKER_22]: The folks who are members of CCIA and are
part of the legal industry have absolutely
[SPEAKER_22]: jumped through all of the hoops to be
compliant and we're absolutely committed
[SPEAKER_22]: to working with all of you.
[SPEAKER_22]: Our biggest fear is that if we cut off
access to legal cannabis the illicit
[SPEAKER_22]: market thrives even further which creates
more risk to public health.
[SPEAKER_22]: So we appreciate the opportunity to
partner with you and be a resource and
[SPEAKER_22]: thank you for this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_34]: Hi, good afternoon Chairman Gray and
Chairman Wood and committee members.
[SPEAKER_34]: My name is Tiffany Devitt.
[SPEAKER_34]: I work with Cannacraft.
[SPEAKER_34]: I head up our consumer and government
affairs.
[SPEAKER_34]: We're one of the largest manufacturers in
the state.
[SPEAKER_34]: We've done a lot of research on this
issue.
[SPEAKER_34]: It is worth mentioning that California has
the most rigorous testing standards in the
[SPEAKER_34]: country.
[SPEAKER_34]: We did some comparative testing of other
products and California cannabis with
[SPEAKER_34]: regard to pesticides is cleaner than
chocolate milk, it's cleaner than wine,
[SPEAKER_34]: it's cleaner than baby food.
[SPEAKER_34]: It looks as though this vaping issue is an
issue with the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_34]: Our message to you is that the only way to
stop the illnesses and deaths that are
[SPEAKER_34]: happening is to help consumers migrate
from the illicit market to the illicit
[SPEAKER_34]: market.
[SPEAKER_34]: There are three reasons why they're buying
in the black market.
[SPEAKER_34]: They can't tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_34]: They don't want to pay three times as much
for the regulated product or they don't
[SPEAKER_34]: have the access to regulated product.
[SPEAKER_34]: So what we'd urge you to do is to work on
passing 1356 to expand access to legal,
[SPEAKER_34]: well-tested, well-regulated cannabis and
look at some tax reform.
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for this hearing.
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Dale Geringer with California
Normal.
[SPEAKER_10]: I sponsored the first published studies on
cannabis vaporization back in 2001 and
[SPEAKER_10]: 2003 which demonstrated quite clearly that
vaporizers were very effective in removing
[SPEAKER_10]: the toxins in marijuana smoke and were
really helpful as a smoke harm reduction
[SPEAKER_10]: device.
[SPEAKER_10]: Since then, marijuana vaporizers have come
to be accepted as the gold standard for
[SPEAKER_10]: administration in medical studies.
[SPEAKER_10]: However, there are vaporizers and there
are vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been a lot of innovation recently
with new kinds of extracts, possible new
[SPEAKER_10]: chemicals and additives and there is an
issue about the hardware which comes from
[SPEAKER_10]: China from many different sources,
some of them more reputable than others.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we ought to investigate those
things.
[SPEAKER_10]: However, consumers really appreciate the
availability of tested, high-quality
[SPEAKER_10]: vaporizers on the market now in
California, hope they stay there and
[SPEAKER_10]: should a problem ever arise with one of
those, at least we'll be able to track it
[SPEAKER_10]: down a whole lot better than this stuff
that's on the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: Rand Martin here on behalf of Caliva which
is one of the largest vertically
[SPEAKER_16]: integrated operations in the state of
California.
[SPEAKER_16]: We appreciate the emphasis today on
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_16]: We can tell you from the perspective on
the ground is that enforcement resources
[SPEAKER_16]: may be substantial but they are far from
sufficient.
[SPEAKER_16]: We as the stakeholders and you as the
legislature have worked to put more funds
[SPEAKER_16]: into the budget for the last couple of
years for more resources for enforcement.
[SPEAKER_16]: That was done in the context of making it
easier for legal operators to continue to
[SPEAKER_16]: operate successfully and also to make sure
that our tax resources were robust as
[SPEAKER_16]: projected but now it's taken on a whole
new complexion with this public health
[SPEAKER_16]: issue.
[SPEAKER_16]: We really need this coming budget cycle to
amp up our efforts to get more,
[SPEAKER_16]: excuse me, more money into the budget for
enforcement purposes.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_30]: Hi, I'm Ellen Comp with California Normal.
[SPEAKER_30]: I have an opposite perspective.
[SPEAKER_30]: A hundred years of punitive actions
against marijuana sellers hasn't made our
[SPEAKER_30]: state safer.
[SPEAKER_30]: The only thing that will ever work is
proper reasonable regulation.
[SPEAKER_30]: We thank Lori Ajax and the BCC for
enacting those regulations in California,
[SPEAKER_30]: keeping us safe.
[SPEAKER_30]: We supported the bills Mr. Lowe mentioned
to address the problem of two-thirds of
[SPEAKER_30]: California cities and counties not
licensing cannabis retailer delivery.
[SPEAKER_30]: Tulare and Kings County where we have seen
deaths due to this crisis have no legal
[SPEAKER_30]: option available.
[SPEAKER_30]: Mr. Gray, there was no bill to encourage
cannabis use by passengers in commercial
[SPEAKER_30]: vehicles in California.
[SPEAKER_30]: That was allowed for in Prop 64 as it is
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_30]: There was a bill to regulate those
vehicles which was sensationalized in the
[SPEAKER_30]: press as allowing it.
[SPEAKER_30]: Now the transportation bill has ensured
that the exemption for passengers in such
[SPEAKER_30]: vehicles applies only to alcohol,
not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_30]: Excessive alcohol use in California is
responsible for 10,000 deaths and 72,000
[SPEAKER_30]: hospitalizations annually.
[SPEAKER_30]: The penalty in California for illegal
sales of firearms, as far as I can find,
[SPEAKER_30]: is a misdemeanor with a $1,000 fine.
[SPEAKER_30]: There are 3,500 deaths due to firearms
annually in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon Chair and members.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Jazzy Graywell and I'm here on
behalf of UFCW, Western States Council.
[SPEAKER_00]: UFCW represents thousands of cannabis
workers within the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're committed to ensuring the legal
cannabis industry continues to put
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer safety first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strong regulations and strong enforcement
are critical to protecting consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The California Department of Public
Health, while cautioning against vaping
[SPEAKER_00]: until more is known about the root of
these illnesses, has been clear in its
[SPEAKER_00]: advice to consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illegal cannabis dispensaries sell
unregulated and untested cannabis products
[SPEAKER_00]: and should not be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we do know is that licensed
cannabis businesses continue to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: safest option for consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: No cannabis vaping products purchased at
legal cannabis businesses have been
[SPEAKER_00]: confirmed linked to any of the recent
health cases reported.
[SPEAKER_00]: In response to the outbreaks of
respiratory illness linked to vaping,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is imperative that California further
strengthen its enforcement efforts to
[SPEAKER_00]: thwart the illicit market by identifying
and closing the estimated 3,000 illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries operating in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, state officials and
industry leaders must redouble their
[SPEAKER_00]: commitment to ensuring a legal marketplace
in which consumers can purchase cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: products with confidence on their safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_19]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_19]: Lynn Silver, the Public Health Institute.
[SPEAKER_19]: Dr. Wood, your former county health
officer.
[SPEAKER_19]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm glad to see this hearing today.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is not just an issue of legal versus
illegal products.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a much deeper problem.
[SPEAKER_19]: If there is no single cause, we need to
look at the forces that are driving
[SPEAKER_19]: addiction, initiation, and heavy use,
and thereby exposing people to whatever
[SPEAKER_19]: hazards may be causing this epidemic,
but also the many other more serious
[SPEAKER_19]: health consequences.
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, not more serious than death,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_19]: This week, for example, I purchased Stilze
Grandaddy Perp, a sleek pink vaping
[SPEAKER_19]: device, which I'll give you guys,
resembling a memory stick with grape
[SPEAKER_19]: flavor, 78% THC, or 393 milligrams,
four times the maximum THC dose for edible
[SPEAKER_19]: packages, 40 times the maximum Canadian
edible packages, the equivalent of 30 1990
[SPEAKER_19]: joints.
[SPEAKER_19]: Furthermore, in just 0.02 ounces,
it is an invitation to youth addiction
[SPEAKER_19]: legally marketed in the state of
California.
[SPEAKER_19]: Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate a
five-fold increase in psychosis risk with
[SPEAKER_19]: daily use of cannabis products over 10%
THC, which is almost the entire California
[SPEAKER_19]: regulated legal or illegal market.
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to address these issues to
successfully reverse both this epidemic
[SPEAKER_19]: and negative health consequences from
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to make a few just very concrete
recommendations, and I can leave a written
[SPEAKER_19]: set of comments with you.
[SPEAKER_19]: We call for urgent common-sense action
from the state legislature and state
[SPEAKER_19]: agencies to prevent even more serious
consequences.
[SPEAKER_19]: First, close the kitty on-ramp of flavored
products and sounds like flavored
[SPEAKER_19]: products, like the one Assemblymember Gray
cited, the banana, this and that,
[SPEAKER_19]: that may not be flavored but certainly
sound to a kid like they are, both for
[SPEAKER_19]: nicotine and for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: Second, build on San Francisco and
Richmond's courageous initiatives and
[SPEAKER_19]: suspend sales of vaping products A,
until the e-cigarette industry proves
[SPEAKER_19]: their safety to the FDA, and for the case
of cannabis, until we understand what is
[SPEAKER_19]: going on with the vaping epidemic.
[SPEAKER_19]: Third, interrupt the addiction glide path
created by products like this by limiting
[SPEAKER_19]: the potency of THC products allowed.
[SPEAKER_19]: This will reduce youth addiction to
vaping, lung disease, psychosis,
[SPEAKER_19]: secondary to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: Uruguay and Quebec, for example,
have already done this.
[SPEAKER_19]: Fourth, tell people the truth.
[SPEAKER_19]: We only have warnings in six-point font on
packages today.
[SPEAKER_19]: We need to have clear, prominent health
warnings to consumers, in stores,
[SPEAKER_19]: on products, and on ads, making clear the
recognized health risks from cannabis,
[SPEAKER_19]: including addiction, low birth weight,
vaping, the vaping epidemic, psychosis,
[SPEAKER_19]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_19]: Fifth, limit the marketing that kids and
teens are seeing every day.
[SPEAKER_19]: For example, even the restriction on
billboards that was part of Prop 64 was
[SPEAKER_19]: weakened by the December regulations,
allowing some of the spate of billboards
[SPEAKER_19]: we're seeing all across the state.
[SPEAKER_19]: Do not allow marketing in restaurants,
alcohol stores, and other places where
[SPEAKER_19]: kids go.
[SPEAKER_19]: We bought a coffee cup in, I think it was
pizza or Starbucks, a week ago with a
[SPEAKER_19]: chill banner on the coffee cup,
for example, and established a scientific
[SPEAKER_19]: advisory board for cannabis regulation
that is free of conflicts of interest.
[SPEAKER_19]: That is essential to help guide these
processes with exemption.
[SPEAKER_19]: The time for action is now.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your comments.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me remind everybody we just
experienced two very long one-minute
[SPEAKER_11]: comments.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're actually, the committee is genuinely
interested in what you have to say to a
[SPEAKER_11]: degree to which you can confine your
comments to a minute and then provide any
[SPEAKER_11]: written testimony, questions that center
to the committee.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll certainly make sure everybody sees
us.
[SPEAKER_11]: Proceed.
[SPEAKER_39]: Good afternoon, Chairman and members of
the committee.
[SPEAKER_39]: Andres Ramirez on behalf of Select,
Moxie, and Crusco.
[SPEAKER_39]: I want to thank you for calling this
information hearing to discuss this
[SPEAKER_39]: important topic and thank the committee
staff for all their work.
[SPEAKER_39]: Through the leadership of Cameron Forney,
the CEO of Select, we've helped build a
[SPEAKER_39]: large coalition of 25-plus cannabis
industry businesses to come together and
[SPEAKER_39]: recommend five pillars that we strongly
believe would lead to an effective and
[SPEAKER_39]: immediate impact on illicit vaping
products.
[SPEAKER_39]: We've shared our coalition recommendations
with committee staff, and the five pillars
[SPEAKER_39]: include addressing the illicit market,
enhancing testing regulations,
[SPEAKER_39]: certifying hardware and facilities,
anti-counterfeiting efforts, and certified
[SPEAKER_39]: shipping.
[SPEAKER_39]: We've had many discussions and meetings
with Governor Newsom's administration,
[SPEAKER_39]: as well as cannabis regulators,
and we greatly appreciate their effort and
[SPEAKER_39]: interest to work with us and discuss our
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_39]: We're excited to partner and work with the
legislature, specifically your committees,
[SPEAKER_39]: to ensure that youth vaping epidemic is
not only reduced, but that strong
[SPEAKER_39]: effective enforcement is directed at
eradicating illegal and counterfeit vaping
[SPEAKER_39]: products in California.
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for the committee for
convening today and having this hearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's one message I would like the
committee to take away from this is three
[SPEAKER_02]: words, bans don't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Louis Han.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a California native, and I have vetted
thousands of cannabis companies for the
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcview Group, a nine-year-old investor
network that has invested more than $260
[SPEAKER_02]: million into the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: A moratorium on all cannabis vaping is not
the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Despite years of cannabis vaping products
being on the market, we are only hearing
[SPEAKER_02]: about these issues now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is because this is a death rattle of
illegitimate producers who are using fast
[SPEAKER_02]: and cheap methods in order to cling on to
the market share that they have left.
[SPEAKER_02]: A ban on cannabis vaping is the exact
response that they're looking for,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that will shut down their
legitimate competitors while allowing them
[SPEAKER_02]: to continue to thrive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bans will only perpetuate this public
health crisis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, we should invest more resources
into enforcement and research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I encourage our legislature to consider
these alternatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bans didn't work for prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't work for the war on drugs,
and it won't work now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_35]: Chair and members, Kathy Mossberg with the
American Heart Association.
[SPEAKER_35]: Again, like everyone, I want to thank you
for this hearing today.
[SPEAKER_35]: I want to underscore some comments from
the first panel and talk about the
[SPEAKER_35]: epidemic we're seeing in teen vaping.
[SPEAKER_35]: We have been the sponsors, along with a
number of public health advocates,
[SPEAKER_35]: in encouraging this legislature,
and we hope to work with the governor's
[SPEAKER_35]: office in banning, sorry, not my best
following the last gentleman, but banning
[SPEAKER_35]: the sale of all flavored e-cig and
combustible tobacco products.
[SPEAKER_35]: We think this is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_35]: Certainly, we heard the testimony that up
until a point that the ban has worked,
[SPEAKER_35]: we have seen a decrease in teen and youth
use, but that we left out menthol.
[SPEAKER_35]: So we do think that menthol and mint need
to be a part of this ban.
[SPEAKER_35]: So we encourage, we want to work with the
legislature, these committees,
[SPEAKER_35]: and we encourage you to work on that this
next coming session.
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to clarify your comments there,
did you include, you said a ban on THC and
[SPEAKER_11]: tobacco?
[SPEAKER_35]: We do not have a position on cannabis at
this point.
[SPEAKER_35]: We are looking into that, but that is an
area that we haven't looked at before.
[SPEAKER_35]: We have been focused on vaping and e-cigs
as well as combustibles.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_21]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_21]: Daria McGrew on behalf of the California
Dental Association.
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for the attendance.
[SPEAKER_21]: As I mentioned, there's clearly several
complex issues at play here, separating
[SPEAKER_21]: out the discussion of flavors and the
discussion of cannabis and some of the
[SPEAKER_21]: issues that could be used to address the
vaping-related illness.
[SPEAKER_21]: CDA is supportive of multi-pronged
approaches that address all of these
[SPEAKER_21]: through separate policy issues,
including a ban on flavors.
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_25]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_25]: Laura Del Castillo with Eden Enterprises,
which is a fully licensed, vertically
[SPEAKER_25]: integrated cannabis company that includes
manufacturing vape products, which are
[SPEAKER_25]: rigorously tested, as you've heard today.
[SPEAKER_25]: I would just like to echo some of the
comments I've been hearing, which is that,
[SPEAKER_25]: yes, the public health issue is very
important and should be addressed in a
[SPEAKER_25]: smart and effective way, not with
reactionary bans, but with thorough
[SPEAKER_25]: research, public education, and really
getting to the root of the problem,
[SPEAKER_25]: which we've heard is directly connected to
the illicit market created through
[SPEAKER_25]: prohibition and lack of enforcement.
[SPEAKER_25]: That being said, and I agree with others,
that this issue is being somewhat
[SPEAKER_25]: conflated with the use of vaping and the
attractive flavors.
[SPEAKER_25]: But if the state and other local
municipalities are considering a flavor
[SPEAKER_25]: ban that would extend to cannabis,
I would encourage you to carefully
[SPEAKER_25]: consider and make clear the definition of
flavor, which should focus on artificial
[SPEAKER_25]: flavors rather than naturally occurring
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_29]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_29]: Alicia Priego on behalf of the California
Cannabis Manufacturers Association.
[SPEAKER_29]: We also stand ready to work with and be a
resource for the legislature and the
[SPEAKER_29]: regulatory agencies.
[SPEAKER_29]: As covered exhaustively today,
this is a youth and illicit market issue.
[SPEAKER_29]: We are also looking at best practices and
have seen in Europe that they have a very
[SPEAKER_29]: vigorous education effort on the use of
vaping devices and hardware and also limit
[SPEAKER_29]: nicotine content and other ingredients
inside the devices and notably do not have
[SPEAKER_29]: the same issues that we're experiencing
here.
[SPEAKER_29]: And lastly, the notable absence of reports
stating cases arising from legal regulated
[SPEAKER_29]: outlets speak strongly to the
effectiveness of controlled access and
[SPEAKER_29]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_26]: Good afternoon, Chairman Gray,
Chairman Wood, Amy Jenkins here on behalf
[SPEAKER_26]: of two cannabis operators, Bloom Farms and
Sunday Goods, both manufacturers of
[SPEAKER_26]: inhalable products, license compliant
entities that are subject to all the
[SPEAKER_26]: rigorous testing standards.
[SPEAKER_26]: I want to echo the comments made by
Cannacraft, CCIA and Arcview.
[SPEAKER_26]: Bans just simply will not work in this
situation and the linkages with compliant
[SPEAKER_26]: products is just simply not there at this
point in time.
[SPEAKER_26]: Both Bloom Farms and Sunday Goods is
committed to continuing to partner with
[SPEAKER_26]: this legislature and our associations.
[SPEAKER_26]: I've never seen so many groups coalescing
and working together to try to resolve
[SPEAKER_26]: this issue.
[SPEAKER_26]: We want to continue to be partners.
[SPEAKER_26]: A couple of last minute comments.
[SPEAKER_26]: Illicit market.
[SPEAKER_26]: We need more enforcement dollars and we've
been trying to champion that.
[SPEAKER_26]: Access continues to be a significant
issue, as you know, and then adopting some
[SPEAKER_26]: anti counterfeiting measures would
certainly be critically important.
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good afternoon, Michael Wheeler.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the vice president of policy with
Flowcom.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a cannabis distributor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for taking time today
with this hearing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously a very complicated issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: I echo many of my peers with regards to
their remarks around the usefulness and
[SPEAKER_04]: effectiveness of bans and prohibition.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've talked a lot about the
importance of how we encourage use of the
[SPEAKER_04]: regulated market through reducing taxation
and increasing access to legal regulated
[SPEAKER_04]: product.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, what I wanted to add to the
comments today were that I've got three
[SPEAKER_04]: kids at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're young.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not exposed to this yet,
but I'm very concerned about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very concerned about teen vaping and
absolutely positively, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we stand at your side and working in any
way to stamp out teen vaping.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a horrible epidemic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would encourage you.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I didn't hear any of the panelists
talk about today was some of the factors
[SPEAKER_04]: that add to the coolness.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you get a chance to take a look at
YouTube, go look at teen vape tricks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything having to do with vape tricks on
YouTube, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your jaw will drop and this is part of
what makes it cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kids sit around all day sucking on their
vape pen, doing these tricks over and over
[SPEAKER_04]: again.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's practice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Practice makes perfect, but it's adding to
the use of these products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just don't want another data point
for all of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_18]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_18]: Pamela Lopez with K Street Consulting.
[SPEAKER_18]: On behalf of the Silicon Valley Cannabis
Alliance, cannabis is medicine and
[SPEAKER_18]: licensed and regulated folks in the
cannabis industry are absolute partners in
[SPEAKER_18]: working with you to get to the heart of
this crisis.
[SPEAKER_18]: We would urge you to remember that access
to cannabis is an important way to help
[SPEAKER_18]: consumers get away from the black market
illicit products that are making them
[SPEAKER_18]: sick.
[SPEAKER_18]: If I recall correctly, to date,
only 600 licensed retailers exist in the
[SPEAKER_18]: state of California.
[SPEAKER_18]: 275 licensed non-storefront distributors.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's down from 3,000 storefronts that
were open before the passage of Prop 64
[SPEAKER_18]: and before cannabis was licensed and
regulated.
[SPEAKER_18]: So there will always be bad guys who are
trying to sell illicit stuff on the black
[SPEAKER_18]: market to make a quick buck.
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's our job in the state of
California to make sure that consumers
[SPEAKER_18]: have access to products that they know are
licensed and safe.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sabrina Fendrick with Berkeley Patients
Group.
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to reiterate what some of the
other people have said, our country and
[SPEAKER_14]: our state have gone through multiple
iterations of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_14]: Every single time, we've realized that it
doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the whole point of Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_14]: However, when you have two-thirds of the
state that are banning retail sales,
[SPEAKER_14]: it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that
we're seeing the bathtub gin of 2019
[SPEAKER_14]: happening or the K2 spice of 2019
happening.
[SPEAKER_14]: I would also note, it's important when
talking about flavors to consider the
[SPEAKER_14]: genesis of the flavor.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was mentioned before and the difference
between naturally occurring flavors and
[SPEAKER_14]: artificial flavors.
[SPEAKER_14]: And also I wanted to bring to your
attention, and nobody has mentioned today,
[SPEAKER_14]: is looking at the data in the UK and in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is a very uniquely American
crisis.
[SPEAKER_14]: The United Kingdom has one of the lowest
youth use rates and actually subsidizes
[SPEAKER_14]: vape smoking and promotes it as smoking
sensation policy.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we should ask the question as to why.
[SPEAKER_14]: Why is there a disconnect between
evidence-based public policy and
[SPEAKER_14]: emotionally driven prohibitive policies
that are uniquely American that we need to
[SPEAKER_14]: look away from?
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_24]: Good afternoon, members.
[SPEAKER_24]: Erica Costa with the American Lung
Association.
[SPEAKER_24]: I very much appreciate the robust
discussion today on this issue,
[SPEAKER_24]: and we just simply want to emphasize the
importance of including flavors in the
[SPEAKER_24]: conversation, particularly mint and
menthol.
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, very much appreciate the discussion
and look forward to further conversation.
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_42]: Good afternoon, Chairman Gray and
committee members.
[SPEAKER_42]: My name is Alex Thompson.
[SPEAKER_42]: I am the Director of Compliance for Pure
Extracts, a vaporizer cartridge
[SPEAKER_42]: manufacturer in Delray Oaks.
[SPEAKER_42]: I work alongside three dozen diligent
ethical people passionately helping
[SPEAKER_42]: medicinal and recreational consumers
through our products.
[SPEAKER_42]: As I hope each of you can say,
I love my work.
[SPEAKER_42]: I joined the regulated cannabis industry
eight years ago as a Crohn's disease
[SPEAKER_42]: sufferer and doctoral student.
[SPEAKER_42]: Cannabis saved my life then and still
provides me with life-changing symptom
[SPEAKER_42]: relief, particularly wind vapor.
[SPEAKER_42]: As a patient, scholar, and industry
member, please hear me that rash action on
[SPEAKER_42]: this topic may have disastrous fallout.
[SPEAKER_42]: Since first hearing of recent medicinal
concern over vaporizer products,
[SPEAKER_42]: Pure Extracts began intensive research,
supplemental laboratory testing,
[SPEAKER_42]: and made pointed requests of our cannabis
vendors, terpene suppliers, and cartridge
[SPEAKER_42]: manufacturers for all available research
and safety data.
[SPEAKER_42]: We welcome your further guidance in
protecting our consumers' safety,
[SPEAKER_42]: particularly focusing on cutting agents
used within the illicit market though,
[SPEAKER_42]: including vitamin E acetate.
[SPEAKER_42]: We strongly support additional laboratory
testing and consumer warning requirements.
[SPEAKER_42]: We will never ignore the well-being of our
consumers.
[SPEAKER_42]: We are also sincerely concerned though
about our livelihoods and the medicinal
[SPEAKER_42]: needs of our thousands of consumers.
[SPEAKER_42]: Please collaborate with our industry to
address this issue with an evidence-based
[SPEAKER_42]: manner that provides an ongoing access to
a non-combusted inhalable cannabis option.
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is John with Wederb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm speaking on the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lack of enforcement in illicit market
is not really the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the lack of licensing in the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of us that were in the illicit
market and a lot of these companies
[SPEAKER_01]: forget, the major companies forget that
they were in illicit market at one point
[SPEAKER_01]: in time and how did they get the money in
order to get the license that they do have
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been struggling for the last three
years in order to get licensing in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody has been able to give it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been doing the best that I can in
order to try to, you know, get the correct
[SPEAKER_01]: information to get in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a lot of us in the illicit market,
we are definitely trying our best.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have families, we take care of business
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's kind of hard when you have people
that are in power that control the
[SPEAKER_01]: narrative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_32]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_32]: My name is Anne Delcore.
[SPEAKER_32]: I chair the Anti Vaping Alliance at Rio
Americano High School.
[SPEAKER_32]: Today I brought props.
[SPEAKER_32]: This is a month's worth of confiscated
devices from the high school.
[SPEAKER_32]: I take them just about everywhere I go
because I find that they are the best
[SPEAKER_32]: educational tool that we have in this
fight.
[SPEAKER_32]: So it's a variety of nicotine and
marijuana devices.
[SPEAKER_32]: And as we heard today, the students are
vaping these devices interchangeably.
[SPEAKER_32]: I am asking that we do something urgently.
[SPEAKER_32]: I think waiting until the next legislative
session delays this.
[SPEAKER_32]: And we are seeing students and families
truly suffering with addiction already.
[SPEAKER_32]: They're spending a lot of money on
addiction counselors.
[SPEAKER_32]: Teachers and administrators are having a
very difficult time educating our kids
[SPEAKER_32]: because of this distraction.
[SPEAKER_32]: And the schools need more help.
[SPEAKER_32]: So I ask you for attention to the schools,
either additional personnel or additional
[SPEAKER_32]: help at the state level.
[SPEAKER_32]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_40]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_40]: My name is Lori Bremner with the American
Cancer Society Cancer Action Network.
[SPEAKER_40]: The single most important thing that we
can do to tackle the teen e-cigarette
[SPEAKER_40]: epidemic is to pass a policy that
prohibits the sale of all flavored tobacco
[SPEAKER_40]: products.
[SPEAKER_40]: Passing a flavor policy with no exemptions
ensures that youth don't go from one type
[SPEAKER_40]: of tobacco product to another to chase the
candy flavor that got them hooked in the
[SPEAKER_40]: first place.
[SPEAKER_40]: Mint and menthol are extremely popular
among youth.
[SPEAKER_40]: And exempting those flavors would
undermine all efforts designed to limit
[SPEAKER_40]: youth initiation.
[SPEAKER_40]: Legislators introduced two bills last year
that would have prohibited the sale of all
[SPEAKER_40]: flavored tobacco products, but they did
not advance.
[SPEAKER_40]: Juul and other tobacco companies lobby
furiously against flavor policies because
[SPEAKER_40]: they know they will result in a reduction
of tobacco use in our state.
[SPEAKER_40]: The American Cancer Society Cancer Action
Network hopes that the outcome of these
[SPEAKER_40]: hearings will be for the legislature to
adopt the consensus, along with the public
[SPEAKER_40]: health community and more than 40
California cities, that prohibiting the
[SPEAKER_40]: sale of all flavored tobacco products with
no exemptions is the best way to combat
[SPEAKER_40]: youth tobacco addiction.
[SPEAKER_40]: We need to hold Juul and the other tobacco
companies accountable for the disaster
[SPEAKER_40]: that they've caused.
[SPEAKER_40]: By passing a bill that prohibits the sale
of all flavored tobacco products,
[SPEAKER_40]: the need is urgent.
[SPEAKER_40]: We need to get this done.
[SPEAKER_11]: And just to clarify again for the record,
there's been a lot of confiscating on this
[SPEAKER_11]: issue that was just on tobacco or on all
vaping?
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm addressing only tobacco-ish tobacco
products, but all tobacco products,
[SPEAKER_40]: including menthol and mint, combustible
cigarettes as well.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_23]: Thanks, everybody, for coming together
today.
[SPEAKER_23]: My name is Mike Clemens.
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm the president and co-founder of Guild
Extracts.
[SPEAKER_23]: We're a licensed manufacturer out of
Oakland, California.
[SPEAKER_23]: And as has been explored today,
California spent years carefully crafting
[SPEAKER_23]: a framework of regulatory controls to
address the public health risks that we've
[SPEAKER_23]: been talking about today, like VAPI.
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't believe that we're seeing a
failure of these controls.
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that we're seeing the result of a
failure to adequately support legal
[SPEAKER_23]: cannabis industry within this framework.
[SPEAKER_23]: The economic burdens on the industry from
the regulatory layer has driven up prices
[SPEAKER_23]: and driven consumers to continue to
purchase from the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_23]: To Mr. Cooper's point, a recent audit
found close to 3,000 illegal retailers in
[SPEAKER_23]: California versus the 873 that Ms. Ajax's
team at the BCC has licensed.
[SPEAKER_23]: A lack of enforcement against the bad
actors across the state has resulted in a
[SPEAKER_23]: black market that's not only impossible
for regulated businesses to compete with,
[SPEAKER_23]: but it also operates outside of the
oversight that's supposed to ensure
[SPEAKER_23]: products conform to a safe standard.
[SPEAKER_23]: Furthermore, any move to just completely
ban any product altogether will only
[SPEAKER_23]: exacerbate a dangerous situation by
driving more consumers away from a
[SPEAKER_23]: regulated businesses to the illicit
sources, and it still fails to address the
[SPEAKER_23]: underlying problem of contamination in the
supply chain.
[SPEAKER_23]: It would be disastrous to the industry and
to the people of California that have
[SPEAKER_23]: entrusted their elected officials to work
together to make this industry work.
[SPEAKER_23]: It would also threaten the entire state
program that we've all worked really hard
[SPEAKER_23]: to create.
[SPEAKER_23]: So we just need to enforce the law,
and we need to make compliance less costly
[SPEAKER_23]: for the good actors.
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_38]: Marvin Pineda on behalf of the United
Cannabis Business Association.
[SPEAKER_38]: We've actively have worked to push for
penalties as Prop 64 was drafted only to
[SPEAKER_38]: allow for penalties for legal operators.
[SPEAKER_38]: So for the last couple of years,
you've had state agencies and attorney
[SPEAKER_38]: general and local law enforcement not
having the tools necessary to shut down
[SPEAKER_38]: the illegal market.
[SPEAKER_38]: AB 97 is the first step that we worked on.
[SPEAKER_38]: AB 1417, which allowed attorney general,
district attorneys and city attorneys to
[SPEAKER_38]: impose penalties was held in the Senate,
a provisions committee.
[SPEAKER_38]: There's a crisis.
[SPEAKER_38]: We are legal.
[SPEAKER_38]: We have ensured that our products are
safe.
[SPEAKER_38]: A ban on all vaping products will only
push people to the illegal market.
[SPEAKER_38]: We want to do the right thing,
and we've been advocating this for years,
[SPEAKER_38]: and now there's a crisis.
[SPEAKER_38]: Now people are saying that the illegal
market needs to be shut down.
[SPEAKER_38]: We've been advocating that for years.
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Chairman, Tim Madden, representing the
California Chapter of the American College
[SPEAKER_06]: of Cardiology.
[SPEAKER_06]: And since I'm your last person,
I won't go too much longer.
[SPEAKER_06]: But consistent with what some other folks
have mentioned, we believe as an
[SPEAKER_06]: organization that a ban on all vaping
products is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: And listening to Dr. Dean's testimony,
where the Department of Public Health is
[SPEAKER_06]: saying people should not be vaping at all,
we think is the prudent approach.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we want to get to the next level.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are asking for a ban similar to
what was done in Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_06]: although they did it on a four-month time
frame on all vaping products.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_41]: Hello, Jared Kylo, president of the United
Cannabis Business Association.
[SPEAKER_41]: Going to keep it short.
[SPEAKER_41]: Regulations are just suggestions without
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_41]: That is what we need to focus on.
[SPEAKER_41]: We are trying to build an industry,
and we're trying to keep safety and
[SPEAKER_41]: security amongst our consumers.
[SPEAKER_41]: And if we don't have a good enforcement
branch, we are just allowing these
[SPEAKER_41]: regulations to just kind of go pass us by.
[SPEAKER_41]: And we're not really focusing on what the
effects are, not only for the industry as
[SPEAKER_41]: its growth, but also the health and safety
of its consumers.
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your comments.
[SPEAKER_11]: That brings us to the conclusion of public
comment.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll bring it back here to the committee
for closing comments.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to thank Chairman Wood and
Chairman Low.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this has been a very informative
hearing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it's been a long afternoon,
but this is a tremendously important
[SPEAKER_11]: subject that I know we all share.
[SPEAKER_11]: A desire to move forward with some
solutions, some concrete activity via
[SPEAKER_11]: early in the legislative year next year.
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you again, Chairman.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll let you make some closing remarks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just thank you to my colleagues for
working with us to put this together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, when you fill the room in a
non-legislative session, you clearly have
[SPEAKER_07]: a topic of interest.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I appreciate the information we
learned today.
[SPEAKER_07]: We will use this to craft an additional
hearing.
[SPEAKER_07]: To explore this issue further.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just so people know, we are not in
session.
[SPEAKER_07]: We cannot take any sort of legislative
action now until we reconvene in January.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just the way it works.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I appreciate everybody's attendance
here, all of our panelists, everybody who
[SPEAKER_07]: came and many people who came from a long
distance to participate today.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's been really valuable
information and look forward to
[SPEAKER_07]: reconvening and discussing this further.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_11]: With that, we're adjourned.
Thank you.
Thank you.
