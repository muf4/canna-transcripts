[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, good morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Robert Sumner with the California
Department of Justice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to be here this morning in front
of these three committees.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it will be a really great panel
throughout the morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll keep my portion brief and largely
suited to the role of the Attorney General
[SPEAKER_04]: as the constitutional chief law officer
for the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both the medical marijuana legislation
that was passed and Prop 64 actually
[SPEAKER_04]: largely omits a direct role for the
Department of Justice, aside from our
[SPEAKER_04]: administrative duty and in disseminating
criminal history information.
[SPEAKER_04]: That said, as I go through a basic
overview of the bill, you'll see that as
[SPEAKER_04]: the lawyer for virtually every government
entity in the state, the Attorney General
[SPEAKER_04]: will be continuing to assess the impact
that Prop 64 and the legislation provides.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something that we're going to
have on our day-to-day responsibilities
[SPEAKER_04]: through our various legal divisions and
sections.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've actually appointed a coordinator
within our government law section,
[SPEAKER_04]: an attorney whose sole purpose on this
project is going to be to assess the
[SPEAKER_04]: cumulative impact of these new policies
for marijuana on the department.
[SPEAKER_04]: To understand whether or not we have
appropriate resources to handle all the
[SPEAKER_04]: complex legal issues and regulatory
frameworks that are going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: implemented as a result of the law.
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition to that, we also are going to
be actively using our case management
[SPEAKER_04]: system to track any litigation that comes
to the various sections that have a core
[SPEAKER_04]: nucleus subject of cannabis or marijuana
legalization in order to track the
[SPEAKER_04]: progression of those issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a quick overview, I believe the
background paper does a fairly good
[SPEAKER_04]: summary of the Prop 64 language,
but I can just give a refresher.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that it makes cannabis lawful under
state and local law for adults 21 and
[SPEAKER_04]: older.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can possess up to one ounce of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: For personal use and cultivate up to six
plants for personal use in a private
[SPEAKER_04]: locked residence.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can only be smoked and vaped in places
where tobacco is allowed and it can't be
[SPEAKER_04]: ingested in a public place.
[SPEAKER_04]: From there, Prop 64 is largely based on
the previous medical legislation that was
[SPEAKER_04]: championed by members of this committee
and the legislature.
[SPEAKER_04]: In that it divides up a number of very
complicated and necessary regulatory
[SPEAKER_04]: framework pieces across different areas of
agency expertise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, the one newly created entity
within the past few years is the Bureau of
[SPEAKER_04]: Medical Cannabis Regulation, which is
going to be handling the licensure for the
[SPEAKER_04]: transport distribution, sale, and I
believe will be testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a new bureau that, as an entity of
the Department of Consumer Affairs,
[SPEAKER_04]: will be a client agency of our licensing
section.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then meanwhile, the Food and
Agriculture Department is going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: licensing the cultivation, which is a
client of our natural resources section.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Public Health will be
licensing manufacturing, and that is a
[SPEAKER_04]: client of our health, education,
and welfare section.
[SPEAKER_04]: From there, those kind of key implementers
that are obviously working on a tight
[SPEAKER_04]: timeline to implement regulation,
there will be a number of other impacted
[SPEAKER_04]: agencies or legal issues that may come to
light within the Attorney General's
[SPEAKER_04]: office.
[SPEAKER_04]: The State Board of Equalization will
obviously be in charge of collecting the
[SPEAKER_04]: special taxes implemented by Prop 64,
which is a client of our business and tax
[SPEAKER_04]: section.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another client of that section is the
treasurer, who is, of course, working on a
[SPEAKER_04]: number of issues related to dealing with
the profits related to marijuana sales.
[SPEAKER_04]: The various environmental regulations that
are going to be set by Food and
[SPEAKER_04]: Agriculture, as well as State Water
Resources Control Board and the Department
[SPEAKER_04]: of Pesticides is a kind of our natural
resources section.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on top of that, we expect that
there will be a number of reduced
[SPEAKER_04]: penalties as a result of Prop 64,
which allows for marijuana felonies to be
[SPEAKER_04]: reduced to misdemeanors with petitions for
reduced charges.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so our appeals, writs, and trials
section, which handles many of those
[SPEAKER_04]: cases, will likely be dealing with those
issues, as well as our correctional law
[SPEAKER_04]: section.
[SPEAKER_04]: From there, as far as our employment
administrative mandate section,
[SPEAKER_04]: Prop 64 continues to allow employers to
discriminate against users of marijuana,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that may come up as well as in
settings of professional licensure,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is one of the primary BNP committee
issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both our health quality enforcement
section, which deals with the healing arts
[SPEAKER_04]: boards, and our licensing section,
which deals with many of the other boards,
[SPEAKER_04]: may end up seeing litigation involving
disciplinary or licensure revocation
[SPEAKER_04]: cases, where one of the factors behind the
investigation was use of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the extent that local ordinances
restrict cultivation or use of marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: in a zoning context, we have a land law
section that would deal with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prop 64 also envisions the possibility of
non-profit licensees, and that would fall
[SPEAKER_04]: under our charitable trust section.
[SPEAKER_04]: It got to a point when we were assessing
this that as we go through all of those
[SPEAKER_04]: issues which unfold through the language
of Prop 64, nearly every legal section
[SPEAKER_04]: within the Department of Justice is likely
going to have some case or some matter
[SPEAKER_04]: that involves a new issue that has been
brought to light by the signing of the
[SPEAKER_04]: initiative.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I mentioned earlier, we do also have a
direct role in that we are the state's
[SPEAKER_04]: criminal history depository.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to the extent that Prop 64 and previous
legislation continues to lay out fitness
[SPEAKER_04]: criteria for licensees with the idea that
they cannot have been convicted of a
[SPEAKER_04]: substantially related crime or serious or
violent felony.
[SPEAKER_04]: Felonies involving fraud and deceit or
employment of a minor in a drug business.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of that background check workload will
be coming to our CJIS Division of the
[SPEAKER_04]: California Justice Information Services
Division.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, I would also point out
that as far as the driving impaired issue,
[SPEAKER_04]: there is obviously going to be a lot of
discussion about what constitutes driving
[SPEAKER_04]: impaired following the ingestion of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking at all the new scientific
ways to be able to do roadside testing and
[SPEAKER_04]: other types of testing by law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something that the various
folks that work in toxicology in our
[SPEAKER_04]: Bureau of Forensic Services is likely
going to have to handle from an IT
[SPEAKER_04]: workload issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, to the extent that law
enforcement training and standards impact
[SPEAKER_04]: us as chief law enforcement officer,
I'm sure we'll be working closely with the
[SPEAKER_04]: various associations and with post and CHP
to make sure that we are adequately
[SPEAKER_04]: preparing folks that are doing local law
enforcement and statewide law enforcement
[SPEAKER_04]: for the new laws that will be a large
change in life for many of them,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then just to book in with this,
if there's any case just generally
[SPEAKER_04]: challenging the constitutionality of
either Proposition 64, any of its
[SPEAKER_04]: provisions, any of the regulations or any
local ordinance that will obviously fall
[SPEAKER_04]: upon the attorney general to defend as the
chief law officer for the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: So while we don't have a direct impact as
a result of Prop 64, you almost get a
[SPEAKER_04]: little annotation next to every provision
in the law.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the attorney general will likely
have to be present to lend some legal
[SPEAKER_04]: guidance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in that serving as kind of a basic and
hopefully brief summary of the provisions
[SPEAKER_04]: of the bill and how we see them from our
role at the AG's office, I'm happy to
[SPEAKER_04]: answer any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Sumner, let me just ask you something
real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know Ms. Waldron also has a
question, but under the proposition,
[SPEAKER_02]: it specifically names the Department of
Consumer Affairs, Department of Public
[SPEAKER_02]: Health, and the California Department of
Food and Drug, to come up with a
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory scheme work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just wondering, how is the Department
of Justice working with those three
[SPEAKER_02]: agencies?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's the regulatory framework that
the Department of Justice is doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that independent?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it collaborative?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to wait and see what the feds
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been invited by the way they
didn't show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But can you give us some sense of that
please?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, we're not directly involved with any
of the regulation that is currently being
[SPEAKER_04]: developed by the other departments,
certainly we have an open conversation and
[SPEAKER_04]: open dialogue with the bureau,
with the departments, with their parent
[SPEAKER_04]: agencies, largely as legal counsel.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have active client liaisons that are
always available to work through various
[SPEAKER_04]: legal issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: But really the proposition sets out that
the stakeholders with the expertise should
[SPEAKER_04]: be developing the specific policies and
regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: For what fits with their own
jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Department of Justice, there's a
portion in there kind of clarifying and
[SPEAKER_04]: accelerating some work that we've been
doing to assess the legality of hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, the background check process
is something that we do already for
[SPEAKER_04]: licensees of all kinds throughout the
state.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll be continuing that workload with
what's in the proposition.
[SPEAKER_04]: But otherwise, we really have been less
and independent implementer of this new
[SPEAKER_04]: initiative and more so legal counsel for
those who are tasked with doing the job.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's obviously, it's a complicated
issue and we're always available to them
[SPEAKER_04]: for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me ask you legally for the state of
California as we continue to move forward
[SPEAKER_02]: and given the federal landscape and the
new administration, what are some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: things we should be concerned with?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, well, I mean, what's important to
keep in mind is that in terms of federal
[SPEAKER_04]: versus state law, not a whole lot has
changed at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we've seen over the past several
years isn't a change in federal law,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the expression of different
enforcement priorities on behalf of the US
[SPEAKER_04]: Department of Justice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't speak in terms of federal statute
or regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We speak in terms of memoranda issued by
the Federal Department of Justice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about the Ogden memorandum,
which was then replaced by the Cole
[SPEAKER_04]: memorandum.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then there was a supplemental Wilkinson
memorandum.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of these are, of course, subject to
the pleasure of the United States Attorney
[SPEAKER_04]: General.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at this time, there's really nothing
but speculation that can be done for how
[SPEAKER_04]: the federal government is going to choose
to view its own enforcement priorities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, we've been hearing a lot about
the issue from California as we look to
[SPEAKER_04]: implement our own state laws that would
seem to conflict with federal law,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's why it's important to state that
it's not that marijuana is illegal,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's that it is lawful under our laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: But while that is a new legal context,
the core issues of federalism and the
[SPEAKER_04]: right of states to enact their own
policies that may or may not be preempted
[SPEAKER_04]: by federal law is something that is kind
of at the core foundation of most
[SPEAKER_04]: government laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've been evaluating that issue across
a whole spectrum of areas of conflict
[SPEAKER_04]: between federal priorities and
California's policies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll be continuing to do that as we
get a little bit more meat to what we're
[SPEAKER_04]: currently thinking we might be seeing out
of the Federal Department of Justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is the California Department of
Justice, are we gearing up to have that
[SPEAKER_02]: argument of state's rights and looking for
litigation, not just in this area,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like you said, there's a host of
areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where this could potentially be an issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, well obviously we have a new
attorney general who knew from his first
[SPEAKER_04]: day in the office that one of his core
functions was going to be assessing when,
[SPEAKER_04]: where, how and how most vigorously to
defend the priorities of the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a constitutional mandate for the
attorney general and it's going to become
[SPEAKER_04]: a question in many court settings that
don't want to get too far out in front of
[SPEAKER_04]: us, but I think certainly it is understood
and the analysis is already happening to
[SPEAKER_04]: constantly look into issues of what
defenses would California have in order to
[SPEAKER_04]: preserve its own policies that its own
citizens have chosen to act on despite any
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of federal conflict.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms. Waldron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: With this implementation, and we can
clearly see it's a balancing act,
[SPEAKER_00]: and with the California Supreme Court
affirming local authority over medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to some extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as was mentioned, the patchwork of
local ordinances, trying to give clear
[SPEAKER_00]: direction to law enforcement, the
employment issues brought up, land use
[SPEAKER_00]: planning, as well as just the state being
consistent statewide as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having served over 14 years in local
government, I'm concerned and I was just
[SPEAKER_00]: wondering, how would your office and the
other stakeholder agencies that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with, how do you look to balance
local control with the statewide concerns?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what would be, how do you look at
defining the statewide concerns that would
[SPEAKER_00]: bring some consistency that is needed
while still preserving some of the local
[SPEAKER_00]: control?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it's a real balancing act.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hm, and obviously the issue of to what
extent should locals be able to govern for
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves, how marijuana should be lawful
in their communities is something that's
[SPEAKER_04]: been present throughout a long history on
this subject.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do believe that both the medical
legislation that was passed and also
[SPEAKER_04]: what's mimicked in Prop 64 does recognize
the importance of local voice on many of
[SPEAKER_04]: these issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say that having worked on this issue
back in 2011, when we were evaluating if
[SPEAKER_04]: any additional guidelines were needed in
lieu of new statutory policies,
[SPEAKER_04]: there was almost nothing speaking to the
subject about what could or cannot be
[SPEAKER_04]: regulated at the local level.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're seeing now, I think,
is a much more memorialized commitment to
[SPEAKER_04]: understanding that there should be a
balance between what standards the state
[SPEAKER_04]: thinks is appropriate to set out through
its expertise, through its departments,
[SPEAKER_04]: and also what is uniquely necessary for a
local community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something that I know that all
of the key regulators have in mind,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that they're working actively with
local stakeholders, and that's something
[SPEAKER_04]: that the Attorney General would certainly
encourage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me ask if there are any more
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Wood has one, and then we'll go to Mr.
Breaux.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super brief.
[SPEAKER_03]: Has there been outreach from our Attorney
General's office to the Federal Attorney
[SPEAKER_03]: General's office to get any sort of idea
of what direction they're going,
[SPEAKER_03]: or is it premature?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's premature, but more so for me to say
that there's really not any kind of direct
[SPEAKER_04]: conversation happening with the federal
government now in terms of there not even
[SPEAKER_04]: really being a confirmed federal attorney
general at this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So certainly state and federal
partnerships are important, but it's all
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be handled in due time by those
that are going to be working on any actual
[SPEAKER_04]: legal forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: But is it safe to say in the past we had
regular conversations with the federal
[SPEAKER_03]: government on this issue?
[SPEAKER_04]: To an extent, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously, the US attorneys that
represent the Federal Department of
[SPEAKER_04]: Justice when they're in California have
always had good relationships,
[SPEAKER_04]: both locally and with the state law
enforcement liaisons that work with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our prosecutors within the state AG's
office frequently engage with the federal
[SPEAKER_04]: level, and I don't expect that to change
substantially with the new federal
[SPEAKER_04]: administration.
[SPEAKER_04]: That said, when you do talk about the
potential for conflict, it becomes a
[SPEAKER_04]: slightly different posture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where obviously the federal level
Department of Justice and the state level
[SPEAKER_04]: Department of Justice are going to be
making sure that they're preserving their
[SPEAKER_04]: own best interests if there is any sort of
court setting for those conversations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Roe, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other conflict between state and
federal government is the banking laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your office involved with the
treasurer's working group or a lot of us,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my view, I think we need to get out of
the physical commodity of cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Needs to be something electronic like
Bitcoin or something, because we can't
[SPEAKER_01]: have businesses delivering hundreds of
thousands of dollars of cash to a BOE
[SPEAKER_01]: office and having a member of the staff
there count it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please elaborate on anything your
department's doing in regards to the
[SPEAKER_01]: banking of marijuana money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, of the many issues that have been
arising, that is definitely one that has
[SPEAKER_04]: been raised from a couple of different
perspectives within the Department of
[SPEAKER_04]: Justice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our business and tax section is client
counsel for the treasurer's office and is
[SPEAKER_04]: working on the work group that you
mentioned, as well as BOE.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they are available and continue to
provide legal guidance as that,
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree, very complicated issue is
currently being sussed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
