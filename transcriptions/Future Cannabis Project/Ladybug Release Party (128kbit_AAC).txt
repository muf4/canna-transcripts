[SPEAKER_02]: They won't eat me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, the ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Won't eat me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I touch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting in my finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not gonna eat your finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what they like to eat?
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to eat aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to eat bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only eat the ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only eat the ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we're gonna let the ladybugs out
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we open them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're gonna open the ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, ready?
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we do it together?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, ready to let the ladybugs out?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here they all come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we'll put some right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh, look at all the ladybugs on my
finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ladybugs eat aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one on your pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not eating my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not eating my fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you open the next one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let me get them off me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so normally we should have let the
ladybugs out at night right before it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: dark out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't touch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's when the bugs that they eat
are most active.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when the bugs they eat are eating
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want the ladybugs to eat the bugs
that eat the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we also have lacewings.
[SPEAKER_00]: in the other container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also going to get some predatory
mites that are going to eat the... No,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let them crawl on your finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get some predatory mites
that are going to eat spider mites and
[SPEAKER_00]: broad mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they like to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ladybugs don't really eat the
spider mites that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, this is how we control the bugs
in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we don't want to spray bad things
on our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ming-bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, do you want to open the other one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, let her go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't touch her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, you're going to stand over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they're on me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's walk over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, come on little buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you come over here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let the ladybugs go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come hold my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, you're going to open this one too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they coming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here they come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you hold the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hold the container?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you have in your hands?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have in your hands?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you have ladybugs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do the ladybugs eat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Baby girl, what do the ladybugs eat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Baby girl, what do the ladybugs eat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaves?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now they eat other bugs,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they ate the leaves, we definitely
would not be letting them go in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'll hold that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the ladybugs eat aphids and other bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, don't pull the leaf off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so we're going to put this... Can
you hold him so I can feed him?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put these guys right in
here, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll come back tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh, look at all those ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at all the ladybugs on my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, ready?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're all over the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we didn't bring today are the...
They're called predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're... A dot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Their name is Neosilis californicus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you say Neosilis californicus?
[SPEAKER_02]: Californicus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say Neosilis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you say this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Neosilis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neosilis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Californicus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to let those go in here
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not shy anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're definitely not shy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The ladybugs are not shy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have some in my shirt, so I'm going
to take my shirt off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh, let's see where they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, there's one on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, can you grab the one... Is there one
on my back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Baby girl, is there a ladybug on my back?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll take it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all over me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got all the ladybugs off Baba's back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, I feel another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any more on my back?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you sure?
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like they're on my back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let me see if there are any in my
shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pulled your pants up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pulled my pants up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let all the ladybugs go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you say good job?
Good job.
