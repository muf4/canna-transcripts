[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't in this game two years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been, I'm an underground grower,
you know, and have been in the,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the traditional market for over 45
years and coming out and meeting like guys
[SPEAKER_02]: like Colin and Cam over the last couple of
years has really helped me understand
[SPEAKER_02]: where the market's morphed into.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I really appreciate, appreciate
about what you're doing is, and what I
[SPEAKER_02]: believe is critical at this point is we
need to be preaching out and teaching out,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, correct information.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much bad information out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I'm seeing people,
people hurting themselves on oils that
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't understand that that's an
internal and you're not supposed to smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: the damn thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and like my practice,
I'm holistic, wild craft, organic,
[SPEAKER_02]: my working with Cam, he's where I am as
far as our methodology with plants go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just so you understand, I've been
smoking this plant since 1970.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, this has been my lifeline
because I never really was into alcohol
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've done all the other drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the seventies, I'm a seventies era bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a old airborne combat engineer,
uh, and a green brave, anyway,
[SPEAKER_02]: different world, different life,
but stepping out of that time period is
[SPEAKER_02]: what helped me, uh, embrace a plant and,
and learn to grow the plant was the fact
[SPEAKER_02]: that I could grow a grow my own mess and
be new exactly where it came from,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, knew that it was that I'm the
guy, you know, what's going on at that
[SPEAKER_02]: whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a lot of, where I am with it
right now is trying to teach people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to teach people how to grow their
own plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they can't grow their own plant,
have access to stuff like what I do and
[SPEAKER_02]: what cam does and what column is a
proponent for, and what you are performing
[SPEAKER_02]: it for is high quality, fresh medicine
that comes from a reputable source that we
[SPEAKER_02]: know is clean and that, you know,
the end result is, is I get, I get that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's an intoxicant, but we use this as a
medicinal purpose to keep ourselves
[SPEAKER_02]: balanced and regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the things I put in that text
I put the other day, cause it's part of my
[SPEAKER_02]: journey is this has kept me, you know,
I'm a, I'm a trained killer sister and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's taken me 50 years to get out of that
mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I approached the plant keeps me,
I was never afraid of ever killing myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: My biggest fear was always that I would do
something in a short moment of losing my
[SPEAKER_02]: grasp on things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hurt somebody or worse kill somebody
and then spend my whole damn life in a six
[SPEAKER_02]: by nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's always been my biggest,
biggest, biggest concern of why I've
[SPEAKER_02]: isolated myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I'm in rural Northern Humboldt
County.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not down in LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, I'm not even, I'm four hours north
of Santa Rosa where you last like four
[SPEAKER_05]: hours tops in these cities.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_05]: He can last like four hours tops.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't blame you one bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why I love Colin so much is I
understand his choice of being out in
[SPEAKER_02]: nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's how I healed myself was
having my hands in the dirt, my feet,
[SPEAKER_02]: barefoot on the ground and working mother
gonja with my hands and learning to love
[SPEAKER_02]: her and appreciate her for what she really
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, and why I dress it with people,
this is a sacred, sacred plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not, this is not some kind of it's
been demonized for only about 80 frippin
[SPEAKER_02]: years is the part that pisses me off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm generationally a seven, you know,
I was a young man in the seventies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I saw this plant being demonized in
nine, you know, the people don't get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the law only goes back to last
fricking schedule one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 1970.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's only 50 frippin years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not like that was long ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you talk about a plant that's been
used on this planet for a conservatively
[SPEAKER_02]: six to 7,000 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm seeing all kinds of crazy
documentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I read an article the other day where
they were going back into biblical times
[SPEAKER_02]: and finding the plant on altars that goes
back before Christ was born.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so there's, there's all these
things that in me personally, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: get way off on a tangent here,
but I believe the anointed one was
[SPEAKER_02]: anointed with holy cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I look at myself as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I'm glad you brought that up
because one of the things that I do preach
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time is the fact that this plant
was here way before any one of us that is
[SPEAKER_01]: alive today and will continue to be even
after we're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing that we can do about that,
but actually embrace it in our humanity
[SPEAKER_01]: and be able to make this world a better
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only as in the person as medicine that
you use, but also as an eco-friendly crop
[SPEAKER_01]: that can potentially save our environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And give us all a better quality of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about consumption is about the
potential and how it can actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: in essence, I know it may sound out there,
but save the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many industries that right now,
if they use the fiber for the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it would take it to a next level and
at the same time help the rest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, this is, we should not take
this lightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's usually how I preach it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think it's kind of,
and I guess part of what I've realized is
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have been about, you know,
I got out of the traditional market after
[SPEAKER_02]: my military time and I just, I focused on
just underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was literally pre 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't find me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in a four by five little box in
Willets, California, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and if anybody's ever been to Willets,
before that is a weed community that
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing else really pushes that little
town anymore, other than the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of, again, that whole,
that whole community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I am a long bell boy,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I am a, I was raised in Yokai.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a NorCal through and through,
you know, I've left and traveled the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've come back to this area and retired
here and been in this craft for decades
[SPEAKER_02]: and decades now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like watching where it's morphed
from back when I first got into it,
[SPEAKER_02]: to where it's transitioned about 10 or 15
years ago, when I, you know, I love these
[SPEAKER_02]: youngsters ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in it since it was legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you haven't done shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you got into a game after we
forged with our blood, sweat, and tears,
[SPEAKER_02]: jail time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, I've been thrown in the,
been locked up for, you know, they took
[SPEAKER_02]: five years of my life back in the mid
eighties guys, you know, over this plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: three quarters of an ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the crazy part of this in 33
states.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the ticketable or misdemeanor
offense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they threw me in fricking prison over
it, you know, and it's like, I look at it
[SPEAKER_02]: now where how it shifted so much is like,
there's so, me, it's the love of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, what it does, how it helps us all,
regardless of how you use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't, you don't have to use, do it the
way I do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it the way that it works for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have friends that I've worked with from
childhood epilepsy to a buddy I'm helping
[SPEAKER_02]: with Crohn's disease right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I assure you, my partner with Crohn's
is not using the plant to get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's juicing the fricking green leaves,
making smoothies out of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's drinking it internally because of all
the, the high medicinal value that the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole plant has.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's again, that's where this thing,
what I realized a couple of years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause I wish Dr. Sue was here and maybe we
can get Ethan in on one of these
[SPEAKER_02]: conversations in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is a point where that we've taken
old hippie, you know, a bunch of old
[SPEAKER_02]: slacker hippies come hang out with me for
a summer and do 3000 hours in the hot sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm in my mid sixties now,
you know, it's like, this is, this is not
[SPEAKER_02]: a lazy man's game.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the ones that are true,
true craft, professional cannabis growers
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Emil triangle, what Cam preaches,
what I preach, what we do as a craft,
[SPEAKER_02]: it comes out in our flower quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I tell, I mean,
again, I'm going to shut up and let Colin
[SPEAKER_02]: could speak firsthand, brother,
you, you know, you've smoked my flowers
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we also need to get rid of this
differentiation between recreational and
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all therapeutic and it's been used
for all of human history as a food and
[SPEAKER_04]: fiber and fuel and a medicine and,
and a way to become spiritual in our own
[SPEAKER_04]: way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's only been, like you said,
the last 80 years that we've been without
[SPEAKER_04]: this an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not saying causation correlation,
but we have had forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: That it's only in the last several decades
that we're starting to see these
[SPEAKER_04]: autoimmune diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're starting to see allergies.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're starting to see these things where
our bodies attack themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't really have a written record
of something like that previously,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we've also had a cannabinoids in our
diet for all of human history.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can hear my dad saying, well,
I never touched it.
[SPEAKER_04]: My grandfather never touched it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, no, but your livestock ate
feral hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your livestock's eating feral hemp and
your chickens are eating the seeds and
[SPEAKER_04]: your goats are eating it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're getting cannabinoids through
your milk, through your dairy,
[SPEAKER_04]: through your meat from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And acidic cannabinoids in the raw form
are very effective at much smaller doses
[SPEAKER_04]: to find that homeostasis in our body.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think we're having to relearn
what we've forgotten throughout all of
[SPEAKER_04]: human history.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you were talking about, you know,
finding biblical evidence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then what was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Exodus 30, 23.
[SPEAKER_04]: It talks about the holy anointing oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there was a mistranslation in the
early text of the Bible in a Septuagint
[SPEAKER_04]: where they changed calamus to cannibosin
or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there is references all throughout the
Bible.
[SPEAKER_04]: By how much cannabis, how many shekels it
costs to put it in the holy anointing oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you're seeing, you know,
ancient things about Jesus bringing sight
[SPEAKER_04]: to the blind or he's healing leprosy or
he's casting out demons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you have ocular pressure,
you're going to be blind with glaucoma.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're anointed with cannabis oil,
reducing the ocular pressure, you get
[SPEAKER_04]: sight to the blind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Leprosy, which covered all kinds of skin
conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you put a topical ointment of
acidic cannabinoids, even decarboxylated
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids on any kind of dermatitis or
some sort of skin condition, it heals
[SPEAKER_04]: fairly quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So healing leprosy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Children or people with epilepsy having
seizures could absolutely look like being
[SPEAKER_04]: possessed by a demon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give them raw acidic cannabinoid,
whole plant, wonderful goodness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll see a reduction in seizures or
casting out demons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm not saying that's exactly what it
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, you got to look at all the
evidence and where we've come from and all
[SPEAKER_04]: the altars where they were burning seeds,
they were burning this as part of a
[SPEAKER_04]: spirituality.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've only had 80 years of
misinformation, disinformation,
[SPEAKER_04]: propaganda and bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've got 80 years in 80 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in only 80 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what people don't get.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like this is only since the late the
early 1930s that this has all changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: This hasn't even been in 100 year time
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The get it part is it's all about greed
and it's all about corruption and control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we've realized now, what Cam hit
it totally on the head and Joanne and
[SPEAKER_02]: Colin, I know you guys know this too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about a plant that is food,
medicine, fiber, fuel, rubber,
[SPEAKER_02]: concrete, all these things, all these
industries that it spills into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's why they it's greed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to keep it demonized so that
people stay away from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm glad to see that we got
industrial hemp out of that loop and put
[SPEAKER_02]: back into a textile that it could be used
as.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, breeders that want to breed
that thread and go into CBD specific
[SPEAKER_02]: strains for research and development and
for medical applications to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm totally glad to see that
that happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens and keeps going that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for me and for Cam and you guys
too, because you guys use the plant and I
[SPEAKER_02]: know what Colin, you know what his thread
is and how what he preaches and follows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe in Colin's mission so much
it's beyond words.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I believe in Colin's mission so
much that I drove down 750 miles one way
[SPEAKER_02]: two years ago and brought my flowers down
for his birthday just to go hang out with
[SPEAKER_02]: him.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what my connection to him is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And him, like a lot of people don't know,
he literally knows where I live.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just when I told him where I
live, he's got all my that's where I want
[SPEAKER_02]: to retire to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's kind of how we are drawn
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know Colin's backstory and he knows
mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we shared a similar path of how
we went through the military.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's just I don't know
yours, but I have two daughters that are
[SPEAKER_02]: fricking veterans, you know, and I already
know what women endure going through the
military.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I applaud you so much for what you
endured to get to where you are and to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to use your platform now as a
military veteran to help bring in other
[SPEAKER_02]: female veterans into this mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just it just as a whole to,
you know, to get it beyond.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't a we thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't a me thing or I think this is a
we thing where we can touch a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kills me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I because, you know,
just briefly, you know, I got I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: blown up twice, fragged once, you know,
I've jumped out of airplanes, I got bad
[SPEAKER_02]: shoulders, bad knees.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, long story short, the the the
regime was 750 milligram Vicodins on a 90
[SPEAKER_02]: count on with an unlimited supply and go
home and lay on the frippin floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the recourse of Western medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wasn't going to buy that,
you know, and I don't take synthetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I drink coffee, I smoke my fine
herb that I produce myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take occasionally if my joints are
really, really killing me, I might take a
[SPEAKER_02]: little leave or something for just to sit
till I get to sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, I really don't take a
whole lot of plethora of things that they
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_02]: The VA has issued, you know, I'm 100
percent pink card carrying member and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: not retired.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm 100 percent disabled.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not you know, I didn't make 20 years
of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did my first tour and they damn near
killed me in my first two or three times,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and that that was it for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like I got out and it's
like and have been where you guys are now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not not acknowledgement within the
VA system getting off point here a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit, but it still rounds back to this
because I beat young men and women that
[SPEAKER_02]: are you guys age range now where they're
getting the same kind of treatment I was
[SPEAKER_02]: getting back in the nine eighties and
nineties when all I really wanted I blew
[SPEAKER_02]: shit up for a living.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I wanted was hearing aids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's all I ever asked for was
hearing aids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they own me 100 percent because
they wouldn't give me hearing aids 30
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's just how but I hear the same
stories from young men and women like the
[SPEAKER_02]: ones that are getting out today that they
don't know they're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all damaged and I tell anybody over
about the age of 18.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get out on your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody has PTS everybody, you know,
even if you live silver spoon in your life
[SPEAKER_02]: and you were coddled till your 21st
birthday as soon as you walked out the
[SPEAKER_02]: door somebody punched you in your teeth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just the fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just the fact of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just just how it is, you know,
then so when I got yeah, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Joanne, can you please cut in on any of
it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I so what I wanted to say with
respect to my mission and what I'm doing
[SPEAKER_01]: is just I want this information that we're
having these discussions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the people to be able to hear this
information because you know, you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: have been doing this for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people before you that have been
doing it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is nothing new.
[SPEAKER_01]: This information has been here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we said, you mentioned biblical times
potentially back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was utilized to help people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as me, yes, as a military
service member, I had my issues almost
[SPEAKER_01]: lost my life as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis saved me after I got out
where I was lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: With PTSD anxiety from an accident that I
suffered a concussion, lost the English
[SPEAKER_01]: language for almost 20 minutes,
then get out and was in a dark cloud in my
[SPEAKER_01]: head that I didn't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortunately and randomly met somebody who
introduced me to cannabis for medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes, which honestly, it was meant to
be because I'm pretty sure based on my
[SPEAKER_01]: background, you know, growing up
Christianity, you know, and being drilled
[SPEAKER_01]: that cannabis is a drug and XYZ you
already know the narrative there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was introduced as something like
we're doing it for fun, likely I may have
[SPEAKER_01]: not gone that route, but I met a grower
like you guys who takes this very
[SPEAKER_01]: seriously that understand that whether you
do this, you know, when you sit on the
[SPEAKER_01]: couch just or because you are looking to
cure your cancer, get through chemo or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, it's medicinal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at the end of the day,
we're doing it to feel better,
[SPEAKER_01]: to get to a better mental state or
physical or emotional for that matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that introduction, I felt so much
better like almost immediately mentally
[SPEAKER_01]: after three years of being in that cloud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I decided that I would make this my
mission, you know, to battle the
[SPEAKER_01]: misinformation because then I started
doing my own research and one thing led to
[SPEAKER_01]: the next.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, the whole,
if we're talking and touching back on what
[SPEAKER_01]: Doc was saying here, greed and just
business, you know, people wanting to
[SPEAKER_01]: destroy other industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously cannabis is something that
people can grow at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have land, you can grow cannabis
and help a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like people back in the day,
you know, we have the paper industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have the plastics industry,
we have all these other industries that
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to make money and this crop is
cheaper and to grow and it grows faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a greed, you know,
in capitalism that created that narrative
[SPEAKER_01]: that cannabis was bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you know, we cannot deny there
was some racist undertone as well in
[SPEAKER_01]: denying all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's about, we're in the era of
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think with all the technology that we
have right now and all the true anecdotes
[SPEAKER_01]: of real people like yourselves,
like myself, that we can say, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: I am alive and this happened to me and I
have all this evidence and I am not the
[SPEAKER_01]: only one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like what we're doing with
veterans walk and talk with cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: synergy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously you guys, and I think the fact
that we can come together to have these
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations and then share it with our
respective communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like because we're not lying,
you know, this is actually the fact,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's gonna spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very hopeful for the near future
that we can continue to have this
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations, get more people involved,
you know, in all the areas, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: science, whether it is entertainment,
education, business, cannabis pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: touches on everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have so much opportunity and I'm
glad that we're seizing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for having me here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doc, can you give your like returning from
war and kind of setting up, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: in Humboldt and, you know, growing
medicine.
If that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, if that's what you want,
Peter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to hear your story and your focus
on creating medicine for yourself and by
[SPEAKER_03]: extension medicine that then helped other
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as breeding, like, you know,
what have you noticed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh, I created this plan and it
really helped me with X and I noticed that
[SPEAKER_03]: it had these terpenes or whatever like get
into that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you talking about like right now or
what?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, like in the beginning and then
kind of your journey of like discovering
[SPEAKER_03]: that if I breathe in this direction,
like it helps me more with PTSD or pain or
[SPEAKER_03]: sleep or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you came back from what it was
Vietnam, I assume, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm the end of Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the very tail end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm considered a Cold War Green Beret,
what they call a Cold War commando.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an unknown variable and have have been
up until about 2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was an unknown variable in the military
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most military, quite honestly,
ninety nine point nine percent doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: even know what we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's such that behind the frickin
scenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So long story short, I get extractions and
then from extractions, I moved over to
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe where I was doing working in
northern Africa, working in all across
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe, fighting what we consider the Red
Menace, the communist block, that whole
[SPEAKER_02]: part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did two different times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I returned from that,
I basically got kicked out in Fort Dix,
[SPEAKER_02]: New Jersey as a twenty two year old,
not quite twenty three year old,
[SPEAKER_02]: completely messed up young man that didn't
have a clue because everything that I
[SPEAKER_02]: believe to be true and fighting for truth,
justice in the American way, when I got
[SPEAKER_02]: overseas, realized that it was a bunch of
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: After a few years of time, it was really
hard for me to get beyond.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was real angry when I came back,
you know, and why I isolated myself so
[SPEAKER_02]: much because I was so it was bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I knew it was bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It crushed me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really crushed me on a spiritual level
and an emotional level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to lose brothers and arms in the
behind the scenes is in a thing in seventy
[SPEAKER_02]: nine called Eagle Claw.
[SPEAKER_02]: Desert One was the attempt to remove the
Iranian hostage cry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Iranian hostages are people out of that
building.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were the group that women in the very
first joint task force ever for the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States military, the very, very first one,
JTF.
[SPEAKER_02]: One seventy nine, you know, it was what
spun the one sixtieth sore off of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seventy fifth Rangers Marine recon,
all kinds of crazy shit, stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: happens within the Navy now that was more
from that original mission where nobody
[SPEAKER_02]: even knew about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we crashed in the desert and
lost a half a dozen brothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I personally was on a team that was on
the ground and we had packed in stealth
[SPEAKER_02]: leave from fricking Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like to get where we were
to be outside of Tehran and then shit blow
[SPEAKER_02]: up and be told that we were on our own and
nobody knew we were there and basically
[SPEAKER_02]: get your own fucking ass out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's it's a tough thing to swallow,
you know, to be to be left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were left in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breathe, breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have any weed on hand, Doc?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always got weed on hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always had weed, you know,
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're with our 60s now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're all in our mid 60s now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just realized that I have a brother
that's down in Santa Cruz that he put he
[SPEAKER_02]: was the one side of the team that the six
of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was seven of us, you know,
there was only seven of us on the ground
[SPEAKER_02]: and we basically were just denied by our
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a survivor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys are dealing with it,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you guys, there's nothing's
changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys come back and you're denied like
we were denied in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like I got out in 82,
you know, after after a stupid six years
[SPEAKER_02]: and got out in 82.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all I really and I went 88 just to get
my ears because I couldn't hear anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and like deny, deny,
denied.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see that happen again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I and what Peter basically asked me is
what happened is like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, fuck this and unplugged and moved
off into the middle of nowhere by myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, and I was getting getting flour from
people, you know, getting flour from
[SPEAKER_02]: people that was OK, but it was seedy weed,
you know, and I was just started.
[SPEAKER_02]: There weren't any books back then,
you know, we were just starting to figure
[SPEAKER_02]: out things, you know, and separating males
from females and all, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm self taught, you know, but now my now
I have a breeding canvas breeding company
[SPEAKER_02]: that represents my flower line,
you know, and my and my lawyers tell me
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm one of a handful of guys that do what
I do in the world, you know, and I have
[SPEAKER_02]: been you know, hunting specifically for
over 35 years now, excuse me, chemo bar
[SPEAKER_02]: specific hunting for over 35 years on you
know, specific types of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it goes back to when what Peter said
how, you know, I smoked the first joint in
[SPEAKER_02]: 70 and started growing my first plant in
about 72, you know, and it was trial and
[SPEAKER_02]: error.
[SPEAKER_02]: And back then it was, you know,
Acapulco gold and Colombian red and and
[SPEAKER_02]: Thailand silver tie coming over from
overseas and things like that is that what
[SPEAKER_02]: and Mexican brown weed coming from down
south, you know, so there was this influx
[SPEAKER_02]: and then where I'm at specifically just
happens to be the heart of the Emerald
[SPEAKER_02]: Triangle, you know, where I where I grew
up and where I found my sanity and what I
[SPEAKER_02]: consider my home and my sanctuary,
you know, and it's like that moment in
[SPEAKER_02]: time when I was it actually was in right
after I got out of prison and I was the
[SPEAKER_02]: only one that was able to take care of my
mother who was going through breast cancer
[SPEAKER_02]: and I became her primary caregiver for
about 16 months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was me taking her back to
chemotherapy every day and dealing with
[SPEAKER_02]: her double mastectomy, taking my mother
that I love dearly and taking her in and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, getting this walk coming back at
the end after chemo and having to deal
[SPEAKER_02]: with her being sick and anyway,
this old man back then was a young man,
[SPEAKER_02]: I decided to take old school hippie
therapy and you know, we worked where she
[SPEAKER_02]: ate about a quarter of a brownie,
you know, and it helped me get her through
[SPEAKER_02]: her being sick party and keeping her
appetite up and you know, quarter of a
[SPEAKER_02]: brownie when she went in and a quarter
when she came out about a half a brownie
[SPEAKER_02]: anyway, this was just how I started
getting into the medical application of
[SPEAKER_02]: this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for me for my own damage was I
didn't even really know what it was to
[SPEAKER_02]: answer Peter's question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even know what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite honestly guys, it was, I just knew
that and you guys get it,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That decompression that you get from when
you that you don't get from alcohol and
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't get from pills and you don't get
from other synthetics and you don't get
[SPEAKER_02]: from speed or heroin or freaking coke or
it only comes through this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's decompression is what I call it now
is you and I've seen this and I've seen
[SPEAKER_02]: this with other men and women in the
military.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like go go be with them and literally
a buddy of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like take a hit off a joint and
literally in a combat bet 30s,
[SPEAKER_02]: good guy, a lot of tough situations in his
military career turn into alcohol and
[SPEAKER_02]: painkillers and was hating and hating his
life, hating his world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally a guy my age, a buddy of his,
his big brother said, dude, you need to
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, long story short, now he's using the
plant using the sacred plant for his daily
[SPEAKER_02]: working on it every day to get better and
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said him to me smoking one of
my joints, walking on Collins deal homeboy
[SPEAKER_02]: started crying, you know, laughing and
crying.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, you know, I haven't cried and
laughed in over three fricking years,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was to me, one more verification
that this is medicine, that this is a
[SPEAKER_02]: holistic tool that we can use a natural
and we're like calling.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I love about natural plant medicine,
you know, pick it yourself, grow it
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself, raise it yourself, you know,
make it, do it yourself and you know where
[SPEAKER_02]: it comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I get not everybody can do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joanne, what you said, sister,
I a hundred percent agree with,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can teach people how to grow in a coffee
can if they really want to know and get
[SPEAKER_02]: them an ounce of fine, fine flour off of a
coffee can, you know, I just have a little
[SPEAKER_02]: two by four sun area in my back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's bonsai.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I breathe specifically now is I
breathe short structured plants designed
[SPEAKER_02]: for mom and pops to be cultivated in two
to three gallon pots and yielding three to
[SPEAKER_02]: eight ounces, depending on what your skill
level is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for a mom and pop to have, you know,
like we're here, anyone over 21,
[SPEAKER_02]: six plants, you know, mom and pop with
skills, 12 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of fricking flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know what the hell you're doing,
or you don't even have to know what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just be willing to learn how to do it,
you know, and hit what I teach now and
[SPEAKER_02]: have for years is how to grow your own,
you know, me with what cam and I are
[SPEAKER_02]: working on specifically is to get my
flowers out and, and he does such a
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I just, I'm so honored to even
have an opportunity that he and I are
[SPEAKER_02]: getting a partner together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, it's like, if I will get,
well, I have, I have picked a business
[SPEAKER_02]: partner is cam hat and I'm thankful.
[SPEAKER_02]: For it, you know, and that's how I look at
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, if I was going to
pick somebody, it'd be cam him and his
[SPEAKER_02]: wife, you know, what they do for their
business model is so clean and so pure and
[SPEAKER_02]: from a point of love.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, you know, just,
you know, we're, we really try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, and we're not out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's part of people that don't
know who high tide distro is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't know who I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just sent flowers to a, we lost a
brother down south.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just sent flowers to their group.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they would have something to use for
their, for their healing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like he and I, this thing
we're doing, we're, we've making
[SPEAKER_02]: agreements and he's aligning with other
veterans nonprofits where we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be giving flower away every damn month,
you know, and we're not talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: giving away quarterbacks, honey.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be giving away pounds of
fricking flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we're going to try and grow
thousands and thousands of pounds of
[SPEAKER_02]: flower next year to put into this threat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're working on right now,
you know, and, and, and I love him so much
[SPEAKER_02]: and I have such tremendous love for Colin
and sister.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so thankful for you to be in on this
thing today with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm so, I'm so honored that
you're a part of our conversation and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm getting off point here,
but my cultivating flowers specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: was about 16, 17 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, three.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, this is before a lot of people
that like you before you were in this
[SPEAKER_02]: craft 17 years ago, most likely,
you know, it's like in 2000, 2001,
[SPEAKER_02]: September the 11th happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody shut down and internalized the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a luxury based item.
[SPEAKER_02]: The market crash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I watched flower, my flower go
from five to $6,000 a pound of copy to
[SPEAKER_02]: under $3,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was still the three to three,
three to 3,200 hours a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wants to take to make the damn thing
get done full sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is before light depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is before greenhouses is
full sun outdoor just the way mother
[SPEAKER_02]: nature and God almighty intended it to be,
you know, 20 footers, 16 foot wide,
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 feet tall, that kind of crazy stuff.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I anyway, my old lamp hard and
I between oh three and oh five,
[SPEAKER_02]: the market tumbled, tumbled bad from
33,000 or so where I believe is unfair
[SPEAKER_02]: marketable price where a farmer can make a
living.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is about $3,000 a pound wholesale.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sort of a reasonable rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of money left at a $3,000
price point.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of money left for a retailer and
make a killing when they're charging
[SPEAKER_02]: brothers and sisters, 25, 30, 35,
40, $50 a gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know my flowers on the East coast on
both ends of it and they get 35 to $50 a
[SPEAKER_02]: gram for my flipping flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting way off another tangent.
[SPEAKER_02]: My point is this portion of breeding
specifically you guys is this is what I've
[SPEAKER_02]: been working on for me specifically for
two decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: In oh three, oh three to oh six I got was
getting out of the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we grew so much weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me three years to get rid of it
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I just couldn't do it
anymore because it was the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was working 12 months out of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my old school and people don't even
know that, you know, my old plant was from
[SPEAKER_02]: a buddy of mine called old Dave.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Old Dave who has been gone for over 10
years is the original creator of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Rousselberry Kush.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dave has been gone for a decade and
that one of my mentors were long story
[SPEAKER_02]: short, my skunk OG plant that would just
lay your ass out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It puts you on a couch in about 20
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend, a very dear friend of mine
that's a blue dream, the creator of blue
[SPEAKER_02]: dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: She gifted me a plant of female and I took
as something to do because I was wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: growing and she said you need something to
do here smoke this blue dreams of
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful cerebral smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good for clearing your head
finding your balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't put you on the couch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know all the CBD THC, but I do
know what the effects are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So her plant with my old day plant,
which I call my OG skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was called Mendo skunk can probably
gets it because he's old enough to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's what the Mendocino peace
plant was all about, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Mendo skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of my legacies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I I'm a creator of team of
creators on a lot of strains that are
[SPEAKER_02]: unknown.
[SPEAKER_02]: The unknown breeders, you know,
the green mountain growers group before
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys, even before cam was born,
you know, it's like these as my 40 year
[SPEAKER_02]: old son says to me, you mean before me
dad?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, yes, I'm before you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that being said, that plant,
that combination and 1314 years of
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding is what's releasing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now is my, what I call my blue skunk
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is a very much created for
post-traumatic stress for with physical
[SPEAKER_02]: damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something you can smoke that
clears your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can smoke it or vape it clears your
head clears your consciousness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in about 20 minutes later,
all of a sudden you go, Oh, my shoulder
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't hurt anymore, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my back isn't aching anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this is just me.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's happened in the last two years is
me taking that plant and getting it out to
[SPEAKER_02]: people across our state and across the
country and getting the same results back
[SPEAKER_02]: from veteran brothers and sisters going,
I'm getting the same results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now in the last, since the end of last
year, since the Emerald Cup, now breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: best is my breeding company.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're helping me with patenting and
branding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and that puts me in the same rooms
with Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_02]: The neurologist cannabis guy in that
fricking country.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it puts me in the same room with
Sue Sisley, the woman that's leading the
[SPEAKER_02]: fight for post-traumatic stress therapy,
cannabis therapy for veterans.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's the one suing the VA on our behalf
right now, you know, and them to me,
[SPEAKER_02]: they want to be where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I got in step in over in the
earlier part of the year was Sue coming
[SPEAKER_02]: and searching me out with Dale so they
could sit down with me, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause they know that they're hearing about
what my flowers are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I'm trying to get from
this obscurity that I'm in this unknown
[SPEAKER_02]: variable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in not, and I don't even care about
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not about money or me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about helping men and women,
helping brothers and sisters in the arms,
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically military veterans,
first responders, anybody in crisis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what my thread is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not, again, I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you can, but that's not my thread.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've my agreement with my breeding company
is I can stay conservatively stay 70% or
[SPEAKER_02]: more in the medical field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only 20 to 30% of my flowers were ever hit
the recreational market and very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very on a limited scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to keep it in that thread.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want it to go that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, personally, for me, it's about
the quality of the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about that initial intake.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like something again,
where Cam and I are very, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we age weed for so long, people can't even
get how long we cure our flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they don't even understand it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pulling out stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly what you can sister, but again,
you understand it, you know, and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what I welcome and hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see you teaching this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Colin teaches us out about how to
look at plants and you know, how do we,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, how do we bridge that gap?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, how do we get it out?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're well, I'm hoping this is a first
step now that you know, you and I are in
[SPEAKER_02]: the same realm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like we have, you have access to a
grow in Humboldt County now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to go over there because I
feel like this is all in alignment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we're all in alignment in our
mission and obviously coming together
[SPEAKER_01]: would just give it more power and reach
more people that we're trying to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is like a personal agenda
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like I said earlier, we can't take
this lightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if we have this information that can
help so many people, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you guys are putting into work
intentionally, you know, to solve all of
[SPEAKER_01]: our problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even if we just talk to veterans,
like we are doing such a service to our
[SPEAKER_01]: community, to our people that we know what
it is in so many levels, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have, you didn't for a person,
like in the military, I know people that
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't get blown up, didn't get blown by
air aircraft, jet blast, like I did for
[SPEAKER_01]: instance, but they went through other
stuff that is trauma, like it's trauma,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and I would, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you said, I believe it's
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even if you were a desk jockey
somewhere, man, or, you know, or you were
[SPEAKER_02]: just looking at the screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always saying this because I have
female, you know, I have daughters that
[SPEAKER_02]: are veterans, you know, I just know what
kind of harassment there was, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just understand that kind of nonsense,
you know, and that's the part,
[SPEAKER_02]: again, my girls knew how to whip your ass
about the time they were about 16,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's like, you want to smart off
to me, man, I'll pop you right in your
[SPEAKER_02]: jaws.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how it's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get it out there, you know,
we need to get this out there as a
[SPEAKER_02]: community, you know, you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know cam's doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colin's doing it every damn week,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see what, what walk and talk does all
across the country, the tremendous things
[SPEAKER_02]: that he's doing, just reaching brothers
and sisters in crisis and literally in the
[SPEAKER_02]: trenches.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the part that I love about what
Colin does so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It isn't talking the talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is literally out there seriously
walking in the walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm walking right behind him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's definitely leading a lot of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so just quickly, doc, I think you,
you touched on a couple of things that I
[SPEAKER_03]: think are critical.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, one, you were kind of like
learning on the fly about something you
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't even know about, like, you know,
I mean, I think you, you had an intuitive
[SPEAKER_03]: sense that this was a medicine,
but then you started, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding with intent in certain directions
towards, you know, easing your physical
[SPEAKER_03]: pain, your mental pain, you know,
different chemo types that maybe you
[SPEAKER_03]: started to realize, oh my God,
like this super knock you out on the couch
[SPEAKER_03]: is great for X, but it's horrible for Y.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to breed something else
that's great for Y, but maybe not good for
[SPEAKER_03]: X.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what I'm doing now, Peter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I mean, it's my focus now,
you know, I have more science behind it
[SPEAKER_02]: now and I can actually, you know,
I can go in and look at the structural
[SPEAKER_02]: makeup of it and go, okay, I'm looking for
CBG or CB, CBDV now, which is really what
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm flipping looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's where this has got me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but, but, but back in the day,
you didn't have that vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBG, CBG, CBG.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's kind of, it's interesting once
you start to gain that vocabulary and meet
[SPEAKER_03]: people like Ethan Russo or Sue Sisley.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I feel like now we're fast
forwarded in a moment where you're armed
[SPEAKER_03]: with kind of a team of scientists behind
you who can articulate what you're,
[SPEAKER_03]: all of you are seeing anecdotally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the big thing here is,
you know, pharmaceutical medicine is kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of top down.
[SPEAKER_03]: A company spends a billion dollars to get
something approved for a specific disease
[SPEAKER_03]: or condition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas cannabis is kind of bottom up
where you have, you know, thousands or
[SPEAKER_03]: tens of thousands of caregivers noticing
things with themselves and their friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And initially not having a way to verbally
articulate it, but I think now kind of the
[SPEAKER_03]: vocabulary is coming and, and,
and can you and Cam, can you just quickly
[SPEAKER_03]: touch on what happens when you cure flour
for a longer period of time in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: medicinal effects?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, again, this goes back to what
Peter just was talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: This goes back to what, and something that
I practice and I know Cam practices and
[SPEAKER_02]: most of us here in the triangle practice
is craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I realized a couple of years ago,
and this is what we need to do as a
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing we need to embrace
sister and something that you can do and
[SPEAKER_02]: Colin could do is we can teach out that
white, white dabs are not necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: anything other than immature flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the, the rich full spectrum plants
are amber in color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those that gold Brown's rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I realized was, and I was talking
to a mutual friend of Collins in mind,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause I asked him what the hell man,
you know, where do I need to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm going to go into that market with
my flowers and he wants full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's literally told me this word for
word and, and, uh, Colin, it was blaze
[SPEAKER_02]: brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was talking to blaze on the phone and he
told me this and he said that growers are
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting anywhere from two, three,
and even four weeks early to keep the
[SPEAKER_02]: pistols white and the trichomes white and
creamy so that when they crush it and
[SPEAKER_02]: smash it and turn it into whatever the
hell they're turning it into, it stays
[SPEAKER_02]: white and creamy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hence the visual impression is,
Oh my God, it's so white and clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It must be the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the farthest thing from the
truth of the matter really is because when
[SPEAKER_02]: you get into like RSOs and FSOs and full
spectrum concentrates, they're gold and
[SPEAKER_02]: rich and full and amber colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what Peter was alluding to,
I believe is what he was alluding to is
[SPEAKER_02]: when, when I'm in the field watching that
I'm literally, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking 48 years of experience when I'm
looking at my flowers in the field per se,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I have a lighted microscope and a
jeweler's loop in my fricking pocket,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I only leave so much to sheer
instinct.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm go back and even when I'm sure it's
right, I still go back in and oscilloscope
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've popped my little lighted microscope
in there and look at the trichome heads
[SPEAKER_02]: and see, you know, am I 60?
[SPEAKER_02]: And me, okay, my rule of thumb,
60 to 65%, 70% clear, 20 or so milky,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10% red and burn off.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's me as optimum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cam?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about identical to what we do as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so that, what Peter was talking
about full spectrum, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: how do we know when it's optimum?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we go on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the concentrate people that I've
talked to and I've talked to a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: guys are really good at their craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they have huge followings
online.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they produce lots and lots of
material and they're really good at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what they're telling me is that
clear stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the commercial stuff is being
harvested way, way early.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what we can do as a community and
sister, your platform and calling your
[SPEAKER_02]: platform brothers teach out that what full
spectrum really looks like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is full spectrum, full term.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look how golden amber it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look how beautiful this coat, this patina
is on this, you know, I have a sister that
[SPEAKER_02]: just sent me some of hers from the middle
of the country over for me to look,
[SPEAKER_02]: take a look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's brown as it can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is just delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's smokes like heaven.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is immediately just washes right over
you, you know, and, and again,
[SPEAKER_02]: another warrior, veteran, female,
bad-ass girl that I know that's a rock
[SPEAKER_02]: star, you know, and Sierra is just a
fricking killing it, man, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I love what she does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just, that's again,
her, what she teaches out and what I teach
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Cam and I'm assuming you are sister
and brother, Colin, I assume you are as
[SPEAKER_02]: well, you know, about whole plant medicine
and, and, and really what, where it is for
[SPEAKER_02]: me personally is that's my main thread of
trying to grow full term, full spectrum
[SPEAKER_02]: that has is rich in everything across the
board, maybe high in some areas,
[SPEAKER_02]: but rich in everything across the board,
because that what I believe is the closest
[SPEAKER_02]: way to heal ourselves naturally with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Joanne, you said something and Cam
said something both about it, about the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we have cannabinoid receptors in
our bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, we're wired for this
stuff to think that it's not supposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: be in our system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just quite honestly ridiculous in
today's scientific community, medical
[SPEAKER_02]: community, you know, back in Peter,
you said it earlier, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: back in the seventies and eighties,
man, we were outlaw, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we were underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody knew who the hell we were.
[SPEAKER_02]: We only knew who each other were.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't put our names on stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't advertise what we were growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you advertise what you were
growing and you went to prison,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and that's just the truth of the
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's even happens now there's
still red States in our union that if they
[SPEAKER_02]: advertise what they're doing, they go to
prison over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it's like, we're fortunate
to be in the state of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would, why would like, um,
right now, why do you think people are
[SPEAKER_01]: using the white stuff as opposed to
letting it get the right color?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, ratio that you were speaking about,
um, like the white, the, the lighter color
[SPEAKER_01]: is what I predominantly see, especially,
especially like in the legal market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that, that is the commercial legal
market that is not crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: What craft people do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's, it's harvested earlier
and answer his question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you said it too already, Joanne.
[SPEAKER_02]: You already said it, sister greed,
greed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also lack of education quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can turn more, you can turn more
volume over in the same 12 months.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the 12th, same 12 months that
cam and I would work in where we would try
[SPEAKER_02]: and do maybe three or four harvest is
using the sun and maybe a little light
[SPEAKER_02]: augmentation doing a light depth outside
and full what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three or four times, maybe in a year
commercially every six weeks, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're trying to get six, seven harvest
in a year, because again, it's about greed
[SPEAKER_02]: and not about the quality of the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, and sadly, I believe now I'm not a
hundred percent sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm only going on by guys that
practice the craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not, I'm a flower guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not an extraction with, I,
I, you know, the, the guy that it is that
[SPEAKER_02]: I have connections to is a great
extraction guy that I, that I ask
[SPEAKER_02]: information from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what he's telling me is,
you know, quicker harvest, quicker return,
[SPEAKER_02]: less time in the ground, you know,
more, more, more, more, more cheaper,
[SPEAKER_02]: cheaper, cheaper, cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we really have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have that market that they,
they're $10 a gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't give a damn what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want to get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not my thread.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not really cams thread.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's you guys have a newer
thread either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get that that's out there, but I believe
what, what you said, what we, what we need
[SPEAKER_02]: to do is we need to teach that that's not
necessarily the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can also say best, but we can also
say different because when we look at the
[SPEAKER_04]: different differences of those,
you also have the people who insist that
[SPEAKER_04]: you have to have flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's over 20% THC and all of the
research and all of us know that use
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis on a regular basis, that some of
the greatest strains are, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: seven to 15% THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're having to educate people that
more THC is not the end all be all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, and this comes back to where you
were talking about full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to define these terms for
ourselves before other people's other
[SPEAKER_04]: people define them that have no business
talking about it because they don't have
[SPEAKER_04]: the experience in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So are we talking full spectrum of an
industrial hemp?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we talking full spectrum of an indoor
grown clone that's harvested in a specific
[SPEAKER_04]: time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we talking about the full spectrum of
a beautiful cannabis plant that was grown
[SPEAKER_04]: in full sun and full soil and allowed to
go to the full term of its life expectancy
[SPEAKER_04]: being buffeted by the wind and being
predated on by bugs and, and deer so that
[SPEAKER_04]: they respond and produce more cannabinoids
and more terpenes, you know, there's all
[SPEAKER_04]: different levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we have to start coming up with
standardized definitions of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people can understand what we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you spend all that time outdoors,
making these beautiful plants that the
[SPEAKER_04]: most robust broad spectrum that you can,
the better that you take care of them
[SPEAKER_04]: post-harvest that once you harvest them,
that's the halfway mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you've got to start working on curing
and making sure that you stabilize all
[SPEAKER_04]: those cannabinoids and all those terpenes
that you allow them to develop to their
[SPEAKER_04]: full potential while degrading the things
in the plant that we don't want like the
[SPEAKER_04]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Doc and I both do super long,
slow cures where we leave the flower
[SPEAKER_04]: untrimmed on the stick for months in a
dark space that is climate controlled,
[SPEAKER_04]: humidity, temperature, airflow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't like to trim them first.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want all of those small sugar leaves to
cover the trichomes and protect them like
[SPEAKER_04]: a cocoon and let them develop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and they'll, it's like a fine wine or
a fine tequila.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, talking about the colors,
a Blanco tequila is an unaged tequila.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's raw, it's fresh, it's young,
it's hoven.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as you age the can or the tequila,
just like the cannabis, it's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: develop more rich colors and you're going
to get a Reposado or a Niejo style.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the more that you allow the cannabis
to cure, the more it's going to develop
[SPEAKER_04]: into new things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're even discovering a new thing called
hashachin, which is prevalent in a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: handmade temple ball hashes or sharas.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you seal that hash in, it still ages
and converts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have flower, you know, I'm still smoking
my pre-rolls from three years ago that are
[SPEAKER_04]: developed and they've just become so much
more robust.
[SPEAKER_04]: But all of these parts of the plant that
there's better things for better people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody might need that, that blonde
rosin that's got a lot of THCA or CBDA or
[SPEAKER_04]: CBGA, the precursor of acidic
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a lot of other people are going
to need a more robust profile that has a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot more things in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because our endocannabinoid systems are
extremely individual.
[SPEAKER_04]: What works for one of us won't work for
another.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we just need to make sure that
everything that's going into the market is
[SPEAKER_04]: clean and tested and won't cause harm.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, as someone who spends a lot of
time testing different things that can
[SPEAKER_05]: heal, because I'm a self-rehabilitated
veteran, I wear that badge of honor
[SPEAKER_05]: proudly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with cannabis in particular,
and you know, I don't want to get too into
[SPEAKER_05]: the weeds with it, but you guys are
hitting it on the head in such an
[SPEAKER_05]: important topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because for me, for four years,
I have been trying craft cannabis to
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensary cannabis and everything in
between.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can tell you wholeheartedly now that
the past month, every time I dab or take a
[SPEAKER_05]: bong load of a high THC cannabis,
every issue I have is worse.
[SPEAKER_05]: My pain, my depression, my anger,
my sadness, all is compounded.
[SPEAKER_05]: And through my own personal research,
which I like to do on my own, I have come
[SPEAKER_05]: to find that, you know, people with a
proclivity to traumatic, with traumatic
[SPEAKER_05]: brain injury in their past, with PTSD with
brain injuries specifically, the dopamine
[SPEAKER_05]: levels affected by THC can ultimately
hinder your own body's ability to make
[SPEAKER_05]: this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what you're doing is you're spiking in
and out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you take that bong load,
you may feel a little bit of relief at
[SPEAKER_05]: first, but four or five hours later,
your body is not producing the same levels
[SPEAKER_05]: of dopamine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then you're crashing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was happening to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why I'm off THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm specifically just taking oils like
fiddler's greens, THC, a acidic THC now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has like night overnight,
I felt better overnight.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it is scary to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the problem with that is, and I come
from the cannabis compassionate world,
[SPEAKER_05]: is that I have 200, over 200 active
members of Veterans Walk and Talk
[SPEAKER_05]: throughout the nation who for one reason
or another need cannabis to survive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you are facing them and they're
coming to your hikes, and I have to try to
[SPEAKER_05]: provide for them on a weekly basis when
we're out or when we're really active,
[SPEAKER_05]: and all three of you have hiked with us,
and all three of you have donated to
[SPEAKER_05]: Veterans Walk and Talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you know the need is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: What has happened now between the beauty
and the elegance of what Doc Ray and Cam
[SPEAKER_05]: do, between that and dispensaries,
it has gotten completely convoluted with
[SPEAKER_05]: greed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what happens is you get 39%
cannabinoids, on the label when that means
[SPEAKER_05]: nothing to the average consumer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you get up people like myself who
take the time to try every last product
[SPEAKER_05]: that they can possibly find because if
you're putting it out in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: space, I wanna know about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can tell you firsthand, the
medicinal side of cannabis has been
[SPEAKER_05]: completely convoluted by the recreational
side.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has set us back decades to be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much inequality.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much back and forth bullshit
with the research and the denying of the
[SPEAKER_05]: research that goes on in cannabis when we
know this plant works and we know it needs
[SPEAKER_05]: to be made accessible.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys being the pioneers of this and
empowering people to grow on their own is
[SPEAKER_05]: imperative because the need is so great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't turn away high THC products if I'm
getting them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't be like this won't help my people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just not at that point because
cannabis is the great unifier.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is also in many ways for what I do
for Veterans Walk and Talk, it is the
[SPEAKER_05]: healing basis of what we do but it's also
in a lot of ways it's bait and it's a way
[SPEAKER_05]: to get veterans to learn that this is
something that they can try but also get
[SPEAKER_05]: them to the group and the community
because as I've said many times cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: is community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And whether you're consuming it properly
or not, you're getting medicinal value
[SPEAKER_05]: from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All cannabis use is medicinal.
[SPEAKER_05]: All cannabis use is medicinal.
[SPEAKER_05]: All cannabis use is medicinal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like saying basketball isn't
medicinal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's a recreational sport.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have fun when you play it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't mean it's not a good thing for
your body.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I tell veterans and you guys thank
you for all your praise about Veterans
[SPEAKER_05]: Walk and Talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have seen firsthand all three of you,
Cam you hiked with us in Malibu I think it
[SPEAKER_05]: was or you came and sponsored an event in
Malibu we did and Doc you hiked Bridge to
[SPEAKER_05]: Nowhere and Joanne and I have been working
hand in hand together for many months now
[SPEAKER_05]: and have big plans.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have never seen anything, anything like
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It brings people to a place of comfort
within themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: It brings people to a place where they can
face like Doc did and say things that
[SPEAKER_05]: whether or not we are sitting around in a
table physically smoking together,
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis is what brought us all to this
place right now and empowered Doc to share
[SPEAKER_05]: that for the very first time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are the types that's as powerful
as it gets with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: My role in cannabis is compassion.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to advocate for the plant the way
the plant advocates for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And which is why I'm so honored to be on a
panel with you guys who are because I know
[SPEAKER_05]: Cam and Doc specifically and you guys can
touch on this later but getting an
[SPEAKER_05]: heirloom of Providence de Origin
established in Humboldt is something that
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very passionate about and I know you
guys have talked about this with me
[SPEAKER_05]: before.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with Veterans Walk and Talk in
particular, it's gotten to the point where
[SPEAKER_05]: if you're a veteran and you're not taking
control of your own health then you're
[SPEAKER_05]: going to fall under the VA.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the VA for me, I am 100% disabled
combat veteran.
[SPEAKER_05]: I broke my moral code for this country.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hurt people for this country.
[SPEAKER_05]: I watched my brothers get hurt for this
country.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the fact that we have to come back and
take our own health into our hands is
[SPEAKER_05]: terrifying for many and hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm having a baby with my beautiful
girlfriend Cookie who is a Navy veteran
[SPEAKER_05]: and worked with NATO and served as proudly
as anybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are both covered by the VA.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are both unwilling to have our baby
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we pay for private insurance,
even though it would be completely covered
[SPEAKER_05]: under the VA system.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that doesn't tell you everything you
know about the VA, I don't know what does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because literally, I mean, we're spending,
yes, am I spending disability money that's
[SPEAKER_05]: coming from the VA to get service outside
of the VA?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm using their money so I can get better
care that they don't offer.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is so wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is wrong on every level.
[SPEAKER_05]: The VA's motto is defining excellence.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have done nothing of the sort.
[SPEAKER_05]: I lived at the VA for 11 months on the
campus grounds when I got back from
[SPEAKER_05]: Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_05]: I tried, I tried to do it their way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave it as honest an effort as anybody
that I have ever met.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one, in fact, I've barely rarely meet
people that lived at the VA for more than
[SPEAKER_05]: six months.
[SPEAKER_05]: 11 months is like unheard of.
[SPEAKER_05]: My 11 month tenure at the VA ended with me
in a padded cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: At 11 months, after all the healing I did,
all the effort, one argument with my
[SPEAKER_05]: roommate and I'm in a padded cell being
shot without a van.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of that out the window, gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Out on the street, my stuff waiting for me
when I got back to the dormitory,
[SPEAKER_05]: on the street, I was escorted by VA police
officers.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was after being on a board of
directors for the VA domiciliary in West
[SPEAKER_05]: LA VA.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I gave it an honest effort.
[SPEAKER_05]: I took methadone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I took, I took, well, buterin.
[SPEAKER_05]: I took everything that they would throw at
me just so I could be in my father's life
[SPEAKER_05]: and be a good veteran.
[SPEAKER_05]: And none of it worked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis, cannabis, coming to it like I
did is what saved my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Veterans Walk and Talk's mission is
simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: We walk, we talk, we talk about whatever
comes to our minds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis usually being at the forefront of
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now mushrooms have been an amazing healing
component for, for veterans.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, we use it almost on every hike.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now there are several veterans that are
partaking in a, in a, in a, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: in some form of mushroom therapy,
or at least learning about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Veterans Walk and Talk has grown to be
much more than just a group of hiking
[SPEAKER_05]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you all know, like we advocate,
we grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are, we are just social justice
warriors.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are at the forefront of knocking down
the fascist regime that's taking over our
[SPEAKER_05]: country.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are just doing all the good work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope I didn't rant too much,
but that's, that's my piece for this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, I'm just very grateful you guys are
touching on everything you're saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I think that's critically important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I, I want each of you to kind of give
concrete and you just did it kind of,
[SPEAKER_03]: here's my personal journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, you know, I, I think one thing
you just mentioned was kind of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you, you come back to the U S
and you're kind of pushed into the VA
[SPEAKER_03]: system and, and the current state of the
VA system.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like you guys to touch a little more
on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and is it changing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it stuck in some time warp that you
just don't have any hope medium term for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for each of you, it's kind of
like you, you took control of your own
[SPEAKER_03]: destiny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing Colin, you just mentioned
was like, you know, someone goes into a
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary and buys the, you know,
designer cultivar du jour and they smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: it and they have a paranoid freak out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe they never want to touch it
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, Oh my God, that was,
that was an opportunity lost because had
[SPEAKER_03]: that person tried something that is right
for them, they'd start healing and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they'd find something that helps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And instead they had this, you know,
you know, anxiety, uh, written experience,
[SPEAKER_03]: which you seem to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so can each of you kind of,
and Colin, you, you just did a little bit,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if you want to, you know, expand on it
or Joanne, you want to talk kind of like
[SPEAKER_03]: what you started with, what you noticed,
what you realized works with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's your personal experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then each of you has experienced with
at least 10, 20, 30, 50 friends who are
[SPEAKER_03]: veterans and kind of just be specific,
talk about my friend, Billy, like he,
[SPEAKER_03]: this was his journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what we learned on his behalf
along the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I, cause these anecdotal stories,
I mean, these are real stories of real
[SPEAKER_03]: people and what works, what doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's important for people to,
to, or basically for us to document wins
[SPEAKER_03]: and losses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will start if that's okay, because I've
been doing veterans walk and talk since
[SPEAKER_05]: late 2016 for four years.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the first few years, I was still
struggling with a lot of issues and
[SPEAKER_05]: finding my way in many ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then veterans walk and talk and
myself, we really made a name for
[SPEAKER_05]: ourselves by driving to the VA and saying,
I don't give a fuck what you think about
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm picking your people up and taking them
hiking and I'm going to get them high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you kick them out, I will be at the
door waiting for them to give them a
[SPEAKER_05]: house.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was at the West LA VA?
[SPEAKER_05]: West LA VA, the Chatsworth VA,
I picked up veterans and also at several
[SPEAKER_05]: out the VA outsources.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So several, you know, you call them
shelters in downtown LA that I would pick
[SPEAKER_05]: up homeless veterans and take them hiking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they, I can tell you I, with,
with a few exceptions, I've lost,
[SPEAKER_05]: I've lost to suicide.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them I've lost to, to further
homelessness and drug addiction,
[SPEAKER_05]: which any, anybody in this profession,
it's just, you can't, there's 22 veterans
[SPEAKER_05]: a day dying.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to lose some.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and that's why we put ourselves out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the ones that, that continued to hike
and continued to garner what cannabis had
[SPEAKER_05]: to offer, I am still in touch with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're usually back at home with their
families.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are working in the cannabis space now
lifted up by it in many ways, whether it
[SPEAKER_05]: be security or cultivating the plant,
growing it on farms where they can seclude
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves, but they don't actually have
to buy the land that's as Doc Ray was
[SPEAKER_05]: afforded to do and did many, many years
ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's what I want to do as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the, the, the healing, like I,
I have 200 members of veterans walk and
[SPEAKER_05]: talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I were to put out an email
questionnaire to them saying, what healed
[SPEAKER_05]: you better, the VA or cannabis,
the results, I don't even need to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what the results are.
[SPEAKER_05]: The VA has dropped the ball.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's seems a little, a little bit like
it's getting better.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can talk about cannabis and maybe I'd
love to hear Joanne talk about what she,
[SPEAKER_05]: what she discusses with, with your medical
professional, because I keep it very,
[SPEAKER_05]: I use plant medicine, plant medicine,
plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I discussed, but I have a
permanent disability.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't have to, I don't have to,
I could say whatever I want to them,
[SPEAKER_05]: basically, as long as I'm not hurting
people with the money they're giving me.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for, for others, you know,
it's terrifying to bring up cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's terrifying to talk about mushroom
use.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're having a baby, cannabis,
you know, it's nausea, come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, morning sickness, it's night and
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: You take some cannabis, you don't throw
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't take cannabis, you throw up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, I don't need more evidence than
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, so the VA dropping the ball
and an excellent book is the, the ex VA
[SPEAKER_05]: secretary, David Shulkin's book.
[SPEAKER_05]: It shouldn't be this hard to serve your
country.
[SPEAKER_05]: He lays it out as well as anybody just
explaining how he tried to fix it from the
[SPEAKER_05]: internal and how it's just, it America,
we got to just admit that some things
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't work and we have to revamp them
from the, from the ground up basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd love to hear from Joanne more.
[SPEAKER_03]: What just before Joanne starts,
can you talk about, I mean, you're showing
[SPEAKER_03]: up unannounced at a VA facility and
pulling people to go hang out and smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, were there bureaucratic
administrators at the VA who were
[SPEAKER_03]: supportive of others who thought you were
doing the devil's work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, did they bring the MPs in to escort
you off the facility?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what were some of the, the,
the interactions with the VA staff?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much for asking that
question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ran into the craziest of, of scenarios,
picking a veterans up at the VA,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is a large reason why I can't do it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what was happening was my members were
being searched at a higher rate in their
[SPEAKER_05]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: The VWAT members were being harassed.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were being denied certain things.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were being given unfair curfews that,
you know, you have to understand the
[SPEAKER_05]: places that I, I was picking veterans up.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to qualify for, for instance,
when I lived at the domiciliary in the
[SPEAKER_05]: West LA VA, I lived on both the substance
abuse track and the combat trauma
[SPEAKER_05]: treatment track.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was a homeless drug addicted veteran,
but you have to interview for a spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to qualify.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to show that you're, have the
initiative to heal or whatever the hell
[SPEAKER_05]: that means.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they turn people away.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you admit to cannabis use,
you will just simply not get a bed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, yeah, they were being searched and
fucked with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my, I, I had to take into
consideration that I am not a medical
[SPEAKER_05]: professional.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a licensed counselor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have the protections that the VA
has in place.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I was running into was my most
severe cases, my most severe brothers and
[SPEAKER_05]: sisters who I was picking up at the VA,
I had to listen to what they were saying,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I also had to take into consideration
that they were there for sometimes
[SPEAKER_05]: paranoid schizophrenia, for sometimes
delusional thoughts.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are, and again, I had delusional
thoughts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still have delusional thoughts,
but I, I'm not, I shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_05]: hospitalized over them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: So when these veterans were telling me
that their heat was being turned off in
[SPEAKER_05]: their room, which they were paying for,
out of their own disability, or that the
[SPEAKER_05]: water, and I have video, the water is
brown running out of their bathtub
[SPEAKER_05]: constantly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're the only room on the floor
that has this issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to wonder, is it related?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it related to the fact that these
veterans aren't falling into line with
[SPEAKER_05]: what the VA is prescribing them?
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, I, these are veterans who
didn't live in a treatment program like I
[SPEAKER_05]: did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would never have been able to walk with
veterans, walk and talk, living in the
[SPEAKER_05]: treatment program I lived in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a chance.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have been kicked out immediately.
[SPEAKER_05]: The veterans I was picking up were paying
to rent a place on the VA grounds that was
[SPEAKER_05]: leased to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the VA would lease the building on the
VA grounds to a company like Salvation
[SPEAKER_05]: Army, or the Disabled American Veterans
Association, or IAVA, or any of these.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they would in turn rent it back
to the VA.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, and so you don't even know
you're in one building one second,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're in a private institution.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're in another building the next second
you're falling under VA rule.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's really just no clear cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like for me, why is it that veterans
aren't given this alternative six months
[SPEAKER_05]: into before leaving the military?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is veterans walk and talk not,
hey, you're leaving, you're leaving the
[SPEAKER_05]: military in six months.
[SPEAKER_05]: In order to qualify for the medical
marijuana, the cannabis that we want to
[SPEAKER_05]: give you, you have to go, or we suggest
you go, walk with veterans walk and talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're in a wheelchair, you're a paralyzed
veteran.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will suggest that you instead go do
veterans art and talk, go paint.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do this, you will be given cannabis
while you do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then slowly you will be released as you
go.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just giving veterans cannabis,
veterans more medicine, that's not gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alternative therapies, a new lease on life
is what cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what cannabis gives you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need to shepherd that in every way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's no reason why alcoholism,
drug addiction, depression, PTSD,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's no reason why all these things we
have to knock out before we come to
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis should be the first thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we tackle these things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what veterans walk and talk
stigma is trying to break the stigma of
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm denied, I can't see my son that lives
in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have two step sons and a daughter on the
way and a son in North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_05]: My son in North Carolina, I have not seen,
it'll be a year in November because of my
[SPEAKER_05]: choices, because I won't take
prescriptions, because I won't stop
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about cannabis and mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't get to see them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I barely get to Skype with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I bring up mushrooms or cannabis on a
Skype, it's cut immediately.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are sacrifices that we have to
make because we know the truth of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once you know the truth of cannabis,
you can't help but sing it from the
[SPEAKER_05]: mountaintops.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just quickly, the neighbors either
cutting a tree down or doing something,
[SPEAKER_03]: but this is what you were talking about
from David Shulkin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just... Yeah, that's a brilliant
book.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Joanne, you wanna jump in and
kind of tell your, I think it's basically
[SPEAKER_03]: your story of figuring out that this works
for you and then specifically what works,
[SPEAKER_03]: what doesn't work as some cannabis and
form factors of taking it maybe don't work
[SPEAKER_03]: or are less effective or adverse in the
same way Colin was talking about where
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like, I had anxiety.
[SPEAKER_03]: So can you kind of talk about your journey
of discovery?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then any friends who you have who you
can talk about kind of their experience as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll absolutely share my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in the aviation community here with
the Navy stationed in Lamar, California,
[SPEAKER_01]: working with F-18 aircraft during my first
deployment, working on the flight that I
[SPEAKER_01]: was actually blown by jet aircraft.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jet blast from the aircraft.
[SPEAKER_01]: And long story short, it was a horrible
accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a concussion from it and couldn't
speak English for about 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And long story short, that created a whole
bunch of problems from the main one that I
[SPEAKER_01]: could experience and could put my finger
on throughout that time was besides the
[SPEAKER_01]: headaches and the back pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't sleep for more than like two
consecutive hours or every night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was waking up every hour,
every two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that happened, needless to say,
I still had time to serve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did nine months of physical therapy and
went back on deployment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that deployment was where I
realized that my sleeping became a problem
[SPEAKER_01]: because we were working 12 hours and I
still was up like 20 hours because I
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't sleeping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that problem, I literally was let out
of the military because after that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't the same person anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't even want to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But coming out, that's when all the issues
became more exacerbated because now I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: alone in my thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I fell into the hands of the VA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was not unlike some of you guys,
I had not experimented with cannabis even
[SPEAKER_01]: before that very, in college I did do it
every a few times, but it wasn't like a
[SPEAKER_01]: thing I had never heard of medicinal
cannabis or using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that I had heard of maybe
glaucoma that you can use it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought I was maybe a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't even, that's how disconnected I
was at that point in my life with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I met a person who was a grower
and he was working towards, at that point,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was 2014, he was working on illegal
cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, what does that even mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But even before we got to that point,
he introduced me to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually RSO.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me a little syringe looking thing
and told me, take a grain of rice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm telling you right now that changed
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am talking about, for three years,
I could not tell you who I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot, I had no clue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And starting that regimen or that becoming
a routine before I went to sleep,
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much I, cannabis was able to help
me sleep and that solves so many other
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pain with the backaches, trying to
sleep and in all that situation,
[SPEAKER_01]: literally within a month, I was already
the person that I remember being before
[SPEAKER_01]: all these problems began.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just made it my mission to make sure
I spread this message however I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: I quit my job and became completely
involved not only in trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: what worked for me, because I did,
I know Doc brought it up earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were, some of the things,
then I started experimenting with the
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I quit cigarettes and focused on cannabis
and never had to pick that back up again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And doing it with the edibles,
with the, just trying to find out where I
[SPEAKER_01]: was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a flower person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what helps me the most to not
only be functional, but also to manage
[SPEAKER_01]: pain, to manage the anxiety that arose
from not sleeping for years and just even
[SPEAKER_01]: my eating habits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was just a situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I became so serious about it that I
have a journal where I keep the names of
[SPEAKER_01]: the strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm able to identify that strain and
how I felt documented, more of that for
[SPEAKER_01]: creativity, more of that for no pain,
more of that to be able to sleep through
[SPEAKER_01]: the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then documenting to the ones who fell
paranoid or fell, druggie or whatever the
[SPEAKER_01]: case may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, it's been like I said,
a game changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know individuals in my circle who have,
I have a friend, Dave.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually makes a bomb at home from the
plants that he grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know people in my family,
my aunt in the Dominican Republic,
[SPEAKER_01]: she's using the bomb right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's diabetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: She suffers from diabetes.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's had it for ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: She had, she has a wound in her foot that
she got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gnarly.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's had it for 10 years because of the
diabetes.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's not able to heal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with Dave's bomb, she already has,
unless I am telling you in less than six
[SPEAKER_01]: months, she's experienced, she already has
a scab on it, which means that her skin is
[SPEAKER_01]: completely being regenerated.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the diabetes, the diabetes status is
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis bomb has been able to,
I mean, I can show you the before and
[SPEAKER_01]: after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her whole foot was in the verge of being
completely engulfed in this wound because
[SPEAKER_01]: since it didn't heal, it continued to get
infections and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the cannabis, she sent me and
WhatsApp this message this long,
[SPEAKER_01]: thanking me so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my aunt is like in her 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fact that this thing was hindering
her life for a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with cannabis, what medication was not
able to do in years, a decade,
[SPEAKER_01]: in six months, she's already has like a
normal healing process with hers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's not smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's not getting, doing bomb rips or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is literally using it as a topical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like one of the most compelling
stories I have besides the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis prevented me from committing
suicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was literally on the floor with a gun in
my hands, contemplating that when I met
[SPEAKER_01]: that guy that same week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he introduced me to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we are five years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't change it any other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was perfect timing for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It became a complete journey from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here I am five years later,
having this conversation, which I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: crucial for people to listen to and other
people, because you guys are just some
[SPEAKER_01]: people like in your area, in the Humboldt
County area, Lord knows how many growers
[SPEAKER_01]: have so much information.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to give people like, we have to
give these people a platform so they can
[SPEAKER_01]: get this information out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I made that, my mission to be able to
contribute to that in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very passionate about it,
very thankful to the plan, to people that
[SPEAKER_01]: grow it like you guys, through people like
Colin, who create communities and then
[SPEAKER_01]: infuse the message of wellness and just
being able to be stable and the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's okay to feel some kind of way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here, these are alternatives because I
cannot take pills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the headaches that I get from
the concussion, they give me 800
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams of ibuprofen pills that I got
to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: These pills are like this big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I sometimes had to get creative trying
to mix it with something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, with cannabis, it's natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't hurt my liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because with big pharma medicine,
it usually creates an underlying issue if
[SPEAKER_01]: you use it for long periods of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I prefer the alternative that's
something that's not going to harm me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have to worry about side
effects or long-term effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then being detrimental to myself,
which will eventually create another
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, I'm super thankful to be
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the power of the plant is not even
just for medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for pretty much anything but creating
glass or steel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, we can use this
eco-friendly product or crop to help the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for having me here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really critical right now,
too, that the conversation that we are all
[SPEAKER_02]: for having is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know this information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, Joanne, specifically,
is how do we take what we all know to be
[SPEAKER_02]: the truth?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we get it beyond this point?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we get it to reach the masses?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we saturate more?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it is Pavlo's dog repeated over and
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually, it sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been preaching it for 40 years and
not sure that maybe it's sticking now as
[SPEAKER_02]: it just generationally moves so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where so many people with this quasi-legal
thing that we're in are stepping forward
[SPEAKER_02]: because the states say it's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can get this federal ship to come,
hopefully, in the next 24 months,
[SPEAKER_02]: get this federal ship to come with the D
class on schedule one, as it rightfully
[SPEAKER_02]: should be, that it does have true medical
value.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a matter of fact, it's at the top of
the pharmacopoeia of medical value.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where we need to move this to,
where we can get it to open, where the
[SPEAKER_02]: ones that are still standing on the
sidelines watching, and you alluded to it
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier, a fear of repercussion of the
unknown.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's here, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of on the tip of the spear here
for cannabis because I have outed myself
[SPEAKER_02]: and put my face on videos and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of my grower friends as you
said, sisters, the truth is about 80% of
[SPEAKER_02]: the best genetics in the world are within
about a 50 mile radius of where I live.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know the bulk of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like there are a lot of
them with what Dale and I are doing two
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wouldn't even come to a meeting that
when he met me up here in the Redwoods,
[SPEAKER_02]: they wouldn't come to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this earlier this year in January on
the radio, I had him on the radio with me
[SPEAKER_02]: on K-Mudd and the people there that
wouldn't even engage with me last year
[SPEAKER_02]: about the topic of patent protections,
what I'm doing, plant patent protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people can't rip me off anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my primary.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's mostly so that's just the one
side of it is branding and aligning with
[SPEAKER_02]: cam so that so high tide distro can help
get veterans choice cannabis across the
[SPEAKER_02]: country.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're going to blow California
up, but just when the time is right,
[SPEAKER_02]: move it across the country, you know,
that's the big goal right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think is we all get the same kind of the
same phrase ology, the same verbiage.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all saying the same thing,
you know, and I'm hoping maybe this
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation we can with the other leaders
within our respective groups, we can get
[SPEAKER_02]: where we're all using like, you know,
let's quit saying strain, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's pick up the correct phrase ology of
chemo bar or cultivar and to to make
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves and I know this sounds terrible,
but to make ourselves look more
[SPEAKER_02]: professional, you know, I mean,
honestly, God, I cleaned up today,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I didn't look so shaggy, you know,
and that's kind of I know, cam,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we already look like rough,
rowdy, rough next to a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: anyway, just because we look like wild old
fuzzy guys, you know, and, and we and we
[SPEAKER_02]: need people that can help us translate
across where that, you know, we're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about chemo bars and cultivars and even me
personally in the last 24 months having
[SPEAKER_02]: access to Peter led to that earlier,
I have access to the medical professionals
[SPEAKER_02]: now where I can get the correct phrase
ology and I understand CBD and CBG and CBN
[SPEAKER_02]: and things that I didn't know how to say
that three years ago, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got what it did and I could tell you
know, if you smoke this man, I promise you
[SPEAKER_02]: in about 20 minutes, you're going to be
relaxed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like the raspberry Kush, you know,
and you alluded to it just briefly on that
[SPEAKER_02]: one that is a true heirloom one to one
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a full spectrum CBD THC rich and it
is literally about 15% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most shops won't even want to look at
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what it also is, is it's 15 freaking
percent CBD, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you smoke that puppy and in 20
minutes, your ass is taking a nap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't care who you are, how tough
you think you are, how big you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 64 and 200 in my prime 260.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm about 210 now, but I'm about big,
but taking a nap in about 30 minutes on a
[SPEAKER_02]: nice joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's how good it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that strain so much to you know,
it's just again, it's nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the shops Oh my god,
it's not 20%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not supposed to be it's a
medical cultivar specifically designed to
[SPEAKER_02]: it was specifically designed to help with
sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you had the terpenes tested on that
strain yet?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know the terpene levels?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming, Colin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brother, you know, I'm an old man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm doing it by myself until I
was just, you know, I just growing badass
[SPEAKER_02]: weed and only a few people knew who I was,
you know, variable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has like that camphor menthol like
almost like licorice end note that I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: just anxious to find out the terpenes that
make that up, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can wing it and kind of tell you
just by the profile is what I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just literally so you guys get it
literally joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how how slow I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally less yesterday just set up cam
you'll be appreciate this brother set up
[SPEAKER_02]: my account with SC labs to start having
shit tested.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love it because I wouldn't do it
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they actually come to your damn
location and pick your stuff up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have to drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm thankful sister, you know,
it's like, again, I don't want to really I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean, I do my goal is really my goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you I want to shift it to the hands of
my young brothers and sisters that want to
[SPEAKER_02]: learn the craft the way I do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why I'm thankful to have cam are we're
working on is aligning together where I
[SPEAKER_02]: can teach this out on math scale,
so we can get it out there and let people
[SPEAKER_02]: have access to good information.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, for me to call and call him cam
and are building that damn retreat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yeah, build a man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys work no more talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done with the talk, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to put your money where your
fucking mouth is, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And walk it sister, you know, and walk it,
you know, and that's what can my literally
[SPEAKER_02]: part of our conversations, we want to
build it up because he he needs to ramp up
[SPEAKER_02]: his supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can't keep up with the man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't get mine out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you're hitting it on the head
doc.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like we got to do it ourselves,
or no one's gonna do it for us that earns
[SPEAKER_05]: walk and talk is held three retreats so
far.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, everyone has been
successful.
[SPEAKER_05]: But everyone has been also a huge risk,
because I am taking combat veterans out
[SPEAKER_05]: into the desert out into the woods with no
insurance, no medical professionals,
[SPEAKER_05]: just the knowledge that I know I can help
them and and doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it does it takes people like
yourself to just put plan, put it into
[SPEAKER_05]: action because no one is going to do it
for us period.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have an alignment we didn't have a year
ago to call and you know, now we have Dale
[SPEAKER_02]: hunt in our corner, then Dale,
again, you guys haven't been around Dale
[SPEAKER_02]: yet, just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a brother to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love him so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, he's the premier Pat plant
patent guy in the frippin country for
[SPEAKER_02]: crying out loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oh, yeah, he's a plant lawyer to oops,
you know, but he happens to have a Navy
[SPEAKER_02]: son that has PTS and he loves my flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it takes people like you guys and
lawyers, honestly, and politicians to
[SPEAKER_05]: change the nomenclature of cannabis from
Graham dabs to anandamide.
[SPEAKER_05]: From taking this can put you in
homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why does no one talk about homeostasis?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why does nobody talk about the fact that
bong loads and dabs can spike you in and
[SPEAKER_05]: out?
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, while you're spiking,
here's your homeostasis level,
[SPEAKER_05]: you feel good while you're in that level,
but you spike in and out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas if you take it like, intuitively,
you can actually stay within that level
[SPEAKER_05]: and continually produce anandamide and
stay in homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what we need to be talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what we've been doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't set out to start a distribution
company.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was making pot ice cream in the Virgin
Islands 25 years ago because it made me
[SPEAKER_04]: feel good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just kept carrying on with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've been my wife and I, Shannon,
we've been growing in under the 2015 model
[SPEAKER_04]: in Northern California for over 10 years
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we started growing CBD strains eight
years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were one of the very first farms in the
United States to grow CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got our original seeds from Lawrence
Ringo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we started working with labs,
trying to figure out what we had and what
[SPEAKER_04]: it was, and trying to learn from all the
people like Martin Lee and Project CBD and
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Ethan Russo and learning all of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I started growing CBD strains,
when I take it into a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, hey, I grew this great flower
outdoors, but it doesn't really have much
[SPEAKER_04]: THC and it won't get you high.
[SPEAKER_04]: And nobody understood what I was talking
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we had to educate ourselves to be
able to educate the purchasers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we had to go and educate the
customers so that they knew what was
[SPEAKER_04]: happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that just led us down a path of
self-education to where we started doing
[SPEAKER_04]: free trainings.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the last 10 years, I've been a
member of over a thousand dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: We offer free cannabis education to
anybody who will listen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be a group of one or a hundred or
however many.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the meantime, we want this
information to be out there for free,
[SPEAKER_04]: just like we want the plant to be out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: For everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're building community.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're at this time and place in history
where we get to create the universe that
[SPEAKER_04]: we need and that we should have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's for all of us who have been in
the legal market, trying to survive up
[SPEAKER_04]: till now, we are just now getting through
the survival phase where we can start
[SPEAKER_04]: helping and institutionalize compassion,
institutionalize community, create a
[SPEAKER_04]: community over competition to we're all
out there Lincoln arm in arm telling the
[SPEAKER_04]: government let's consistently do her
research.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let Dr. Ethan Russo use quality cannabis
and we don't have to use this ship from
[SPEAKER_04]: the university of Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a lot of us out there and I
can't tell you how excited I am when I
[SPEAKER_04]: teach classes on acidic cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can go into a dispensary now and I don't
have to explain what decarboxylation is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to explain to the majority of
people what the endocannabinoid system is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we can get to the fine tune things
where you were talking about the dopamine
[SPEAKER_04]: and serotonin levels in somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that a good level of CBD combined
with THC and the other cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenes helps balance out serotonin,
dopamine and other neurotransmitters so
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't spike, so you don't crash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of the problems that people are
having are because their endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: system is out of whack.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're making a lot of great
improvements on the education level in the
[SPEAKER_04]: country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just all of us getting out there
and telling our stories and talking to
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: My dad's a 100% disabled Vietnam vet.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was blown up in country he was a Marine
Corps infantry officer and turned the
[SPEAKER_04]: entire right side of his body into chewed
bubble gum and he spent a year in a body
[SPEAKER_04]: cast in Japan before he came home.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I grew up with him medicating with
alcohol and pills and he was a great dad.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was my scout leader but he was always
in pain and he was always suffering and be
[SPEAKER_04]: damned if you tell him about
post-traumatic stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't happen to Marine Corps
infantry officers, damn it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I learned at a young age, don't sneak
into the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I've been out late, come in loud and
proud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise you're gonna wind up on your
back after you get right inside the door.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't sneak around.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I grew up with disabled vets and
watching all of them self-medicate and
[SPEAKER_04]: then myself, I self-medicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew up in a very conservative Christian
family where dope was for losers,
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't touch that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we drank ourselves silly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I got out of the Marine Corps
myself, I was studying for law enforcement
[SPEAKER_04]: and I was burning out fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was drinking myself to death.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was working in bars so I could fight
without going to jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the very first time the day I got out
of the Marine Corps, I smoked my first
[SPEAKER_04]: joint and just like Doc says, I was able
to just go, I don't have to be on point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to have my back against a
wall looking at the door all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to be on alert and always
hyper vigilant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can take a deep breath and I can slow
down and I can unclench my fists.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, this plant's amazing and I can't
get enough of learning about it and we
[SPEAKER_04]: wanna share it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what Doc and I are talking
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started talking about the distro
company.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started creating our own distro company
because nobody could talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids and CBD, CBDA, whole plant
medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we could.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we started representing ourselves
and offering free education with
[SPEAKER_04]: everything we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll offer free classes to anybody who
will listen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we started finding other small family
farms and product makers and brands are
[SPEAKER_04]: running into the same problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Small craft family run heritage legacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we wanna do is be that personalized
we wanna tell Doc's story and have Doc
[SPEAKER_04]: show up and explain what he does.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanna make sure that the people who
have done this for decades and generations
[SPEAKER_04]: have a voice and we create the community
that we need.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can talk forever about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just one of thousands here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And John, you get it within a 50 mile
radius of me there are hundreds and
[SPEAKER_02]: hundreds if not thousands of small craft
mom and pops that have true one of a kinds
[SPEAKER_02]: that people don't even know about.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not in their circle and get
access to the 10 pounds that they create
[SPEAKER_02]: every flipping year because that's who I
am.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't grow 100 pounds of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow five pounds of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow five pounds of the different
strains for myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I've morphed into with this is
getting into a position now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, what Cam and I are doing is
like we tried to contract people to do it
[SPEAKER_02]: this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I'm a first through the door
motherfucker man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's who I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been kicking indoors for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm kicking indoors with probably the
toughest cat in this state as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution that I'm aware of who is also
a door kicking old guy too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we went along with people that wanna
get this thing out there and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: make it happen ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I get what Colin was saying
earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, we have to do it ourselves
because again, walk the walk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like get out there and we tried to
contract people to make it happen and we
[SPEAKER_02]: couldn't get it done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're gonna build it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just basically in our alignment
is that's what again, I think with you,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything is coming together for a point
here where we all are intertwined with
[SPEAKER_02]: each other now where we know each other,
where you need access, you reach out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get to your market.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna reach out to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: These kinds of things where we can all
expand what we're doing for the greater
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You hit it on the head doc.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about access, access, access,
access.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I give somebody your pineapple berry
kush and it helps a veteran, I need to
[SPEAKER_05]: ensure that they can access it whenever
they need it because they don't need it
[SPEAKER_05]: just every now and then.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kills me, Colin.
[SPEAKER_02]: 70% of Californians don't have access to
cannabis within an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: My five pounds or 10 pounds, it just goes
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes so quickly as I wanna get it into
the hands of people like where I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: mind being part of it, I'm too old to do
it myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need young men and women that wanna get
their hands dirty and wanna learn how to
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivate cannabis to come up to the
middle of nowhere in the wild woods and
[SPEAKER_02]: the mountainside with me and the other
bearded guy and me more than anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're building a thing together,
but it's like I get what he's doing where
[SPEAKER_02]: he's at in Sonoma to where we're looking
at up in Northern Mendo and Southern
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a three hour gap.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I have people that are,
again, other veteran growers that are
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna, I've already told me that are good
at their craft that wanna learn underneath
[SPEAKER_02]: me that are willing to come from where
they are around the world to come be a
[SPEAKER_02]: part of this deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we wanna share this information for
free.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanna make sure that everybody has
access.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanna be educating people, especially
veterans to come into the industry and
[SPEAKER_04]: have a level of education.
[SPEAKER_04]: We wanna make sure everybody has access to
continuous medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no better place for veterans.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no better business that I can
suggest to veterans to go work in
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because even the act of growing is
therapeutic.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting your hands in the soil and
touching it, getting connected to the
[SPEAKER_04]: ground and putting your hands in the soil,
that plant will tell you everything she
[SPEAKER_04]: needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: She will be on her tippy toes smiling when
everything is going well.
[SPEAKER_04]: She may be looking away or drooping a
little bit when she needs some water or
[SPEAKER_04]: love or attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that connection and that love with
that plant is just, it's very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think everybody should grow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis is an amazing, phenomenal,
from the bottom up medicine, and it grows
[SPEAKER_04]: on trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why can't we make sure everybody grows
it?
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody, your friend can't grow it,
give them some of what you've grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: This needs to be community from the ground
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody should have access.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody should be able to grow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody should be able to sell it as
long as it's tested and clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this needs to be, none of this trickle
down bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is from the ground up.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what's gonna elevate the community
from one end to the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that everybody can do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It comes back to like, what does a farmer
look like?
[SPEAKER_05]: What does a scientist look like?
[SPEAKER_05]: What does a veteran look like in this day
and age?
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be anyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you can empower yourself in these
amazing, amazing ways to heal not just
[SPEAKER_05]: yourself, but your community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hear a lot of whispers and I wanna
pose the question to the group is,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I know you guys have tried to do many
things like this, Doc and Cam,
[SPEAKER_05]: but something I'm hearing kicked around
right now through the Veterans Cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: Coalition is an HGA, a Home Growers
Association, where you are empowering
[SPEAKER_05]: people to grow in their closets,
grow in their backyards.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they are able to gift that
certain amount of cannabis away so that
[SPEAKER_05]: there is never not a need.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this is difficult, but it is a
start.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially here in Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have several cultivation groups that
are people who got pushed out from 215
[SPEAKER_04]: into 64 and they all rally and share tips.
[SPEAKER_04]: They meet every Tuesday in Sebastopol and
they grow six big ones and it's free
[SPEAKER_04]: information.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're trying to create that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can share the information where this is
this group that you can access all their
[SPEAKER_04]: resources online for free, even if you're
in San Diego or you're up and humble,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can access this group.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're trying to do the pay it forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: My knowledge for you sharing the knowledge
to them sharing knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of these little groups are there
and we're just now getting to the point
[SPEAKER_04]: where we can stick our heads up and see
who we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, here in Sonoma County,
we just found that the very first cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: Grange Hall in the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a traditional agricultural
group.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have two lobbyists in Sacramento and a
national lobbyist.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all in the infancy stages of these.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to get the Granges going in every
single county and system.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are community halls where you can
share information and have classes and
[SPEAKER_04]: hold events that we can do outside of any
traditional market where it's designed for
[SPEAKER_04]: community and farming.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finding everything downstream
where this can go.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're just now getting out of the
shell shock survival mode from 64 and
[SPEAKER_04]: we're still battling every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know it's we could say it's greed
and the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But speaking, I do cultivation,
manufacturing and distribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we get fucked every step of the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the most difficult thing I've ever
done in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every day, it's demoralizing.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I use a great Marine Corps motto
with all of our crew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Embrace the suck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Embrace the suck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Arms around it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every time they fuck you, you say,
thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: May I have another.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to beat them at their own
game.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're winning in every district.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're winning in every district.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're winning in every district.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis isn't the you know, the devil's
weed and then we can convince other people
[SPEAKER_04]: we just have to meet them at their level
of understanding and give them enough
[SPEAKER_04]: digestible information and share the
resources where we get it from don't come
[SPEAKER_04]: out and see it does everything no Cannabis
slows your body down so it heals itself
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is how we know what it does and
just break it down into simple
[SPEAKER_04]: conversational things We do more sharing
our stories every day to people we meet
[SPEAKER_04]: then, you know A lot of other outlets so
we just need to make sure that we're
[SPEAKER_04]: creating other People to go out there and
share their stories.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just need to create good stories that
can be shared The bottom line is our
[SPEAKER_05]: country through Jim Crow through
segregation through the war on drugs
[SPEAKER_05]: through everything Did a really really
good job of putting Cannabis down like a
[SPEAKER_05]: good job to the point where people like
your friend of 20 years It's ingrained
[SPEAKER_05]: that it's bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's bad we need to do an even better job
than they ever did of Unifying creating
[SPEAKER_05]: communities and and speaking our truths
like you're saying couldn't couldn't have
[SPEAKER_03]: said it better camp jet just quickly it it
seems like you know, we've been talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about kind of the grassroots and momentum
from the bottom and you know, I view it as
[SPEAKER_03]: like You know an iceberg kind of it's
moving in a direction and whether it's
[SPEAKER_03]: moving too slowly is a moot point because
it's happening like you guys are gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: touch more veterans and we'll touch more
and more and more people will try it and
[SPEAKER_03]: Then become evangelists, but let's talk
about the other side, which is the
[SPEAKER_03]: top-down.
[SPEAKER_03]: We touched on the VA Can can you guys
offer some tactical ideas and not just the
[SPEAKER_03]: VA?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean think about each of you were in
different branches of the military So how
[SPEAKER_03]: do you put pressure on them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there like one individual who's
blocking progress?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, like you've been a county the
sheriff is Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell
[SPEAKER_02]: is blocking progress that is blocking
progress Because he loves hemp and not
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis The bill is sitting there again,
where's it where's the holdup at it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting right there They're trying to vote
on it right now to turn it in to to
[SPEAKER_02]: decriminalize it to take it off the
regulation and it's getting voted on that
[SPEAKER_02]: just that they're voting on It sometime in
the next couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe but it's got to get past
McConnell's desk That's the truth of the
[SPEAKER_02]: matter and I only said that to say this It
is small grassroots and how do we do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You change your politicians if they're not
pro-cannabis you vote their ass out and
[SPEAKER_02]: you put a pro-cannabis person into that
seat And that's what I'm getting at which
[SPEAKER_03]: is you know, even a county the sheriff
loves doing raids on cannabis farmers Well
[SPEAKER_03]: that guy comes up for reelection every
once in a while so Thinking of all these
[SPEAKER_03]: different groups that we need to change
the VA is one so my question is like is
[SPEAKER_03]: the VA a monolith where like the West LA
VA just has to go by the orders of the
[SPEAKER_03]: national VA or is each local VA its own
kind of silo of Decision-making where they
[SPEAKER_03]: could be a little more tolerant or a
little less tolerant I will I will address
[SPEAKER_02]: that personally It is a specifically that
it depends on where this specific
[SPEAKER_02]: community based and outreach program is at
here here where we're at is The seabock in
[SPEAKER_02]: Eureka specifically like my physicians
there my primary care and people they all
[SPEAKER_02]: know I use the plan I don't take
synthetics you go to another state where
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't have the same kind of
compassion laws or depth of understanding
[SPEAKER_02]: like we do because this is a Humboldt
County Frickin facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot of what it is It's it's right
down to the personal level of what the how
[SPEAKER_02]: the doctor interprets how the bill is
written and how the Regulations are
[SPEAKER_02]: written within the VA.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's but again Depending on where you're
at.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up to personal interpretation of your
freaking position But my personal primary
[SPEAKER_02]: care literally last time was in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's asking me about what I'm cultivating
Okay, and this is all happening in just
[SPEAKER_02]: the last few years You know, I'm gonna say
it's not immediately so but I'm gonna say
[SPEAKER_02]: in places where they're not in the middle
of the Mecca for cannabis in Northern,
[SPEAKER_02]: California Then obviously it's kind of
you're not going to get the same kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: pro approach someplace else I believe in
places where compassion laws are in place
[SPEAKER_02]: where the doctors can talk to bet about
cannabis with the veterans It's tough
[SPEAKER_02]: because if you're rated and you're not a
hundred percent secured in your rating
[SPEAKER_02]: They can mess with your rating and take
your money away from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a serious consideration for a lot
of people Collins not in that boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not in that boat You know,
it's like we're beyond those points where
[SPEAKER_02]: we are with it But there was a point where
it would have affected me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like I have to be careful
You know, it's like we all have to be
[SPEAKER_02]: aware of what the laws are around us Not
not expose ourselves to any kind of risk
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're not a hundred percent sure Don't
expose yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe we have enough legal people
around us now civilian legal people and
[SPEAKER_02]: veteran lawyers that to get advice From
where it isn't going to cost you 250 or a
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand dollars an hour to find out if
it's safe for you Talk to somebody in your
[SPEAKER_02]: state.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of the other things we need to
start be working on I believe as a group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so this is these are things that I
think on a broader national level that we
[SPEAKER_02]: need to be because California again,
we're all West Coast ma'am.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're living this bubble out here You
know, we 20 whatever 24 years of medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis now since 96, you know It's just
there's so much Has changed in where we've
[SPEAKER_02]: been in this things for so long where our
doctors are to our way more lenient in the
[SPEAKER_02]: north I don't know about the southern half
of the state, but you get north San
[SPEAKER_02]: Francisco and coming up Cannabis is a way
of life up in the northern half of the
[SPEAKER_02]: state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean it's just how it is is like I
believe all our doctors are understanding
[SPEAKER_02]: of it may be not completely Receptive to
it, but at least sympathetic of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah in I know Collins experience with
with LA and stuff is again a different
[SPEAKER_02]: course Of the state and just a different
mindset of the doctors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to go down to what each
individual doctor is within your VA best
[SPEAKER_02]: advice Don't say anything about your
cannabis use until you're a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: percent sure you can you know Unless you
live in a community like where I live out
[SPEAKER_02]: or you let you know your doctors are a
hundred percent Pro cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to put it in your
records because you put it in your records
[SPEAKER_02]: You're screwed right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it boils down to we got to get
Mitch McConnell to either out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: office or change his mindset and get this
bill Change on schedule one the schedule
[SPEAKER_02]: one that is that's no medical value is
bullshit and we all know it's bullshit and
[SPEAKER_02]: we need our medical professionals or
scientists our Legislators and again if
[SPEAKER_02]: they aren't pro cannabis then vote them
out and put somebody in who is pro
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis because this is again I hate to
be this way, but this is about control and
[SPEAKER_02]: greed and corruption and that is the truth
of the matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a it's everything, you know keeping
keeping the masses under control
[SPEAKER_02]: incarcerating It all ties into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many how many lot how many nonviolent
first offenders are in federal prison over
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like it's just freaking
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's people that instill the was that
the last last prisoner project that is
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve D'Angelo's project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it that what that one is right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ridiculous over joints, you know,
it's like 25 years for a frickin joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you out of your fucking mind?
[SPEAKER_02]: What the wrong is this country?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does he you know, how do we do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like I'm getting on kind of
off point here a little bit, but this
[SPEAKER_02]: really is what it boils down to is we have
to vote with our conscience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to even if you don't tell people
you smoke weed and you use that plant you
[SPEAKER_02]: need to talk to your politicians and vote
for those people who are that way and if
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not don't vote for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like here the Trinity
County Sheriff last year mom and pops with
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 to 40 $50,000 worth of paid permits
with their papers in their hands having
[SPEAKER_02]: federal agents kick their gates in and go
we don't care what your damn paper say
[SPEAKER_02]: we're here to knock your plants down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's bullshit, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's an elected official.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an elected sheriff at Trinity
County vote that son of a bitch out and
[SPEAKER_02]: put somebody into his pro cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it works here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our county our County Sheriff is 100%
behind mom and pops 100% behind what we do
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't accept the funds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't allow it to happen here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a long time coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, been hanging cuffs been pepper
sprayed before wasn't that way 20 years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago, you know when the laws first changed
in the early in the late 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there we're talking about kind of
elected officials and voting them in and
[SPEAKER_03]: out like a I'm going to take the concrete
example of the West LA VA where it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: elected doctors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not elected administrators Colin
would it be possible to create you know if
[SPEAKER_03]: veterans in different municipalities
created lists like could we create lists
[SPEAKER_03]: of the doctors who are kind of on staff at
the VA's and then have some sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: constant trying to outreach to them and
invite them to local events and see if
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll you know because it just takes one
domino to be like I'll come to that event
[SPEAKER_03]: and like meet and listen and talk about
medical and cannabis and I'm a VA doctor
[SPEAKER_03]: and then he goes back and tells like one
of the other VA doctors at West LA like I
[SPEAKER_03]: was at this thing and it was actually
pretty interesting and you know you're
[SPEAKER_03]: just moving mindsets a little bit at a
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah we try and that's you know exactly
what we strive to do at Veterans Walk and
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk with no nonprofit flag with no
business license so that we can just
[SPEAKER_05]: subvert from the inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't go to a VA in Southern
California or Oklahoma and not find
[SPEAKER_05]: Veterans Walk and Talk literature we drop
it off routinely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have people who do it for me but the
fact of the matter is like what Doc said
[SPEAKER_05]: is that as long as veterans are too afraid
to talk to their medical professionals
[SPEAKER_05]: about cannabis there are going to be no
chances for medical professionals to leave
[SPEAKER_05]: the grounds to learn about cannabis
because their jobs are at stake as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flip side to that is UCLA I know First
Act has partnered with the West LA VA to
[SPEAKER_05]: do more research on cannabis they have the
Kana Club at USC and UCLA.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have personally been to UCLA run
operations several of them cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: operations and I can tell you I can tell
you wholeheartedly that they're lacking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been one of them was was up to par
the other one is just embarrassing so but
[SPEAKER_05]: you're you're you're right on the money.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know the VA works based on results so
as long as they are showing some kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: result in a field that field will continue
to get funded which is why they make us
[SPEAKER_05]: interview for a bed and that we have to
actually qualify for because then our
[SPEAKER_05]: position is more likely to fruit them a
positive positive outcome and therefore
[SPEAKER_05]: they will get more funding.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah it's it's from the top up that's
where it has to be when you have like I
[SPEAKER_05]: said again people like Shulkin writing
books entire books about how they tried to
[SPEAKER_05]: change the VA and couldn't do it from the
top down.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that a subversive movement has to
has to take part and with Mitch McConnell
[SPEAKER_05]: and the more act and all that stuff the VA
the VA it's all all lumped into the same
[SPEAKER_05]: thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact of the matter is that Americans
are incapable of admitting that we got
[SPEAKER_05]: something wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: To the point where they are terrified of
having to admit that these people were
[SPEAKER_05]: behind bars for the wrong reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are terrified of having to pay
reparations to these people once they are
[SPEAKER_05]: out.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are terrified of generational
conflict that they will have to face
[SPEAKER_05]: because of families uprooted over single
plants single joints quarter ounces of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are mistakes that America made their
mistakes that they did to their own
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are mistakes that they need to be
accounted for just like they were
[SPEAKER_05]: accounted for Vietnam and they accounted
for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to account for Afghanistan and
the fact that they keep us there just to
[SPEAKER_05]: make money.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are all top down issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: And until we vote the people out who are
afraid to admit that they've made mistakes
[SPEAKER_05]: the mistakes will continue to happen
because there is no accountability.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's OK for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's OK for us to say the VA needs to be
reworked.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's even OK especially from a combat
infantry veteran who killed people for
[SPEAKER_05]: this country.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's OK for us to say that the
Constitution needs to be rewritten.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing wrong with looking into
our roots and finding what worked and
[SPEAKER_05]: finding what didn't and taking it and
making it better.
[SPEAKER_05]: America is scared to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So our health institutions particularly
the VA they're terrified to empower
[SPEAKER_05]: veterans in a health and wellness manner
because they know for every veteran
[SPEAKER_05]: empowered every veteran healed they are
butterfly affecting 10 more.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's all.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: My mushrooms my mushrooms kicked in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just like yeah baby let's talk
about the VA.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're wondering what guy mushrooms
looks like it's like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: No it's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what we're doing here is kind of
part of what we're talking about which is
[SPEAKER_03]: we can you know this conversation will
reach veterans who will be impacted by
[SPEAKER_03]: seat watching this conversation and then
we'll also reach bureaucrats and decision
[SPEAKER_03]: makers who will be impacted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to put you know more and more
pressure on that front and be really
[SPEAKER_03]: tactical and as good here like for example
it's interesting that you hand out
[SPEAKER_03]: literature like do you notice that
administrators are coming and like
[SPEAKER_03]: throwing the pamphlets out or are they
like has there been a transition where
[SPEAKER_03]: they're allowing it and they're cool with
it and they're actually happy you're doing
[SPEAKER_03]: it versus like three years ago when maybe
they threw it out as soon as they saw it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah but it's all hush hush still even
even even now I mean I have to take the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis leaves off my logos to do this
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every now and then like Oklahoma to be
honest as as progressive as as we want to
[SPEAKER_05]: pretend we are in California and as far as
cannabis goes Oklahoma is doing a great
[SPEAKER_05]: job of shepherding the best in the country
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so in Oklahoma they have no problem at
the VA putting my logo up and literature
[SPEAKER_05]: up.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not been an issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: But here in West L.A.
[SPEAKER_05]: because cannabis use is still it's still a
dis disqualifying factor to get mental
[SPEAKER_05]: health treatment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they won't you know they they don't
want to think they call it like you know
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to clean yourself completely
before we will let you get here which is
[SPEAKER_05]: just absolutely impossible for most people
and is also why most people in the rehab
[SPEAKER_05]: centers at the VA look like me and are
white guys who they think will do well and
[SPEAKER_05]: are they're not actually giving the help
to the people who actually need it because
[SPEAKER_05]: of drug use and racism.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's all we could do two hours on
that as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw veterans I saw them die at the VA in
my arms that my brothers who I didn't
[SPEAKER_05]: fight with they were Vietnam vets older
African-American gentlemen died on the
[SPEAKER_05]: steps of the fucking the home that I lived
in because they weren't allowed access.
[SPEAKER_05]: We would trace their body.
[SPEAKER_05]: We would put flowers out there for them
because we had no we didn't they were
[SPEAKER_05]: there one day and they were gone the next
just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what's wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Colin you say we have to own our
mistakes and we don't do it as a country
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's a part of what we're in this mess
that we're in right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently it breaks my fucking heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it breaks all of our hearts
collectively of what we see with our
[SPEAKER_02]: brothers and sisters.
[SPEAKER_02]: That have you know signed a blank check at
some point in their lives saying up and to
[SPEAKER_02]: and including my life I'll do whatever it
takes to defend our country and we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: honor what it's supposed to be and that's
not this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not supposed to be on the streets.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not supposed to not have access.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I'm a big believer of how we
treat the least amongst us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that's my my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how my God looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know and that's how I approach this
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: With with who I've tried to be around you
know and who I try to share with it and I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't quite honestly understand it until
the last couple of years at the outpouring
[SPEAKER_02]: of the lack of access to what I do and
what brothers and sisters that I have in
[SPEAKER_02]: my community here this small little bubble
just utopian cannabis bubble that we live
[SPEAKER_02]: in here in the triangle that you know it's
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get it beyond them being scared
and afraid that they're going to have to
[SPEAKER_02]: have it taken away from them which is
their ultimate fear.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it's my ultimate fear is to have
what I've worked my life on taken away and
[SPEAKER_02]: some I'd rather be at a corporate cannabis
company than freaking Monsanto or Dow
[SPEAKER_02]: Chemical or Budweiser Anheuser Bush you
know it's going to jump in as soon as the
[SPEAKER_02]: federal thing changes they're all going to
jump in.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so many veterans still like Joanne I
was just going to throw it to you because
[SPEAKER_05]: we talked about this last time I saw you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't use we still receive medicine from
the VA in order to just keep them off your
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking backs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a it's a it's a weird time right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know this is a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized you know I realized that
earlier this year because people were
[SPEAKER_02]: asking questions about what the rules were
for like I'm I'm getting realize it but
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the guy they're getting references for
for the city of Arcata for the edible
[SPEAKER_02]: edibles guidelines of what milligram
dosages are they're asking me you know and
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like there is somebody smarter than
me you know that whole thing and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: like well you know you've been I was like
all right this is what I recommend and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: again very conservative because I believe
personally as a caregiver because that's
[SPEAKER_02]: my primary focus for the last 23 years as
a caregiver of this of the sacred plant is
[SPEAKER_02]: to always under prescribe so the
experience is an uplifting and enjoyable
[SPEAKER_02]: one and they can always add more but it's
hard to take this away if you over well
[SPEAKER_02]: said.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then they were asking the right person
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they said.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know you start smaller if you go all
the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah then you get consensus was that
Joanne that's really is the consensus on
[SPEAKER_02]: that really is it you know we can add more
you know and that really because I have
[SPEAKER_02]: friends like oh man two and a half
milligrams that ain't shit you know I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like I get that isn't shit but someone
that's never ever ever ever ever ate this
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two and a half milligrams of a certain
kind of compound in this plant could be
[SPEAKER_02]: almost too much for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the old school was you know my friends
because I've shepherded a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: into the into the plant over the decades
my friends that would be around us that
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't partake you know I dear sister I
love her very much you know like family is
[SPEAKER_02]: like very important to me is like giving
her you know everybody all my buddies you
[SPEAKER_02]: know and their friends and even the wives
that we're doing you know a whole frickin
[SPEAKER_02]: brownie.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know everybody can I have a brownie I
say you know break it in half and me again
[SPEAKER_02]: one more time here I'm going to break it
in a quarter here you start with this and
[SPEAKER_02]: come back to me in an hour and if you stop
then if you want more I'll give you more
[SPEAKER_02]: and of course an hour later can I have
more I was like of course you know but I
[SPEAKER_02]: want to make sure that you're okay and
comfortable with the transition from being
[SPEAKER_02]: where you are awake if people don't
realize how special and how clearing this
[SPEAKER_02]: plant is to your mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do as damaged again we as veterans
because we're all damaged on some level
[SPEAKER_02]: when we when we do embrace this plant at
least how I perceive it is there's this
[SPEAKER_02]: clearing which you get it from it Joanne
calling what you get from it that now that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're dialing in that you don't want THC
heavy plants man that you know you can
[SPEAKER_02]: find for now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just for now I was just saying just for
now I will definitely get back to THC at
[SPEAKER_05]: some point but I just know I need a break.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly and one again here's what Tam does
specifically again why we're partnering
[SPEAKER_02]: together is he's been embracing non-high
THC strains for let me rephrase that he's
[SPEAKER_02]: been embracing full spectrum correct
heritage craft balanced strains the way
[SPEAKER_02]: Mother Nature intended them to be that's
what I see where we create this market or
[SPEAKER_02]: this niche or this veterans community
awareness that we have of this is how we
[SPEAKER_02]: approach this with our with our fellow
brothers and sisters in arms man that's
[SPEAKER_02]: like you know we don't care if you want to
sit on the couch and rip bong hits all
[SPEAKER_02]: afternoon and not get off the couch that's
your prerogative but we're going to show
[SPEAKER_02]: you how to do this conservatively and
correctly the first time until you get
[SPEAKER_02]: your feet on the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like anything you do the first time
you know it's like you reference tequila
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a tequila guy but I know there's a
full thing of that kind of a run you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it's like and as Colin is
reaching out into now like psilocybin and
[SPEAKER_02]: other things that are out there you know
like freaking peyote which is one of my
[SPEAKER_02]: personal favorites you know it's like and
I did do a lot of mushrooms and eat a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of LSD back in the late 70s and early 80s
one you know trying to process all I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't get that you know I didn't get that
that's what we were doing that we were
[SPEAKER_02]: decompressing back then when I was a young
man in my 20s you know I didn't get that
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what we were doing that we were
trying to cast off all this Colin
[SPEAKER_02]: reference cast off all this shit we just
got finished done in the previous 72 hours
[SPEAKER_02]: to get that fucking off of us you know and
it doesn't get off of you at all you know
[SPEAKER_02]: it follows you through your life how we
process it now what I'm realizing I
[SPEAKER_02]: thought my self-isolation was my sanity I
believe the plant is my sanity now and
[SPEAKER_02]: teaching people that you don't have to
self-isolate that you can grasp this plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and it can be a lifeline to you maybe it's
not maybe it's not but at least venture
[SPEAKER_02]: out beyond opioids and alcohol and
self-seclusion and embrace veterans walk
[SPEAKER_02]: and talk and get around other brothers
since it did this old man that hadn't been
[SPEAKER_02]: around other brothers and sisters in arms
for years and years and years two years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago for that redheaded son of mine's
birthday to come down and embrace him two
[SPEAKER_05]: years ago and he hasn't stopped talking
since just been out there just talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about cannabis left and right you can't
get away from doc now it's too important
[SPEAKER_02]: Colin I know I know I'm joking it breaks
my heart brother it breaks my heart man it
[SPEAKER_02]: really does it kills me to think that and
I got it how I understood it is I realized
[SPEAKER_02]: it what Joanne you led to it too it's like
you can't people don't have access you
[SPEAKER_02]: know it's like and I've been literally in
tears the 22 a day now they're saying 17
[SPEAKER_02]: brothers and sisters a day 22 a day
whatever the figure is one too many yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly yeah I got I got this plant
running out my flipping ears and we can't
[SPEAKER_02]: get this out to people why can't this not
happen why can this not happen and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: making it happen I hope I hope we are I
hope that's I I want to touch on one last
[SPEAKER_03]: topic and it's kind of you know there's so
much division in society right now and
[SPEAKER_03]: people who get really upset about certain
things and I kind of I want to point out
[SPEAKER_03]: some commonalities and kind of bridging
communities and you know doc you said I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna bring up two docs doc Ray who
earlier in this conversation talked about
[SPEAKER_03]: when you kind of realize that you know the
military and the country doesn't care
[SPEAKER_03]: about you who served it and Doc Rivers who
said a couple days ago you know we keep
[SPEAKER_03]: loving this country and this country
doesn't love us back there's huge
[SPEAKER_03]: commonality there and I think people who
get upset about you know black lives
[SPEAKER_03]: matter and say all lives matter I think
any black person would say of course we
[SPEAKER_03]: just hope you realize our lives matter as
much not even more than but as much as
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody else's that seems like a simple
ask and just the concept of fairness and
[SPEAKER_03]: society and you know you're all military
veterans do any of you get offended when a
[SPEAKER_03]: pro football player takes a knee at a
stadium to try to raise awareness for just
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of unfairness and society as a slap
in the face to military veterans like you
[SPEAKER_01]: Joanne I want to hear from Joanne on this
one well I mean from a veteran US military
[SPEAKER_01]: veteran perspective no because that is the
reason why we serve Colin and I were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about it yesterday we cannot go
out to foreign lands claiming that we are
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting for the freedom of our people and
come back here and deny the freedom that
[SPEAKER_01]: is ridiculous obviously freedom of speech
freedom of being a person having your own
[SPEAKER_01]: beliefs we claim that we accept everyone
here for their values obviously we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: when we think that number one I I'm sick
and tired of people using veterans as a
[SPEAKER_01]: pawn to justify their beliefs or whatever
they think number one we are just a
[SPEAKER_01]: diversified group of people and have
different opinions and some may agree with
[SPEAKER_01]: that and some may disagree with that so
you can just lump us all in one group
[SPEAKER_01]: because it doesn't work like that yes we
do join the military we have that in
[SPEAKER_01]: common and we fight alongside each other
despite our differences despite our
[SPEAKER_01]: mindset despite what we look like and make
shit happen do good things do bad things
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever the case may be but in there
we're all doing that and even in the
[SPEAKER_01]: military you know there are people that
are racist and still have to work
[SPEAKER_01]: alongside a black person and get the job
done and you know same situation but
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately no I'm not offended I think
that is exactly why I went to war twice
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that for people to be able to do
that here so no to answer the question it
[SPEAKER_01]: does not offend me I think it's the way it
should be so you know they're not it's
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody that's not breaking a law or
hurting anybody but actually standing up
[SPEAKER_01]: for something they believe and something
that does need to be addressed obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the circumstances wherein so if
that wasn't predicting that hey putting a
[SPEAKER_01]: shedding light on a situation in America
that it's you know it's about time we get
[SPEAKER_01]: over that hump clearly so not at all I
think it was necessary and I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: still necessary for people to stand up for
what they believe in or what or you know
[SPEAKER_01]: for stuff that's violating human rights
rights in America so no proud as hell you
[SPEAKER_03]: know so I want to hear from the three
white males in this conversation who all
[SPEAKER_03]: served our country your thoughts on
someone taking a knee to try to raise
[SPEAKER_03]: awareness for social justice are you
offended because people watching this are
[SPEAKER_03]: white males who think it's horrific and
not patriotic so talk to those people I
[SPEAKER_05]: mean I'm I'm happy to talk about this I am
NOT offended they think that it is thank
[SPEAKER_05]: you for unmuting my mic I think that is
heroic I think that it is something to be
[SPEAKER_05]: revered in this country when you stand up
to something that is wrong that should be
[SPEAKER_05]: celebrated I am reading a book right now
that has got my absolute mind it's called
[SPEAKER_05]: how fascism works and I can't recommend it
enough it is very informative and what
[SPEAKER_05]: this lays out and what has happened
throughout history is this mythic past of
[SPEAKER_05]: patriotism that everyone holds on to and
this patriarchal society that everything
[SPEAKER_05]: is war is good if you go to war be proud
about it no matter what you did no matter
[SPEAKER_05]: if you did bad things don't talk about
those things only talk about the good
[SPEAKER_05]: things your beautiful wife at home should
be proud to be making kids and be taking
[SPEAKER_05]: care of them those kids while you're off
fighting this war that nobody seriously
[SPEAKER_05]: really even understands and what it goes
back to for me is admitting mistakes
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's okay to make mistakes that's
what life is to be human is to err is to
[SPEAKER_05]: be human right Shakespeare so making
mistakes is okay but admitting them is
[SPEAKER_05]: just where we get off and we won't admit
our mistakes and so we've built up this
[SPEAKER_05]: mythic past of America is being this great
land of opportunity the heartland the
[SPEAKER_05]: heartland the heartland the people that
feed us the farmers the people they should
[SPEAKER_05]: be revered their opinions everything it
should be preserved pride should be
[SPEAKER_05]: preserved that is all systematic racism
and if you don't admit that you are
[SPEAKER_05]: fooling yourself the fact of the matter is
people like Colin Kaepernick taking a knee
[SPEAKER_05]: takes more bravery than a lot of people
understand that is not easy it is it is it
[SPEAKER_05]: is almost impossible in this day and age
and look at the look at what it's caused
[SPEAKER_05]: it's one man one man and look at what it's
caused for good or bad people are still
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about it and that's what's
important for me I see you cannot get you
[SPEAKER_05]: can't I can't have a conversation with
people who start off by saying this this
[SPEAKER_05]: country isn't racist this country was
built on racism this country sends people
[SPEAKER_05]: to war based on racism all I don't can't
speak for everybody here but for me I came
[SPEAKER_05]: to the army at my absolute lowest point I
had no other alternative that's such a
[SPEAKER_05]: common story why is that the case why are
why are most downtrodden and hurt people
[SPEAKER_05]: why are the people who are impoverished in
this country the ones serving it the most
[SPEAKER_05]: these are all things that need to change
and until we admit it it won't so
[SPEAKER_05]: absolutely I don't right now I am having a
baby in November or I would be on every
[SPEAKER_05]: front line of these protests every single
one and I can't everybody out there
[SPEAKER_05]: protesting don't stop but you have been
though so we've been that's true we have
[SPEAKER_05]: and I would I'd be there out there every I
want to I mean like I I feel this call to
[SPEAKER_05]: action now but it's almost too like it's
too great like it's like I want something
[SPEAKER_05]: to put my hands on just like I can get and
grasp you know like if racism was right in
[SPEAKER_05]: front of me I could just choke it until it
was gone but it doesn't work like that
[SPEAKER_05]: which is why these books are if you don't
understand like the level of effort that
[SPEAKER_05]: goes into dividing us it is crazy and
cannabis is the great unifier back around
[SPEAKER_02]: brought it back around to that shirt I
love that this isn't about taking away
[SPEAKER_04]: from somebody or a group or a class of
people this is about raising everybody up
[SPEAKER_04]: this is about looking all of our brothers
and sisters in the eye and having that
[SPEAKER_04]: contact and that love and if you listen to
the people that are spewing the hate
[SPEAKER_04]: they're angry at people who they've never
met on the word of somebody that is a
[SPEAKER_04]: known liar or is out there to misrepresent
I've been very blessed to be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: travel all over the world and every place
I've been I haven't been to shit whole
[SPEAKER_04]: countries I've met beautiful people
everywhere I've been and I can't tell you
[SPEAKER_04]: how I think I think travel will solve a
lot of that but the powers that be are
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to divide us so we don't unite and
we just need to look at each other and and
[SPEAKER_04]: listen this is my time right now to listen
to people and hear what's happening and
[SPEAKER_04]: see is I'm at that weird transition where
I still think I'm 18 but yeah I think I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: about to get an AARP letter but everybody
keeps talking about our kids how they're
[SPEAKER_04]: lazy they're shiftless they just do play
video games no we need to listen to them
[SPEAKER_04]: we need to be mentors we need to support
them we need to show them that there's
[SPEAKER_04]: more community than anger and vitriol we
need to show the younger kids that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: okay to listen and to love another person
that you disagree with and I'm hoping you
[SPEAKER_04]: need great trauma to heal and I think
we're gonna have to rip the band-aid off
[SPEAKER_04]: rip the scab off re-break the bone and let
it heal properly add a little cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: bomb in it it'll fix it well said and
that's all about admitting that we were
[SPEAKER_05]: wrong let's just admit we were wrong about
so many things I mean we were not even
[SPEAKER_05]: like we're talking about this Joanne
yesterday in our podcast like growing up
[SPEAKER_05]: as a American man learning an education
system schools where I was taught
[SPEAKER_05]: segregation like not about it I was taught
that it's how you should live it clicks
[SPEAKER_05]: our word for segregation you know you're
these things are taught to us in our
[SPEAKER_05]: institutions that we're supposed to trust
with there's so many America is a
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful beautiful country it has
potential it's also was the first of its
[SPEAKER_05]: kind and in many ways and an experiment
that is just over 200 years old so it's
[SPEAKER_05]: okay to admit we made mistakes we're that
young I mean we barely know what we're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing can we just admit that and then move
forward like you said let it scab over put
[SPEAKER_05]: some CBD bomb on it and move forward
period period so that for me that the
[SPEAKER_03]: contrast is and that for me was really
important because I you know there are a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of impressionable people who watch
this and I want them to hear from real
[SPEAKER_03]: veterans that you're not offended and and
then the people who are offended didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: serve in the military so I'm like about
the people that use the military as a pond
[SPEAKER_01]: like us to mask their agenda and lumping
us all in one category as if we all think
[SPEAKER_03]: collectively as one thing so for me the
most egregious thing was discovering that
[SPEAKER_03]: the NFL had their you know pay-to-play
patriotism where they were collecting
[SPEAKER_03]: money from the armed services for all the
dramatic you know national anthem like
[SPEAKER_03]: military jets flying overhead
[SPEAKER_03]: the Atlanta Falcons and so so it's
interesting to see what people get upset
[SPEAKER_02]: about and then you said it though Peter
you said but you said again in calling you
[SPEAKER_02]: alluded to it too is that false patriotism
the ones that are the ones that are upset
[SPEAKER_02]: there are veterans you know again
generationally because I'm hearing it from
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys generation with me man I give a
damn what color you were okay quite
[SPEAKER_02]: honestly my teammate was black I love him
so much you know we were partners you know
[SPEAKER_02]: we were intertwined at the hips man we
depended on each other you know and I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't care man it's just the bottom line
of it you know it's like and it breaks my
[SPEAKER_02]: heart because I raised my children to be
colorblind also and it just really breaks
[SPEAKER_02]: my freaking heart because I personally had
thought this was something we had worked
[SPEAKER_02]: through and what I realized is we haven't
worked through shit in over a half a
[SPEAKER_02]: century and I grew up in that time period
in the 60s and saw this saw a lot of this
[SPEAKER_02]: turmoil and unrest and it and the thing
that kills me and I'm sick and tired of it
[SPEAKER_02]: and maybe as a veteran community we
address it these posers man these things
[SPEAKER_02]: that show up with that their indignance
with their flags and their body armor and
[SPEAKER_02]: all their crap trying to say that they
represent us and they don't represent us
[SPEAKER_02]: you know how do we come in and play a part
in this thing but I do know this part of
[SPEAKER_02]: it there is that that part of it that I
just it's like I don't see it cam saying
[SPEAKER_02]: he doesn't see it Colin saying he doesn't
see it Joanne saying she doesn't see it
[SPEAKER_02]: we're generationally we're talking 44
decades of freaking military covering it
[SPEAKER_02]: all and we as a community don't
necessarily embrace it I'm not saying that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's not that fringe that does see it
but we have worked integrated for freaking
[SPEAKER_02]: decades and we as a team approach things
as a team we don't see black and white we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't see yellow and brown we see green or
we see blue or we see OD and that's how we
[SPEAKER_02]: function and we all depended on each other
to keep each other alive so when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: coming out this false patriotism thing at
the football football games and all that
[SPEAKER_02]: nonsense it's like it's just a bunch of
nonsense man and I don't know you helping
[SPEAKER_02]: voice the veteran community us getting out
it's like the true ones of us that have
[SPEAKER_02]: paid signed the blank check the ones that
has really signed that piece of paper and
[SPEAKER_02]: did the time we're not the ones that are
up in arms about this thing man it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: ones that aren't really part of it it's
ones that aren't part of our veteran
[SPEAKER_02]: community the the distractors the
naysayers whatever you want to call them
[SPEAKER_02]: and the instigators whoever they are they
think they're trying to personal gain on
[SPEAKER_02]: something that isn't and Joanne said you
know trying to get what they want off of
[SPEAKER_02]: our blood sweat and tears and our back
span it's like that's part I don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: we as a community well again we as a
community don't get addressed 99% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: time why because only 3% of us on the
whole freaking country ever served this
[SPEAKER_02]: country and then it's even more integrated
when you get into families that are
[SPEAKER_02]: military families like me I have four
grown children and all four of them have
[SPEAKER_02]: served okay I have three that are active
right now okay this is part of again we
[SPEAKER_02]: are a military community I have a baby
brother that is a Marine Corps my old man
[SPEAKER_02]: was in the Air Force we are a military
family okay that sways that 3% by a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: when it's one or two families where their
whole family served you know and as we see
[SPEAKER_02]: we've seen generationally since Vietnam
people that come from underprivileged
[SPEAKER_02]: backgrounds find it as a way out to get
out and get where they want to go that
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have a slot at an Ivy League college
you know I was a military family we worked
[SPEAKER_02]: poor we worked hard you know we weren't no
silver spoons here that whole thing is
[SPEAKER_02]: like we the military was a way to get away
from it you know get you to where you
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to go what happened with me
generationally I shifted I instilled it in
[SPEAKER_02]: my kids because I knew they were going to
do it instilled it in them to get what
[SPEAKER_02]: they wanted out of it they all selected
careers within the branches that they
[SPEAKER_02]: thought would best serve them after the
fact okay and I'm off topic on this thing
[SPEAKER_02]: but to assume that we as a veteran
community get offended because someone
[SPEAKER_02]: takes a knee during a sportings event for
crying out loud it's a freaking game
[SPEAKER_03]: that's what I've always laughed at is how
did sports events become these patriotic
[SPEAKER_03]: you know like national anthem at the
beginning of every professional and
[SPEAKER_05]: college sports game it's because the
Department of Defense has an entertainment
[SPEAKER_05]: budget period as long as the Department of
Defense has an entertainment budget and a
[SPEAKER_05]: recruiting budget there you're going to
get false patriotism the fact of the
[SPEAKER_05]: matter is the Department of Defense pays
the NFL in order to put flags out and put
[SPEAKER_05]: guys who look revered and do all that
stuff so that they're recruiting numbers
[SPEAKER_05]: in the worst parts of our country will be
both beefed up because football and people
[SPEAKER_05]: of color and all these things are severely
affected by so much of the poverty and so
[SPEAKER_05]: much of the systematic racism at the top
of our country right now whether you're
[SPEAKER_05]: not you want to put out everything else
that that that man as our president has
[SPEAKER_05]: done that man wouldn't last two seconds on
a line two seconds now for me that means a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot put that man on an aircraft carrier
and watch him watch what happens if he's
[SPEAKER_05]: blown by a fucking aircraft jet see what
happens to that man I'm pretty sure he's
[SPEAKER_05]: not gonna get back and go to work like I
did and he's gonna be milking that forever
[SPEAKER_05]: and here's the thing with that is like I
joined the infantry in 2007 late 2007 2008
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to go through rigorous psychological
and psych psychiatric psychiatric testing
[SPEAKER_05]: before I was able to join I had to take an
IQ score I had to take the ASVAB I had to
[SPEAKER_05]: because I admitted to using cannabis I
joined the military at 26 years old
[SPEAKER_05]: because I admitted to using cannabis more
than 50 times before prior to joining I
[SPEAKER_05]: was made to see a psychiatrist these are
all things I had to go through in order to
[SPEAKER_05]: go to war and be in a lethal instrument of
this country why is it that anyone with
[SPEAKER_05]: the money to put their name out there can
climb to the very top of that pillar and
[SPEAKER_05]: be in charge of everyone that is so
backwards and wrong in so many ways again
[SPEAKER_05]: we just have to come to an understanding
that some things we've tried have not
[SPEAKER_02]: worked and I think we will grow from there
hopefully so hopefully we'll see that and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not speaking for everybody but I hope
that we see a ship that we haven't seen
[SPEAKER_02]: quite honestly I'm gonna go back a little
bit for some of you guys when Clarence
[SPEAKER_02]: Thomas was going on to the Supreme Court
in Anita Hill we've seen this swell of
[SPEAKER_02]: females and people of color and
unrepresented move into the political
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum that wasn't there previously then
that was 91 it's like that's how far back
[SPEAKER_02]: this goes since the last time we've seen
this kind of grassroots movement within
[SPEAKER_02]: our politics and I'm so thankful to see so
many women coming quite honestly it pisses
[SPEAKER_02]: me off being a crotchety old white guy to
get looped in with all these other
[SPEAKER_02]: jackasses that are crotchety old white
guys because I am not one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: motherfuckers no I'll tell you something
we are all aware that not everybody is
[SPEAKER_02]: like that I'm thankful for it sister
because I don't I'm thankful for that not
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody is like that and quite frankly
even in the military where I experience
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals who came from a background
where perhaps growing up the only
[SPEAKER_01]: perception of a black person they had was
what they saw on TV and then coming into
[SPEAKER_01]: contact and seeing like whoa and admitting
like I was completely like I never thought
[SPEAKER_01]: a black person would be able to do this or
act a certain way or so even in that
[SPEAKER_01]: happened in the military and quite frankly
witnessing that gave me number one even
[SPEAKER_01]: more greater understanding of the fabric
of America and the limited exposure that
[SPEAKER_01]: people have and at the same time people
can come to to their senses once you know
[SPEAKER_01]: coming like you said I think it was Kim
that said earlier traveling just
[SPEAKER_01]: completely changes your your perspective
because exposure matters and also even on
[SPEAKER_01]: TV like representation matters so if you
have this race portrayed as a way on TV
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's the only access that these
people have to view in that clearly it
[SPEAKER_01]: creates some systemic issues in the fabric
of America and I think the fact that all
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff is arising and we are all even
no matter which spectrum which side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum you end up as far as your beliefs
we all know there's a fucking problem and
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that we're all actively working
towards making the necessary corrections
[SPEAKER_01]: we all know there there's a problem at
what's created like Colin said we can't
[SPEAKER_01]: put an actual face to it so we can punch
it but you know we just got to continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: move forward we have to continue to admit
that there's a problem awareness and then
[SPEAKER_01]: what can we do personally how far can we
reach the cause and impact and a change
[SPEAKER_01]: and the fact you know that we have these
conversations Colin and I get together
[SPEAKER_01]: weekly and have discussions that we know
are not being had so if we have the eyes
[SPEAKER_01]: on ourselves we should go ahead and
discuss them and right now because we are
[SPEAKER_01]: most of us are just enclosed not everybody
we we're not so caught up in in life now
[SPEAKER_01]: we're home with this whole coronavirus
shit it has literally it's had us glued to
[SPEAKER_01]: a box for the most part whether it's your
small screen or the bigger one and now we
[SPEAKER_01]: have we can't turn away so now you know we
all have to actually do something which
[SPEAKER_01]: honestly guys it excites me you know that
the fact like okay so now you really don't
[SPEAKER_01]: got much going on what are you gonna do to
make the change because now you know that
[SPEAKER_01]: something has something has to change and
I'm super proud of at least a circle
[SPEAKER_01]: around me and obviously by extension with
you guys that we are all towards elevating
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody elevating you know we are aware
that a group of people black people we've
[SPEAKER_01]: not been elevated by this country so it's
about time that we equal the playing field
[SPEAKER_01]: and we are human too and we've contributed
as a collective to a lot just as much if
[SPEAKER_01]: not you know speaking from from my culture
we've we've contributed more than enough
[SPEAKER_05]: to have a seat at the table and that's a
man sister honestly because cannabis can't
[SPEAKER_05]: bringing it full circle Joanne cannabis as
you've said as we have talked about is a
[SPEAKER_05]: matriarchal industry it is and a plant
that we smoke is a female plant it is a
[SPEAKER_05]: matriarchal community and America is as
you know father first as it gets so that
[SPEAKER_05]: threatens the fabric as you said of
America but it needs to be threatened and
[SPEAKER_05]: it needs to be sewed the the matriarchy
and the minority-led empowerment that
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis provides is one of the most
exciting things about being in this
[SPEAKER_01]: community yeah I think we can cannabis
definitely can be an industry that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: we can we can pioneer this movement
continue to show that we all can work
[SPEAKER_01]: together that you know through medicine to
through wellness we can create like
[SPEAKER_01]: cultural change from the root you know
from the seed if you really I I always
[SPEAKER_01]: like to take it back whether it's in
business as far as the industry goes or as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as medicine go like we are just
planting seeds whether it's education the
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific aspect of it the cultural
aspect of it the social aspect of it we're
[SPEAKER_01]: planting seeds in literally and
figuratively figuratively speaking and we
[SPEAKER_01]: just got to be patient and continue to do
the good work and the plants will sprout
[SPEAKER_01]: and eventually we will we will be costing
a radical change positive change for not
[SPEAKER_01]: only for America but global at a global
scale that's that's how much I do believe
[SPEAKER_01]: in not only what we're all doing here but
like the plant itself and where we can
[SPEAKER_01]: take this
[SPEAKER_04]: farming and agriculture and cultivation
monocropping and monoculture is never
[SPEAKER_04]: sustainable you need a bit of everything
you need a broad spectrum of everything
[SPEAKER_04]: flowers and vegetables and trees and
fruits and all kind of animals we can't
[SPEAKER_04]: have a monoculture in our culture as well
or our communities exactly that thank you
[SPEAKER_01]: for beautifully coming in there making it
come together so that's exactly what I
[SPEAKER_03]: meant well why don't we why don't we
that's a good mic drop moment why don't we
[SPEAKER_03]: end there and we can always regroup at a
later date we can get ready for part two
[SPEAKER_01]: whenever that may be I can't wait guys it
was such a pleasure there was an amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation totally guys are y'all as
well doing the work I I look forward to
[SPEAKER_01]: working together you know where there is
coming back and regrouping or just getting
[SPEAKER_01]: the word out there so thank you so much
thanks Colin we need to thank you because
[SPEAKER_04]: every all of this is happening at the same
time and I've had this is the third
[SPEAKER_04]: conversation like this I've had this week
the universe is putting us all in each
[SPEAKER_04]: other's paths and we're all asking the
same questions how do we get this
[SPEAKER_04]: knowledge out there how do we make it
change what can we do in my neighborhood
[SPEAKER_04]: in my family my town my state and we're
all here together and so let's keep this
[SPEAKER_04]: going between us two on how we can help
each other to move this forward as well
[SPEAKER_04]: because you know we have a good reach and
this is what it's going to take to get us
[SPEAKER_04]: to move forward is conversations like this
and you know we all each have a piece of
[SPEAKER_04]: this puzzle and so how are we going to all
put them together and how many more people
[SPEAKER_04]: are out there that have pieces that we've
