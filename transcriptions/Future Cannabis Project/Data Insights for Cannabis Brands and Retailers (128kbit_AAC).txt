[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so going back to somebody was
asking about trends earlier So of course
[SPEAKER_02]: as you see in every other state and
actually, you know, you would ask about us
[SPEAKER_02]: versus the rest of the states Well,
California versus the rest of the states
[SPEAKER_02]: incidentally even in when California was
only medical and in states that are only
[SPEAKER_02]: medical you're actually seeing Similar
trends and yes, there's slight variations
[SPEAKER_02]: Between the states but what it tells us is
the consumer the cannabis consumer
[SPEAKER_02]: ultimately state by state or
internationally Behaves more similarly
[SPEAKER_02]: than they do differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ultimately, what are the trends that
we're saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well So we're of course seeing we're
seeing flower decrease steadily and
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the beginning of 2017 in California
flower was roughly 53% All right,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you think the bottom will be that's a
great question pause that's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: question That's a great question,
let's get back to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually thought it to myself But
yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I think q4 and maybe November was the
first time that That flower dropped below
[SPEAKER_02]: 50% in California, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So shocking and then the major dramatic
drop that we saw was between December to
[SPEAKER_02]: January Where flower dropped about six
points, I think 49 to 43 percent or 48 42
[SPEAKER_02]: dropped it dropped significantly Right,
so great question so one of the main
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons so what what so I mean,
of course the launch of the adult use
[SPEAKER_02]: market and and and what that's telling you
right I mean with the with the launch of
[SPEAKER_02]: the adult use market and with that comes
regulations compliance taxes increase in
[SPEAKER_02]: price at retail, right and for heavy
flower consumers Medical consumers in the
[SPEAKER_02]: prop 215 world who are accustomed to
having bought their flower at a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: price point for the last Two three five
ten years.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're walking In a dispensary January
1st, and they're like, oh hell no I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing those prices right and so we did
see a lot of the You know you saw we all
[SPEAKER_02]: know that a lot of the medical users left
the legal market altogether because this
[SPEAKER_02]: is California and everybody knows how to
purchase cannabis not at a dispensary if
[SPEAKER_02]: you are so inclined but But so of course
you see flower drop out more significantly
[SPEAKER_02]: than other packaged Consumer or new
consumer oriented products edibles vapes
[SPEAKER_02]: topicals tinctures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the launch Of the adult use
market, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing the new adult use user come
in So my mom who I talked about earlier my
[SPEAKER_02]: chardonnay mom cousin with two kids write
a 40 year old female with two kids there
[SPEAKER_02]: another one on the way congratulations and
and Like any minute now actually and so so
[SPEAKER_02]: so this consumer right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not buying flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know what to do with flower,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're buying something more familiar to
them tinctures creams lotions You know
[SPEAKER_02]: blue chocolate covered blueberries,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean mints.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the types of tear exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are all you know Lower dose entry
level products, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was of course one of the major
reasons we saw flower lose significant
[SPEAKER_02]: share to these other product categories We
saw that happen now incidentally right
[SPEAKER_02]: where we would expect to see another
dramatic share share change right in
[SPEAKER_02]: categories We saw sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take a step back We saw flower
continue to lose share month over month No
[SPEAKER_02]: surprise with as the launch of the as the
adult use market continued to launch in
[SPEAKER_02]: the new adult use user Continued to come
into the dispensary What's interesting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was between June and July where we'd
expect to see the share of flower continue
[SPEAKER_02]: to drop We actually saw the share of
flower creep back up right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's think about that So July 1st,
what happened phase two testing right with
[SPEAKER_02]: phase two testing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know if you think about this,
yeah, I mean if you just you think about
[SPEAKER_02]: the supply chain, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean the flow, you know as you move down
this less very exactly of less We have
[SPEAKER_02]: less variables introduced that are likely
to cause about the products to pass to not
[SPEAKER_02]: pass testing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean flower is the rawest form of the
product In the supply chain the most
[SPEAKER_02]: likely to pass testing and so there was an
abundance of flower available on the
[SPEAKER_02]: market and a lot of the package products
were not succeeding Pass it making it
[SPEAKER_02]: through testing or in a timely enough
manner not ready enough July 1st and so
[SPEAKER_02]: Dispensaries were all picking up picking
up their phones calling their flower their
[SPEAKER_02]: major flower suppliers, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course these flower suppliers in
some instances the big guys they weren't
[SPEAKER_02]: able to double their orders for every
dispensary And so you saw tons of small
[SPEAKER_02]: boutique local flower brands pop into the
market in July with a hundred hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: fifty even a even a half a million dollars
in sales folks that weren't doing any
[SPEAKER_02]: volume before then because They could
Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say that you're seeing like
on the license side?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing a huge influx of new
brands?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing the same licenses being
used maybe?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you saying, you know,
really what we're seeing is trends we've
[SPEAKER_01]: seen in every state, you know Colorado's a
more mature market at this point and going
[SPEAKER_01]: back to your point I did want to make this
point so I Don't think it's just a pricing
[SPEAKER_01]: issue when it comes to flower and the drop
in flower I think it in general is the
[SPEAKER_01]: availability of products, you know once
rec sales kicked off in Colorado in 2014
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2016 we saw the same shift from flower
To vaping equipment and everything else
[SPEAKER_01]: like that and it's just because it's more
readily available more educated consumers
[SPEAKER_01]: They start to learn they go to their shop
the third fourth time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're more open to starting new
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean We've seen the same same thing
happen this year in Canada as well They
[SPEAKER_01]: went from flower being the top bottom now
on the license side and the trends that we
[SPEAKER_01]: see in California specifically Are several
I would say vertical integration is key to
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of these businesses being able to
Yeah, yeah being able to stack those
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses and control on the other side
with outdoor growing this is a big trend
[SPEAKER_01]: is stacking licenses and growing farms
bigger and bigger and Overall,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think on the on the cultivation side.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably two outdoor licenses to
one indoor license in this state the vast
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of licenses Colton on the
cultivation side are in Santa Barbara
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino and Humboldt County Santa
Barbara Santa Barbara is the One county
[SPEAKER_01]: with the most cultivation licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's somewhere around 800 of those 800
It's only a handful of businesses that
[SPEAKER_01]: that hold these licenses and they've
stacked these licenses Across the US it
[SPEAKER_01]: varies greatly because in states like
Vermont You're not gonna be growing
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor because you're only gonna have one
harvest a year, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So indoors big there on the East Coast we
see large-scale industrial indoor growing
[SPEAKER_01]: In California, I would say the vast
majority again It's probably two to one
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor compared to to indoor growing and
and really as far as indoor grows The vast
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of them are here in LA County
outside of LA County.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost You know, you can just assume
it's they're growing outdoor You asked a
[SPEAKER_02]: question earlier about where do I see
flower bottoming out and it's that's
[SPEAKER_02]: that's I mean I think the I think the
question there is more so on the supply
[SPEAKER_02]: side even because how crafty are suppliers
going to get with how they deliver and
[SPEAKER_02]: package flower products and and how an
effort into branding and telling the story
[SPEAKER_02]: of the humble grower and making the end
consumer care about The flower they're
[SPEAKER_02]: consuming right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the major question for me
on the flower side is is you know I think
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt is gonna actually be dry whether
or not Humboldt survives I think We'll
[SPEAKER_02]: drive a lot of the flower availability on
our market And yeah the branding that
[SPEAKER_02]: comes with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it all comes back to
branding, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in a capitalist society that
allows you to actually interact with
[SPEAKER_00]: people and bring people on and try to sell
your product to them You have to build
[SPEAKER_00]: your brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to cultivate that brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to nourish it as well Yes,
and I think that's something that's a real
[SPEAKER_00]: issue that Humboldt is dealing with right
now If you guys watch South Park and Vic
[SPEAKER_00]: South Park fan you see like last week
Taggerty Farms Stan Marsh he went out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he left the city and he started his
own cannabis farm It's about Taggerty
[SPEAKER_00]: Farms and They had juuling right,
you know the juuling epidemic going on and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's that's real right and so a Part of
the episode this guy from big vapes comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out there the big vape industry tries to
get extracts from Stan To get his company
[SPEAKER_00]: to fill these Juulpods, pack Sarah And but
he kept on talking about there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: Taggerty in that something that we're
really dealing with right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you sell out completely and Go into the
vaping industry where it's everything is
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke and mirrors Or do you still have
integrity of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you still appreciating the trichomes
the different colors the different actual
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes not added back in like where you
End that where does the culture actually
[SPEAKER_00]: meet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Industry and can they truly coexist in the
future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean look at alcohol right,
you know, everybody there's Bud Light and
[SPEAKER_01]: then there's whatever craft beer you want
to talk about and there's a marketplace
[SPEAKER_01]: for all of those products whether you're
You know mid scale price wise you're
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not looking for something too great
But you want quality for the price you can
[SPEAKER_01]: pay then then there are options for you
certainly on the Cheap side there's
[SPEAKER_01]: there's plenty of that as well be a
product and brand for every consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: segment, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know and going back to the
license is the one thing that that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: interested to see in California and the
one trend that that I've seen in in states
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly Washington and Oregon on as
far as the licensing size Initially when
[SPEAKER_01]: those two states were getting off the
ground they over licensed cultivators And
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't have the consumer market to sell
all of that product Now we see the
[SPEAKER_01]: wholesale price is absolutely tanked in
those states Colorado is a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of leveled off and in which game
pretty Oregon Something like three dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: three dollar gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, ten dollar eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think our average is I think our average
in the data is four or five dollars a
[SPEAKER_02]: gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a hundred percent sure,
but retail right and and when we look at
[SPEAKER_01]: California I kind of see the same thing in
this state That I did see in Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: and Oregon where they're the the majority
of licenses out there I mean, there's
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere around 5,400 active licenses now
two-thirds of those are cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses We have 500 retail legal state
license retail shops in this state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's obviously it's top-heavy on the
cultivation side We'll see what happens on
[SPEAKER_01]: the manufacturing the one wild card in
This scenario is delivery Because I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon has it to a smaller extent
Washington doesn't have it at all so I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: excited to see what consumer trends happen
as far as Visiting your retail shop brick
[SPEAKER_01]: and mortar are you calling speed week?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and especially when it comes to my
mom and my chardonnay mom cousin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that well It falls directly into
our lap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we work with almost 1,200
dispensaries nationwide delivery services
[SPEAKER_00]: and brands What we've seen the data That
we've seen points directly to women not
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to go to dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's some pretty cool data We see
our online orders are significantly higher
[SPEAKER_00]: from women women are more informed
shoppers They spend more time actually
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the product descriptions Spend
a bit on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give bad data right here with my
team right there I say about like 20%
[SPEAKER_00]: longer than men do online
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, so it's like women are I mean So
the one thing that we do see dying is like
[SPEAKER_00]: the sash culture that we have in
California I will miss it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will but um It doesn't sell which is
which is very very interesting I see some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these new players won't say any names
these new players in the game They're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to go back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to go back to the TNA and
all of their Advertisement that shit does
[SPEAKER_00]: not sell Because that sells to men and men
don't buy It sells to the men it sells to
[SPEAKER_02]: the men that are already going into the
shop and buying like you're all Marketing
[SPEAKER_02]: to the same people that are already buying
the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's you know from the data We
know in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I mean listen so Two things so we
do consumer surveys as well as the retail
[SPEAKER_02]: tracking data, right in our consumer
surveys in, California We fielded one
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're currently feeling another And then
we filled it one last year the number last
[SPEAKER_02]: year 23% of California adults of over 21
were consumers That's defined as people
[SPEAKER_02]: who have said yes to consuming over the
past over the past six months that number
[SPEAKER_02]: has since in the last year gone up to 29%
and the rest of the pie is made up of 38%
[SPEAKER_02]: acceptors people who are not open to
consuming, sorry, excuse me who don't
[SPEAKER_02]: currently consume But are open to
consuming and then rejectors who are not
[SPEAKER_02]: open to consuming but are not necessarily
against it That 38% that's people who want
[SPEAKER_02]: to are open to consuming but don't
currently yet consume that is that should
[SPEAKER_02]: be Everybody's target market, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that is 38% of California and
adults over 21 that orient shopping at a
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary or delivery service Yeah,
I agree with Rico's point earlier is that
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean for a lot of that sesh culture
You're you're advertising to the consumers
[SPEAKER_01]: you already have there there aren't a lot
of brands out there that are going after
[SPEAKER_01]: that Undecided consumer that's looking to
make a decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen it a little bit on the
branding side as far as marketing Products
[SPEAKER_01]: specific towards women.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it's been done poorly In a
lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've seen a lot of that see a lot
of stuff that's being marketed towards
[SPEAKER_00]: women I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have enough data to know how well
that is doing yet We were a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: quarters into that and then a lot of those
companies just fell off anyway
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna have to wait another year or
two to actually see how successful these
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing campaigns are right knowing that
the cycles Through regulations that these
[SPEAKER_00]: companies have been failing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean look like the two strongest
flower brands that you're seeing in the
[SPEAKER_02]: market right now are Candessa and Flo Cana
now Flo Cana they're there I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they're they are helping the
small grower and they're marketing on that
[SPEAKER_02]: platform And I think they're taking a
little bit more of a Tom's approach,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though they're not necessarily taking
the Tom's approach, but they definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: are It's more Thomas than Tom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah more Thomas than Tom, right and and
Candessa is I mean they are they're taking
[SPEAKER_02]: the effect-based approach of targeting
that new consumer and it's and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: working I mean they're crushing it and and
you know, I do I mean for people who are
[SPEAKER_02]: entry-level flower consumers I mean that
is the way to keep the flower alive,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because going into the dispensary and
seeing from my mom if she wants to consume
[SPEAKER_02]: flower green crack not only means nothing
to her It scares her right, you know
[SPEAKER_02]: Gorilla Glue Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean none of that sounds appealing,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And but if she walks into this well to her
if she walks into dispensary and she sees
[SPEAKER_02]: calm Relax, you know sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like that, you know also I mean
she's looking for she's looking to achieve
[SPEAKER_02]: an effect the reason she's coming into the
dispensary is because someone told her
[SPEAKER_02]: this will help you with your sleep this
will help you with your menopause,
[SPEAKER_02]: but But you know she's going in and she's
like will Gorilla Glue help my menopause
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone and are the bartenders qualified to
ask answer that question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like again, I go back to trends I've seen
in other states and how they may apply to
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado When you look at the
consolidation effect that happened in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado about two years ago where native
roots goes out buys those mom-and-pop
[SPEAKER_01]: shops now They're 23 different locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a big key to native roots success
is also making a very open and available
[SPEAKER_01]: shop to their consumers And having
educated bud tenders that can help them
[SPEAKER_01]: the mom that is looking for help with her
menopause They can come in and ask that
[SPEAKER_01]: bud tender.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Education to economics right there,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we do to bridge the educational
gap?
[SPEAKER_00]: That we face right now when the plan is
still federally illegal and you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: government directly Telling its people
lies on everything including cannabis well
[SPEAKER_02]: and and when you don't have when a lot of
the Brands and the many a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: operators don't have access to traditional
Media and advertising and and and
[SPEAKER_02]: communicating to their end consumer to my
mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do they reach her?
[SPEAKER_00]: Capital I'm not just talking about money
You don't have access to any of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: modes of communication that every other
industry has right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you have you surprised something
some of the states that we operate and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't you can do online ordering But you
can't put prices online.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck is that you can do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Online ordering, but you can't have
pictures Or you can't put snoops name on
[SPEAKER_01]: it or whatever you want to do yeah And
going back to the the point you made
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier too with the trends of People
moving towards those other craft products
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to just smoking flower these days
You know I think it has a lot to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: the science behind this we're still very
immature when it comes to what we know
[SPEAKER_01]: about this plant and the more we learn the
products get better the quality gets
[SPEAKER_01]: Better and the the medicinal effects and
identifying those it's huge I also think
[SPEAKER_02]: and this goes back to this to the South
Park episode a little bit But I actually
[SPEAKER_02]: predict we might have a little bit of a
right now vape is still one of the fastest
[SPEAKER_02]: growing categories And I actually predict
that we might see a little bit of a dim
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a personal prediction a demise of
the vape.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not and I don't want to say demise
It's not going to go away entirely But I
[SPEAKER_02]: think that some more research a research
is going to come out around how most of
[SPEAKER_02]: the vapes are currently manufactured and
also I think more research will come out
[SPEAKER_02]: about the process of vaping I also think
yep, and I also think that I mean for an
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very socially conscious and
environmentally conscious We've been
[SPEAKER_02]: giving the vape in a sort of a pass And I
don't know how long that's gonna last
[SPEAKER_02]: because the amount of waste that's being
collected right now and the fact that we
[SPEAKER_02]: can't recycle those vapes because they
have contaminant product and you know
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless we get this we encourage the state
to take action on this somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the people will revolt I see
the trends on the licensing side and You
[SPEAKER_01]: know overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think yeah high quality outdoor Grown
cannabis is going to be big in in
[SPEAKER_01]: California and depending on where the
Federal regulations go I mean it could be
[SPEAKER_01]: that everything's grown outdoor in
California and trucked across the country
[SPEAKER_02]: by Coca-Cola or whatever else Likely to
happen In terms of trends outside of the
[SPEAKER_02]: flower category so with Edibles category I
believe gummies make up Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know it off the top of my head,
but gummies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's say yeah the gummies make up
the majority of Edible sales, I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: they're definitely the dominant category
so gummies as well as vapes it within the
[SPEAKER_02]: concert category As well as mints within
the Edibles category right so if you think
[SPEAKER_02]: about like these three products,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do they all have in common they have?
[SPEAKER_02]: user friendliness Familiarity ease of use
right um You know these are all things
[SPEAKER_02]: that for an entry-level consumer right
someone who is like I I want to try this
[SPEAKER_02]: cannibal cannabis thing But I don't really
know how to do it a vape if they vape
[SPEAKER_02]: cigarettes very familiar to them gummies
We've all eaten a gummy before mints who
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't take a mint right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean that's one of the easier products
to make it's very simple, so I see a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: more of it That's actually another very
good point that you bring up right because
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of what we're actually seeing in the
sales right in sales is you know a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people ask me like should I make a Product
you know ten units ten milligrams hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: milligram total or should I do five
milligrams?
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 units hundred or five and five and five
and ten and keep it a 50 right and I get
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now you look at the data and most of
the products that are selling are ten
[SPEAKER_02]: packs with Ten milligram doses right that
that's most of the top selling products
[SPEAKER_02]: right and everyone's like well That's what
the consumer wants and my question is is
[SPEAKER_02]: it yeah, because maybe no one's making
right you know Ten milligram or five
[SPEAKER_02]: milligram ten doses for fifty million if
someone's only visiting for a week and
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't want to buy 20 doses, and they
just I mean And so I think that it is a
[SPEAKER_02]: function of both supply and demand and
work where they are co-evolving together
[SPEAKER_02]: So as the new adult use user right I keep
coming back to my mom and my chardonnay
[SPEAKER_02]: mom cousin because they are very very They
smoke so much weed and it's a joke,
[SPEAKER_02]: but uh I will let them comment on how much
they consume But but no because I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: they are they are those are two very
representative demographics that are
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to come into the market and and
it's a it's sort of a catch-22 Almost of
[SPEAKER_02]: like well there aren't really products
available for us and people are like yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're not gonna make the products if
the consumer is not coming in right so you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to and That's not what is currently
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is happening is that people are
actually it's like the reverse of a
[SPEAKER_02]: catch-22 If you build it they will come
You know there are buying what's available
[SPEAKER_01]: that doesn't mean that it's the best
product out there Yeah, and and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's also what consumer are you targeting
are you targeting a guy like me?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been smoking weed for more than
half his life, and I want to burn really
[SPEAKER_01]: good flowers And hang out and do my thing
or are you going after?
[SPEAKER_01]: That tourists that is coming to California
for the first time and hasn't tried
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're from, Wisconsin Well edibles are
very you know it's an easy gap to fill and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's definitely a niche for that
There's a niche for going after consumers
[SPEAKER_01]: like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a niche for going after female
market I mean it really depends on what
[SPEAKER_01]: product or what demographic you're going
after and then you know just because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the product That's selling in that
that top market doesn't mean it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: best.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's what's available now So yeah,
and that is and actually this court this
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of takes it all back to what
something we were discussing earlier is
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of folks coming into the
industry with a lot of capital and a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of experience And they know they know how
to make a lot of product.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know how to scale They know how to
distribute, but do they know the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: do they actually understand?
[SPEAKER_02]: how to make a decent cannabis based
product and The answer isn't is not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily yes and the folks that I see
succeeding the most and I believe will
[SPEAKER_02]: continue to succeed the most are those
that take that external experience that
[SPEAKER_02]: external capital and bring in the
indigenous endemic legacy Cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: operator experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I think that we can all have a seat
at the table It doesn't need to be black
[SPEAKER_02]: and white it doesn't need to be us versus
them right and and and in fact that way
[SPEAKER_02]: they better each other and And so that
that is what I say to a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis operators right now that are
struggling And they don't know what their
[SPEAKER_02]: next step is I mean it should be sell
should be scale should be raised You know
[SPEAKER_02]: and a lot of them think that they can do
it on their own and continue brute-forcing
[SPEAKER_02]: it on their own as they have For the last
you know X many years and the I don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: to be pessimistic I don't I don't I don't
discount their experience or their
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge I respect the hell out of them
But the fact is that these people that are
[SPEAKER_02]: coming in now are going to be able to
they're going to be coming in with a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of experience and a Lot of money,
and they're going to be able to out
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacture and out price and out
everything the legacy operators who don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have that experience and so with that I
beg you Get some help There's technology
[SPEAKER_01]: out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's I mean there's everything these
businesses need to operate at full
[SPEAKER_01]: capability It's just a matter of going out
there and getting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know don't be afraid to spend money on
your LED lights too Because they're in
[SPEAKER_01]: it's an expensive initial purchase But at
the end of the day you're going to save
[SPEAKER_01]: money over the course of the life of that
light or or same as technology build your
[SPEAKER_01]: IT infrastructures build your Structures
so it's scalable so you can continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow your business and operate at the
highest level So that's a big thing the
[SPEAKER_01]: other thing that I would say that I think
is going to be the next trend in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry is Edibles without sugar,
and there's a lot of people out there that
[SPEAKER_01]: do not want sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not want to eat gummies That's why I
smoke weed so I see a lot of those
[SPEAKER_01]: products coming out in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: I expect to see the same thing in
California Agreed You
