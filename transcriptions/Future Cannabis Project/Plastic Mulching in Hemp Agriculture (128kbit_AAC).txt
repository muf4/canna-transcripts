[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be talking about setting
the standards of what regenerative hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: means and solutions on plastic mulching.
Josh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp is a huge new area of exploration of
farmers and it's bringing a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers, people to the farm where there's
a lot of people in agriculture that are
[SPEAKER_01]: leaving agriculture and a lot of other
realms.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are always talking about farmers
are leaving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis, so hemp farms have brought a
lot of people to agriculture, but it's sad
[SPEAKER_01]: to see how large scale hemp has been,
you know, big ag if I'd and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing plastic culture in it and
bringing large scale machinery is turning
[SPEAKER_01]: what could be, you know, not only an
environmental success and a human success
[SPEAKER_01]: with the expansion of CBD into really an
environmental disaster because of single
[SPEAKER_01]: use plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that we can look towards what
we already know, which is mulch and
[SPEAKER_01]: someone could say, how do you do a hundred
acres of mulch?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say, you know, do as many
acres as you can do with mulch because
[SPEAKER_01]: really it's not about doing more acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about doing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in going forward with the peer
certification and maybe how we can affect
[SPEAKER_01]: the future of hemp farming and what
regenerative hemp farming looks like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to look towards field
cultivation like the cover cropping and
[SPEAKER_01]: crop rotation that Dave was talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also, you know, like people to look
forward, you know, looking into crimping
[SPEAKER_01]: and rolling and growing cover crops and
just knocking them over and then slicing
[SPEAKER_01]: into the residue is what they call it when
it lays over and then planting plants just
[SPEAKER_01]: right in the residue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's big ag farmers that are
growing super successful, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 700,000 acre plots with these new no-till
techniques on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would love to see hemp be figured out
as far as the new THC laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's obviously a really big new topic
of discussion is, you know, what is hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: and how are we going to move forward with
all that?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is here and it is going to be on
large scales.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a lot of techniques that we
can use to have it be a healthy impact on
[SPEAKER_01]: the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that a lot of our actions and
moving forward as businesses and as people
[SPEAKER_01]: are really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me and for us, I think it always
resonates that our actions are supporting
[SPEAKER_01]: a healthy ecosystem because not only are
our bodies being affected, but so are the
[SPEAKER_01]: lands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So finding ways to grow hemp without
plastic mulch or without plastic at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different cow pots that you can
use in the beginning or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: different ways of even creating clones if
you're going to use it in field scales
[SPEAKER_01]: with soil blockers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can keep it short.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's hemp even just rotting in the
fields because they haven't figured,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, out the scale of drying hemp and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, you know, maybe a whole field
of hemp that's been rotted with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic underneath it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think in moving forward, I think we
can all help even if we don't have a hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: farm or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking about hemp in this
moment for field cultivation aspects is
[SPEAKER_01]: influence people that are, you know,
doing doing new big projects and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: guide them towards old school farming like
Victor Schomburg and some of the bio plows
[SPEAKER_01]: and the ways that some plows used to turn
dirt over in a way that was really
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, that's what I have to say
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because hemp is such a becoming big ag,
we're really starting to talk about our
[SPEAKER_00]: waterways and the way that we're what
water runoff is happening now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a crop that can save the earth,
what's going on and how can we save our
[SPEAKER_00]: waterways specifically?
So thank you very much.
Thank you.
