[SPEAKER_00]: So the topic I'm speaking on is cover crop
rotations, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially I thought I was just speaking
about cover cropping, but it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: good because they really are intertwined
in our system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically we do cover cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure most of the one I say here is
already second nature to a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: here, so bear with me if I say elementary,
for lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do cover cropping for a number of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is just to protect the soil in
the winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For soil, you know, it really helps with
erosion and preventing erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of our ground is in the
floodplain, so it kind of keeps the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: more intact and secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, another reason is legumes in
particular are really, they fix nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: from the air, so we really boost our
fertility levels with good cover cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we usually mix grasses in with the
legumes because the grasses kind of create
[SPEAKER_00]: a cover immediately, choke out existing
leaves, and allow the legumes to come
[SPEAKER_00]: through later over the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, probably one of our main
focuses with cover cropping is for our
[SPEAKER_00]: weed control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's generally how the cover cropping
and in crop rotations really work hand in
[SPEAKER_00]: hand because, for example, the first
season on new ground we're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into, crops that are a lot more labor
intensive when it comes to weeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: like longer lasting crops like carrots,
onions, things like that that are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find that it's almost pointless to try
to grow them in a first year area that was
[SPEAKER_00]: fallow with nice cover crops for a few
seasons before we get into that ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crops that are more, have a big canopy
and are quicker, like corn for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of brassicas, broccoli, and lettuce,
head lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good first year crop
because we can get in, plant our plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: then do a combination of mechanical
cultivation followed by in row hand
[SPEAKER_00]: weeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on the crop, one to two
times doing that, then the plant can take
[SPEAKER_00]: off, and then the native weeds and brought
in weeds, they'll start popping,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they'll be one step behind the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally, the first few seasons doing
crops like that, then our weed seed
[SPEAKER_00]: populations will reduce drastically,
then we can get into more of the labor
[SPEAKER_00]: intensive crops like carrots and beets and
onions and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In conjunction with that, our style of
crop rotating, we find that not doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: same family of crops in the same area in
less than ideally a four year period and
[SPEAKER_00]: some crops even longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So four to five is generally our sweet
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say families of crops, we don't
break it down by each vegetable,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we'll do like root crops and break
that into carrots and beets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do brassicas and we'll do leafy
greens and salad and corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are kind of our main breakdowns of
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we find is that anytime any crop,
once I push that threshold of an acre or
[SPEAKER_00]: more, we generally have problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're certified organic, but what I still
consider to be the heavy artillery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crops that are more disease prone are a
lot harder to pull off without having to
[SPEAKER_00]: go into the war chest or having really
timely applications once we push that acre
[SPEAKER_00]: boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can keep everything smaller than
that with good rotation, I see a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: examples on Instagram and follow some of
you guys where a lot of people are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: more like a polyculture type of thing,
like where everything's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: intermingled, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: On ours, we still consider it so small
scale, but we definitely are like a
[SPEAKER_00]: production farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vegetable side supports a lot of four
families and we crank out a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: produce sort of focusing on our regional
food security within a hundred miles of
[SPEAKER_00]: where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, the margins are really
slim when you're trying to make a living
[SPEAKER_00]: growing produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed pressure will make or break us,
like how we deal with our weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of how we overall attack
weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically after we get our crop out in
the fall, generally, or late summer
[SPEAKER_00]: whenever it is, we get our ground prepared
for whatever cover crop we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I like to do a rye grass or oats
and mix with a few other legumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally I like to let that cover
crop go as late as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That possibly can before the crop goes to
seed, late spring, early summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And deciding when I whack the crop in or
incorporate it in has everything to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with the crop that I'm going to plant
there next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get early ground, it might not get
much time to really get like three,
[SPEAKER_00]: four feet tall, but later ground,
I like to incorporate it a solid month
[SPEAKER_00]: before we're gonna be wanting to plant
that ground to give plenty of time to
[SPEAKER_00]: break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would want to say one more thing in
relation to ganja, is that we have been
[SPEAKER_00]: having really good success both in our
cannabis and in our ham with under sowing
[SPEAKER_00]: clovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once our plants get established and we
kind of scrag out the area, giving up
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow, I'm a really big fan of New
Zealand clover and Dutch white clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: New Zealand clover I'm leaning a little
more towards because it's a bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: drought tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But both of them, they'll tell you they
grow about this big.
[SPEAKER_00]: In ganja we say they grow more about this
big because we have pretty fertile beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that creates a great habitat for
all beneficials, chokes out other weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we can get to overwinter and
not incorporate it until it flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: it pops off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it comes to hemp,
it's a really great alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I got to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
I'll see you next time.
Bye-bye.
