[SPEAKER_07]: I have been with the Commission since
December 1st of 2018, which happened to
[SPEAKER_07]: coincide with the first day that product
was available to patients in Maryland.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I get blamed for a lot of things that
have happened since then.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually get blamed for a lot of things
that happened before then, but we're
[SPEAKER_07]: working on those things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as background, I want everybody to know
that I came from healthcare and I had a
[SPEAKER_07]: unique experience in my healthcare career.
[SPEAKER_07]: I started at the age of 17 as a nurse's
aide in a nursing home.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will tell you that the very first
day I went home with a migraine headache
[SPEAKER_07]: and said, man, I don't know if I can do
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I don't know if I can do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I went back and I grew to love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I absolutely loved it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I loved helping people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I loved taking care of people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, that really was my
integration into healthcare.
[SPEAKER_07]: From there, I became a laboratory
scientist.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a medical technologist.
[SPEAKER_07]: From there, I became multi-departmental
managers in hospitals.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've always worked in small rural
hospitals.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the unique opportunities is to
get to do a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's less people, so you just kind of
got to pitch in and learn to do what needs
[SPEAKER_07]: to be done.
[SPEAKER_07]: So laboratory scientist, I became a
quality director in charge of quality for
[SPEAKER_07]: healthcare programs in the hospitals.
[SPEAKER_07]: I became a risk manager looking at,
you know, mitigating risk.
[SPEAKER_07]: What does that mean for patients?
[SPEAKER_07]: What processes do we have in place?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then became director of compliance and
regulatory affairs, which all of those
[SPEAKER_07]: things really were great building blocks
for what I'm doing now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am a regulator.
[SPEAKER_07]: I look at things through a regulator's
lens.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I look at things through a healthcare
lens.
[SPEAKER_07]: The focus in healthcare is the patient.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what are we doing for the patient?
[SPEAKER_07]: And what processes are we putting in place
to make sure that our focus is on patient
[SPEAKER_07]: safety, quality services, and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's really my background and how I
come to the commission.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really excited to be able to have an
influence on rolling this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Healthcare program out for patients across
Maryland.
[SPEAKER_07]: The cannabis space is a little bit
interesting in that regard.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a little bit what I want to
talk about tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Brent Guyton, chief operating officer
of Remedy Columbia.
[SPEAKER_16]: Gavin Hack, I'm the assistant manager and
IT lead at KIPCAN.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just get right into it and then we'll
have discussion.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell me what motivates you to work in the
medical cannabis industry and what is the
[SPEAKER_07]: most satisfying aspect of doing that.
[SPEAKER_16]: I have a 20-year history of working in IT
as a quality assurance professional,
[SPEAKER_16]: let's call it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have a sister who was a programmer
and became a nurse.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I was interested in kind of going into
healthcare.
[SPEAKER_16]: But around the time I was taking on my
prereqs for nursing, I went into a
[SPEAKER_16]: clinical trial at Hopkins and had a
radiation injury.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it kind of swerved me away from being a
hospice nurse in India.
[SPEAKER_16]: And two years ago I finished a master's at
UMBC in instructional systems development.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I wanted to kind of apply my degree to
a field that needs training and needs kind
[SPEAKER_16]: of process.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me I come from food manufacturing and
supply chain logistics.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most recent venture was right down the
street.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you smell any bread, and I used to run
the H&S bakery there, I used to run.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with bread comes a passion for all
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with food comes a passion for all
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my passion is helping people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Helping people and being a healer.
[SPEAKER_02]: My background with cannabis is I played
football in college.
[SPEAKER_02]: I played football at UCLA back in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And back in the 90s, if you recall,
a gentleman by the name of Jack Herr
[SPEAKER_02]: helped lead a proposition in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was there with him on the corner of
Wilshire and Sepulveda in front of the
[SPEAKER_02]: federal building protesting, passing out
medicine, enjoying medicine, teaching and
[SPEAKER_02]: helping people all about playing football
at UCLA.
[SPEAKER_02]: I enjoyed an illustrious career at UCLA,
came back to Maryland, and have many
[SPEAKER_02]: people in my family that suffer from
cancer in different forms, in different
[SPEAKER_02]: stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have been patients in Maryland and
across the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a true appreciation for this
medicine dating back to the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_07]: So tell me what is the most satisfying
aspect of being in this business?
[SPEAKER_16]: When someone comes back and says that it
worked, and they had been, I'm also a vet
[SPEAKER_16]: and I've struggled with insomnia for 20 or
30 years, and I've finally personally
[SPEAKER_16]: found something that works for me.
[SPEAKER_16]: And when somebody comes back and you know
you've given them that relief that they've
[SPEAKER_16]: been seeking for decades from an
institution or an entity that really
[SPEAKER_16]: should have been able to help them,
and you kind of become that entity.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd agree with that and say that when
patients definitely come back and you see
[SPEAKER_02]: them at first and they're using a walker
or some aid and they come back with the
[SPEAKER_02]: help and aid of cannabis, they no longer
need that walker or that crutch,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they come in, they thank you on the
way into your dispensary, they stop and
[SPEAKER_02]: they give you donuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't bring my wife donuts on a
regular basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that to me says that we're doing what
we need to do and serve our patients.
[SPEAKER_07]: Comments from the audience?
[SPEAKER_06]: As a bartender, I agree with the best
reward is having someone come back and
[SPEAKER_06]: say, you've helped me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have so many patients that were in a
frankly devastated state when they first
[SPEAKER_06]: started coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then in the last six or seven months,
we've been open.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're walking.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can go to the grocery store without
having a panic attack.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're doing great at school.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing the many, many people that are
getting off of opioids and fentanyl
[SPEAKER_04]: patches.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still remember one of our first patients
the weekend, the first week we opened.
[SPEAKER_05]: A month later he came back and said,
you know, you saved my marriage.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can get off the couch again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can play with my kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like I'm a human being again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm off of the scripts and he's been a
loyal patient and he couldn't even walk
[SPEAKER_05]: into the store or the shop when he first
started coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now he comes in, he bobbled around.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really nice to see.
[SPEAKER_15]: As a disabled veteran, I'm in this
business for my brothers that need help
[SPEAKER_15]: that with respect to my grandchildren.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, through my regulator lens,
my next question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Comment first is, some of the things that
I've seen in this medical only market are
[SPEAKER_07]: absolutely shocking to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So tell me, Brent and Gavin.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to call you Kip.
[SPEAKER_07]: What business strategies do you use in
differentiating your business model to
[SPEAKER_07]: focus on medical only versus an adult use
market, whether that's, well, if you're a
[SPEAKER_07]: grower out in the audience, whether that's
choosing genetics, whether you're a
[SPEAKER_07]: processor and choosing the products you're
going to manufacture, or if you're
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensary, what are you going to
recommend to your patients?
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us, I can tell you at Remedy
Columbia, we have a long history and
[SPEAKER_02]: holistic and natural health care dating
back to 1974 when acupuncture was illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was illegal in every state in the
nation except for Maryland and Nevada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our president and founder, Mr. Bob Duggan,
who's no longer with us on this earth,
[SPEAKER_02]: founded the Thai Sophia Institute in
Columbia, Maryland back in 1974 when
[SPEAKER_02]: acupuncture was illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Acupuncture and cannabis are riding
parallels right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us, our definition of medicine is
anything that helps maintain or bring you
[SPEAKER_02]: back to homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We start with that as a basis and then
levitate from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is us and our approach to the
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So based off of our definition of
medicine, medicine could be a smile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medicine could be jogging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medicine is anything that helps you bring
you back to homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So off of that, our business practice is
to use that as a guide and have a
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation with people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come in and speak with us and let's have a
conversation about what we can help you
[SPEAKER_02]: with, what ailments do you have that we
can help improve your life and your
[SPEAKER_02]: well-being while you're with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of our take on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I answered your question
directly, but indirectly that's who we are
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's over the 7,000 patients that
we've seen and continue to see on a
[SPEAKER_02]: monthly basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our approach.
[SPEAKER_16]: Although I didn't really shape KIPP,
I was just tired a couple months ago.
[SPEAKER_16]: The basic idea that KIPP stands for
knowledge is power.
[SPEAKER_16]: The idea that if you don't have an
informed customer, informed patient,
[SPEAKER_16]: they're not going to be able to really
negotiate the process of being medicated
[SPEAKER_16]: properly.
[SPEAKER_16]: The other thing is we hired a registered
pharmacist and we encourage everyone who
[SPEAKER_16]: comes in, if they have any questions at
all, to take the time to have a
[SPEAKER_16]: consultation with him which is free and
can be as long as they like.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've had people come in and talk to him
for five minutes.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've had people come in and talk to him
for two or three hours.
[SPEAKER_16]: It really helped.
[SPEAKER_16]: We also have a patient handout where
they've got a couple pages to track
[SPEAKER_16]: dosages, strains.
[SPEAKER_16]: We encourage people to come back to us,
but we also have a policy of trying to
[SPEAKER_16]: follow up with them if they want to.
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll actually call people and ask how
it's going and encourage them to just
[SPEAKER_16]: communicate with us.
[SPEAKER_11]: When we first opened our dispensary,
one of the bigger, more medical
[SPEAKER_11]: prescribers came into the shop and we were
sitting there shooting the breeze.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was watching people come in.
Someone walks in and he goes, that's a rec
user.
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone comes in and he goes, that's a rec
user.
[SPEAKER_11]: I realized two things.
[SPEAKER_11]: One, obviously he had a bias.
[SPEAKER_11]: I realized that I also had that bias.
[SPEAKER_11]: For me, it was like turning a key.
[SPEAKER_11]: I came to understand things from a
different perspective.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just because someone has been using this
medicine because it wasn't available
[SPEAKER_11]: legally or because they got it from other
ways doesn't mean that they haven't been
[SPEAKER_11]: using it for very important reasons,
whether that's sleep, anxiety,
[SPEAKER_11]: pain, whatever.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't even think in terms of rec and
medical anymore.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think in terms of unguided and guided.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that what we want to do is
advocate everybody using this medicine in
[SPEAKER_11]: a guided way instead of an unguided way,
regardless of how they get it.
[SPEAKER_11]: When they can get medicine in this
program, we know that they're getting
[SPEAKER_11]: clean medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: We know that it doesn't have any junk in
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We know exactly what they're getting.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that that's also an important
distinction between what they can get on
[SPEAKER_11]: the street, between what they can get from
any of our dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we need to rise above this idea of
rec and really just think of it as we
[SPEAKER_11]: would any other herbs.
[SPEAKER_11]: If I had a patient that was using Ginkgo,
I want them to use it in a guided way.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want them to get their medical
advice from the 17-year-old clerk at the
[SPEAKER_11]: local G&C.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want them to talk to somebody that has
an education in this medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how I want it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting terminology, guided versus
unguided.
I like it.
I like it.
I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might steal it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Brad, I could just tell you, if you steal
something from me, it's at least twice
[SPEAKER_11]: stole.
[SPEAKER_07]: The follow-up to that question is,
do you think the Maryland market overall
[SPEAKER_07]: is specifically tailored to medical only?
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell me why.
[SPEAKER_02]: Based off of our definition of medicine,
knowing that I've been using this medicine
since 1992, yes.
Somewhere, I think the definition
ultimately becomes less meaningful when
[SPEAKER_16]: you see someone come in who has been using
it for decades, and they finally are able
[SPEAKER_16]: to really dial it in.
[SPEAKER_16]: Often, we don't even know the specificity
of all their potential illnesses,
[SPEAKER_16]: but we know it works for them.
[SPEAKER_16]: You probably know this about some
traditional medicine, like the vinca
[SPEAKER_16]: alkaloids.
[SPEAKER_16]: Often, cultures have been using medicine
for thousands of years, and then big
[SPEAKER_16]: pharma catches up.
[SPEAKER_16]: What was a local medicine to people in
South and Central America now has become
[SPEAKER_16]: vincristine, or vinblastine, and is used
for chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we're finally catching up with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can expand on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a gentleman by the name of James
Duke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody ever hear of that name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: You graduated from Thai Sophia.
[SPEAKER_02]: James Duke, has anybody ever seen the
movie Medicine Man?
[SPEAKER_02]: James Duke is a Howard County native.
He lived right in Fulton in Howard County.
He was on our advisory board until he
passed away last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: James Duke was the one that Sean Connery
played him in Medicine Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would go down into the indigenous
regions of the Amazon and find all these
[SPEAKER_02]: herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He eventually brought the big pharma
companies in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They eradicated all the herbs and made
modern medicine out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This gentleman who was on our advisory
board, who lived in Howard County,
[SPEAKER_02]: who still has an herbal garden that
represents the Eastern Hemisphere and the
[SPEAKER_02]: Western Hemisphere and is divided.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has every herb there that you could
imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's taken people from a cormac on tours
of his garden, and they have never seen
[SPEAKER_02]: herbs grow naturally until they've been to
his garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: This man was remarkable in what he could
do with a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these companies came back and just
eradicated things because he went down to
[SPEAKER_02]: the Amazon and lived with indigenous
people forever and brought things back.
[SPEAKER_02]: His stories are amazing and I can't even
begin to tell you.
[SPEAKER_07]: What about the audience?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think our market is geared
specifically to a medical only market?
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you mean by the regulations or
what exactly do you mean by?
[SPEAKER_07]: What you're seeing day to day,
what you experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean whatever from your perspective.
[SPEAKER_09]: Who are we serving?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what you're asking?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not framing the question.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not qualifying the question.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see from your experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot of the philosophy you're
hearing is that anybody can be a patient
[SPEAKER_09]: even within the regulations of what
qualifies somebody as a patient.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether anxiety or insomnia or any of
these things are on the list of
[SPEAKER_09]: qualifications.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're finding at dispensaries that people
come in for a plethora of reasons and
[SPEAKER_09]: they're qualifying by their doctors,
by their physicians for many, many reasons
[SPEAKER_09]: of why they're coming in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pain comes in many, many forms both
mentally and physically.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of the conditions are physical as you
know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's serving mostly as a medical
but when I hear that I think more of the
[SPEAKER_09]: regulations are written for more medical
patients but people are finding
[SPEAKER_09]: alternative medicine is the solution
versus the pharmaceuticals that they've
[SPEAKER_09]: been offered for so many years.
[SPEAKER_09]: In different forms people are slowly as
you know coming in and registering
[SPEAKER_09]: themselves, certifying themselves to try
something new.
[SPEAKER_09]: Something that may work better for them
and is more healthy for them that won't
[SPEAKER_09]: actually kill them in a lot of instances.
[SPEAKER_09]: We see it every day at Remedy.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the things that we always say,
doing it for years, it's not a cliché to
[SPEAKER_09]: say that we're saving lives.
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually have people at our store,
at our shop saying you're saving my life
[SPEAKER_09]: so it's not for me to say I'm saving
lives.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's them telling us that what they are.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's serving them as a medical
market and it's actually expanding slowly
[SPEAKER_09]: into other people's needs and desires and
really helping a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely this program from a policy
procedure standpoint coming from a
[SPEAKER_01]: military background, this is indeed a
medical market but I think this brings
[SPEAKER_01]: Segway to a broader perspective about the
opportunities that if we went we won't see
[SPEAKER_01]: a recreation because that's a bad word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be realistic when we talk about
responsible dog consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to bring a much broader
opportunity to the state of Maryland if
[SPEAKER_01]: the state approved it we hope in 2020 to a
market that's going to allow for taxation,
[SPEAKER_01]: for a market that may allow for home
cultivation because let's be honest I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't afford the $1,600 a month in
medicine so I think this is an opportunity
[SPEAKER_01]: to think broadly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just the medical state but I
realize we need to keep the medical state
[SPEAKER_01]: intact and if we look at other states like
we have been and looking for these finer
[SPEAKER_01]: points to broaden our spectrum we're going
to see a lot better difference to the
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape of Maryland those from the
medical state as well as a responsible
[SPEAKER_01]: adult consumer state.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that there has been legislation
introduced at least the last two years in
[SPEAKER_07]: regard to adult use and we get that
question a lot at the commission and I can
[SPEAKER_07]: just respond by saying we are the Maryland
Medical Cannabis Commission so we have no
[SPEAKER_07]: position and no comment on adult use but I
think it's very well known that medical
[SPEAKER_07]: usually comes first and then states get
into authorizing adult use in a variety of
[SPEAKER_07]: ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know that we have an idea of what
that program might look like in Maryland
[SPEAKER_07]: and I think those things are yet to come
but from my focus I really want to
[SPEAKER_07]: emphasize and the reason for my questions
is we are a medical program we are a
[SPEAKER_07]: health care program for patients across
Maryland and I realize that there are
[SPEAKER_07]: patients that we have now who were not
patients before it was legal but they were
[SPEAKER_07]: using this self-medicating as you will but
I think it's up to all of us to really
[SPEAKER_07]: change that persona and sometimes it's
more difficult with people who have been
[SPEAKER_07]: using cannabis for years have a
perspective of you know I need to hide it
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to talk about it in a specific way
I need to refer to it in a specific way
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's up to all of us to change that
nomenclature those types of things that I
[SPEAKER_07]: can see brought ready to jump in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please forgive me if that is the case then
why the ban on advertising and billboards
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything else if we're trying to end
the stigma?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well because I will tell you very honestly
and I know I'm being recorded so I have to
[SPEAKER_07]: be very careful.
Please.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Commission did propose regulations
that did have some strenuous bans in
[SPEAKER_07]: regard to advertising that was in response
in large part to examples that we were
[SPEAKER_07]: provided from licensees that are already
out there in the industry who may have
[SPEAKER_07]: advertised in a way that was not entirely
of a medical flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sir in the back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Behind Eric.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I wanted to add to the point that
I've seen people decide cannabis over
[SPEAKER_12]: hospice so I do really appreciate the
medical aspect of the program and that
[SPEAKER_12]: homegrown is something that's being
considered in adult use and that every
[SPEAKER_12]: time that's brought up I encourage people
to add to the point that it would be
[SPEAKER_12]: amazing if you chose to grow at home and
get it tested then you could sell it to a
[SPEAKER_12]: dispensary and create a legitimate market
where people aren't trading things for
[SPEAKER_12]: teachers like they are in DC or you can
pay taxes on the industry if they want to
[SPEAKER_12]: be and provide us with competition that's
unmarketable.
[SPEAKER_07]: I missed the one comment I'm really
interested you said trading for teachers?
[SPEAKER_02]: T-shirts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Teachers, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This t-shirt will cost you $50.
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're not aware of DC, they get around
the aspect of being able to sell it or tax
[SPEAKER_12]: it or everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: You buy a t-shirt for $60 and you get a
name for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're creative.
[SPEAKER_07]: The market is very innovative.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to the marketing thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can they just say you have rules you have
to follow?
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't make a decision for the
Commission.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Commission did vote on proposed
regulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: They offered at least four or five
opportunities for public comment.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are proposed regulations that will
be submitted through the rulemaking
[SPEAKER_07]: process.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is additional opportunities for
public comment when it goes through the
[SPEAKER_07]: AALR committee.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that we cannot submit those
regulations until after the blackout
[SPEAKER_07]: period for the AALR so they won't even be
able to receive them until late February,
[SPEAKER_07]: early March.
[SPEAKER_07]: That rulemaking process takes four or five
months so they are not yet in effect.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are simply proposed regulations at
this point in time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Caramonte.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee
is interested in having discussions with
[SPEAKER_07]: us regarding those proposals.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're going to have that
opportunity and we may end up holding them
[SPEAKER_07]: based on those meetings.
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't be surprised.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know but I won't be surprised if
there is some legislation that's presented
[SPEAKER_07]: this session.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows what comes out of legislation?
[SPEAKER_07]: We had House Bill 2 last year so that was
a whole event in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there is more to come on the
advertising regulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just explaining the timeline.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_07]: We did give a briefing to the Senate
Judicial Proceedings Committee last week.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are very interested in a lot of
aspects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are a new committee in the Senate
that's hearing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were bringing those new members up to
speed on where we are in the commission.
[SPEAKER_07]: If there is a bill presented on
advertising, there always are hearings
[SPEAKER_07]: where people can have an opportunity to
speak.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can sign up to speak and offer
testimony to the committee.
[SPEAKER_07]: Going back to the point of why was the ban
put out?
[SPEAKER_07]: We received a great number of examples of
advertising that different licensees have
[SPEAKER_07]: been putting out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell you having been in healthcare
for many decades, that didn't look like
[SPEAKER_07]: healthcare advertising to me in some
regards.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some was perfectly acceptable from a
healthcare standpoint, but others,
[SPEAKER_07]: you are scratching your head and going,
how are they advertising medicine?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what the commissioners were
evaluating when they were deliberating
[SPEAKER_07]: about the new regulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Behind Brian, the gentleman hit his hand
up first.
[SPEAKER_10]: This brings up a big issue.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I have the support of everyone in
this room, probably including you,
[SPEAKER_10]: Joy, but it's the whole idea of stigma and
reactions.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything seems from a legislative
standpoint that it's reactionary.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's reactionary to a couple bad
billboards, a couple bad ads, but we're
[SPEAKER_10]: all paying the price for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: To just be reactionary because there's a
couple of bad seeds out there,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's just the wrong way to do this.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're trying to get rid of the stigma
that's been around forever.
[SPEAKER_10]: A perfect example for me is 18 months ago
when we were planning our dispensary,
[SPEAKER_10]: people said, I have friends in the
business and some might be here that have
[SPEAKER_10]: dispensaries that said to me, are you
putting armed guards in your lobby?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, armed guards?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not having a guard.
[SPEAKER_10]: They thought I was crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: My answer was, if I put bars on my window,
I'm telling someone I live in a bad
[SPEAKER_10]: neighborhood, I'm afraid.
[SPEAKER_10]: If I put an armed guard in my dispensary,
first of all, I don't want a gunfight in
[SPEAKER_10]: my dispensary.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Second of all, I'm not doing anything
wrong.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's everyone's legal right to come in my
dispensary and get medicine.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's their legal right that's passed by
the state.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why am I going to project this image?
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a Whole Foods down the store.
[SPEAKER_10]: When I met with neighborhood associations
early on, drugs, money, guns, people are
[SPEAKER_10]: going to rob you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, people walk out of Whole Foods
with $300 of groceries all day long every
[SPEAKER_10]: day.
[SPEAKER_10]: My average sale is going to be 95 bucks.
[SPEAKER_10]: People walk out of Walgreens with
OxyContin's all day, 800 bucks in their
[SPEAKER_10]: pocket, and they're not getting robbed.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's this whole stigma idea that we're all
trying to overcome because nobody's doing
[SPEAKER_10]: anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_10]: When the advertising bans come and all
these other reactionary regulations come,
[SPEAKER_10]: it just defeats everything everybody in
this room is working for, and even you in
[SPEAKER_10]: the commission.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's being so reactionary, it's just so
damaging to our business.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're a retail business.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's not a retail business in the world
that can't advertise.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's just one issue, but I feel like
until the regulators and even the
[SPEAKER_10]: response, I worked in real estate before I
did this.
[SPEAKER_10]: The loudest people that come out are the
vocal minority.
[SPEAKER_10]: The loudest people come out to fight
because they saw two billboards they don't
[SPEAKER_10]: like are the ones screaming.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's plenty of people that aren't
offended by advertising, any of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to fight this as a, I know I got
everyone's support in this room.
[SPEAKER_10]: I see chins nodding.
[SPEAKER_10]: If we let this stuff keep going,
the stigma keeps going on, and we're going
[SPEAKER_10]: to fight these battles for way too long.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't disagree with your comments,
but I do need to say that this is a legal
[SPEAKER_07]: industry in Maryland, which is a state
that is right next door to Washington,
[SPEAKER_07]: D.C., which the regulators of Washington,
D.C.
[SPEAKER_07]: consider this a schedule one drug.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have those considerations.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not an approved federal program
like real estate or whole foods or
[SPEAKER_07]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have those things that we have to
consider as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: The regulations and the examples are not
based on two billboards.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will tell you it was many, many,
many, many, many more examples than those
[SPEAKER_07]: two billboards, and I actually only can
think of one that you might be referring
[SPEAKER_07]: to.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to keep those things in
perspective.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis is available for people who sign
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now we have 80,000 patients
registered, and we have 56,000 that are
[SPEAKER_07]: certified.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is less than 1% of the population
across Maryland.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have to be respectful and consider
all of the state that may be subject to
[SPEAKER_07]: advertising, including children.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have those perspectives as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's the job of the commission to
listen to all of the stakeholders in
[SPEAKER_07]: making regulations.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think you're not doing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just, you know, I think there's a lot
of people that get lumped in, you know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think these regulations came up before
we were open, so I think it's not a
[SPEAKER_10]: personal thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I'm just saying I know you have
all that stuff to deal with, and I don't.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I appreciate that, and I respect
that, and I know that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think if we let the stigma keep
getting projected through reactions,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, we're going to be fighting an
uphill battle.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've all done.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been fighting for a long time.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I know you have all those regulations,
and I know it's a schedule one.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I know all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: Brian, you had your hand up.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to get a sense of how many
were a great number.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think you just made that clear with
many, many, many.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Got a lot of screenshots.
[SPEAKER_11]: Are those available to us?
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think those were.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think those were part of the.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought they were posted, but maybe I'm
mistaken.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was many months ago that we went
through all that, so I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what not to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what Brian is alluding to is that
if given the opportunity, we would
self-police.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I hearing you correctly, Brian?
[SPEAKER_11]: The question about that, it just seems
like if there were examples of that,
[SPEAKER_11]: and we as an industry were concerned about
that, a more reasonable response would be,
[SPEAKER_11]: let's set out the rules of what is
acceptable and what isn't, instead of
[SPEAKER_11]: saying, you can't talk about this,
which is basically what the recommendation
[SPEAKER_11]: seems to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: Eric.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just wondering what health care looks
like to you, because you're saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: certain things don't look like health care
standards to you, but you're also talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the difference between recreational
and medical in the same sentence where we
[SPEAKER_00]: only have a medical industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm wondering just from your
perspective of your history and your
[SPEAKER_00]: background, what do you expect this
industry to look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for me, I don't think it's pills.
So.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I don't think it's pills either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what constitutes not acceptable versus
acceptable when we're dealing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is part of that question like a Viagra
commercial shows how these people frog in
[SPEAKER_03]: through the fields?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not a decision maker, so I don't get a
vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just your hopes and dreams coming from a
Medicare, whatever your background.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think is an acceptable thing
for cannabis to go into the future with?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that, and this is me personally.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I'm not a commissioner,
and I don't get a vote.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it is entirely fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: For people to say, I am a medical cannabis
business, and here's my location,
[SPEAKER_07]: and here's my website, and here's how you
find me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, there is a grower on 95
that has a billboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that acceptable?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all it says.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's literally all that it says.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can only offer you my personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not speaking as the executive director
of the Cannabis Commission.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, one more question, and then we're
going to move on.
[SPEAKER_12]: I
[SPEAKER_07]: don't know that the regulations on
advertising address pricing at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do not have any authority to regulate
pricing markets in Maryland, other than
[SPEAKER_07]: the regulations say you may not give away
samples.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure where your question's coming
from.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think the proposed regulations
address that at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the next topic.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just finished out 2018.
[SPEAKER_07]: First year, 13 months of work in Maryland.
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously a tremendous year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell me, what was the biggest surprise
that came out of 2018 for you?
[SPEAKER_16]: Did I finally get a job in the industry
after applying for probably hundreds of
[SPEAKER_16]: jobs?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I echo this for everybody in the
room that a cannabis year is 10 years on
[SPEAKER_02]: your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dog years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the work is extremely hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: People think that cannabis business is,
oh, you're going to sit around,
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke cannabis and tell jokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's a lot more than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dealing with patients is a responsibility
that everybody in this room knows and
[SPEAKER_02]: welcomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't come to those that don't
have grit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Other surprises from our first year.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a surprise, but I think it's a
clap to everyone who's producing product.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the quality of the product in
Maryland is, I mean, I have a guy who ran
[SPEAKER_10]: biggest grocery in Colorado who runs my
shop.
[SPEAKER_10]: The product quality here is outstanding.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I think we could say we have the
best product in the country.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really believe that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think part of that has to do with the
regs.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know it's been Maryland a long time
to get here, but I think we did it right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think the testing and all that is
great.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think the fact that we dig down into
the turkey profiles and things that other
[SPEAKER_10]: states don't do, it's a testament to
everyone's business.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the fact that we have a limited number
of licenses allow people to spend a hell
[SPEAKER_10]: of a lot of money and build out their
facilities and do things right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So for me, that's a happy surprise.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Joy, I have a question.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to flip it.
[SPEAKER_15]: What's the biggest surprise from the
commission perspective over this last
[SPEAKER_15]: year?
[SPEAKER_07]: How do I pick only one?
[SPEAKER_15]: Pick three.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't rule with three.
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you want to go with three,
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell you one of the things I'm most
pleased with.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is a little bit of a surprise.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I started at the commission,
we had 17 employees.
[SPEAKER_07]: We now have almost 40.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we have some of the best
talent and the most committed employees
[SPEAKER_07]: that I have ever had the honor to work
with.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I am so proud of the work that my team
has done.
[SPEAKER_07]: The projects that were brought out to us
in House Bill 2 were enormous.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we ended up having to hire about six
people just to work on the House Bill 2
[SPEAKER_07]: projects.
[SPEAKER_07]: They did a tremendous job.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just great talent and very, very committed
people to the quality of product across
[SPEAKER_07]: Maryland.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was a gentleman over here in the
ball cap.
[SPEAKER_07]: Richard?
[SPEAKER_14]: I
[SPEAKER_14]: didn't catch the last part.
[SPEAKER_14]: I said, I think it's a problem with the
industry.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to know what's going to be done
with that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just surprised that they continue.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can see at the end of the year,
if someone had gotten their permits and
[SPEAKER_14]: they were in
the process.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not fair to the people that really
worked hard to beat that deadline.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're now up against something.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're coming within 800 feet from our
door.
[SPEAKER_14]: Two years later, they're coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, as you know, dispensaries were
awarded based on Senatorial District.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two for Senatorial District and a grower
could have the opportunity to apply for
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensary for any district that they
chose.
[SPEAKER_07]: Eight of the growers took advantage of
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the commission in 2016
[SPEAKER_07]: awarded 102 pre-approved dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those 102 are either licensed,
71 of them are licensed, or the remaining
[SPEAKER_07]: 31 are still in that pre-approval stage.
[SPEAKER_07]: The list hasn't changed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still the same licensees that were
awarded.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And eight of you actually met the
deadline.
[SPEAKER_07]: Only eight dispensaries met the deadline.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there were eight open on December
1st.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there could have been a few more
licensed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we continue to meet with those
individual dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will tell you that I met with a
dispensary two weeks ago, and they just
[SPEAKER_07]: received their zoning permit.
[SPEAKER_07]: In May of 18, we required every dispensary
that was not licensed to come and meet
[SPEAKER_07]: with the commission and explain to us,
and several of you may have been in those
[SPEAKER_07]: meetings, explain to us the efforts that
you had been undertaking to become
[SPEAKER_07]: licensed.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to deal with them individually
because we know there are
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis-friendly areas and there are
cannabis-unfriendly areas.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a lot of zoning boards that took
liberties in changing rules and things
[SPEAKER_07]: like that, depending on the areas that you
were in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every one of you knew going into this,
there were going to be 102 dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have had the luxury, if you will,
of a non-competitive market up until this
[SPEAKER_07]: time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I appreciate that because patients
need to have dispensaries that are open.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the original intent always was two
dispensaries per senatorial district.
[SPEAKER_07]: That has not changed.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been no changes in the program.
[SPEAKER_07]: The commission has not made any discussion
or decision on rescinding any dispensary
[SPEAKER_07]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can tell you they have all put... Thank
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have all put efforts and energy into
becoming open, even though they're behind
[SPEAKER_07]: the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: My last question is, I'd like to hear one
suggestion for improvement and one item or
[SPEAKER_07]: story of success.
[SPEAKER_07]: What does success look like to you?
[SPEAKER_16]: I've got a quick suggestion for
improvement.
Mark's question, how can we help get the
more than 50% of the market that's now in
the queue to get certified?
[SPEAKER_16]: How can we help you make that go faster?
[SPEAKER_16]: Because basically, 30,000 people are
suffering and waiting to get their cards.
[SPEAKER_16]: We've got employees who have spent more
than two months.
[SPEAKER_16]: So it feels like that's becoming longer.
[SPEAKER_16]: And if there's any way we can expedite
that, we'll produce some... What do you
[SPEAKER_07]: mean employees for two months?
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, even employees who applied for their
cards, their medical cannabis cards,
[SPEAKER_16]: and they're still waiting after two
months.
[SPEAKER_16]: So they're also potential clients.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you talking about the complete cards,
the age of registration cards,
[SPEAKER_07]: or patients?
[SPEAKER_07]: Patients.
[SPEAKER_07]: Patients.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: More than 50% of our market now is sitting
in a queue that we can't purchase.
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_16]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems like that lag is getting longer
rather than shorter.
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_16]: I wonder if there's any way we can help or
help lubricate that process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any automated solution versus
throwing people at the problem?
[SPEAKER_07]: Not an easy one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a fast one.
No.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're working on the automation piece,
but that's not going to help us today or
[SPEAKER_07]: tomorrow or next week.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's an existing paradigm.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not the same product.
If you apply for a handgun permit or to
purchase a handgun in Maryland,
they give you a preliminary approval after
about a week and then do the real
background check that's deeper after that.
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you consider cannabis less harmful
than guns, I think it might be a model
[SPEAKER_16]: that you might want to look at just to
keep people waiting for months and months
[SPEAKER_16]: when they're suffering.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's many times been suffering for
decades.
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems kind of onerous.
[SPEAKER_07]: The pending bucket is divided among many
different situations.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the situations is we haven't been
able to touch the registration yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: The application's been put in.
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't been able to get to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other bucket is we needed to send it
back for some reason, usually the photo.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the biggest problem is the photo.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other is they've received their
registration from us, but they haven't
[SPEAKER_07]: gone to a certifying provider.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there is another bucket that I
think we are remedying with a new process
[SPEAKER_07]: is there's a bucket where people just
applied and they never intended to do
[SPEAKER_07]: anything with the program.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because of the fact that people could
register without a cost, they would just
[SPEAKER_07]: sign up.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we have seen prior to implementing
the new card ID program, we were getting
[SPEAKER_07]: 320 to 350 new applications a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: 300 to 350, average about 320.
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we implemented the $50 card fee paid
at the time of registration, we're at 200
[SPEAKER_07]: a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: So serious people are now registering for
the program.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's going to help us clear out that
queue.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the pending queue is not all
registrations that we haven't been able to
[SPEAKER_07]: get to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some are patients who need to go get
certified.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some are patients who need to get us back
information.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't work that desk.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't talk about those photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: From my perspective, is the photo
subjective?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is there an automated something behind
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it Pat at a desk looking at a
computer screen?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's criteria about what that photo
needs to meet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are individual agents looking at
the photo.
[SPEAKER_16]: If you've already got a driver's license,
I'm wondering why we can't use that photo.
[SPEAKER_16]: For instance, they don't integrate.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's one more question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something more that you can do
with hospice patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we have access to the hospice
registry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that I've had a lot of
hospice patients who have caregivers come
[SPEAKER_00]: in and we end up calling the MMCC and we
don't get answers or callbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually those hospice patients
stop coming in or their caregiver stop
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that what I was originally
told by the commission was that once
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody is in the registry, because that
is already like a list, that those people
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to get pushed to the front of
the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have had a lot of issues with
hospice patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having them have submitted but not
getting fully licensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some confusion with the
commission.
[SPEAKER_07]: If a patient indicates on their
application that they are a registered
[SPEAKER_07]: hospice patient, they do not wait in the
queue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a way that we can give
dispensaries the access to the hospice
[SPEAKER_00]: registry so that we can determine that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because usually with hospice it's not
something that you can really sit around
[SPEAKER_00]: and wait for.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we don't make them wait.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my understanding, I'm not aware we
have access to the hospice registry.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is when a patient applies they tell us
they are in the hospice program.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would think access to the hospice
registry would be a HIPAA issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have particular patients,
I'll be glad to follow up on them.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are not around anymore,
but it's hard to be in a time frame where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not getting any response.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if we know that they're hospice
patients, we process them right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that delineated on the
registration?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a filter?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have to ask that specific question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what I'm asking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I see the frustration that's on
the lady's face.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a box.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do, but there's still like,
I mean the last presentation I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: there was 177 hospice patients waiting in
the wind and if they're automatically
[SPEAKER_00]: generated to the front of the line,
why are there 177 people waiting?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not online here, but I will check and
see.

[SPEAKER_07]: a photo from a hospice patient.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if they have been registered and have
not gotten certified, they're still in
[SPEAKER_07]: pending.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we've asked them for proof of residency
or some other information and they haven't
[SPEAKER_07]: got that back to us yet, they'll still be
in the pending.

on my phone so I can see today's numbers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a report this morning.
