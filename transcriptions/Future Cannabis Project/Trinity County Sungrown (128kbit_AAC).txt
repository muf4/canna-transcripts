[SPEAKER_02]: Just quickly, tell us about the Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Trinity County has its first
official trade association, non-profit
[SPEAKER_00]: member-driven, agriculture alliance,
and basically we've been a really
[SPEAKER_00]: tight-knit community always, and we've
been doing all of our work as licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: participants in the cannabis world,
especially as farmers, all just grassroots
[SPEAKER_00]: from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And has Trinity County been a joy to deal
with?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, the regulations, the policy,
the politics, the backlash from the
[SPEAKER_00]: conservative side of the county which
borders the Central Valley and has a very
[SPEAKER_00]: different cultural mindset than Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're in the southern Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're eight miles from the Humboldt County
line in Highampong Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over a big mountain, but they're over
a mountain from us.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been a lot of community building,
too, which has been really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing I was going to say,
is it's been really painful in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to have to go out and deal with
politics, but also it's democracy in
[SPEAKER_00]: action, and we're taking it into our own
hands, and we had to because we were
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at a ban.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were looking in 2016 at Trinity County,
part of the Emerald Triangle, having a
[SPEAKER_00]: hard ban on commercial licensed cannabis,
and we had to all buck up and get out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and go start participating in our
local government, and it was high time
[SPEAKER_00]: that our generation did that because we've
been so disconnected because we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: trust it, we don't believe in it,
and I mean, mostly it's proven to me that
[SPEAKER_00]: it is exactly what I thought it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, our community was
really brought together and forced to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring these issues out into the open
because for so long in Trinity,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just like nobody talked about it in
public, everybody knew what they had going
[SPEAKER_00]: on in their backyard, but everybody had a
cover story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very still secret behind the
green curtain society even within our own
[SPEAKER_00]: communities, which are really remote and
really tight-knit, and people really look
[SPEAKER_00]: out for each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really sparsely populated county.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 14,000 people, and if you were to
iron out, flatten out all the mountains...
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you flattened out the acreage
because it's very steep?
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be the size of Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's 14,000 people nestled in these
little valleys and nooks and crannies with
[SPEAKER_00]: these huge mountains between us,
and we know the people in our communities
[SPEAKER_00]: really well, we all rely on each other
because that's how it is out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then we as a county had to all really
come together, and as people coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: different walks of life have to
acknowledge that cannabis is a really
[SPEAKER_00]: important agricultural product to our
economy, to our local economy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that we A, do need to diversify from
it, but B, also need to accept it and
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out how to take care of our
environment and bring in this industry in
[SPEAKER_00]: a way where we can actually have a say in
how we care for our watershed,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was important to us in our future
that I wish we could fish in the South
[SPEAKER_00]: Fork.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish there were more than 11 Chinook
salmon left in the river behind my house
[SPEAKER_00]: for my children, my children's children.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were a lot of reasons to do it,
to come out of the woods and have to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with regulations and the freaking
government, but also to demand our rights
[SPEAKER_00]: as human.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're supposed to be the ones
telling them what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way it's supposed to work,
so let's hold them up to it, and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: an endless job, but we finally,
after four years of working as just a
[SPEAKER_00]: tight-knit grassroots community,
came together and officially formed an
[SPEAKER_00]: organization, the Trinity County
Agriculture Alliance, and it's totally
[SPEAKER_00]: member-driven, not-for-profit,
and we were founded this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so now we have this official,
united voice, and there are a lot of us,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have legal, licensed, successful
businesses now, and we're paying taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a lot, so we're at the table,
and it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's meant mostly to focus inward on
shaping Trinity County regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the idea really is that we all have
to work together to be, we all are Trinity
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not that many of us, even all
together, we're one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all are Trinity together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of different things that we
can work together on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows about metric that we can all
talk to, and we all pay them for their
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is education and enablement of
ourselves and each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for navigating and being like,
okay, what do we need to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all figuring this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, so that the metric person comes,
and you know, because with Trinity,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're so remote, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a place where, because we can all
get together, but it's hard to get other
[SPEAKER_03]: people to come see us at each of our
spots, because we're all so far away from
[SPEAKER_03]: each other, like out in the mountains,
so it's really great when we can come
[SPEAKER_03]: together, and we can say, well,
we all need this, and we can have one
[SPEAKER_03]: person, or like, not necessarily one
person, but like the person we need to
[SPEAKER_03]: give us the information about the
regulations that we're all dealing with
[SPEAKER_03]: collectively, or the problems we're having
with something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Trinity's also really remote.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a high demand for our product,
but it's inefficient with the regulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the transport regulations,
with everything, to really reach everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: as individual farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the big concepts of working
together is a trade organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is to help get our product to market,
and to find partners we can work with
[SPEAKER_00]: collectively, and who can reach out to us
collectively, and have a way to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: vet people, also, that are good to work
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is a high demand for Trinity
product, and it's hard to know who,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to know somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a way for us to be able to also
outwardly reach out, and also,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we joke a lot in Trinity that
we're like, you know, Humboldt's best kept
[SPEAKER_00]: secret, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: This or that, because there's so few of
us, and most people, unless you're a real
[SPEAKER_00]: connoisseur, and really into the whole
story of weed, you've maybe never heard of
[SPEAKER_00]: Trinity County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if you're into weed, you've heard
of Humboldt, probably, but you might not
[SPEAKER_00]: have ever heard of Trinity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: people don't like to go up, drive that
car, depending on where they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the way it is all over the
state, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, if you're just somebody in the Bay
Area, you're like, I do the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way they've structured it doesn't
really work, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it'd be easy if I could just do my
own sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be like, yeah, I can bring it to
you, I can bring it to you, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with the regs how they are,
it's like, well, you've got to find the
[SPEAKER_03]: distributor that serves your clients.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: None.
None.
[SPEAKER_03]: None.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're still arguing about storefront
retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They set up an ad hoc, nothing's
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have non-storefront retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we finally got the service.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 14,000 people in the United of
Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, who all can get their own weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all like pulling teeth in Trinity
because we do have a really conservative,
[SPEAKER_00]: affluent demographic part of our
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's hard to push the ordinances
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in storefront retail, everybody was
like, oh, we will never have a dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: in downtown Weaverville.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I think actually the momentum has
shifted a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are working on storefront retail,
but it doesn't exist at this point in
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not actually there right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't go work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even if there were, there's
definitely always going to be way more
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation than there is going to be
retail for the amount of tourism and
[SPEAKER_00]: population that we have compared to how
much is definitely for export.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think essentially, we're all
waiting for federal laws to change and
[SPEAKER_00]: things to move on with all of the rest of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think Trinity has our pool of
buyers has shrunk way down to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even then, being inefficient
throughout more than beyond Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: California is just inefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's easier as a farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: To just work with brands and distributors
who will deal with all of the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make choices about a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, is it worth it to
worry about every store you're in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it easier to just let someone else
worry about how many jars are coming off
[SPEAKER_00]: the shelf and spend more time with your
family?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever pays me the money, it's pretty
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been insane with the
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just figuring out how to conduct
normal business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to that point, I mean, you guys have
such a unique story that you sell most of
[SPEAKER_01]: your product already in jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is there some of it that's white
labeled?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's usually co-branded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually co-branded in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no one way that it's worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very difficult as an independent
farm, unless you're vertically integrated
[SPEAKER_00]: with all the licenses all the way up,
to really get your costs back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you put into being your own brand,
because it's very expensive to be a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that financially speaking,
I make more money white labeling my
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a lot easier to just
concentrate on the farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, we're fortunate that people do
co-brand with us and give us credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm looking for somebody who's fair
and just an ethical business partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important that people get
credit for the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also have to live in reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we never have trouble with finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea behind growing good quality is
that it's going to have a demand either
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've always been able to sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were completely anonymous people
before, when we all had to pretend we were
[SPEAKER_00]: just musicians and whatever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all had our cover stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't part of our story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've kind of decided to let it be
part of our story and just speak the truth
[SPEAKER_00]: and be ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because part of the whole point of this is
that we shouldn't have to hide it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as branding our farm,
it's like, yeah, I'd love to just be an
[SPEAKER_00]: independent farm label, like an
independent wine label.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to be able to just sell it at the
farmer's market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people could come way out the amount
they want and put it in their bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so much weed that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is that I see that the reason
you guys cultivate the way you do it is
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is a branding technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee the distributors see that your
style of growing is a branding technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that being said, it resonates with the
consumers, not because it's a branding
[SPEAKER_01]: technique, but because it feels right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's the cool part of getting
your story out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the jarring, perhaps, is an easy way
to do that, because there's that
[SPEAKER_01]: recognition But the key is that it's the
distributor, the retailer, that are seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: the financial in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the retailer that's seeing the same
thing you're seeing in why you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: that way is why they're consuming that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's still a pendulum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It benefits us a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're still battling the whole,
oh, this is full season outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the price is this, commodification of
the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And total disregard for the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they will take it, and they will put
it in a jar and pretend it's indoor and
[SPEAKER_00]: put it on the top shelf and perpetuate
that myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we appreciate having partners who
recognize your saying and pass that on to
[SPEAKER_00]: the consumer and are creating access to
that for consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is why it's so important to be
honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: On all fronts, not that we weren't,
but being frank, that we know in the past
[SPEAKER_01]: brokers and whatever were playing those
games.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe I saw less of an issue with it
in the past than I do now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of like, whatever, that's their
trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I'm really seeing, no,
it's messing with the consumer to such a
[SPEAKER_01]: level when you start making that false
association, which sometimes is true,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we know so much it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a disservice to us, maybe in a
financial realm, but it's a disservice to
[SPEAKER_01]: the consumer also.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need to get over the, like,
you can grow beautiful, beautiful weed in
[SPEAKER_03]: the sun, you know, like naturally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, it's just, why is that so crazy?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had this recently, I was talking with a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Producer, and I was explaining to him the
verbiage of indoor and that in his world,
[SPEAKER_01]: like greenhouses are indoor because there
is no indoor in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fact that we don't even let
greenhouse be, that it has to be this
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, the sun and the air aren't allowed
to touch it in order to be the highest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was almost like my mind to this guy
who it's his whole world too, but not
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, that that would even be a thing,
that greenhouses wouldn't be good enough
[SPEAKER_01]: as a structure, that we'd have to have
this other thing that started off as a way
[SPEAKER_01]: to hide the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, people developed a lot of skill
and got a lot better and better obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: to where they are with indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's where it started from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I've, you know, maybe even
talked with you guys about that in the
[SPEAKER_01]: past and that that's translated from being
a necessity thing to being this sales
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a big part of it comes from this
whole, like, our modern technological view
[SPEAKER_00]: of ourselves as humans controlling and
being superior to other, like biology and
[SPEAKER_00]: the natural things in general,
that sterilization of things being better
[SPEAKER_00]: than like having probiotic, like
biodiversity, things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just technology, like people want to
become machines so that they can live
[SPEAKER_00]: forever and this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think that, mindset, people like to
play God with their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can control all factors,
like you're not in collaboration with
[SPEAKER_00]: nature, you're not, you're not like at the
mercy of the elements anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in control of everything about you
created this little world in this room and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people get really into being
like mad scientists in their laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: and it comes from just a very different
philosophy and it, to us it seems
[SPEAKER_00]: unconscionable to be like in a closed off
room to garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the whole reason we do our job is
because we want to be outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well why do you want to play God when you
can be in awe of nature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so, but I mean maybe they're not all
trying to play God, I'm being really...
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but no, totally, because it is like
that, because it's like, we're gonna make
[SPEAKER_03]: sure that there's, it's sterile,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, and people are like,
ooh bugs, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, like our, we had, our egg
commissioner did our inspection and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: awesome because he's very pro-pesticide,
he's like very old fashioned, but he came
[SPEAKER_03]: out and he was like, oh look at that
carpenter bee and look at that bug and
[SPEAKER_03]: look at this and that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, because he's a bug guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he loves bugs and it's like,
yeah, I plant these, I plant these plants
[SPEAKER_03]: and these bugs come and they eat my other
bugs that you would spray pesticides on
[SPEAKER_03]: and everybody's happy, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, and there's no chemicals involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was so stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been in big, in the big ag world for
a long time for his whole career,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, coming back to this after his whole
career and then being the ag commissioner
[SPEAKER_00]: of all these like tiny pot farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And changing our agriculture is the
biggest way we're gonna change,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, stop climate change,
or if we can, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people need to get in the dirt and,
and doing these things, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like whatever you're gonna do,
like just get in the dirt and do a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that makes a difference in plants and
flowers and more pollinators.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like the way they work is they go
from flower to flower to flower to flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if everybody just has a few,
you know, it makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like my bees go to my neighbor's
flower gardens and the flower gardens
[SPEAKER_03]: after them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like then they farm down the road and
it's, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're promiscuous bees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go like two miles or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, or maybe even more, I don't quote,
they go far, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a, I don't have a bee cam,
but that would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology is cool too, you know,
but just the idea that like we can just,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's, there's just a very different way
of thinking that went off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started as like, we have to put the
plants inside to hide them, but it turned
[SPEAKER_00]: into this like whole thing of like,
I can create a universe in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing that people forget is that
you can still be a mad scientist in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's way more fun to have other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a video game.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you want a video game where like no
things jump at you ever, nothing surprises
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how, how boring is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same every year, like when it's
outside and every, and when you're really
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the season, the full season cycle,
every year is different in so many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It affects the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's creamier this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's more tart this year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just waiting for the awareness to
the consumer and for everybody to catch up
[SPEAKER_00]: because wine has been, wine didn't start
out that way either.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look back at how prohibition and
did with that and how, how the wine
[SPEAKER_00]: industry evolved and small winemakers
couldn't sell direct retail the way they
[SPEAKER_00]: can now, they had to push for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took them a long time to be strong
enough force to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just, you know, we're seeing a
lot of similar things where we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting for it all to catch up because it
is marketable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is good for the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think getting that exposure of,
of your type of flowers into the hands of
[SPEAKER_01]: more people that maybe in their own
rights, I've seen this from some hydro
[SPEAKER_01]: growers where like, I disagree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't like a lot of the key,
the key lights in their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't like a lot of the methodology,
but what they're seeing in some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: systems is more complete nutrition than in
a failed attempt at organics or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because that biology wasn't present,
a lot of the nutrition was not available
[SPEAKER_01]: to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a subpar product and rather than
maybe correlating that and saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: how could I make these systems in play?
[SPEAKER_01]: They went with this bottled or now,
you know, raw salt nutrition program that
[SPEAKER_01]: has all these detrimental effects that we
see, but at least in their controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: environment where they're able to mitigate
some of the problems, they're getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain complete nutrition that they
weren't getting with their incomplete,
[SPEAKER_01]: non living soil organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to turn around full circle,
like see like some of the herb,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you guys produce that's getting that
full nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, I think for me, it's easier to say
like, yes, full sun regenerative organics
[SPEAKER_01]: work because it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It truly is those things versus someone
that's like six months in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great farms, great weed doing this kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it all like in a garden of grease
and green source gardens and moon geyser
[SPEAKER_03]: farms and all the radical herbs and like,
there's so much beautiful, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's people I'm not even saying
because there's so many people,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and we're getting to know so
many amazing people who put their own take
[SPEAKER_03]: on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it's an individual thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: we know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still a big conundrum as far as...
But as long as we get cut in, we're happy
[SPEAKER_03]: about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's fair as long as, but if you
want to be like, no, this is the outdoor
[SPEAKER_03]: commodity price and then sell it for five
times what you bought it for as indoor,
[SPEAKER_03]: that doesn't feel fair to me or the person
who's buying it on the other end,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Going forward, when you build upon your
practices, your application, your
[SPEAKER_05]: uniqueness, that's all in the service of
branding your products.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not bold sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's your future.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, whatever you need to do to survive,
obviously, is the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just casting your mind forward,
building on those things is all building
[SPEAKER_05]: on branding and the specials of the art
form.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's branding.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been doing those things and it's
been growing for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, none of us had farm brands
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also one of the things that we find is
interesting in branding ourselves and
[SPEAKER_03]: marketing ourselves is we appeal to
connoisseurs and most of the connoisseurs
[SPEAKER_03]: in Northern California work in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going back to kind of the list of farms
that you guys put off and even other
[SPEAKER_01]: people, I think the similarity I see
there, though, is the care for the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, the stewardship of the land,
but also care for the plant for producing
[SPEAKER_01]: really quality, or having that be a big
part of the equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like getting that out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we're going to be like as a
society, as just like humans, we're not
[SPEAKER_03]: going to go anywhere unless we start
focusing on quality in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing that's scary is that the
majority of people will always trade
[SPEAKER_03]: convenience for quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how do we change that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the retail level what happens
is they have lots of people that come in
[SPEAKER_00]: for the cheap this thing and very few
people that come in for a more expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they pay the farmer a fair price to
do a small batch quality product and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they add all the middleman costs of all
the crazy taxes, regulation, all the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, not just normal middleman costs,
and then it's finally in the packaging too
[SPEAKER_00]: because it has to be this ridiculous,
it has to be childproof, there's only like
[SPEAKER_00]: so many suppliers and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get to the final, like it's ready
for the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're selling by the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these retail stores are mostly not
that large, like what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their model is like if you were to
compare it to something else, it'd be more
[SPEAKER_00]: like a Walgreens or a CVS than it would be
like a fine wine shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's about... Yeah, but it's just
still happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just still being created.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is being created, which is difficult
because there's so many players.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I know for a fact, because I've been
for the last five years talking to all
[SPEAKER_05]: these people and marketing people,
mainstream people coming in, is that there
[SPEAKER_05]: are entities out there, big-time marketing
entities that have more money than we can
[SPEAKER_05]: ever dream of, that will be working for
these large commercial grows and they will
[SPEAKER_05]: be out there marketing the language and
the narrative, organics and all of these
[SPEAKER_05]: buzzwords.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sustainable, which you'll already see in
car commercials.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the meaning of that term.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which doesn't mean that you can't regain
the meaning of that term.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't give up that fight at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's the truth of the world out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been saying for a long time to
groups like yours and small farmers,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's nothing you can do about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this huge indoor, they're called a
flower up in Canada, FLOWR, huge massive
[SPEAKER_05]: hydroponics operation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been told that the guy who runs
it is a hydroponics guru.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what they plan to do is to put very
high-end, top-end hydroponics flower lots
[SPEAKER_05]: of it out in the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now what I think is a top dollar is
nothing on the planet can stop that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can't let yourself stop it because
there is only one Trinity.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only one Trinity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where, well, the thing that I
always think of is when you're doing
[SPEAKER_03]: indoor, you can do it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not California weed anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that we're getting into this
legalization, that's a reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: That your California indoor is just
indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now your indoor has to be better than
somebody from Canada or like the small
[SPEAKER_03]: growers who are going to come out of the
Midwest who like... For instance,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know there's a long-established main
cannabis community that has for many,
[SPEAKER_05]: many years produced willing quality
indoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they care.
[SPEAKER_05]: They care.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, people care about weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing about weed is it reflects
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to be able like whatever
they think is top shelf isn't actually
[SPEAKER_03]: going to meet the... Like somebody who
really cares about weed, there's more in
[SPEAKER_03]: it than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a special mysterious plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: On the left side of what I believe is that
cannabis for... Is it 80, 20?
[SPEAKER_05]: So for real cannabis people, they do care
about quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's an aspirational product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most families have a person who thinks
they're a connoisseur, who thinks that
[SPEAKER_05]: what they like the most, whether they do
or not, it's... But then they also...
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I used to be this person too where
I was like, I love weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will smoke any weed you give me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But in smoking all the different kinds of
weed, I got to know what was like... What
[SPEAKER_03]: do I like?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: What am I stoked on when I get that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know I'm not going to maybe get
that next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was the black market and you
get what you get, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It will get figured out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think that the people will be
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't... The retailer isn't
necessarily your friend unless you're in a
[SPEAKER_05]: relationship with them where you don't
care about your product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have relationships with retailers
who care about our product and we care
[SPEAKER_03]: about their store and that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working with Soulful and we have a
good relationship with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've had a lot of different
distributors we've gone through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so depending on the distributor,
they let you cultivate those relationships
[SPEAKER_03]: or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I cultivate these relationships
when I can't be the person distributing it
[SPEAKER_03]: or even giving them samples?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are really difficult complications.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you have to find somebody who is
really supportive of your stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's good to... Right now I feel
like...
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean for everybody it seems good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to team up with people and so we
can all raise awareness for each other
[SPEAKER_03]: because we're all small... We're not even
companies some of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just all small farms and small
producers in the Emerald Triangle who do a
[SPEAKER_03]: good job but we're not allowed to do the
outreach that we otherwise would.
[SPEAKER_03]: To have a booth at the Emerald Cup we had
an opportunity to get a booth but the
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of investment that would have to go
into just getting the booth because of the
[SPEAKER_03]: regulatory burdens was like... It's just
not even feasible.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you have to like... Well we could
have one strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But like you have to have... You either
are gonna have to like put in what you
[SPEAKER_03]: think you're gonna sell and have those all
tested which is like all those varieties
[SPEAKER_03]: or you have to have it all finished by
then to have it all tested and then it all
[SPEAKER_03]: has to go to one place.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't really move from that place very
easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't transfer things easily if that
person doesn't supply people up here and
[SPEAKER_00]: they want it and it's all stuck over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that kind of stuff happens to us
constantly with every batch, every strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not even anybody's fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when they're trying to get it to them
and doing the best they can.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the rules were man-made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah they were and they were made
specifically by certain people to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain outcome and part of that outcome
is for us not to be able to control our
[SPEAKER_00]: supply.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they are not serving the
interests.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean it's making it very difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah but the Emerald Cup isn't prohibitive
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know it's like they actually are
helpful with the contest and extending
[SPEAKER_03]: deadlines and all these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: They definitely are like supportive of the
farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like yeah it's crazy that the
regulatory... I mean it commodifies the
[SPEAKER_00]: supply and it allows us no control over
our product as it moves up the supply
[SPEAKER_00]: chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't allow us to retain its true
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows other people to capitalize on
our value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you know as a small independent
producer with not a 200 million dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: investment capital or marketing budget or
whatever and you know reach to like all
[SPEAKER_00]: these you know with like processing and
all these things you have to have now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like most small producers in the
Emerald Triangle can't process on their
[SPEAKER_00]: farm anymore without getting another
license or moving because they're not in
[SPEAKER_00]: the right zoning for that and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really fortunate in Trinity that we
can do at least do our own trimming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well like it's not necessarily processing
but we can do trimming and packaging and
[SPEAKER_03]: dry sifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't actually have to hire a bunch
of employees they are letting you do some
[SPEAKER_00]: processing on small farms in Trinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Mendocino they're not there even their
small farmers aren't being allowed to even
[SPEAKER_00]: do their you know like what a small home
business scale should be allowed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've taken that away from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're treating us like it doesn't matter
how small you are you're like this
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial like huge impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could be doing it that way so I
recognize why those things are there but
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no differentiation between us and
them and what we have to do to operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just our ability to really be a
true small craft producer and keep our own
[SPEAKER_00]: value and make our own value added
products like I used to make medicines of
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds that were handcrafted from start
to finish in tiny batches with wild
[SPEAKER_00]: crafted other plants and like really
medicinal products that I can't make
[SPEAKER_00]: without a commercial kitchen a separate
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a separate manufacturing thing than
the hash so we couldn't even even if we
[SPEAKER_00]: did all that they'd have to be like it'd
be insane you know and so there's already
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of stuff we used to do that
consumers have no access to now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there might be medical stuff where
it's like we could still provide medicine
[SPEAKER_03]: but I don't know it's very it's been very
frustrating for for every I think
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody on every side you know and even
the consumer like because oh yeah with the
[SPEAKER_05]: supply you know and even to just help
support the industry and be like
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody's like I know weed I'm gonna go
get the job that helps what good weed get
[SPEAKER_03]: on out there you know like for people you
know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah that's where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of why we even applied for the
regenerative farm award and even showed up
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Emerald Cup and like do all this
stuff was because we're like this is
[SPEAKER_00]: really this is something I could actually
really get behind and the more platforms
[SPEAKER_00]: there are to reach people the better and I
mean you just have to be authentic about
[SPEAKER_00]: it and hope that I do get I do get a lot
of feedback from people who who say they
[SPEAKER_00]: can tell the difference between just like
other corporate kind of marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: greenwashing and stuff and us and our that
we're you know they really see the real
[SPEAKER_00]: the real authenticity behind what what all
not just us but all of all of us and so I
[SPEAKER_00]: think consumers are starting to seek that
out and try and and you know it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of that game of time that you
know that we can we can keep educating and
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people haven't ever gotten to try
really amazing cannabis they have no idea
[SPEAKER_00]: what it even could be like and in parts a
lot of parts of the country it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: really difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was talking to last year to
Sunshine, Sunshine Johnson, put love and
[SPEAKER_05]: written about it and the whole thing she's
like and she's she's very knowledgeable
[SPEAKER_05]: she was a wine broker for several so she
knows more she's really on top of things
[SPEAKER_05]: and now she has her packaging and she's
like I want everyone to taste my flower
[SPEAKER_05]: and she's very serious you know very
serious about every aspect I'm like
[SPEAKER_05]: awesome how much can you produce it's like
do the numbers like the I like
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah none of it's gonna get to me down you
know
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really really where we're really
like our sights are really set like on a
[SPEAKER_00]: few humps over you know like there's a few
more hills still in between but like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking over there and that's
really where we all should be focused for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure and and direct to consumer for sure
we we used to talk about this all the time
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like we need a hundred dedicated
stoners or whatever you know like like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not gonna be in every it's not gonna
be Safeway wine it's not gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere and so part of it is finding
the people the niche the people who really
[SPEAKER_05]: care yeah I think there's gonna be more
and more of that the best champagnes in
[SPEAKER_03]: France are grown on a quarter acre yeah
we'll get there yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
