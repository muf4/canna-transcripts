[SPEAKER_01]: Do we want to talk about 2020 right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I just came from Hall of Flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just came from Hall of Flowers,
but that was at a fair ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So AB 2020 by Bill Quirk is a bill that's
also pending before the governor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It essentially would expand the number of
licensed or number of eligible venues for
[SPEAKER_00]: on-site consumption special events.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bureau created the special event
license through regulations for the
[SPEAKER_00]: emergency regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't really a statutory basis for
it, but it goes and helps provide for
[SPEAKER_00]: additional consumption opportunities,
retail sale opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, by statute, it was limited to the
degree of the consumption itself was
[SPEAKER_00]: limited to fair ground areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what this bill goes and does is
expand the eligible locations for
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just fairgrounds and district
ag associations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also could be wherever essentially a
city goes and licenses it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know there is a restricted access
to 21 plus no minors going and seeing the
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a couple other conditions,
so it's it's a bill that it's anticipated
[SPEAKER_00]: to be signed and it will go help cause an
explosion of licensed events.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a licensed event is not necessarily
compliant event and Pam went to play with
[SPEAKER_00]: the more compliant events she's seen just
earlier this week, but yeah, it just flew
[SPEAKER_02]: in from the Hall of Flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really interesting to see how a
compliant you can do a compliant event
[SPEAKER_02]: that has.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I will say the version of sampling,
because you still had to pay for your
[SPEAKER_02]: sample being very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one centralized retailer that
everything went through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting to note it was not a retailer
that was located in Sonoma County or Santa
[SPEAKER_02]: Rosa, so it will be interesting to see
where those tax the the tax implications
[SPEAKER_02]: happen there with a retailer not based
within the county or the city where the
[SPEAKER_02]: event was handled.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you got little tickets and you went up
and you had to pay $1 plus the excise tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also a little weird since sometimes the
excise tax is embedded into the cost of
[SPEAKER_02]: the product, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is still how it went.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will sort of help.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what we've seen more recently is
these pop up events that occur and how
[SPEAKER_02]: does product get to such an event?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it cannot come from the
manufacturer or the cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to go through QA QC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to go through a retailer so that
the taxes are taken out and then it goes
[SPEAKER_02]: to the event, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this will kind of help streamline
getting events in more locations,
[SPEAKER_02]: which may then help operators to
understand that they need to be compliant
[SPEAKER_02]: while they're doing, because if it's held
at a licensed facility that the city
[SPEAKER_02]: allows, there's going to be a lot more
robust regulation that goes within that,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's unfortunate with the level of
pop up events that I've been seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would happen if track and trace were
truly online and you had to account for
[SPEAKER_02]: how these samples got to an event and
didn't go through those proper channels
[SPEAKER_02]: and just came your retail, your
manufacturer, and you bring your
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturing product to a private venue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter that that's a private
venue and isn't then eligible for going
[SPEAKER_02]: through the event license rhetoric.
[SPEAKER_02]: That product is still licensed product and
needs to follow their correct supply
[SPEAKER_02]: chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hoping that 2020 does more to
instill an idea that you can have more
[SPEAKER_02]: events that therefore are responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think also there's other challenges
there though with the special event
[SPEAKER_00]: license in general in terms of the the fee
per event is a thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there a 10 event cap as well as in
the regulation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a proposed cap of 10 events per year
Did it get diluted to four?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was talk about that on some of the
2641 stuff, but not in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're still, well, I don't think we
are in a statutory cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sidebar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, there needs to be other
changes to the event language.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we appreciate the fact that this
language is being moved in, there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: just big questions on how events or NIF
events will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that's tied into if everything
has to be sold by a licensed retailer and
[SPEAKER_00]: move through the supply chain by a
licensed distributor to that retailer,
[SPEAKER_00]: is there, what incentive is there for
retailers to take a chance on brands they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have to have purchased that
product, if you have to have possession of
[SPEAKER_00]: that product for it to be at the event,
at the booth of the manufacturer,
[SPEAKER_00]: or cultivator, it's going to
disincentivize a desire to go and allow
[SPEAKER_00]: emerging brands to go and be at these
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, and that's why there was
some discussion and movement on the bill
[SPEAKER_00]: 2641 earlier this year, which did not make
it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was held in appropriations committee
near the end of the year, which will have
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed some degree of farm direct,
consumer direct access by licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even the underlying issue there is
there's just some structural issues with
[SPEAKER_00]: events and with running events through
distro and through retail that I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to address before we can have a
successful fix like 2641 or like something
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just, we need to have more
discussion about how to make events work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in some of those same issues go
through the whole supply chain,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I was just discussing today,
how is a small cultivator or manufacturer
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to attract a distributor without
the ability to provide them with a sample
[SPEAKER_01]: of their product?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean you want to try something before
you commit to buying it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No need.
[SPEAKER_01]: No need.
No need.
No need.
No need.
No need.
No need.
