[SPEAKER_09]: We're here with Brent from Flower Mills in
the valley.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, first time in the valley.
[SPEAKER_09]: First time in LA and we were like,
he needs to experience the valley.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's actually quite cool right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're not experiencing peak heat
valley.
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway, at least you got a taste of
the valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, this is good.
[SPEAKER_09]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have the Flower Mill.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the man behind the Flower Mill.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you want to give us some backstory on
how this all came about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we were talking earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was 2019, Canna Con, Detroit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've met what are who are now my
partners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that like a military?
[SPEAKER_07]: Age 47, twin rudders.
[SPEAKER_07]: They used to, it was an army transport.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now it's used for putting out fires.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to work on H-46s, the CNITE,
which is a smaller version.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in Detroit, Canna Con.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm managing some grows at the time and
just kind of entering into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: market publicly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had met John and Aaron and Jason.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are the actual guys that
invented it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three engineers that started off making
aftermarket automotive car parts for Mazda
[SPEAKER_03]: Miata's.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they were tinkering at the end
after the work with the machines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they all weed smokers?
[SPEAKER_03]: They are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not quite as heavy as maybe we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they definitely appreciate the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to hold that up yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're good, great guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're engineers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they tackled the issue with the
equipment that they had in the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it started off with a little shark
fin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that fin would just get worn down all
the way until it was completely flat like
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it became a milling screen or a
milling plate, like I like to call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is how we ended up with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as it went down, we found that we
started off with just 10 flutes in our
[SPEAKER_03]: rotor, and now we have 20 because we were
getting pancakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we kept on designing and
engineering it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the time it was Royal Health and
the product was called the Crown.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they had gotten two prototypes out of
30.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had called me back about a year later
and said, I don't know if you'll remember
[SPEAKER_03]: me, but we met you at Detroit CannaCon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, it's in my hand right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been waiting for your call.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flew out literally, I think, a week later
and made them a deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We became partners within about 10 days,
hiked Camelback Mountain barefoot
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the rest is kind of history.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, from then, we renamed it Flower
Mill and worked on the design.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of helped build the company
around a product and build a brand within
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And together we had taken it to this
level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we've got five partners total.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's me and Q and Aaron and Jason and John
in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're all over, two guys in Arizona,
one in Canada, me in Detroit, Q in
[SPEAKER_03]: Chicago.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, without them, none of this is
possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just the guy that gets to do all
the fun stuff out here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there are three sizes, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to... There's actually two
sizes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the mini mill, which is pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the magnets were a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the standard size, which is
another version of the Flower Mill that is
[SPEAKER_03]: all built in and doesn't have any
interchangeable parts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for this ring that you can put a
key catch into if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is the one that we like.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is personally what I use every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people really like the premium
version because you can customize it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can swap out these screens for
different sizes and break it down any way
[SPEAKER_03]: that you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether you're doing it for backwoods or
for vaping, you might want to go a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit finer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people, some of the professional
rollers actually do a blend of two thirds
[SPEAKER_03]: with a smaller one and one third of the
batch with a larger one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that enables people to customize it
based on their cure, based on what they're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be using the product for.
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it have a smoother burn?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, it burns more evenly and
consistently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the difference is that because of the
way that it's being processed,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're no longer grinding your mill.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're milling.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the trichromes and cannabinoids are
still stuck to the vegetable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it burns differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: It lasts longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets you a little bit more lifted and
elevated because all the good stuff is
[SPEAKER_03]: still attached to the vegetable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Completely breaks down, so it's easier for
cleaning.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I love just the industrial design.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the engineers, those guys,
you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just clean and tight.
[SPEAKER_07]: How did you come up with the actual part
you grinded?
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you call it?
The mill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so this is a rotor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Flutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, the flutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was just a process.
That's ingenious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it goes back to like milling food,
milling grains and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this has been, this technology has been
around a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just haven't been applying it to our
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I recognize the different size holes from
meat grinders.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great crossover with food.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't mean to bring up the word grinder
because this is a mill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the patents, we did get our patent
on this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why we've been kind of quiet
about coming out so strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, now that we're covered and
protected, because we know this is
[SPEAKER_03]: probably the way that you're going to want
to be processing your cannabis personally
[SPEAKER_03]: going forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this magnetic aspect is what separated
us from being able to get our patent when
[SPEAKER_03]: we were denied and we had to appeal it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were saying the pepper mill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of you were mentioning food.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, kitchen utensils.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is really close to a kitchen item.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had to say, well, there's nothing
quite like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the magnets along with these is
really what enabled us to protect
[SPEAKER_03]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just holds it together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really a cool part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing is a quarter turn off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's double threaded.
[SPEAKER_03]: So look how quickly you can separate the
housing from the base.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of them use 180 degrees and you're
spinning and spinning and spinning.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is double threaded.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very easy to get on and off.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is something that I think you just
notice after you start using it for a
[SPEAKER_03]: while, but it's, it's meant to be more
efficient, increase the quality results.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea is to make a more efficient
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do 3.5 grams at one time and
probably less than five seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can do a demonstration like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the end result is lighter and fluffier
and it's easier to roll, easier to
[SPEAKER_03]: manipulate and play with.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also, it comes alive,
which we can show on video, which is why
[SPEAKER_03]: this is so cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I'm doing this over the phone a lot
of the time or in places where I can't do
[SPEAKER_03]: it with product and show you and give you
an actual demo.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where the magic happens.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think equally as important.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to walk us through the lineup
of weed that you brought with you?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the reasons we're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess this is a pillow talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one from Tang Farms with Mosca
seeds and genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is really very special.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is from a fino hunt that we did down
in Oklahoma with Ben Grieve and Aaron,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we are partners in a new company
called Canalytics.
[SPEAKER_07]: That smells unreal folks.
[SPEAKER_07]: I smell that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It smells better than anything else on the
table at the moment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not trying to insult anybody else's bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, this is really nice,
which we can sample a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the elevated genetics Tiki Tom,
which is just another great one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are the genetics that,
you know, there, there are seeds from
[SPEAKER_03]: Mosca usually.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some raspberry pie.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are not my favorite sample jars for
this reason, but you can get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Raspberry pie is very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually one that is one of my
personal favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is, this is going to be
absolutely phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you divulge the origin of the genetics?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a Mosca and Tiki cross.
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually sell a bunch of their stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this one's Tiki, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or one of them is Tiki?
[SPEAKER_03]: Mosca and Tiki crosses for chicken.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the origin of Tiki?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's another breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's another breeder out of Michigan and
Mosca is out of Ohio.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are Midwest guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're from out, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we got like some Chris, my other
partner at Hill Street genetics and Hill
[SPEAKER_03]: Street companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Jamaican blue that I've smoked
most people done with, but I've never sold
[SPEAKER_03]: any of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a really beautiful from lamb's
bread from Jamaica from 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: We brought up, washed it back,
cleaned it out and brought it back with
[SPEAKER_03]: some, there's some great God in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Superman ice cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've created a new one that is just
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a fun one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I and I can smoke some.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I got some strawberry sauce.
[SPEAKER_09]: You said that, what was the Rohan story?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we heard from Rohan and he had,
you know, Rohan contacted me and went down
[SPEAKER_03]: to Miami to see him.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were able to actually share the
Jamaican blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there were some guys from Jamaica
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Mike James is there and you,
you know, they're mentioning how you could
[SPEAKER_03]: taste the Tarwar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the, and the, and the red clay in the
soil, which I thought was so cool,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, to, to, I've never been to
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, you're nobody until,
you know, in this industry until you've
[SPEAKER_03]: been there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thankfully I got Amsterdam and Spain
under my belt in the last couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: months.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think Jamaica and all these other
places are next.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was really cool to connect through
the plant with that family and have such a
[SPEAKER_03]: great experience with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was pretty neat because of the,
and where we connected with Lion Order was
[SPEAKER_03]: really on the fact that Jamaican blue
coffee, you know, the Jamaican Marley
[SPEAKER_03]: coffee, they mill it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So their process for making their coffee
is very similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we connected instantly on the flour
mill.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Degenex were just a fun thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've actually taken this strawberry
cough and mixed it with the Jamaican blue
[SPEAKER_03]: to give Ro exactly what he was looking
for, which is the blend of these two.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'll be out soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's it going to be called?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's up to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, we like to work with people like
that and, you know, there's a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: of spillover and other things,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, let's get to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I saw you brought some Genese here
too.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, I'm psyched.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to smoke all this tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm totally psyched to try what you
brought with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's some strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to lay all these in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: See that stem?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to leave it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically you'd dick your hands and you'd
mess it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put, uh, it doesn't get
ground in there, does it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it doesn't have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's up to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's up to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't mean to use the word
ground milled in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to stop saying dirt and ground.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't call it a grinder.
[SPEAKER_03]: So look at those stems are right there on
top without the flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I didn't go all the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went most of the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I just take my finger, take the stems
out like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That took like less than a half second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was, you know, and then look at
the end result.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never seen anything like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: You burn fewer calories.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the plant is happier.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's lighter, fluffier.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can shape it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see how it's a little bit alive.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks perfectly rollable right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what, what gradation of holes?
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is our standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have all these different ones
and we can run some through and change
[SPEAKER_03]: some different sizes to, to show you the
difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is just, is this a standard?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's the one that it comes with
naturally.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you change them, you unscrew the
thing and then you put the new one on.
Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: As of now, we're always looking to tweak
things and make it better.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want me to roll one?
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then let's do the Jamaican too,
just because this is, we're here together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, let me just plug Cali High
episode 61.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about the time I went to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: These, so this, these genetics,
the lamb's bread came from Jamaica in
[SPEAKER_03]: 1980, one year before I was born.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these guys brought back that we
actually have the photos of the seeds in
[SPEAKER_03]: the field on the mountain with the plants
and the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it was a couple of guys working
for the military came back and brought
[SPEAKER_03]: them back and we've had them ever since.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually pop these seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have any filters here?
[SPEAKER_07]: I have some in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have any.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a Midwest guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We smoke like cigarette style joints with
no filters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since we've got a moment, you know,
one of the cool things about Flower Mill
[SPEAKER_03]: is that we were able to approach people
that I don't think you otherwise would be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we went with, you know, zigzag.
[SPEAKER_03]: My father smoked zigzag oranges my whole
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, they're iconic and legendary in
their own right in my childhood.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to be able to do a collaboration with
zigzag and have it be the first collab
[SPEAKER_03]: with zigzag was really a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we made a new logo together and this is
a really cool thing that you can see out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just got their shipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that they're selling really well
right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then who else were you excited to do a
collaboration with?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, of course, Future Cannabis
Project.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one that you can get to.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we just learned the Hawaiian word for
friend, which is hoa.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all hoa here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do the blue.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was on the bottle cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I want to put a whole big nugget
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to keep that clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's nice to see the stems
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what we can do with this one.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a Jamaican?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's so fast and easy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's strawberry soda.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to do the Jamaican?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one do you want to smoke first?
[SPEAKER_07]: Jamaican?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's very special.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that I want to
experience with you guys together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, let's make this easier on you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so normally we have Otis here,
who's like the house professional roller.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's nice to just have him.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do all the rolling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our rollers will be in town tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're setting out for holla
flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have Hoppa and Bruno.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Lux rolls.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's usually who takes care of this
for me, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the best in the world,
I think.
[SPEAKER_09]: I roll sad joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at Chenza, a speed roller.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was just, I mean, together,
I think we make a good team.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely, brother.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking for a job.
[SPEAKER_07]: Podcasting is a good job.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, mind anyway, beater.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why you can find Callie High on The
Future Cannibal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll show you how it breaks apart so we
can do one that's smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've added these washers in to the
premium because so many people are just
[SPEAKER_03]: spinning these without product in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's created some metal on metal
issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're getting a lot of comments
about that, but it's very small.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's less than 1% of people are actually
having an issue with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so we put these extra rings in there
just to kind of help people that it's kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of like a fidget.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are really playing with these
often, and they like it in their hands.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the feedback on kind of like what
scenarios people, I mean, you mentioned it
[SPEAKER_09]: before, but kind of like, I love this size
hole for this purpose and that size for
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just in Europe and I ran into stores
in Bickel, the volcano.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have a volcano.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a perfect product for the
smaller holes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The consistency and the mighty is really
good for that, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that, you know, when you're
vaping, especially on the go, that it
[SPEAKER_03]: gives you your smoky vaping more surface
area at once.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's not left with bigger chunks or
something like that that is trying to be
[SPEAKER_03]: processed.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like white noise.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's about to take off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some orange soda here, which is some
of my personal favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is really delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all grown in soil with no
nutrients, no toppers, no teas,
[SPEAKER_03]: just our organic, patent-pending soil and
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we should spark one of those up.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't you, where's the, wait,
sorry, I missed that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that little step that was in here,
again, laying on top right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I spend half my time pulling out
the stems before I even put it in my
[SPEAKER_07]: grinder, not associated with the milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so look at the difference between
these two.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a finer one, right, the smaller
holes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some people like to mix these together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, what is so cool about the flour
mill is that afterwards you can't help the
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes, they liven up, they wake up and
it's much louder.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they don't get stuck to the milk.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not creating hatch up top by
grinding it together.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, check the nose on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't have got that same hit out of
the jar.
[SPEAKER_07]: True.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're all three part Italian,
at least, here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got Italian and German.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Italian and Great Britain.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm one quarter Scottish, one eighth
English and Irish, and half Italian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sicilian and Greek.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what this tastes like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Salute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stevens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Salute.
[SPEAKER_09]: You said it was from Stefano?
[SPEAKER_03]: Stefano.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nicoletti here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the lineage of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's some... Like something I
haven't tasted in a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I heard Bob Marley's favorite
strain was called the Cot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cotton.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cat Corey's son told me that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cat Corey is the guitar player from Third
World.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have a... Fact check?
[SPEAKER_03]: An ashtray.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a portable weed match one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Over there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, that works too.
[SPEAKER_09]: This will work.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little hard to pass around,
but maybe get a little one over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me... I think that Pillow Talk,
Luke, because that's... Yeah, yeah,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also the Pillow Talk was grown... What was
the most amazing smell that I smelled?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that is it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Pillow Talk?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it wasn't the Kiki, it was the
Pillow Talk, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Cenza, what was your lamb's bread
story?
[SPEAKER_07]: My lamb's bread story?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so I went to Jamaica in 75,
a year after I graduated high school,
[SPEAKER_07]: because my brother told me there was
Rastafarians that smoked weed there,
[SPEAKER_07]: and that was kind of their religion.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I bought myself a ticket after selling
a bunch of Colombian and I got to Negril
[SPEAKER_07]: and met a Rastafarian named Reefard Ward.
[SPEAKER_07]: He turned me on to reggae for the first
time also.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were sitting in my tent on the sands of
the Negril Yacht Club under a palm tree,
[SPEAKER_07]: and he told me that lamb's bread is
actually a technique.
[SPEAKER_07]: You cut off the top eight inches of a
plant right after it starts to bud and
[SPEAKER_07]: stick it back in the ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: In Jamaica, the muddy soil acts like what
we would put our clones in, and it takes
[SPEAKER_07]: root and becomes an amazing... That's a
cool story, I never heard about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so the plant is going to be about
that big, but it just becomes... A cola on
[SPEAKER_00]: its own, a cola plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and that's what they called lamb's
bread.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, we've got to try that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Years after that, people came up with a
strain they called lamb's bread.
[SPEAKER_07]: That smells great, what's this one?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Pillow Talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Masca, and Tang Farms, and House of
Kush, and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tang is Ben and... Ben and Aaron and
Brent, yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we've created a new company called
Canalytics, and that's a whole other
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation for another day, but I think
they'll be really happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's no longer with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ben is with us, so that enables us to do
things that he wasn't otherwise able to
[SPEAKER_03]: do, so I think that it's going to be a lot
of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just got back from Oklahoma,
so Ben did the feno hunt, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Coco, we've got down there,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did soil, so this came from soil,
and so he just did these.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had about 250 that he popped,
and this is one of the best ones that we
[SPEAKER_03]: came back with, so let's give this a go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cross-contaminating.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right,
[SPEAKER_09]: what was the second joint we had rolled
out?
[SPEAKER_07]: That was still Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_07]: I never rolled one of the other ones yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's two of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can roll one of those real quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not as quickly as you can mill it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have fun party tricks while you're
rolling?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is so cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes it harder for me to rip off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I didn't even know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check this out, too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_09]: I did not know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll stick to your refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll stick to anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a nice relationship with things
and people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's made with love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the mission behind our company,
and what are we trying to be, and what are
[SPEAKER_03]: we trying to do here?
[SPEAKER_03]: And after a couple of weeks of hammering
it out in person in Arizona, we came up
[SPEAKER_03]: with, we want to make products that bring
people joy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to make people happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to enhance your relationship with
cannabis, make it easier, better.
[SPEAKER_03]: We run 34 pounds through one of these
without cleaning it.
[SPEAKER_03]: At one of the labs in Michigan,
shout out to Lit Labs and Mark and the
[SPEAKER_03]: boys over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Gene, they had a power mill.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love good industrial design,
good engineering.
[SPEAKER_09]: And small business.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're checking all my boxes.
[SPEAKER_09]: How many guys are in the company?
[SPEAKER_03]: Five now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all partners.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're still doing this on our own.
[SPEAKER_03]: I handle all the sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aaron runs everything out of the shop in
headquarters in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_03]: We brought on Q.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's masterful at the back room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out here like a maestro with a
rolling paper over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Pete and Chris.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chris was the best roller.
[SPEAKER_07]: He taught me how.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, shit, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I should get a mic stand maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, no, my brother Chris taught me
how to roll when I was about 12,
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe 13.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have something here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is probably one of my favorite
genetics that has not been just yet
[SPEAKER_03]: discovered.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love your opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Pillow Talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I thought was the best
smelling herb of the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are actually Mosca seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know that that's.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I can ask Rick what crossed with what.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also to get back to Aaron and John and
Jason are the engineers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the guys that crank out all the
cats, all the everything else.
[SPEAKER_07]: Super smooth, floral, earthy, and a little
bit fruity.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like underlying, what kind of fruit
would that be?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where we need Gabe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Gabe is like my voice in terms of.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be like, it tastes fruity,
but like he'll wax poetic about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the gage.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to Gabe and we wish he was here.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to try and do our best to
describe this.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is super smooth.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is super tasty.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it has many elements.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, but it works together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we care about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We pay attention to our terpene profiles
and the cannabinoids and the blends of
[SPEAKER_03]: those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you have these high THC's and
that really takes away from helping your
[SPEAKER_03]: pain receptors and actually getting the
full benefit of the entourage of the
[SPEAKER_03]: entire plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're growing it specifically for
one cannabinoids and there's hundreds and
[SPEAKER_03]: hundreds and hundreds that you do and
don't know about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you're in some ways overlapping the
positive that you can get.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, it's very good.
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you think of the fromage?
[SPEAKER_03]: I only had a couple of hits, but it
started this conversation off,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel very comfortable.
[SPEAKER_09]: And those are growing over there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quatro fromage.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was so fortunate during the rain.
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried to keep the strain alive during
the cold winter and I had two mothers and
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, oh, I'm gonna have better take
some cuttings.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I took some cuttings and then like a
week later, the two mothers got powdery
[SPEAKER_07]: mildew and I've never had powdery mildew
because I don't have the right stuff and I
[SPEAKER_07]: was moving the plants in and out.
[SPEAKER_07]: The change of temperature and the dampness
because of all the rain gave them powdery
[SPEAKER_07]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think I never had on the cannabis
plant ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I chopped them down and threw them
away.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how long have you been gardening?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, straight for about five years,
six years now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I grew a successful crop back in like
1984.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: In Moraga Canyon, just east of the 405
where Gaspar de Portola was led by a group
[SPEAKER_07]: of Chumash Indians in 1769.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Bel Air.
Right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we could roll one of these up too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what we can do is see if it... We
never rolled one of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is delicious.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we roll one of these.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a Jamaican, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So wait, then what's this joint?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the... That's another Jamaican
from the beginning, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I thought you meant the one we're
bringing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why don't we put it with what is it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause we're gonna... Let's, let's repeat
the name of this again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pillow Talk, Alaska Tang Farms.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're gonna hear about that
folks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what state is that from?
[SPEAKER_07]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to boot camp in Great Lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that Illinois?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's Illinois.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is all connected.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Great Lakes is a little city north
of Chicago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I was thinking about all the Great
Lakes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The largest freshwater.
[SPEAKER_07]: Naval Training Center there.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: So are we a Red Wings fan?
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, the Raspberry Pi I was just with
Darren McCarty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And shout out to the Red Wings and Darren
McCarty.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they the football team or...?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: The hockey.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, hockey.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he played in like the 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a legend.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we... I went to a game with... With
like the Steve Iserman.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that's right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fedorov.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm a hockey player.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to play a lot of hockey.
The Bruins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The original six.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yesterday was a tough day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they got Pertuzzi, who was a former
wing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he just got traded over there and he's
already doing good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was with McCarty and our friends at
I-Spire and we were in Detroit and went to
[SPEAKER_03]: a game, ran into him, got together the
next night out in Hazel Park.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I brought some Raspberry Pi and some
flour mills to say thank you for the night
[SPEAKER_03]: before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just clicked and had a great time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I shared the Raspberry Pi and we shot
a video of him smoking it and... Listen,
[SPEAKER_05]: DMACC here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Darren McCarty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm smoking on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ras...berry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ras...berry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't forget to pee.
[SPEAKER_05]: Berry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Love you, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Raspberry Pi.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Rasp.
[SPEAKER_03]: R-A-S-P.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of people say Razz.
[SPEAKER_03]: Raspberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because this industry is probably part to
blame.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the R-A-Z-Z and the flavors of
gummies and the different products.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm actually with Roe in Miami before
this meeting in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're laughing so hard about Raspberry
Pi.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I tell him the story while we're in
Detroit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tell him Darren that story and he goes,
Raspberry Pi.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend's recording it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, like a week later after that,
there's a music, a song made from that,
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking that joint Raspberry Pi from the
audio recording of the video.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's evolved in this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Raspberry Pi warrants that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the club remix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a remix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like before I got here, just before I got
to California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really, you know, it's cool to be
able to work with those people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love music.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know... You play?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but Detroit, electronic... No,
Detroit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, come on, Motown,
electronic music festival scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: All that is, you know, part of our blood.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really cool that this industry and
these products and the genetics that we
[SPEAKER_03]: bring together can cross over into the
mainstream like sports.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get to meet people that you like
and might want to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like being able to work with Zig
Zag or with, you know, former Red Wings
[SPEAKER_03]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've wanted to do kind of like,
like skateboarding content and surfing
[SPEAKER_09]: content and music content and like hockey,
like sports content.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just like, let's smoke weed and
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do two minutes in the penalty box.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's talk about the cosmos with an
astronomer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like imagine if you had Neil deGrasse.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you had a Neil deGrasse and just got to
smoke weed and ask him whatever... We'll
[SPEAKER_07]: leave off the Tyson because that's better
for the future cannabis project.
[SPEAKER_07]: Neil deGrasse.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even think about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: He even has a name that works.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to shout out to something that I
think is really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know...
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is another organic... Raspberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Raspberry pie, which is another mosca.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is really good too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cross.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't been... You know, I only sit in
my backyard smoking my own weed mostly.
[SPEAKER_07]: All these highs are different though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give me some weed, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: But these are... This is freaking amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're enjoying this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't smoked like a variety of really
great weed in a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably since the last time I was at
Peter's... I was going to say that's every
[SPEAKER_07]: Tuesday night.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that's what I love about the event.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just weed comes in from everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shout out to the sessions.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's so many joints going around.
[SPEAKER_07]: Santa Monica.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess that's West LA.
[SPEAKER_07]: Border of Santa Monica.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you get to a point where just
everyone's so high and they're like
[SPEAKER_09]: shaking the joints off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like a pitcher shaking off a call.
[SPEAKER_09]: Next time I'm bringing my melodica,
somebody's going to play the bomb.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you brought it and you never played
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can play it right now, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I was DJing, bro, in case you didn't
remember.
[SPEAKER_09]: You were terrible.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait a minute here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, we had the worst records to play
with.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that night.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were playing vinyl and we were just
using the vinyl that they provided us at
[SPEAKER_09]: the recording studio.
[SPEAKER_09]: But because those turntables had shitty
needles on them, they didn't want to give
[SPEAKER_09]: us any of the good vinyl.
[SPEAKER_09]: They gave us stuff they didn't care about
scratching up.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was terrible music.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some great albums.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did the best with what I had.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't that bad, was it?
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Better than nothing, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it was also coming through terrible
speakers.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had like a double whammy of the
speakers.
[SPEAKER_09]: You had the high end and like no mid and
bass.
[SPEAKER_07]: What about the second time I DJed with my
phone?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we were fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: DJed from your phone?
[SPEAKER_07]: I started to put it in love.
[SPEAKER_07]: Played music.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I DJ, it's a commitment to like getting
back into it because I don't want to like
[SPEAKER_09]: if I do it, I'm going to like start
spending time at home going through music.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like something that if you enjoy it,
it's like an art.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you enjoy making art, why not make
it good?
[SPEAKER_09]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have no time for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I throw the playlist together
or I just need other people to DJ.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you ever use like simulated turntable
stuff with like reverb?
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to use turntables and then I
started using Ableton.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I do, you know, like so many people
DJ with like the, what is it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Tractor.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what's the other one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Garage.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one that comes with Apple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ableton though, that's been going around
for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Detroit, that's really popular.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, no, Ableton, I love just being
able to like... This one is very strong.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or they're all at the Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what's so cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you said it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you guess is the THC content of
that product?
[SPEAKER_07]: Not as high as you would think from the
effect because of the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's special.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says 19%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've never, I don't walk around with
COAs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to prove a point,
you know, with those.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's amazing is I would not sell in the
dispensary market.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't get this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the quality of the high.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the number of percentage of THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's, yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an entourage of different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some DJ Short down in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some Grape God.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the whole lineage of it if you want
to know, but yeah, that's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we say, I like the line,
you know, you can't really, you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: pick out, choose your dessert based on the
sugar content.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not how you go find things that you
like.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or your alcohol based on the... You
drinking Everclear tonight?
[SPEAKER_09]: Making oil with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, we're drinking... Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my current favorite beer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's to the flour mill and the
partnership.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks for your hospitality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our partnership with the Future
Cannabis Project.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to click my beer here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can get these.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Salute.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you hear about the flour mill?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where was your first interaction with it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we, at the events, someone was
bringing one.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the FCP sessions, that is cool because
you see new stuff pop up and it's like,
[SPEAKER_09]: that's cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was one of them where I
immediately, I mean, I reached out,
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I reached out to you right away.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's strawberry soda.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I do like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That one's strong too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, but we haven't gotten to the one
you've been hyping.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wait, that was the pillow talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pillow talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the thin one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pillow talk.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard after the third hit folks to
actually get the flavor that you can
[SPEAKER_07]: describe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then like, I have to do all the
production.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm like super hot.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why I love this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I volunteer to edit anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: Audio, video, I'll put it together.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll send it to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I love being able to work with people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That gives us the ability because we're
not a grinder, not everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have to do collabs and
partnerships.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're very selective about who we want
to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we pay attention to your history,
your involvement, who you are,
[SPEAKER_03]: character is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we come from bringing morals,
ethics and values and business acumen to
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: These things cost more to make.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not trying to make the prices high
because we think they're worth more and
[SPEAKER_03]: that you should pay more.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because that quarter turn threading
right there, that costs an extra,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like almost $2 just for that extra
double threading, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that adds up with the quality of the
magnets, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, and we know what we
created.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, you know what you've created and how
important it is to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for having us and doing a collab
with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well then thank you for being willing to
do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nah, I was totally psyched.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanted just to mention your logo
because I think it's the coolest logo I've
[SPEAKER_07]: seen lately for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the past week.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm going to say within the decades,
this is one of the coolest.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you seen a cooler one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Three years ago today, my basement wall
was covered in pictures of all Flowermo
[SPEAKER_03]: logos, what they could and wouldn't be in.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one was not on there yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is it, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So can we see this over here?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know, do it on this one,
on this one.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: Check his hat out and his shirt.
[SPEAKER_07]: The shirt is so cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to get close and intimate.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we just made some new sweatshirts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Stuff is recycled.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that physique.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Dad pod.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: My daughters sing songs about my fat belly
in Chinese.
[SPEAKER_07]: How does it go?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like that foods or something like fat
belly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's motivating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My kids walk by and slap my belly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, you know, always motivating.
[SPEAKER_03]: So James made a new rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: No candy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did we smoke everything?
Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the orange.
[SPEAKER_07]: The orange.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have not smoked the orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Chris Wasco's stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Chris Wasco lives in Michigan as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's got just a beautiful history.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he's related.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a partner, Andy, and they got a
spot up in Lapeer, Michigan and Vassar,
[SPEAKER_03]: a couple of licenses up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Chris has put together over with his
family.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like with his grandfather starting
fishing, you know, 30 years ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: teaching him how to make soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he's really mastered the technique
of living soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where I feel these terpenes
really come out and express themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's gotten 4.2 back on COAs for turf
profiles on these.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a very clean and he's a plant
person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Terp is really high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, typically you're between one and 2%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think if you're getting between two
and three, you're doing really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's like a nice place to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are hitting between three and four,
but they're using it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're using a lot of things to pump it
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not even my thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not the expert on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I won't go into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we have Ben.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I got Ben as a partner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ben Grieve and Aaron.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we've got some pretty solid
people that that's what they do.
[SPEAKER_07]: What were you saying the number is?
[SPEAKER_03]: 4.2%, which is high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's from water and dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing else.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hot and cold mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that's what.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't need a pen or a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't go, hey, where's the poker?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're you're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's give you take to dry on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can taste those terpenes right
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's soda.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why we call it soda.
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of fizzes on the side of your
mouth and you'll.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the soda line is what Chris has come up
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's responsible for the Jamaican blue and
the lemon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have lemon haze with me, which is one of
my personal favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the combination of having people
that have dedicated their lives to these
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're able to kind of bring these out into
the mainstream.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has like a deep OG underneath the
orange somewhere down there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems this is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is this is like really worth
investing in.
[SPEAKER_07]: And smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we license our genetics out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And really.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you just don't make flour mill.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the company we invested in.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're partners in House of Kush and,
you know, some of the newer genetics and
[SPEAKER_03]: designer genetics that are coming out that
people looking forward to stay ahead of
[SPEAKER_03]: the curve, but also with that have a story
and have a legacy and have.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, balance between what we're
looking for today, but we're not trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: play these high T games and all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of this stuff does test out high.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cream sodas are 32 percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is between 26 and 30 percent all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: They yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's been tested for commercial
viability.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you need me to further test out any,
I'll be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, your opinion is valued.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they're all unique.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we get to do this all over again
tomorrow night.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you coming?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be there, bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this leads me to think that Michigan
has the kind like Cali, like California.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is some serious talent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got heavyweight heads out there and
they're actually the ones that are growing
[SPEAKER_03]: lion order stuff in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've got some.
[SPEAKER_03]: They started with their sunshine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you got Trick Trick and Willie J.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peso with their giraffe head.
[SPEAKER_03]: And shout out also to Riddle's J.O.
[SPEAKER_03]: with his runs and skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been hanging out a lot the last
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really think his genetics are some
of the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: He found Girl Scout cookies and some of
the originals that we all know today under
[SPEAKER_03]: all these brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are able to work with some of these
kind of, you know, to me, they're the
[SPEAKER_03]: godfathers of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's other people that just been
gifted stuff the right way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there's plant people over
people, people and some of these growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to run into them at a
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to know them or be introduced to
them because you're doing something
[SPEAKER_03]: different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it comes down to the business
side of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make, enable people to do what
they're good at, eliminate all the
[SPEAKER_03]: marketing and the accounting and all the
stuff that gives them headaches,
[SPEAKER_03]: build a team around them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's part of what is making a
difference is, you know, we're not just
[SPEAKER_03]: here to sell shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to help.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's added service.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like these are things we know from having
other businesses in our lives before we
[SPEAKER_03]: got to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's helpful to be a financial planner.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's helpful to have been a defense
contractor and sold weapons to the
[SPEAKER_03]: government.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's helpful to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
Teacher.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I just gave him a better listener.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I see people that have
talent in this, in this space,
[SPEAKER_03]: in this industry, but sometimes they're
getting wiped out by bigger people
[SPEAKER_03]: consuming them or getting the contracts or
not protecting themselves or following
[SPEAKER_03]: through and not doing what they say
they're going to do and collecting money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I think there's a lot of
that going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just trying to do really good
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sleep well at night.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not, you know, you have people to do
it for the money and people do it because
[SPEAKER_07]: they love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was 13 years old when I tasted my first
cannabis and it was to this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the nog.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see it in my head.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was up on the hill behind my house under
the avocado tree with my older brother and
[SPEAKER_07]: my friend who had gotten high before me
and they got me high and I could not stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the person I smoked with was Ben
as my mom's friend's kid and we spoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think out of everybody I've smoked,
he's the only person that doesn't smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: weed that I've smoked weed with my whole
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the first person, the first person
never did after that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think I turned a bunch of high
school friends on to weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: They smoked for the first time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I smoked all through high school,
but they smoked for the first time at
[SPEAKER_09]: graduation at my house.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then two of them just became like all
day smoke, like just bare heaviest donors.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like every day for the past 30 years,
all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: True story.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got caught at school smoking in the
tree house.
[SPEAKER_09]: I started that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got caught and the police came at
school and we were in front of the
[SPEAKER_03]: lunchroom and we got suspended for a week
and our parents put us together for an
[SPEAKER_03]: entire week.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got high.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got high and played video games and
hung out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we were alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our parents were at work and that was our
punishment in high school for getting
[SPEAKER_03]: caught with weed was to spend a week
together and think about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got busted in eighth grade.
[SPEAKER_07]: With like no parents around.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think about this one?
[SPEAKER_07]: We got busted in eighth grade.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the lay teachers saw us smoking
behind a laundromat and told that they had
[SPEAKER_07]: none.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they had none.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had me in class and she had to go get
the bell rang.
[SPEAKER_07]: She had to get the kids in.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was up against the blackboard.
[SPEAKER_07]: The class is talking to me and she comes
in and she goes, Nicoletti, I thought I
[SPEAKER_07]: told you to stand with your nose against
the blackboard.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, no sister, you didn't say that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then she slapped a few kids and me
several times during the year.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she went to slap me.
[SPEAKER_07]: She goes, Nicoletti, you have the colossal
gall.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she goes to slap me and I had to grab
her hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then she tried to slap me with her
other hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: I grabbed that one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry sister, I can't let you hit me
anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you head butted her.
[SPEAKER_07]: The class went, yay, Nicoletti.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to butt their hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: She started shaking and goes, stay,
go out in the hallway.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't stand up to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take my abuse.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, my mom knew I smoked anyway,
so it wasn't a big deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, we used to smoke on the lawn at
North Hollywood High in a big circle
[SPEAKER_07]: passing a water pipe full of hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like the vice principals like over by
my hoop house right over there,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bass going to festivals later
and seeing like your janitor, teachers
[SPEAKER_01]: from high school, they're out smoking in
public.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fun one.
[SPEAKER_01]: 72.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was 10th grade at North Hollywood
High.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the guy that was the hash connect
lived above my avocado tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Live above your avocado tree.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he also came with avocados.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We met under the avocado tree.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fresh made tortilla chips straight from
the oven.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a Haas avocado tree.
[SPEAKER_07]: When it had avocados, they were really
good.
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't have them every year.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'd like to have a good avocado
tree.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to have a pollinator around if
it's a female.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a female and male thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it in everything?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you just have to get some root
stock.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you graft on certain avocat like,
because if you eat a good avocado and you
[SPEAKER_09]: plant that seed, it's not going to be the
same.
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you need, if, if you nail down
something you like, like Haas or whatever,
[SPEAKER_09]: that's like now from clones of parents.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and, and then, and then, um,
put onto like a different avocados root
[SPEAKER_07]: stock, like a lemon tree like that in the
front, the real lemon bearing part is
[SPEAKER_07]: grafted onto some other citrus or lemon
type with giant thorns, like, like,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, Prince Charming.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet those are amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're Meyer lemons.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they're very sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll go home with one tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have we sampled everything?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, we didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't go for the, uh, Tiki Tom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You choose.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little gassier.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else?
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the other one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the raspberry pie.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were talking about the raspberry pie.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to do the raspberry pie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do this one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's the one you were hyping up.
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't even smoked it yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're getting too high.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no too high unless you like are
too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: This should take us somewhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: This has the most amazing automatic
removal of stems I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe how this happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going on this finer holes because a
lot of professional rollers and people
[SPEAKER_03]: that roll really want the smaller grain
and look at those hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: Five seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes a little bit longer with the,
um, with the smaller holes and the more
[SPEAKER_03]: course it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're basically one turn.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was probably a six or seven,
but look at that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: A regular grinder doesn't, it comes out
smelling nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it wakes up the flower and it
prepares it for its purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that to me is what's so special about
this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The end result.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun to talk about all that and you
know, the process is cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: What it's doing and how it's doing it,
but this is just awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you excited to smoke your next joint?
[SPEAKER_07]: I am very excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: This, this smells like, um, could be the
best one so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes me feel good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause you don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the one he's been hyping up the most
all night.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's available.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody else has that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very whiny, very whiny,
like red whiny, very like a Chianti or
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe more.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could look at the lineage.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think after you rolled this,
we should have one more beer and then call
[SPEAKER_09]: it a night.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the lineage on that Jamaican blue,
uh, it's an indica dominant hybrid strain
[SPEAKER_03]: created through crossing an old favorite
DJ shorts, original blueberry crossed with
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamaican land race, BX, then crossed with
Superman ice cream, which is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: God.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is your favorite and infamous
cataract Kush BX Jamaican blue blends
[SPEAKER_03]: floral notes with sweet tropical citrus
flowers, finishing with delicious berry
[SPEAKER_03]: tartness that will linger on the tongue.
[SPEAKER_03]: The aroma consists of a citrus and
tropical floral overtone that is slightly
[SPEAKER_03]: berry and sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamaican blue experience has a nice
lifting effect that comes from its
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamaican lineage that fades into a
relaxing and slightly sedative long
[SPEAKER_03]: lasting high coming from its indica
ancestors.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll feel a euphoric cerebral onset that
will fill you with a pure happiness vibe,
[SPEAKER_03]: pushing out any negative or racy thoughts.
[SPEAKER_03]: A light tingly body high comes next
creeping up on you before you suddenly
[SPEAKER_03]: take hold or pulling you on a state of
relaxation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The terpene in combination with its
moderate THC level, as I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: is about 19%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, comes from some CBG as a bonus to give
Jamaican blue on experience that is
[SPEAKER_03]: entirely unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I give out a lot of stuff that's high in
CBG hoping that people play with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have CBG gummies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lit labs are doing those are just pure CBG
gummies, which is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing, I have like, um,
some dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing dabbing like terp, like terp
pens and just dabbing pure CBG.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have psoriatic arthritis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how do you get it pure?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just order the API, you know, it's the
effect instant and it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel of a pure CBG, like Joel tier
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like a little CBD in my gummies,
especially.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't had any light because I've been
just making edibles from my own stash,
[SPEAKER_07]: but all right, let's light this thing up.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it called?
[SPEAKER_07]: Raspberry?
[SPEAKER_09]: Raspberry pie.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't call it raspberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can see how that one based on the
finer grind, why people like that is very
[SPEAKER_03]: much like a cigarette on the end of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the way that lit up is no,
I'm the actual hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that was noticeable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I don't use that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where'd you just say, where's camera two?
[SPEAKER_09]: Look good on camera too.
[SPEAKER_07]: The lighting of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You might have to make a commercial out of
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of these got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can zoom in on the software.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here, here I can fix it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Filter astray.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just have to reroll it a little bit
tighter.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is where we cut in some dubby music.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's playing while Chenzas fixing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only do I roll, but I repair,
I stand by my work.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will, I will repair it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Raspberry pie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a song for it that we could,
I could play actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just play the actual song while
we're smoking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, here it is on my phone right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the remix though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked the first one better, but let's
see.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to play the original one first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause this one's it's just epic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you know what I should do?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to show you the video.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of the moment, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's even cooler and you can see
how this evolved naturally.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a wrong size filter is what it is,
but you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just be careful.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have sticky lips because of
all the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that last one was a very, I call it an
oiler.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the orange one, orange soda,
orange soda.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember seeing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then about a week later, I'll wait for
the plane to fly over.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit louder.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is
[SPEAKER_03]: Marcus Christie in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the original.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he sent me the remix.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then he added some sports shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a, so that came from the night that
we sharing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this has already become just kind of a
legendary genetic for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been, it's good.
[SPEAKER_09]: My drive home tonight is going to be very
slow on the 405 will be like right hand
[SPEAKER_09]: lane in the Prius going 50.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have balls of hash that are aging.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're in the middle of June.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had other phenotypes of the cross
between the Afghan land race and the OG.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them took after the Afghan had
cedar like smelling big buds, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: donkey dig.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the one that took after the OG had
like nuggets, you know, space nicely,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you excited for the caterpillars this
year?
[SPEAKER_07]: I already caught one at the base of one of
the plants out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I lifted up something that I was
looking for Phoenix, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: bugs for Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a, a leopard gecko and it needs
insects.
[SPEAKER_07]: I, and when I don't buy crickets or find
them around here and it's been too cold
[SPEAKER_07]: for crickets, I have to look sometimes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to get what's underneath the pots.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I lift up a pot and there's pill
bugs or worms or stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a constant battle.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but I found a caterpillar under there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I killed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, Mr. Caterpillar.
[SPEAKER_07]: May you be reborn in a better existence
next time.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I didn't want to take a chance and
it's spreading.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_09]: I killed so many of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I have a jar rubbing up with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just drop them in there and there's
like 50 of them in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: The net is there because one year I was
completely devastated by caterpillars and
[SPEAKER_07]: I had grown some kind of Hawaiian strain
that, um, wasn't used to California heat.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was weak.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know, maybe I didn't cover it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cold.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, why don't we wrap up?
[SPEAKER_09]: But yes, I do agree with you.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a, it's a brisk night in the Valley.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: But these are the most amazing machines
for, for getting your cannabis into a
[SPEAKER_07]: roll.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the zigzag one.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Flower mill.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll leave you with one.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to be a Miller.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think so amazing is the top of
the rotor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the rotor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Little flutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it doesn't do metal on metal friction.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because of the, um, washers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're working.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's, it's, you know,
when you create things that are this,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's innovative and a very saturated
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, you're going to take on all
kinds of stuff, but you know, it's the,
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had incredible success on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally haven't had any issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never seen anything like transformed
out, but into trying to not grind milled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different final result.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's solved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the whole point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it treats the product with
respect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your flower is happier.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're happier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It smells pure.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't smell like it's gone through a
grinder.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Brent, I hope your first trip ever
to the Valley was memorable.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that the next time you're in the
Valley, you'll be like, I remember the
[SPEAKER_09]: last time I was in the Valley.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to host you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
