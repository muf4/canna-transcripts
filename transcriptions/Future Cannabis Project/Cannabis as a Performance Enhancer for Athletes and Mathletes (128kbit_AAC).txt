[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a couple guys that would smoke
regularly and it was like something they
[SPEAKER_00]: did every day wake up smoke get off the
practice they smoke and a couple who told
[SPEAKER_00]: me that it actually dulled the pain
increased their pain threshold so like you
[SPEAKER_00]: said I think it is kind of cheating
because all the guys that were never
[SPEAKER_00]: injured they were always at practice
they're always focused having a good time
[SPEAKER_00]: were the guys that smoke weed you know I
don't know if it's because they're they're
[SPEAKER_00]: just relaxing living life they're just out
there getting it but actually you know you
[SPEAKER_00]: start to realize that their inflammation
is worse they're less pain and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: functioning properly yeah so it's it's
amazing to see that the people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: using were the ones that were actually
doing good and the ones that weren't were
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones that were feeling the pain and
whatnot so that's kind of productive what
[SPEAKER_00]: they teach you growing up is that oh it's
bad you smoke it's gonna ruin your lungs
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna get cancer which I don't know
anybody that has passed away from cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: from smoking weed or overdose either you
could have too much of an edible and you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like you're gonna die you don't
actually die
