[SPEAKER_01]: I've told people they're gonna have to
like let 30 to 50 acres open up in Willis,
[SPEAKER_01]: Covillo, Leightonville, you know all the
small valleys and you'll get like 15 jobs
[SPEAKER_01]: per acre and then you're gonna have like
$70,000 a year jobs and a lot of the small
[SPEAKER_01]: communities can at least survive and they
can have like livelihoods and live well
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're not gonna see the freewheeling,
you know people making big bucks anymore
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think on small farms you're gonna
you're just not going to even on large
[SPEAKER_01]: farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know the margin's not there you know
one of the you know kind of macro
[SPEAKER_02]: environment things that exists right now
is if federal legalization was able to
[SPEAKER_02]: happen in any sort of reasonable rate if
the walls were able to come down and
[SPEAKER_02]: California cannabis was illegal to you
know send throughout the country you know
[SPEAKER_02]: there would be jobs jobs aplenty for
farmers all over California you know the
[SPEAKER_02]: small you know five ten thousand you know
twenty thirty thousand square feet would
[SPEAKER_02]: have a place because you know the country
is is a much much bigger market than just
[SPEAKER_02]: California right now with California we
have a glut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would also break open worldwide
obviously once you go across the country
[SPEAKER_01]: you open the worldwide markets up and then
people said that they so for us Thermal
[SPEAKER_01]: Triangle name will mean a lot more outside
of California outside of LA than it will
[SPEAKER_01]: inside I think going around the country
but all that's definitely true but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: holding on till then and at this point
it's such a rapid extinction event you
[SPEAKER_01]: know most of the people be gone before it
ever gets there so it's sad to see happen
[SPEAKER_02]: because you know at our core at bloom
farms we've we've really built into the
[SPEAKER_02]: culture of the company our desire to
support small farmers you know ninety
[SPEAKER_02]: percent of our biomass that's used to make
our products is sourced from small farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're just kind of starting to stop
returning calls and again and shutting
[SPEAKER_02]: down operations and going out of business
so it's it's heartbreaking to see we've
[SPEAKER_00]: had a similar experience at rosette we've
watched our farmers just implode and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: been very difficult over the last year to
sustain their costs of getting compliant
[SPEAKER_00]: getting their licensing as a small farm
one of the things that I'd like to see and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how it would happen would be
some type of access to non-predatory
[SPEAKER_00]: lending for small farmers so they can
actually get ahead of their costs so they
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually create a business that's
what's really killing them right now if
[SPEAKER_00]: you notice pretty much everybody's going
out and getting funding right now and as a
[SPEAKER_00]: business that's going to scale that's a
lot easier than a small farmer to conceive
[SPEAKER_00]: and so you know I'd like to see companies
form that actually would bring these
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers in and help create some type of
fun for them or government funding for
[SPEAKER_00]: them of some kind because that's really
what could save the small farm just like
[SPEAKER_00]: all of us really we need the funds to get
ahead of the machine I agree with that but
[SPEAKER_02]: also you know systemically you know you
can borrow all the money in the world you
[SPEAKER_02]: can raise all the money in the world but
if the margins just don't exist due to
[SPEAKER_02]: taxes regulation cost for licensing the
margins don't exist there's no scenario
[SPEAKER_02]: where you know any you know any amount of
funding in the world just doesn't burn
[SPEAKER_00]: right through it's true but everybody
needs to get up to speed everybody needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to basically get up to speed they need
that runway time for something like
[SPEAKER_00]: national legalization or the ability to
cross borders into other states so if they
[SPEAKER_00]: just like everybody they have to be able
to sustain that transitional period and
[SPEAKER_00]: people say that it could be legalized
tomorrow or a year from now but it seems
[SPEAKER_00]: like unless something significant happens
that we are on the path towards federal
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization when do you guys think that
would have you're gonna handicap it when
[SPEAKER_00]: do you think that's gonna happen I my gut
instinct says that it's gonna happen
[SPEAKER_00]: probably based on the next presidential
election and I think that it's not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: happen till after that because it's too
much of a tool for a presidential election
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just a guess but I would say what
happened sometime after and I would guess
[SPEAKER_00]: that it would be that it's gonna be a
fairly hot topic on the primary tickets
[SPEAKER_00]: and eventually the the real race you you
