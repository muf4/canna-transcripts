[SPEAKER_01]: Let folks know that this place exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, two, three, gosh, it's 2019 now,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Four years ago, on the floor of the
assembly, the assembly member for the
[SPEAKER_01]: North Coast said to the rest of his
colleagues, like, hey, you guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is no weed fairy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every gram consumed in every community
comes from a farmer, and a lot of them are
[SPEAKER_01]: in my district, and a lot of them are in
Brian's district.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian, you know, being the guy who
represents just north of here who may be
[SPEAKER_01]: your next state senator.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, like, there isn't a weed fairy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people just have never really,
like, water comes from the tap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis comes from the hustler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that's all there ever was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we need to start breaking down that
paradigm in general, but I think giving
[SPEAKER_01]: people, showing them that door,
it's a gateway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gateway into a whole greater way of
being an awareness, and just show them the
[SPEAKER_01]: gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just add that here locally,
grass valley growers has only begun to
[SPEAKER_00]: scratch the surface and telling the story
and the culture inherited the heritage of
[SPEAKER_00]: this place and the people that made it
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going into the future, I really look
forward to being able to involve more
[SPEAKER_00]: people to tell that story.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of similarities in the small
farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so how do you articulate what makes
each one special?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there's a few different ways
to do it from, you know, location and
[SPEAKER_04]: terroir and history.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also for me, it's, you know,
from a personal perspective like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: that concept of the ethos of homesteading,
which, you know, I draw a really clear
[SPEAKER_04]: difference in cannabis reality between
homesteading and resource extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've seen both paradigms,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for me, it's very important to be
able to articulate the reality of the
[SPEAKER_04]: homesteader, the food production,
the fruit trees, the chickens,
[SPEAKER_04]: the weed, all of the different facets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to try to communicate that in a way
that connects.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, ask me in five years and
I'll tell you how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Casey, I'm really glad you used the W
word.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've seen a lot of change in our
culture since weed became cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: since everybody talks about ganja as
cannabis and everything has shifted,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, for better or for worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you see as far as the cultural
perspective of how you are working with
[SPEAKER_02]: these changes as weed has become cannabis
and people are looking at a different
[SPEAKER_02]: thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's honestly, you know,
again, for better or for worse,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a bit of a gentrification
happening in the cannabis culture right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, on a lot of levels,
you know, gentrification is nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I like to eat out at nice places
and this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also have to be aware of what's
happening in order to create those
[SPEAKER_02]: conveniences.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot to unpack there.
[SPEAKER_04]: This idea of, you know, words have power
and the words we choose to use convey a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in the process, you know,
it's kind of this iterative process in
[SPEAKER_04]: which early on, you know, the newspapers,
the pot growers did a bit of a bit of a
[SPEAKER_04]: bit of a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the legislature, it's like,
so you're here to talk about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they can't even say it at full volume.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, that transition from
marijuana to cannabis was was very
[SPEAKER_04]: important because it was it was a taking
of and an ownership of the process and the
[SPEAKER_04]: terminology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we said every step of the way,
like, look, right now, we're we're working
[SPEAKER_04]: to support the process of creating
regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as regulations exist, we're going
to be like any other industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be fighting about the
regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's really where we are now is
that it has come to that point where now
[SPEAKER_04]: we're not asking for something.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to push back against
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, I don't necessarily have
an answer to like what the appropriate
[SPEAKER_04]: terminology is yet, because we're all
still iterating it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's it's definitely the the
transition has happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we're trying to figure out,
you know, essentially how to pick up the
[SPEAKER_04]: pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that when when Nixon declared a
war on the antiwar left and people of
[SPEAKER_01]: color with the intention of disrupting
communities, incarcerating leaders,
[SPEAKER_01]: that there was more going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that stoners, which I'm no longer
ashamed to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I struggled with it a lot growing up,
but I am a stoner and I do like to smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're actually the majority.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our communities have been
intentionally and systematically disrupted
[SPEAKER_01]: for many, many, many, many years now since
I think that was the 68 election that that
[SPEAKER_01]: that conversation was actually had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to me, I would never call it weed
if I were advocating, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when we went to the legislature,
it was cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the accurate term.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the correct term.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't use other slang words when I
talk to senators either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there's a time and a place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to me, pivoting into cannabis as a
term for the purpose of advocacy was the
[SPEAKER_01]: absolute correct decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gave us the ability to have a
conversation without all of the triggers
[SPEAKER_01]: and the stereotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I tell you what, I am a stoner and I
like to smoke good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will never change that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so are all of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so are most of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the heart of weed, it just didn't
really flow as much as the heart of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, THW.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm feeling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and then like the throwback,
right, like I do a radio show and I call
[SPEAKER_04]: it the farm and reefer report,
because that's what like my dad,
[SPEAKER_04]: when I was a kid, he was always like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was a reefer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, the different,
you know, the different iterations over
[SPEAKER_04]: time is something that I think like we
really, you know, we really hold on to and
[SPEAKER_04]: do honor unto.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's an even older generation
that referred to refrigerators as reefers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it almost got us in trouble once when
our landlord got us a new refrigerator in
[SPEAKER_01]: college and stopped by to see the new
reefer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He walks in and he says, he says,
I'm here to see the, I'm here to check out
[SPEAKER_03]: the reefer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just like, and I'm kind of like,
I'm like, well, I guess I'll go get the
[SPEAKER_03]: bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my other roommate is like,
the new fridge is excellent, Dave.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really, and I'm like, oh,
that's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, bringing it back to the co-op.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Daniel, what do you see, what are you
looking for in a farm when somebody is
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in joining your co-op and what
do you as a co-op offer to the farmer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, I don't think of it as
my co-op.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is our co-op and whoever takes part in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has ownership and control in that
cooperative just the same as everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me personally, as a farmer, I'm a
polyculture farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to grow fruits and vegetables right
alongside my cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on a personal level, I would like to
see more farms of that variety come into
[SPEAKER_00]: the group, but I would not expect
everybody to jump on board with something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of an attitude of cooperation
like these guys have mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of standards and
regulations put down on us from above,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be category three testing,
determining that we're completely free of
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides or anyone that can get through
the piles of paperwork we have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: probably has a decent level of competency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that's actually achieved full
compliance is likely a good member of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperative if they have the attitude of
cooperation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a certain level of selflessness I
think required to go into it because we
[SPEAKER_00]: are working for a greater good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've put countless hours into this
since I first started working towards
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is to see my own farm succeed,
but without seeing other local farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: succeed, I'm in a failed community and I
don't want to live in a failed community.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a commonality here that
drove all of us into the regulatory
[SPEAKER_04]: process, the dialogue around regulatory
development was seeing the community
[SPEAKER_04]: survive, the community thrive.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things I think that's really
important, there's a lot of resources on
[SPEAKER_04]: emeraldgrown.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a cooperative, how to develop a
cooperative presentation that's really
[SPEAKER_04]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're starting a business with other
people, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got a bunch of partners,
you're all owning and running this
[SPEAKER_04]: business and it's really, really important
to figure out what your foundation is and
[SPEAKER_04]: where you're going with it because it's
really easy not to have, because those
[SPEAKER_04]: conversations can be difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't really drill down into it and
nail down what it is you're trying to do,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can get a couple of years into it and
have a whole lot of different.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got two years into emeraldgrown and
some people wanted it to be a distribution
[SPEAKER_04]: cooperative, some people wanted it to be a
marketing cooperative, some people just
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted to sell the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really important to nail that down.
[SPEAKER_04]: From a personal perspective, right now it
is very, very small.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope once we sort of nail it down some
that we'll make it a little bigger,
[SPEAKER_04]: but there's two farm families involved,
Happy Day Farms and Emerald Spirit
[SPEAKER_04]: Botanicals, we call it Happy Spirit
Cooperative.
[SPEAKER_04]: The goal is to have a cooperative based
around diversified production,
[SPEAKER_04]: farms who are also engaged in market
gardening for farmers markets and cities.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a salesman, I work at ONCSA,
food production and cannabis because one
[SPEAKER_04]: of the things that I found was,
like, from my perspective and what I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: doing is different than, you know,
for instance, rapid rotation, light-depth,
[SPEAKER_04]: rapid rotation greenhouse operation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for me, as a single-season outdoor
farmer with a lot of food production and
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers markets, like I've got a really
specific reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I want to build a cooperative that
is based around that specific reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think it's really important to
like, and the presentation goes through
[SPEAKER_04]: this, but there's a personal values
worksheet and like, you know, we
[SPEAKER_04]: acknowledge the collective eye roll of
like, cool, I'm going to write down my
[SPEAKER_04]: personal values, but actually like,
it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you come out of this thing with like,
wow, I've really articulated for myself
[SPEAKER_04]: something that I think is very important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I can take that forward into this
business project and we can nail down what
[SPEAKER_04]: it is we're trying to do and we can figure
out if it's a good fit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because like I say, this is a partnership,
you're going into business together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's not something to be taken
lightly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really important to really like,
solidify that foundation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to speak briefly to
tangible benefits to joining a member
[SPEAKER_01]: co-op of Emerald Grown, which Grass Valley
Growers is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this year we're focusing on a
few key things over the next five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to reduce production costs,
increase margin to farmer and provide,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a broad range of price to
consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take a lot to be able to
channel products in a way that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: achieve those goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 2019, participating farms that is
members of a member co-op because we're a
[SPEAKER_01]: co-op of co-op.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, locally joining Grass Valley
Growers or forming a new co-op and joining
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald Grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an inventory management platform
that Salesforce based and Metro
[SPEAKER_01]: integrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the best in market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We provide that to farmers at no upfront
cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so all the things I'm about to
describe are how we're structuring the
[SPEAKER_01]: house brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we give you the clones to grow for the
house brand first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way each and every person is growing
the same clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the day, we've got a
relatively consistent large batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get a handful of clones,
you get an inventory management software,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get a compliance oversight and audit
software that our compliance team can help
[SPEAKER_01]: use to audit you to keep you on track with
permits, help support your licensing
[SPEAKER_01]: efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a collective marketing,
you know, we've contracted with an agency
[SPEAKER_01]: that again, too expensive for any of us to
have on our own, but collectively we can
[SPEAKER_01]: afford them very powerful marketing
agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, participating in that brand
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, the big thing that
we're working on is building out a handful
[SPEAKER_01]: of aggregation centers around the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We basically cross referenced where
there's a lot of growers in the pipeline
[SPEAKER_01]: and where there aren't a lot of support
facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of those communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hoping to be able to announce the
location today, but we had lawyers and
[SPEAKER_01]: they did the lawyer thing on the phone
together and we're going to do some more
[SPEAKER_01]: changes to the thing before I can sign it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Nevada County will be one of,
you know, Nevada County, Mendocino County
[SPEAKER_01]: and Humboldt County are the three counties
that we'd like to put these centers in
[SPEAKER_01]: first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, as a part owner of an
aggregation processing facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the traditional farm operations
are being disrupted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't dry, you can't trim,
you can't do whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our goal is not to prescribe to anyone
what they do with our center, but for it
[SPEAKER_01]: to be there to pick up the pieces wherever
their process gets disrupted, whether they
[SPEAKER_01]: know it now, whether they learn about it
in October when it starts raining to have
[SPEAKER_01]: a solution, avoid waste efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is our number one goal this year is
to not waste a single dollar, not waste a
[SPEAKER_01]: single drop, not let a single gram go to
waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, inventory management software
compliance support oversight, a unified
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing program and, you know,
hopefully by the new year we'll have these
[SPEAKER_01]: centers online to be able to provide more
tangible supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
