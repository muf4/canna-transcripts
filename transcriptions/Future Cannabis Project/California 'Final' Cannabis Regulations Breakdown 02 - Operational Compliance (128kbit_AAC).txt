[SPEAKER_00]: I would say here at MMLG, there's kind of
a slight distinction between the licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: side of things and then what I call the
operational compliance, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: my terrain.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's getting your license, then there's
keeping it and not having it taken away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of this part of the presentation
is kind of a review because so much of
[SPEAKER_00]: what happened in this round is like
everything we feared from the last round
[SPEAKER_00]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can review that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do like to start with let's remember
all the good news and the positive things
[SPEAKER_00]: that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the big ones was that you can now
label THC and CBD cannabinoid content
[SPEAKER_00]: after final form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the distributors can label it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a significant percentage of failures
that was happening was because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: label claims.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a big one that's going to help
a lot of products actually make it to
[SPEAKER_00]: market without going through the loop of
having to relabel because every test
[SPEAKER_00]: result is going to be slightly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made the exemption for tinctures
containing alcohol so that product type
[SPEAKER_00]: got to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got distribution to distribution
transfers thanks to SB 311.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have retail to retail transfer
clarification so that a retailer,
[SPEAKER_00]: an owner that owns multiple stores can
contract distributors to move inventory
[SPEAKER_00]: between those stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's expanded events location thanks to
AB 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evidently for LA it's going to be 2020
right before they get their local events.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like there won't be any local
events till 2020 and you're like no
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just won't be licensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another big win in this one was that you
can reject and accept partial shipments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a provision previously that was
either you had to accept the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: shipment or reject it if something was
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's some card bouts for if there's
things that aren't accurately reflected on
[SPEAKER_00]: the shipping manifest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can not take those items.
[SPEAKER_00]: If things are visibly damaged you can not
take those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's non-compliant labeling as your
intaking you can reject the non-compliant
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled goods and if things are passed
they're expired or best by date you can
[SPEAKER_00]: not accept those.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some remediation for edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have I don't know say a tin of
blueberries and they're over a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams you can actually take a couple
blueberries out and repackage it and be
[SPEAKER_00]: like now we got a hundred milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's nice instead of having to
destroy it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some higher action levels for the
category two solvents which will help some
[SPEAKER_00]: more products make it to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Josh was saying lots of new forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be so much fun filling those
out and possibly a little bit more clarity
[SPEAKER_00]: around some other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there were other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean we still continue with the white
hot white labeling panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Josh was saying like with the
expansion of the definitions of ownership
[SPEAKER_00]: and financially interested parties and
this detail in 5032 b specifically that
[SPEAKER_00]: licensees shall not conduct commercial
cannabis activities on behalf of at the
[SPEAKER_00]: request of or pursuant to a contract with
any person that is not licensed under the
[SPEAKER_00]: act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very problematic for people who had white
labeling situations and less that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're an owner or a disclosed as a
financially interested party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many many people are thinking of many many
workarounds like we'll all go get
[SPEAKER_00]: temporary event licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like yeah you still have to
disclose the owners in that situation too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the main thing is the thing that I see
overall in the revisions that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going through is you see that the agencies
are learning the agencies are seeing where
[SPEAKER_00]: people are hiding money where they're
hiding owners where they don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing and they're starting slowly
but surely to kind of like peel apart some
[SPEAKER_00]: of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these become really problematic
because reactionary regulating is never
[SPEAKER_00]: good for the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you see the process and you get to the
concept underneath it and the concept
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath the this white labeling
prohibition is that if you can call it
[SPEAKER_00]: that is they want to know who's playing
they want to know who's who who's the
[SPEAKER_00]: participants they want and as Josh said
the warm bodies who is it interested not
[SPEAKER_00]: hiding behind entities corporations you
know not disclosures whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting you know they in the
previous version there was there was rumor
[SPEAKER_00]: that like 5032 b was going to get struck.
[SPEAKER_00]: They in the previous version they had all
of these kind of they laid out the
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibitions of like what they meant by
commercial cannabis activities that that
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe would be prohibited by non
licensees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is got to be my favorite thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read the final statement of reasons
it's beautiful is that when they put that
[SPEAKER_00]: in and this is from the final statement of
reasons from the VCC it says you know
[SPEAKER_00]: initially they determined it was necessary
to assist licensees with determining what
[SPEAKER_00]: types of activity by having these
examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: However then they determined that the
inclusion of the examples caused more
[SPEAKER_00]: confusion than clarity so they took them
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean that those examples are
not legitimate examples of what they mean
[SPEAKER_00]: by precipitating and cannabis commercial
cannabis activity without a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means that they if anything I
would suggest did not want to limit
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves to only those definitions that
in fact this gives them a more broad scope
[SPEAKER_00]: of being able to determine on a case by
case basis what they consider to be
[SPEAKER_00]: engaging in commercial cannabis activity
without a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the funny thing is if I don't know if
they're just crazy or like gaslighting us
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea but the agencies say in
conversations with Lori Ajax that the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard thing that we understand as white
labeling did not enter their consciousness
[SPEAKER_00]: at all as what they were trying to
prohibit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's odd as we proceed because they're
not really trying to shut down the
[SPEAKER_00]: practice of white labeling as most of us
know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They in one conversation it was more that
they went into retailers and still found
[SPEAKER_00]: unlicensed product and they were like we
have to stop this unlicensed product from
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into retailers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was their solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole lot of other regulations
to prevent unlicensed product from being
[SPEAKER_00]: at a retail location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not really sure that that
explanation is sound but it's it's the one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that we know from all of the
regulatory agencies is they're not done
[SPEAKER_00]: regulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is still going to be cleanup.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still going to be new language.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm saying the permanent
regulations are never permanent because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just going to keep refining this
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in case just as a refresher anybody
wants to know when you're like well what's
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial cannabis activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go back to the definition of it
from the business and professions code
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the cultivation possession
manufacture distribution processing
[SPEAKER_00]: storing lab testing packaging labeling
transportation delivery or sale of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any you know commercial cannabis
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw the technology platform regulations
are stood and carried over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their reasoning for this was that they
found a number of licensees were engaging
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery services that were facilitated by
platforms but the use of the platforms was
[SPEAKER_00]: creating confusion with customers as to
whether it was a licensee conducting that
[SPEAKER_00]: activity or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some technology platforms may create
the impression they hold a license and
[SPEAKER_00]: they determined that it was necessary to
clarify that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all from the final statement of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally they just kind of you know
went a little more granular this language
[SPEAKER_00]: was in the last version in October that
you know that they can't sell or otherwise
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer a good or license retailer
through the use of an unlicensed third
[SPEAKER_00]: party intermediary business broker or any
other business or entity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can contract with a service that
provides a technology platform to
[SPEAKER_00]: facilitate these sales and delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's lots of step you know
stipulations in terms of what that has to
[SPEAKER_00]: look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The products can't be delivered by that
technology platform that technology
[SPEAKER_00]: platform can't share in the profits of the
sale of those cannabis goods or otherwise
[SPEAKER_00]: provide for a percentage of the portion of
the cannabis goods sales can't be provided
[SPEAKER_00]: to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't advertise in conjunction with
the technology provider outside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: platform and they cannot in the technology
platform can't use the licensees license
[SPEAKER_00]: number to advertise in any advertising and
marketing that primarily promotes that
[SPEAKER_00]: technology platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredibly specific they're very very
specific about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in because back to that original
reasoning that it was to prevent the
[SPEAKER_00]: confusion of knowing who you're buying
from they added in a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: disclosures that those items offered for
sale have to disclose at a minimum the
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed retailers or micro businesses
legal business name and license number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with if it's ordered through
the platform they have to be able to see
[SPEAKER_00]: the business name and the license number
that they are ordering those products from
[SPEAKER_00]: before they make the purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're on the platform and you're
looking at a product you need to in
[SPEAKER_00]: advance of getting it and maybe seeing it
on the receipt know what license
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary is going to be delivering this
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That information has to be on the receipt
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives me the good news about that I
would say is it gives a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: visibility to the retailers that are
actually providing the products that are
[SPEAKER_00]: being delivered through these technology
platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the biggest wins obviously to
delivery was it was the delivery to a
[SPEAKER_00]: physical address.
[SPEAKER_00]: The part that held is that you can deliver
anywhere within the state of California
[SPEAKER_00]: provided that such delivery is conducted
in compliance with all delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: provisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that some of you probably saw the
League of Cities did the big wandering
[SPEAKER_00]: weed campaign with all these beautiful
cartoon children terrified of the symbol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the additions we saw was this
subsection E just to clarify delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: employees can't deliver to a school so
please don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kindergarten or one through 12 college
totally fine daycare center or youth
[SPEAKER_00]: center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the wandering weed site came down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no longer up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it on Squarespace.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell by the lot the missing site
signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw the value that had dropped
previously from ten thousand to five
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand of what can be carried in the car
at any time that stayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to have at least two thousand
dollars in orders to be sallying forth on
[SPEAKER_00]: your delivery route.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cage was clarified that the cage in
the delivery vehicle same as
[SPEAKER_00]: transportation distribution vehicles now
has to be a fully enclosed separate box
[SPEAKER_00]: container cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then no portion of it shall be comprised
of any part of the vehicle or trailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is mirrored in distribution that it
has to be this inside structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's record keeping requirements for
locations that stayed in which is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: history of all locations traveled while
engaging in delivery has to be maintained
[SPEAKER_00]: for a minimum of 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's turn by turn GPS records for all
delivery drivers has to be kept and kept
[SPEAKER_00]: for seven years because it falls under our
record keeping provisions of super fun
[SPEAKER_00]: project for a lot of people is going to be
the now you can deliver to Catalina the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing so good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of how they do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll not hold my breath before they figure
out how state chartered boats is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the fee structure for using a
state chartered boat to transport your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well yeah I mean it's interesting because
they'll have to be that's the interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that we've had is there's going to
be have to be other provisional carve outs
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's impossible in some ways to
fulfill the requirements for delivery such
[SPEAKER_00]: as a vehicle with a cage and stuff when
there is not a single ferry boat that
[SPEAKER_00]: transports vehicles to the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would have to change all of the
transportation regulations for once you
[SPEAKER_00]: get off the boat that you can hand carry
it to anywhere in Avalon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a great concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously the people of Avalon deserve
to have their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the constant the constant caveat in
everything we're doing is right now I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about state regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: State regulations are also a companion to
local regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Local regulations and state regulations
are a companion to federal regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when all of these things work together
then we have regulated cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it's fine and good that now you
can deliver to any municipality in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain localities have their own local
ordinances that restrict delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example in the city of Bellflower you
can a delivery driver can only carry up to
[SPEAKER_00]: two hundred dollars at any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck with your three thousand dollars
of goods in your trunk when you can only
[SPEAKER_00]: collect two hundred dollars at any time to
be in accordance with the Bellflower local
[SPEAKER_00]: ordinance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean it's a much greater
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll kind of touch on a little bit later
of just like the problem of synthesizing
[SPEAKER_00]: the localities with the state is immense
and how and how to keep in mind all that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general this is just some stuff about
advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I know West knows this whenever you
can't find something that you know is a
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget to look in the business and
professions code because you can read the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire you know cannabis regulations of
the BCC and think I don't have to put my
[SPEAKER_00]: license number on a billboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing that says that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the business and professions code.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where you would go to look for
these statutory requirements such as that
[SPEAKER_00]: all advertising and marketing has to
identify at a minimum the licensee
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for that ad with their license
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: A technology platform cannot display an
advertisement by a licensee without a
[SPEAKER_00]: license number attached to it and an
outdoor advertising company can't display
[SPEAKER_00]: an advertisement unless they display the
license number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So theoretically every ad anywhere at all
times you are seeing now should have a
[SPEAKER_00]: license number on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's enforcing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other prohibition that did hold and
came through from the last time was the
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition against marketing cannabis
goods as alcoholic products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't sell or transport cannabis
goods that are labeled as beer wine liquor
[SPEAKER_00]: spirits or any other term that might
create a misleading impression.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little statements from the final
statement of reasons they felt that was
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary because since recently passed
legislation prohibits actually making a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis alcoholic beverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to confuse consumers by
thinking that cannabis wine is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they took that one away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they and they extended that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they extended the prohibition to
anything that could recreate a misleading
[SPEAKER_00]: impression that the product may be an
alcoholic beverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for retailers there was the limit on
the sale of non cannabis goods stayed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a pretty limited definition of
what you can sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to cannabis goods a licensed
retailer may only may sell only cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: accessories and any licensees branded
merchandise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in your retail store you can sell
cannabis you can sell cannabis accessories
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can sell branded merchandise and
then you can have promotional materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: They allow that you can provide
promotional materials which is like
[SPEAKER_00]: informational pamphlets things that have
no monetary value that are given to you by
[SPEAKER_00]: those organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the final statement of reasons they are
incredibly specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have any questions about what
exactly is a cannabis accessory it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: the business and professions code actually
points to the health and safety code for
[SPEAKER_00]: that definition where it's still called
marijuana accessories and and kind of that
[SPEAKER_00]: it has a pretty expansive definition in
that it's any equipment products materials
[SPEAKER_00]: of any kind which are used intended for
use designed for use in planting
[SPEAKER_00]: propagating cultivating growing harvesting
manufacturing compounding converting
[SPEAKER_00]: producing processing preparing testing
analyzing packaging repackaging storing
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking vaporizing or containing marijuana
or for ingesting inhaling or otherwise
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing introducing marijuana or
marijuana products into the human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the final statement of reasons they
get specific of what they mean that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis retailers are licensed to sell
cannabis goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: The definition of cannabis within the acts
explicitly excludes industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: products industrial hemp is regulated by
the California Industrial Hemp Program
[SPEAKER_00]: under the California Industrial Hemp
Farming Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: A retail license from the Bureau
authorizes retailer to sell cannabis goods
[SPEAKER_00]: and cannabis it does not authorize them to
sell items that are unrelated to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're pretty clear you're not
supposed to be selling industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: products anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been they've been clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now branded merchandise the thing that you
are allowed to sell they get specific on
[SPEAKER_00]: that too clothing hats pencils pins
keychains mugs water bottles beverage
[SPEAKER_00]: glasses notepads and lanyards and cannabis
accessories that are branded with the name
[SPEAKER_00]: and logo of a commercial cannabis business
that is a licensed commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is not one of those listed items you
have to get written approval from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bureau in order to carry that branded
merchandise.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to write to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to send them a picture of it and
they have to approve it before you can
[SPEAKER_00]: sell that additional brand branded
merchandise and the branded merchandise
[SPEAKER_00]: has to be from a licensee.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bong I would say is a cannabis
accessory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes under that definition of cannabis
accessories is a subdivision of branded
[SPEAKER_00]: merchandise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can brand your cannabis accessories
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would not be something you have to be
so you see about that would not be
[SPEAKER_00]: permitted because it's not branded
merchandise by a licensee.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be if you the branded merchandise
isn't you know you can't sell Nike
[SPEAKER_00]: sneakers you know because that's branded
merchandise or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be that if you wanted to partner
with an Instagram person and put your name
[SPEAKER_00]: and logo and license number on that then
that might be where you could get
[SPEAKER_00]: something approved in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems that they're being very
specific that the branded merchandise
[SPEAKER_00]: should be of a licensee.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I would ask you know
your friendly neighborhood attorney about
[SPEAKER_00]: because in that final statement of reasons
when they're saying that clarification
[SPEAKER_00]: that a retail license authorizes you to
sell cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I deduced from that is they're saying
like getting a retail cannabis license
[SPEAKER_00]: does not give authorize you to sell like
Coke and Doritos like you have to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: city lease business permit for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to it's a different kind of
seller's permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do that things and what a lot of
retailers are doing is segmenting their
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses so that you have your cannabis
retail area where you're selling your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis products and then you have
another non licensee you know not part of
[SPEAKER_00]: that area where you're selling everything
else and you can and you can get your city
[SPEAKER_00]: business permit and do your thing there
and pay your taxes that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of course for the amount you're
being taxed for your retail space why
[SPEAKER_00]: would you sell Doritos there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to sell them somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a cannabis well it's a cannabis
product at that point as long as it's a
[SPEAKER_10]: anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: is a branded product is a non cannabis
product and they are very specific to
[SPEAKER_00]: about those branded products it's not food
like you can't make no no no any licensee
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah yeah so you can sell any other
licensees branded products exactly exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: because I would imagine that what you're
gonna have is just like you have
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing brands or cultivator brands
that are you know brands and logos in
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves that they are gonna want to
sell that branded merchandise through
[SPEAKER_00]: retail yeah yeah well claiming health
benefits is a whole other ball of wax you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to tussle with go ahead I mean
there's a great question in terms of what
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement is gonna look like and who's
gonna be responsible and and that's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of the big issue I mean especially for the
compliance folks is it's difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: prioritize or convince people that this is
important when there seems to be such a
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of visible enforcement or that it's
very kind of pick and choose needle and
[SPEAKER_00]: haystack but we have had enforcement
actions happen where agencies are going
[SPEAKER_00]: into retailers and pulling product off the
shelf that's non-compliant and and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting more and more specific about it my
concern is always right now obviously the
[SPEAKER_00]: agencies are in this period of where
they've got all the temporary license
[SPEAKER_00]: application you know there's a lot going
on right now but once they mean they are
[SPEAKER_00]: beefing up their teams they are having
huge staff increases and next year when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're bored on a Tuesday it's my concern
is it becomes the new smash and grab
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's like it's so easy to walk
into any retailer any facility anyway and
[SPEAKER_00]: find egregious and gigantic compliance
violations you know it may not seem like a
[SPEAKER_00]: big deal but when you start going through
their disciplinary actions and there and
[SPEAKER_00]: the penalties and fees that they can levy
you know the one that comes up later in
[SPEAKER_00]: this I mean there's a there's a
administrative fine for record-keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be as high as $30,000 per
instance of not keeping accurate records
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's like they they have I mean which
be like fear police but it's like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really is a vulnerable position
because there's just so many nuances and
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations and interpretations which is
why it's really critical to at this moment
[SPEAKER_00]: be practicing all of these things for
record-keeping for inventory for intaking
[SPEAKER_00]: product all those processes and also
building your internal compliance program
[SPEAKER_00]: your compliance team your legal team
making sure that those things are in place
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's you know if they've they've
really got the industry in the crosshairs
[SPEAKER_00]: in many ways
[SPEAKER_06]: like we're never gonna see like a
statewide campaign going against branded
[SPEAKER_06]: swag being sold at retailers but where
this might come into play is if they get a
[SPEAKER_06]: complaint about you somebody complains
that you're selling to kids and they send
[SPEAKER_06]: an agent there and while the agents there
you know they clearly see that you're not
[SPEAKER_06]: selling the kids but oh by the way while
we're out here we notice that you have
[SPEAKER_06]: this unbranded unapproved branded
merchandise and that's where they could
[SPEAKER_06]: just come up and cite you because these
enforcement agencies at the end of the day
[SPEAKER_06]: they're driven by statistics and
demographics and demographics as to like
[SPEAKER_06]: what types of discipline and charges
they're able to prove up because they've
[SPEAKER_06]: got a budget they get it each year from
the state so they need to be able to point
[SPEAKER_06]: to results and say that we've you know
identified 10,000 you know infractions
[SPEAKER_06]: over the last year we need more money
because you know we want to be able to get
[SPEAKER_06]: 12,000 infractions next year so you know
it's a roundabout way of saying that you
[SPEAKER_06]: know they're on the books and it really
becomes a tool for them to use when they
[SPEAKER_06]: want to go after somebody but it may not
necessarily be like a statewide primary
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement mechanism yeah and something
that I like to remind people of is right
[SPEAKER_00]: now especially for licensees that are
really suffering within the you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: unlicensed market and that kind of
competition where what you have is at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of an industry beginning to howl
for enforcement as a solution and I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to caution people to be incredibly
specific about what you mean when you ask
[SPEAKER_00]: for enforcement because when you're asking
the BCC for enforcement the BCC enforces
[SPEAKER_00]: against licensees the illicit market and
the unlicensed market is a criminal
[SPEAKER_00]: activity at this point and that is the
wing that would have to enforce against
[SPEAKER_00]: that activity and we'll touch on this
later but obviously a lot of the problem
[SPEAKER_00]: in those areas is about pathways to
licensure and how difficult that is with
[SPEAKER_00]: local authorizations that there's a lot of
folks that would get licensed if the
[SPEAKER_07]: localities kind of made that process a
little easier yeah that is accurate yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: you are no longer supposed to be carrying
CBD products that are derived from hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: that are not gotten from a licensed
cannabis cultivator manufacturer producer
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the agencies have been very clear
you are not supposed to have that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore so if there is still a distributor
that is supplying hemp products actually
[SPEAKER_00]: if I keep on going there's like I will
list the ways in which they tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: across the board absolutely not
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I mean that yes it's a different
taxation but in the end that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: people rampantly creating committing tax
fraud unknowingly because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: placing excise tax on hemp products are
not doing it on cannabis products it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a messy problem that is going to take
a while and it's only going to get messier
[SPEAKER_00]: now with confusion around the
[SPEAKER_00]: relevance of the farm bill and what that
means in different guidance coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: different you can do that if you're a
licensee
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah well this would be my question would
be where is this giant is it inside your
[SPEAKER_00]: store yeah so yeah so these specific
things that I'm going through right here
[SPEAKER_00]: is advertising and marketing so this is
kind of like there there's exceptions and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd have to look at them closely and get
granular is there's things that can happen
[SPEAKER_00]: inside your store that aren't considered
advertising and marketing and then outside
[SPEAKER_00]: the store is so this specifically is
talking about that your advertising
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing cannot show a depiction of a
minor of inflatables of a movie character
[SPEAKER_00]: of a cartoon character that in your
marketing you cannot do those they cleaned
[SPEAKER_00]: it up you know and this is they have some
great thoughts around you know what is
[SPEAKER_00]: appealing to people or minors or anyone
under 21 years of old age this is an
[SPEAKER_00]: important fact too for anybody that's
cleaning up your old list if you have had
[SPEAKER_00]: medical clientele who are 18 years old
between the ages of 18 and until they're
[SPEAKER_00]: 21 you cannot advertise to those people
they are not an advertising candidate we
[SPEAKER_00]: only advertise to people over 21 years old
so especially in the case if you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: direct marketing so if you have a text
list or you're doing emails and you
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't cleaned up your email list and you
are direct marketing to 18 19 and 20 year
[SPEAKER_00]: olds you're going to want to clean up your
because the people who used to be your
[SPEAKER_00]: clientele and you were it may have been
telling them about deals and promos you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not telling them about that anymore so the
one of the things that did come through
[SPEAKER_00]: that's important for record-keeping is
that there was this audience composition
[SPEAKER_00]: data this mysterious audience composition
data that they request and now they have
[SPEAKER_00]: put in that this your ads shall be
displayed and this may seem like a
[SPEAKER_00]: no-brainer but they're specific now after
you've gotten that audience composition
[SPEAKER_00]: data so and not only do you have to have
it you really have to have it because much
[SPEAKER_00]: like other records you have to be able to
produce it immediately upon request so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not like let me call the company and
I'm sure they have it somewhere before you
[SPEAKER_00]: place an ad before you put up a billboard
you have to have that audience composition
[SPEAKER_00]: data again look at it closely because a
lot of those companies they do it 18 plus
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to make sure that it's 21 plus
on that composition data and they added
[SPEAKER_00]: this line that used to be my favorite line
for employee training which is there's
[SPEAKER_00]: another section where it says in
construing and enforcing the the act that
[SPEAKER_00]: any action omission or failure on the part
of an employee is the licensees fault now
[SPEAKER_00]: they've added that any action omission or
failure on the part of an advertising
[SPEAKER_00]: agent or representative or contractor for
marketing and licensing is your fault as
[SPEAKER_00]: the licensee so clearly it's because the
BCC can't enforce against advertising
[SPEAKER_00]: companies if you get the advertising
company say hey we just say that it's 21
[SPEAKER_00]: up can you help me out here it is your
problem if that if that information proves
[SPEAKER_00]: faulty it is your problem so if that
audience composition data is still there
[SPEAKER_00]: and I know I keep saying this every time
we're all gonna do it together we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: stop saying free you cannot advertise you
cannot advertise free products stop it no
[SPEAKER_00]: matter how crafty you think you're being
nothing's free anymore so they've Dave
[SPEAKER_00]: this is in relation to advertising
marketing again you cannot advertise free
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis goods or any giveaways of any
type of products including non-cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: products so not only can you not say like
get a free pre-roll you can't say get a
[SPEAKER_00]: free t-shirt you can't say get a free
lighter you do depends where you are it
[SPEAKER_00]: depends this is where this is where you
cannot advertise you cannot advertise that
[SPEAKER_00]: that is happening so they get specific it
can't be buy one product get one product
[SPEAKER_00]: it can't be free with donation it can't be
contest sweepstakes or raffles this is my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite reasoning in the whole thing is
in their statement of reasons the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: why you cannot have a raffle is because
they have deemed that the dissemination of
[SPEAKER_00]: promotional giveaways may appeal to
underage people so we can't have raffles
[SPEAKER_00]: because a minor might want to do it they
might be like let's do it and I was like
[SPEAKER_00]: you know you know what raffles and
sweepstakes are appealing to freaking
[SPEAKER_00]: older people who have jobs and no money
like that too my kid doesn't care about a
[SPEAKER_00]: raffle my kid doesn't even know what that
means there's no raffles I love the
[SPEAKER_00]: statement of reasons it's brilliant it's
brilliant so so yes but back to your
[SPEAKER_00]: statement George this their localities
it's a beautiful tier I had I almost put
[SPEAKER_00]: it in again because it's my favorite slide
the the state says you cannot give away
[SPEAKER_00]: any free cannabis goods yeah the business
and professions code says you cannot give
[SPEAKER_00]: away cannabis goods or cannabis
accessories Los Angeles says you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: give away cannabis goods cannabis
accessories or anything else so depending
[SPEAKER_00]: on granular legal quite I mean that I mean
that's that's the thing if it is what my
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding is is if it is in your store
as a cannabis accessory it is no longer a
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco product because you cannot sell
tobacco products you know it's a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: accessory but that would be I mean that
that kind of gets into that's what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: saying is it depends on the locality
because you'd have to look at local
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibitions like Los Angeles for example
says you cannot give away anything of any
[SPEAKER_00]: kind including cannabis so they're like
you can't even give away a t-shirt
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretically in Los Angeles
[SPEAKER_00]: generally I'd like to caution everybody
not to give anything away ever just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: do it but but that's where it becomes
critical that different localities have
[SPEAKER_00]: different prohibitions against certain
things and the thing to remember is that
[SPEAKER_00]: the the state trumps it all the localities
can have rules that are more restrictive
[SPEAKER_00]: than the state but they can't have rules
that are less restrictive than the state
[SPEAKER_12]: yeah if you're in Los Angeles yes no
that's anywhere that is now the state you
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot have a contest a sweepstakes or a
raffle you cannot and that's not just
[SPEAKER_00]: limited to cannabis goods that is nothing
you can't offer to give a free anything to
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody I love that little feeling I get
how they keep up I don't know but yeah I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean it becomes it because obviously
everything cannabis has been a population
[SPEAKER_00]: of people who are pretty okay with certain
kinds of risk you know for a lot of years
[SPEAKER_00]: so for every company it's fine what I
would say is now that they have put in
[SPEAKER_00]: that little part that any act omission or
failure of your advertising company that
[SPEAKER_00]: may be in compliance with everything is is
the your licensees issue that's of concern
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that requires because I know I know
it's like the new it used to be
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's like I know the best master
grower ever and now it's like I have the
[SPEAKER_00]: most compliant POS ever I have the thing
my thing works for that you know it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance is is a I'm saying it's a
philosophical concept because it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's it's a difficult thing to
wrangle because it's an ever-evolving
[SPEAKER_00]: thing so they may be in good they may be
in compliance with what the emergency
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations are but I don't know how
they'd be in compliance with what just
[SPEAKER_00]: came out and you know a few days ago yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I mean I may have used the term
prohibition through regulation a few times
[SPEAKER_03]: in my casual conversations yeah yeah I
mean I don't want to go too far down the
[SPEAKER_00]: rabbit hole in this because I have a lot
more to cover but I would say you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: look very very closely about how these
things interact with other regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's the branded merchandise
and then there's no free products and then
[SPEAKER_00]: there's other areas in the regs where it's
like a representative of another licensee
[SPEAKER_00]: can't give anything to anybody in your
store so so it's important to kind of tie
[SPEAKER_00]: them all together and not just take one
spot yeah yes that's why I just am like
[SPEAKER_00]: can everybody just stop trying to give
everything away for free because if you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have a transaction and a record
of a transaction and you fulfill
[SPEAKER_00]: record-keeping requirements and you carry
the taxes over correctly for the right
[SPEAKER_00]: items in in in large part problem solves
and that's where I just think about think
[SPEAKER_00]: about the agencies think about their fears
and the fear is diversion and like who's
[SPEAKER_00]: playing and crying so it's like give them
visibility on the movement of everything
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you know they see what they need
to see so we we have this in just the last
[SPEAKER_00]: one for the BCC then there's many other
things to talk about the child-resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging exit package whatever you want
to call it this is we we had a shift back
[SPEAKER_00]: that's wonderfully confusing to package or
not to package that is the question that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what I say so the way they put it is it
all cannabis goods sold by a licensee
[SPEAKER_00]: right retailer have to be in compliance
with the packaging requirements those are
[SPEAKER_00]: described in the CDPH and we'll go a
little bit into that so beginning on
[SPEAKER_00]: January 1st 2020 you have to do the full
Kahuna we do resealable tamper evident and
[SPEAKER_00]: child-resistant with some granulations
around product type all cannabis goods
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased by a customer can't leave the
licensed retailer premises unless it's in
[SPEAKER_00]: an opaque exit bag and then they clarified
they added the clarifying line that the
[SPEAKER_00]: immature plants and seeds don't have to be
put into an exit bag please don't put a
[SPEAKER_00]: little clone in an exit bag let it breathe
so so that those can go out in an opaque
[SPEAKER_00]: bag so in until that date because that's
January 1st 2020 this they inserted the
[SPEAKER_00]: line the child-resistant package
requirement may be met through the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: a child-resistant exit package at retail
sale that's the Department of Public
[SPEAKER_00]: Health saying that the business and
professions code I mean what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do is to comply with what's in
the business and professions code while
[SPEAKER_00]: providing licensees with time to comply
with packaging requirements some of us are
[SPEAKER_00]: confused because the packaging
requirements were supposed to be complied
[SPEAKER_00]: with back in July so we've been complying
with them for almost six months but now
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like you need more time so this
again is a greater you know there's more
[SPEAKER_00]: clarity hopefully to come but the thought
is that because they're saying you may
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfy the packaging requirement with an
exit bag that it would stand to reason
[SPEAKER_00]: that a product already in child-resistant
packaging could theoretically leave in an
[SPEAKER_00]: opaque bag but a product that's not in
child-resistant packaging would have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: put in in an exit bag most attorneys I'm
going to guess advising their clients are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to say put it in an exit bag because
how do you know and are you going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: the liability of like whoops that wasn't
actually child-resistant I was wrong I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean and as I shared last time that that's
the issue is that we find ourselves in
[SPEAKER_00]: this Kafka esque or a boros of putting
child-resistant packaging inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: child-resistant packaging and and we're
hoping on this issue that with the
[SPEAKER_00]: incoming administration in Sacramento and
you know that possibly there will be some
[SPEAKER_00]: legislative changes there's talk about
environmental groups getting involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: Sierra Cup being involved because
obviously we just have an ecological
[SPEAKER_00]: disaster on our hands of of this this
amount of packaging and the
[SPEAKER_00]: unsustainability and those issues but for
now that's what they have there for the
[SPEAKER_00]: solution so a little bit that came out in
the CDPH Department of Public Health for
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers it was interesting I love
that they added just one word just one
[SPEAKER_00]: word in here which is homogeneity in terms
of the definition and it's important
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is just something that from
the agency from the Department of Public
[SPEAKER_00]: Health theirs is kind of the best because
you can tell that they went on some tours
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were horrified like that's what
you read is you read it and they're like
[SPEAKER_00]: what is happening so they put in
homogeneity just so people would
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that your process and
procedures need to be developed with the
[SPEAKER_00]: end goal of homogeneity uniformity THC
throughout not just passing free from
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants because they're obviously
finding some some hot blueberries and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like you guys got to spread that out
further across the board I also found it
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting this is back to the BCC we
remember that designation of owner that
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh was talking about and they removed
all these specifics out of it and there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a line in there that was wonderfully
vague that said any individual that
[SPEAKER_00]: assumes responsibility for the licensee
could be considered an owner the beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: thing is they move that line to the CDPH
regs so that one appeared over there so
[SPEAKER_00]: now in owners and financial interest
holders and Department of Public Health we
[SPEAKER_00]: have the beautifully vague any individual
that assumes responsibility for a license
[SPEAKER_00]: and this was one again in the BCC that
they put in there to clarify caused more
[SPEAKER_00]: confusion so instead of further clarifying
they just took it out there's like no more
[SPEAKER_00]: clarity for you so on the CDPH side
beginning January 1st 2020 everything has
[SPEAKER_00]: to be child-resistant they'll I'm just
gonna burn through these because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know how many you can read it it's they
get granular on what that's gonna look
[SPEAKER_00]: like in 2020 this is the future man let's
live in the present so they did add more
[SPEAKER_00]: clarification on what is considered
child-resistant in response to a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions that they were getting a very
important thing in cannabinoid content
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling that I want to point out to
everybody is that with that now delayed
[SPEAKER_00]: possibility of putting testing results on
after it's in its final form you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: a distributor it can sticker it after
however they did add that the manufacturer
[SPEAKER_00]: shall identify a location for the
cannabinoid content label on the outer
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging of the product so this is just
for everybody who's already been through a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred designs of their packaging now you
have to include if you're gonna have a
[SPEAKER_00]: sticker later you have to see you have to
demarcate where they're supposed to put
[SPEAKER_00]: that sticker some people may have already
done that lots I've seen didn't they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't put it on there so now you got to
put a spot they they put more clarity in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of how to do cannabinoid content
labeling for pre-rolls the CDPH didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really realize that they needed to do that
before they were like oh you want us to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you okay so now they got a lot more
specific about how that is expressed how
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid content is expressed that it's
one thing for flour and then you have an
[SPEAKER_00]: option with infused pre-rolls that you can
either do it in milligrams or the flour
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed as a percentage in the
additional concentrate as best in
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams they got a little because
people like to be funny oh yeah and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they added this for THC CBD that's less
than two milligrams per package you can
[SPEAKER_00]: say less than two milligrams per package
obviously companies that are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: doing microdosing and want to be specific
they don't have to but you can't so in the
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling restrictions there were a couple
of new things added to the labeling
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions because again they're on to
you guys if you'd be in tricky so the name
[SPEAKER_00]: of a California County we know
Appalachians you can't say it's from
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt if it's can't say it's from
Ministino if it's not a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_00]: you can also not use a similar name that's
designed to mislead people so you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: say like Mendoz with like a Z like none of
that don't do it same thing with candy and
[SPEAKER_00]: candies you can't spell candy with a K you
can't be like candies buddy I'm doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: as you know edibles had to be an opaque
packaging they also clarified you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: put a picture on what's in it on the
package it's there's a reason they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want it to be visible don't put a picture
of the food inside on it you can't do the
[SPEAKER_00]: same trickery with the word organic by
putting making it organics with an X don't
[SPEAKER_00]: do it stop it
[SPEAKER_00]: so a lot of the stuff in the city ph2 was
just it looks like a lot more new I think
[SPEAKER_00]: than it is because they really reorganized
things and moved it around for the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers you're going to want to look
at things like the menu master
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing protocol there was some a
lot more kind of clarity in the need for
[SPEAKER_00]: written instructions for mitigating
identified risks is in there they added
[SPEAKER_00]: product quality control plan information
in there the GMPs they welcomed as a
[SPEAKER_00]: health and safety code they pointed out
about 21 times in this new one to the
[SPEAKER_00]: health and safety code I put it on the
list of things I never in my life thought
[SPEAKER_00]: I would read as a child and now it's on
there so they also added requirements for
[SPEAKER_00]: a quality control program this is you know
these ones that are really telling that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to some people at the CDPH
about this that you know you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: establish written procedures to document
that this is for extraction that the
[SPEAKER_00]: closed loop extraction system is
maintained in accordance with the
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment manufacturer specifications and
ensure routine verification that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: operating correctly and continues to
comply and you also have to develop SOPs
[SPEAKER_00]: and in good manufacturing product process
practices in a training plan prior to
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it like prior to producing the
extracts and any person using solvents or
[SPEAKER_00]: gases in a closed loop system has to be
fully trained on how to use the system and
[SPEAKER_00]: have direct access to the applicable
safety data sheets so the Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Public Health was going into facilities
and finding people who got a manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: license and got a fancy machine and had no
idea how to use it and didn't know you had
[SPEAKER_00]: to clean it and didn't know how to clean
it and it never cleaned it so they were a
[SPEAKER_00]: little disturbed so now they're asking for
a lot more information under permissible
[SPEAKER_00]: extractions they added that CO2 gas used
for extraction has to be food grade and
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know volatile solvents you do you
also have to use a closed loop extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: system please and then they added a couple
of things in prohibited products about
[SPEAKER_00]: thermally processed low acid cannabis
products anybody know what that is
[SPEAKER_00]: thermally it's canned food that's what
that is so canned food in acidified
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis products is pickled food so that
they're saying that anything of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things my understanding of those terms you
can go to the code of federal regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: and find your own solution but but canned
food pickled food it looks like they're
[SPEAKER_00]: adding to the list of prohibited products
there used to be you can't obviously add
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to fruit loops and and make that
available but they have added that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: put commercially available foods into
candy or snack food as an ingredient but
[SPEAKER_00]: it has to be used in a way that renders it
unrecognizable as that commercially
[SPEAKER_00]: available item and you can't list it in
the ingredients to say like M&Ms is in my
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff so this is this is um this is back
to the kind of industrial hemp thing this
[SPEAKER_00]: is kind of what I call the death toll for
industrial hemp at this moment is that
[SPEAKER_00]: these three regulations so in the
requirement for edibles it already had
[SPEAKER_00]: that except for cannabis cannabis
concentrator terpenes no ingredient can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used unless that ingredient is permitted
by the United States Food and Drug
[SPEAKER_00]: Administration for use in food or food
manufacturing and also now has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: generally recognized as safe under a
section yada yada yada so so for edibles
[SPEAKER_00]: that would mean not industrial hemp
because it is not permitted by the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States Food and Drug Administration now
they've also added that if for topical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis products and concentrates they
shall only contain well this was the can
[SPEAKER_00]: only contain ingredients permitted for
cosmetic manufacturing and in in
[SPEAKER_00]: accordance with the title 21 code of
federal regulations guess what's not in
[SPEAKER_00]: there industrial hemp and then they added
now that a manufacturer licensees shall
[SPEAKER_00]: only use cannabinoid concentrates and
extracts that are manufactured or
[SPEAKER_00]: processed from cannabis obtained from a
licensed cannabis cultivator how many
[SPEAKER_00]: times could they use cannabis in the same
sentence they that seems pretty specific
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're saying if you did not get
that cannabinoid and I don't know that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to argue that CBD is in the
cannabinoid from a licensed cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator it is not supposed to be in a
manufactured product they also have some
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff about like not like Mac is
manufacturing preparing or packaging in a
[SPEAKER_00]: food establishment or as a processed food
registrant and also not in a location
[SPEAKER_00]: that's licensed by the Department of
Alcoholic Beverage Control which feels
[SPEAKER_00]: like they're kind of pre emptying some of
the coming consumption areas and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere like West Hollywood to be like
just so you know you can't have your
[SPEAKER_00]: facility in a bar or a restaurant there
was some new definitions about tablets
[SPEAKER_00]: capsules and orally consumed concentrates
which is a new category that got added
[SPEAKER_00]: they just to specify because obviously you
can see a lot of people vying I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's a there's a mint company that
was trying to call their mint a orally
[SPEAKER_00]: dissolving dehydrated tincture so that it
could have the a thousand milligram limit
[SPEAKER_00]: so they created this orally consumed
concentrate which is a concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: intended to be consumed by your mouth and
not otherwise edible so it can include
[SPEAKER_00]: tinctures capsules and tablets the line
that they seem to be drawing is that a
[SPEAKER_00]: capsule or a tablet is something that is
intended to be swallowed whole you drink
[SPEAKER_00]: it like a like a Tylenol or with some
water there you go orally consumed
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate is more like a mint something
that dissolves in the mouth and has
[SPEAKER_00]: natural artificial flavors or sweeteners
they're saying a tablet or a capsule under
[SPEAKER_00]: their definition doesn't have artificial
flavors of sweeteners so take a good look
[SPEAKER_00]: at those definitions because orally
consumed concentrates max out can be up to
[SPEAKER_00]: 500 milligrams of THC per package but over
100 milligrams they have to be labeled for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical only and can only be sold to
medical patients but a tablet that you
[SPEAKER_00]: swallow whole can be a thousand milligrams
it's makes total sense across the board so
[SPEAKER_00]: the THC concentration limits that's what I
was saying and the 500 milligrams orally
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed products containing alcohol was
specified that's our tinctures those have
[SPEAKER_00]: to be in a container a little no larger
than two fluid ounces and have to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrated dropper or a measuring device
that's kind of how they're distinguishing
[SPEAKER_00]: a tincture from sneaking in an alcoholic
beverage is that it has to have a little
[SPEAKER_00]: dropper and it has to be tight so you know
like airplane booze it's gonna be like
[SPEAKER_00]: that for track and trace system
requirement this is the happiest thing in
[SPEAKER_00]: there I'm gonna say for manufacturers this
brings me so much joy I can't even express
[SPEAKER_00]: it one of the things in the entire
regulations the concept of research and
[SPEAKER_00]: development only existed in nursery that
was the only people allowed to have
[SPEAKER_00]: anything for R&D and one of the big
questions was if you're a manufacturer
[SPEAKER_00]: developing a product and you're trying out
new things or new formulations and how do
[SPEAKER_00]: you know they work and what's gonna happen
or maybe there's gonna be some loss there
[SPEAKER_00]: really was no accountability for that the
CDPH has added this beautiful line that
[SPEAKER_00]: says one of the things that can be
recorded in the track and trace system
[SPEAKER_00]: within 24 hours is the use of cannabis or
cannabis product for internal quality
[SPEAKER_00]: control testing or product research and
development so the fact that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: acknowledged that that is a thing that
exists is a beautiful beautiful thing
[SPEAKER_00]: indeed real quick for the CDFA the track
and trace requirements they did go to
[SPEAKER_00]: calendar days instead of business days so
so a lot of these reporting requirements
[SPEAKER_00]: are like when you have three calendar days
to restore when connectivity goes down and
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to put in all your data you have
to report any change of disposition in
[SPEAKER_00]: three calendar days that's a long time
especially if you're in the up north and
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to come down out of the mountain
and get to internet you know reception and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff it's gonna be a challenge meeting
those calendar day requirements so just
[SPEAKER_00]: when you look at the regs be very very
specific and pay attention to when
[SPEAKER_00]: notifications any action is requiring
calendar days instead of business days
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh touched on this there was some
additions to the cultivation plan
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements there was clarifications on
what can be shared and what can't so
[SPEAKER_00]: things that cannot be shared was like
immature plant areas processing areas
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging areas in that quarantine area he
spoke of and then there was areas that can
[SPEAKER_00]: be shared that that were enumerated he
talked about the signed attestation that
[SPEAKER_00]: states you're gonna do the requirements
for legal use of pesticides in Los Angeles
[SPEAKER_00]: for example that requires getting a
pesticide applicator's license and an
[SPEAKER_00]: operator ID for your business so you have
to contact your agricultural commissioner
[SPEAKER_00]: to know what those requirements are I
think much of this he covered the there
[SPEAKER_00]: was some new clarifications on cannabis
waste super bummer for outdoor growers is
[SPEAKER_00]: this line that stayed that outdoor
licensees are prohibited from using light
[SPEAKER_00]: deprivation which means that they're
saying you can't even tent your plants if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to use a non-electrical non-light
sense from the the best that I can tell is
[SPEAKER_00]: this has to do I mean and that they
consider this a moderate offense that can
[SPEAKER_00]: carry a fine I believe that one is like
five hundred or a thousand dollars per
[SPEAKER_00]: instance and then they determined that I
mean I'm trying to get through the
[SPEAKER_00]: statement of reasons that part of that is
that you know you'll get more flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles if you use that light deprivation
technique and then they're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriately create scaled fees and the
fee for an outdoor grow is less than the
[SPEAKER_00]: fee for a mixed light grow so they want to
take away that ability for an outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grower to get multiple harvest is pretty
much what I'm reading into that because if
[SPEAKER_00]: they did that that they'd want to pay
higher fees if you're going to yield more
[SPEAKER_00]: so this is the one I like to point out
just as my advertisement for why you need
[SPEAKER_00]: an amazing compliance team is that that
administrative action for record-keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: is up to a $30,000 fine per individual
violation if your records are not in shape
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just record-keeping there's a lot
of other fines more fun things they change
[SPEAKER_00]: in the BCC they change the definition of
immature plant that held to anything over
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 inches so if you're a retailer and
you've got clones and they grow over 18
[SPEAKER_00]: inches it's not an immature plant anymore
you can't sell it that does not go for the
[SPEAKER_00]: CDFA they have a different for cultivation
there's a different definition of immature
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that doesn't impose that 18 inch
line inventory reconciliation this was
[SPEAKER_00]: good news change from 14 days to 30
calendar days so now you're you're
[SPEAKER_00]: described you don't have to do your
reconciliations but for every 30 days the
[SPEAKER_00]: significant discrepancy definition went up
a little bit to 3% of average monthly
[SPEAKER_00]: sales instead of two there was some
clarity oh yeah this was about this part
[SPEAKER_00]: did stay with the structures have to be
permanently affixed to the land so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't have like rolling like RVs and stuff
that you're using as spaces or shipping
[SPEAKER_00]: containers have to be permanently affixed
to the ground the there was some clarity
[SPEAKER_00]: around pre rolls it's nice they've got
specific that a licensed distributor can
[SPEAKER_00]: package and repackage and label and
cannabis including pre rolls and that in
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing in addition to the
activities a licensee can roll and package
[SPEAKER_00]: pre rolls they did add the line though to
clarify pre rolls have to be rolled prior
[SPEAKER_00]: to compliance testing so you don't test
your bulk and then roll pre rolls and put
[SPEAKER_00]: them out you have to roll them then test
them then put them out yeah right well
[SPEAKER_00]: it's you get it because we had it we had a
big issue is people get bulk tested and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they mixed it with untested and then
they're pre rolls didn't test right so
[SPEAKER_00]: until until we gain some trust in this
relationship we're having it's gonna take
[SPEAKER_00]: a minute and track and trace will help I
mean it'll help with the visibility on
[SPEAKER_00]: those things where every component is
tested and you can kind of see it better
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the big so resampling was a big
thing we had a big issue and we continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to have issues with testing labs having
issues it's like kind of one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things that did they didn't see that
coming that what happens when a lab loses
[SPEAKER_00]: its license and they're sitting on all
these samples and you're not allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: previously weren't allowed to transfer it
and have somebody else sample it and test
[SPEAKER_00]: it so you're just sitting waiting for your
product to be done and now they allow that
[SPEAKER_00]: if a licensed laboratory is unable to
competently complete the compliance
[SPEAKER_00]: testing after sampling you can contract
another lab to test your goods there was
[SPEAKER_00]: also the issue for a lot of manufacturers
was that they removed this language about
[SPEAKER_00]: the plus or minus ten percent it used to
be for especially for edibles it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred milligrams per package plus or
minus ten percent and they and they took
[SPEAKER_00]: that away which horrified many edible
companies because it meant that they would
[SPEAKER_00]: have to shoot for 90 percent so that all
of their stuff would be like you know 90
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams of THC because they wouldn't
want to go over the 100 threshold but that
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to have been corrected in the
distribution section in 5307.1 where the
[SPEAKER_00]: distributor it can look at it for their
quality assurance review any difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: within plus or minus ten percent is
considered still okay so that's that okay
[SPEAKER_00]: i think i did it and josh touched on the
OSHA so um so what so what now now what
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what i think i have this is my
little quick to-do list because obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of things that weren't
handled in the regulatory process one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the most glaring ones is compassion and
compassion programs um scott wiener is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to reintroduce his compassion bill
this year it's anticipated which was sp34
[SPEAKER_00]: which was to allow for the donation of
cannabis products to medicinal cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: patients without retailers having to pay
the full excise tax and the full taxes on
[SPEAKER_00]: those items so we're hoping that that goes
this also kicks in the delayed feasibility
[SPEAKER_00]: study that the bureau has to undertake
under mccursa of looking into the
[SPEAKER_00]: feasibility of a non-profit license type
which would create another possible avenue
[SPEAKER_00]: for the collective models for
compassionate care for for businesses to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to you know focus on the needs of
patients in the medicinal market without
[SPEAKER_00]: taking on the full you know necessarily
fee structure or tax structure of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial cannabis sovereign nations was
not solved at all in the regulations they
[SPEAKER_00]: still are like yeah waive all your
sovereign rights and go for it so i think
[SPEAKER_00]: there's still a lot of work to be done in
negotiating and figuring out how tribes
[SPEAKER_00]: can interplay and work with the commercial
cannabis industry sampling is still just a
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous the the back-end sales process
that was never contemplated by the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry of how products get to market and
the fact that you maybe need your
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution reps to have samples or be
able to give it to people there's still a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of problems in that area that need to
be solved that the regulators felt were
[SPEAKER_00]: out of their range of ability to deal with
that stuff because of the prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: against free products so it'll probably
require a bill or a new language the
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a tax bill that's going to be
introduced some people are thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: lackey's going to reintroduce the excise
tax bill to hopefully lower the excise tax
[SPEAKER_00]: because obviously we all know taxes are
out of control banking is another huge
[SPEAKER_00]: problem and Hertzberg is going to
reintroduce i think his banking bill to
[SPEAKER_00]: move towards the creation of charter banks
or some sort of solution and then
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously just the glooming loaming
problem of pathways to licensure they say
[SPEAKER_00]: 99 problems and local authorization is
number one that you know some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: questions are starting to be contemplated
is how how is this dual licensing system
[SPEAKER_00]: working out with you know localities and
them trying to get it together and those
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of complexities of not having those
things interface so that i think i got
[SPEAKER_00]: through that's what i have so obviously
there's tons more
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah and I would also say no I don't and
what Josh was saying is that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing in the regulations about
provisional licenses to explain how that
[SPEAKER_00]: system is going to work when it's going to
start what you have to do all we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: go off of is the bill text so it's going
to be critical to keep a close eye on how
[SPEAKER_00]: they roll out their program they've been
pretty mum about it even with the trade
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations and lobbyists and all that
stuff there's not a lot of information
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly I think because they don't know
because they just got passed as a bill and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're making it up so keep an eye on
that and also I would say again keep an
[SPEAKER_00]: eye on what Josh was saying about trying
to get clarity on how the agencies are
[SPEAKER_00]: interpreting that how that provisional
rollout is going to go in and when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be obligated to submit your
annual license because there seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: some different messaging from different
agencies where the CDPH is saying oh you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do it by the end of the year and
the CDFA is saying oh no you don't so
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of chatter about those
things so it's critical to kind of go get
[SPEAKER_00]: those answers in writing like Josh was
saying in a few seconds we have next if
[SPEAKER_10]: anybody has any questions that's fine yes
okay I was up here about the use the word
[SPEAKER_10]: brand is I sell something doesn't have to
be under the brand name of my license
[SPEAKER_10]: number one and also my company I might
have people ranging from people like me on
[SPEAKER_10]: the finance to our CEO to our formulator
making it is there any restriction on who
[SPEAKER_10]: in a company makes a manufactured product
or formulates it it could even be a
[SPEAKER_10]: shareholder like one of our investors
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily I mean that those would be
things is there certain limitations of
[SPEAKER_00]: like making sure that if you can have
unlimited brands but that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: registered DBAs and they're attached to
the license number exactly right
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I mean it seems like they're there I
remember going in for an early like test
[SPEAKER_00]: of the licensing software and they only
had about four product categories for
[SPEAKER_00]: manufactured products so they've been
expanding their understanding of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: possible and what people are making and I
don't think that there's any limitation on
[SPEAKER_00]: products what you would have to look at
though is if you are a licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer they did add language in
terms of notifications to the CDPH where
[SPEAKER_00]: every time you create a new product a new
formulation or release a new skew you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to notify them and update yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't have to be that I think that
the main clarification is a brand has to
[SPEAKER_00]: be attached to a licensed entity and in
that attachment you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a certain amount of disclosures and
have things in place
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah I mean that's pretty much what the
regulations give us is the new roadmap of
[SPEAKER_00]: these are these are the rules as they
understand them and now it's our job to
[SPEAKER_00]: find a way to navigate them and be
creative which luckily is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry has always been
really good at
[SPEAKER_00]: I would I would say a talk to an attorney
because when that's why I think it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: important to look at that definition of
cannabis accessories the original
[SPEAKER_00]: definition from the health and safety code
of marijuana accessories because in this
[SPEAKER_00]: would I tip my hat to the lawyers in the
room to read into that further but it
[SPEAKER_00]: describes a very exhaustive list of
anything that helps you to consume prepare
[SPEAKER_00]: grow prob so so I would you know if I was
a lawyer which I'm not I would say that
[SPEAKER_00]: cookbooks help is a method of figuring out
how I'm gonna put cannabis into the human
[SPEAKER_00]: body which is exactly what that definition
is and learning how to grow cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it into the human body so the the
hair splitting part that it will be is if
[SPEAKER_00]: the agencies are going to be psychotic
enough and I put nothing past them to say
[SPEAKER_00]: that any book cookbook blah blah blah in a
dispensary has to be by a licensed company
[SPEAKER_00]: and brand blah blah blah I don't see that
happening I see it as an ancillary product
[SPEAKER_00]: just like you don't have to be a licensed
cannabis company right now to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis accessory and I believe that
those fall under the definition of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis accessory but ask your lawyer
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I mean that would be that would be
the solution if they're gonna split hairs
[SPEAKER_00]: but I get that my suggestion is these
would be things that we need to go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: agencies after they're done with their
Christmas break because they're like don't
[SPEAKER_00]: ask us any questions it's over that after
that that we'd want to get further
[SPEAKER_00]: clarification to see are they seriously
taking it that far or under the I would
[SPEAKER_00]: argue that under the definition of
cannabis accessory and how extensive that
[SPEAKER_00]: definition is in the health and safety
code that the cookbook would fall under
[SPEAKER_00]: that thank you so much everybody thank you
