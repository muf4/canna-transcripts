[SPEAKER_00]: So we've created a line of self-contained
vaporizers that blend organically grown
[SPEAKER_00]: essential oils with cannabis oil for the
first time to create a more holistic and
[SPEAKER_00]: complementary medicating experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've done this by selecting
organically grown essential oils that
[SPEAKER_00]: enhance the natural properties of each
cannabis variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, Sativa, which is an
energetic and uplifting experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have blended with peppermint,
lime, cypress, and cinnamon essential
[SPEAKER_00]: oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: All uplifting and energizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For indica, which is a more physically
relaxing sensation, we've enhanced the
[SPEAKER_00]: relaxation properties by blending
lavender, chamomile, orange essential
[SPEAKER_00]: oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a hybrid pen that's blended with
just a little bit of coconut essential oil
[SPEAKER_00]: and a non-psychoactive CBD pen that's
blended with frankincense, langlang,
[SPEAKER_00]: tangerine, and geranium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what these essential oils do is all
kind of prepare the body and activate it
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way to make the experience of
medicating with each of these cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties more impactful for the
medicator.
