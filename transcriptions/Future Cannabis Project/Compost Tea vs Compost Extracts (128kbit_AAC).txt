[SPEAKER_01]: Scott, you had a post where you were
talking about extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you moving more towards extracts
versus compost teas?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then can you talk a little bit about
extracts versus teas and kind of your
[SPEAKER_00]: mindset?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think really, you know, kind of the
confusion that's happened is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's Dr. Laningham who came up with all
these methods and, you know, she's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: known for saying tea, saying tea,
saying tea, compost tea, compost tea,
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is people then go just do
any version of what they define as tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a extreme variation between
what Dr. Laningham defines as compost tea
[SPEAKER_00]: and what the market does across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of anything that's more
varied in any thing I've ever done in my
[SPEAKER_00]: entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the two major obstacles with
compost tea is you're doing animal
[SPEAKER_00]: husbandry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing animals and you're growing
life in a tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you either are or are not quantifying
those organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the people that possess a
microscope just kind of look through,
[SPEAKER_00]: which isn't bad, but there's a lot that
you can't see if you're just looking
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the early years, there was a lot of
really bad information as far as organism
[SPEAKER_00]: identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like an entire community went
chasing after the wrong goal because of a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple key people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's starting to get sorted out
a little bit now that Dr. Laningham's
[SPEAKER_00]: courses are far more accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially what we ran into in the
workplace is, you know, really the first
[SPEAKER_00]: few jobs I got were to teach people how to
brew tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that would look like is I would
go to the facility, we would set up a
[SPEAKER_00]: recipe, I would verify with the microscope
that it was what it needed to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we would replicate it over
multiple days so I could leave them with a
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through that first year, it became really
apparent the problems with that because
[SPEAKER_00]: what ends up happening is the climate
changes, the temperature changes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the conditions change for that life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think, you know, the market at
wide really understands how varied those
[SPEAKER_00]: results of compost tea brewing can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we start to communicate to people
these obstacles and we say you need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: checking and it kind of turns into this
like class warfare emotions, like people
[SPEAKER_00]: get offended, like I'm saying you're not
qualified to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, technically that's what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to brew tea, you should
become proficient in identifying organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually quantify them because you're
either brewing life or you're either
[SPEAKER_00]: brewing disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went from facility to facility and
facility and we just kept tracking the
[SPEAKER_00]: issues with people brewing tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around that same time, like from like 2014
to 2016, I think Dr. Lane really started
[SPEAKER_00]: switching more to the extract model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the benefits of tea is you excite
organisms and they produce glues and they
[SPEAKER_00]: stick to surfaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great if you're covering leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to penetrate to roots,
they never get to the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stick to the soil surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Lane was seeing a benefit to adding
compost extract to the soil versus compost
[SPEAKER_00]: tea because the compost extract,
you're dislodging organisms into water and
[SPEAKER_00]: then those organisms will travel as far as
the water does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you actually get to the desired
result quicker using a compost extract
[SPEAKER_00]: versus a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the downside of the compost extract is
you use more compost, but the upside is
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's almost no volatility.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's almost no detriment that can come
with it as long as your compost doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have detrimental aspects to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at the small scale, you can brew
some compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we started to get bigger and bigger
and bigger, we ran into remarkable
[SPEAKER_00]: obstacles at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't necessarily say this publicly
because then I get nasty emails and things
[SPEAKER_00]: from people that manufacture tea
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the larger the tank you go,
the worse it gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing that you want, in my
opinion, is a 500,000 gallon tea brew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I apologize to the people,
but that's the math of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of obstacles to
brewing tea because you're trying to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: on a timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to reproduce rabbits on a
perfect time scale that fits into the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you start a tea brew that has a
24 hour life cycle and you come in next
[SPEAKER_00]: morning, but then you discover an
irrigation leak and you get occupied for
[SPEAKER_00]: four hours, well, now that tea that may
have would have been healthy is now full
[SPEAKER_00]: of disease and problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put that onto your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of issues with tea at
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost extract is far lower volatility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we start moving up in scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not working with technically trained
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with agricultural employees
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's far easier to explain to a
non-trained employee how to do a compost
[SPEAKER_00]: extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought the fascinating part that you
guys discovered was the difference in high
[SPEAKER_02]: elevation and low elevation, lack of
oxygen and those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Total nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a total nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, like I said, 2015, 2016,
that was really the first jobs we got was
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching people how to brew tea because
that's really all they knew from Dr. Lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew that we were involved with Dr.
Lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now what my wife and I do is we
show up with a couple of 55 gallon drums
[SPEAKER_00]: and a pump and a sump pump and 130 foot
hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you know, the wife and I can
apply compost extract to 30,000 square
[SPEAKER_00]: feet in a workday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we just, we just, and it's,
and it's no volatility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cleans out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can rinse out the thing because what
we also started working, running into is
[SPEAKER_00]: you run into ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're trying to do a regulated
facility, you got an OSHA person making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you conform.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot have an employee climb up on a
ladder to get into a 250 gallon tank and a
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just not going to fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now you got to build a platform and
it just, you're multiplying problems to do
[SPEAKER_00]: something that we don't necessarily
advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, for, for Sarah and I,
the real like profound aha moment that
[SPEAKER_00]: will by far go down as one of the most
profound experiences I've had in any
[SPEAKER_00]: workplaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were trying to brew tea at a facility
that hired us to treat two that were about
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 miles apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were racing back and forth to set
tea brews at both facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we came to the one facility and it was
getting dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were running out of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time we were using like 200
and 300 gallon tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd put compost tea bags in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd aerate it for 20, 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd swap them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do that a couple of times until we hit
the targeted values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just didn't have enough time to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Sarah was like, well, I'll just
hand extract the amount of compost into a
[SPEAKER_00]: five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll pour it into the top of the tea
brewer and top it off and go home and get
[SPEAKER_00]: dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the funny part about it was she did it
faster than me and she got better
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction rates because the hand
extraction rate was more efficient than
[SPEAKER_00]: the aerated in the 300 gallon tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that we haven't looked back since.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not impressed by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we, there's a lot of jobs that don't
hire us because they want these wizard tea
[SPEAKER_00]: brewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, proof's in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't turned back since, you know,
and it's far easier for me to show up to a
[SPEAKER_00]: facility with two blue barrels,
bust out the extract, wash it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: turn it upside down and get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, that's, you know,
previously I used to advocate like 55
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon brewers and we were using these
stainless steel ones and we'd have our
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember when it fell on the employee?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that tank fell on one of the employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because she saw me and I, I would always
try to be really careful to not fill it up
[SPEAKER_00]: with water and move it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I screwed up and I needed it to go
like 30 feet to the left and I'd already
[SPEAKER_00]: filled it up and I was just kind of end of
day, tired, stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I picked, I was kind of dragging
this tank down this concrete thing to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the non-English speaking
agricultural employee that had to execute
[SPEAKER_00]: that task after I left did that same thing
and she pulled a 55 gallon stainless steel
[SPEAKER_00]: brewer on top of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the end of that game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that's not going down at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, a lot of these workplace
scenarios of practicality, like I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where Eric and I really are very
similar in that we always want to find the
[SPEAKER_00]: most practical, low cost, easy solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, people that make and sell
brewers don't want to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that want to buy brewers don't want
to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm telling you, we get remarkable
results using small barrels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most employees want to clock in and
clock out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as much as everybody wants to be
in cannabis and wants that job in it or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, a lot of people turn it into the
clock in and clock out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't make it easy and somewhat
desirable, it just becomes, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it becomes the next guy's job and the new
guy and the next and it just moves on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of these jobs, you know,
we're not saying everything's easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's work involved, but you have to
make it safe, first of all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's not safe, that's an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And secondly, if it's not something that
people are like feeling passionate about,
[SPEAKER_02]: it drives down morale because you're
working with a big team of people and all
[SPEAKER_02]: it takes is one, you know, seedling or
one, you know, cell to start to have that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, uninspired attitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it drags the whole bunch down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of these corporate facilities
don't give a fuck about you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not there to make friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, they see that shit and you're
gone quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, at the end of the day,
you know, making these facilities smooth
[SPEAKER_02]: and enticing for employees is important
because again, once you start getting to
[SPEAKER_02]: that clock in, clock out, passion drives
down and we're not actually leveling up at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what kind of evolved us to the
barrels is we were working on a large ag
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't just do cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did a farm that was 6,000 acres of
corn and soy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had like six 250 gallon tea brewers
that were in IBC totes, which kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: solves a problem at scale, but I have
objections to as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nonetheless, we were running those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Sarah and I developed the SOP and
determine how many minutes, how much
[SPEAKER_00]: compost, how much time, what process
yields the appropriate result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we turn that over to employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as the employees take over
that job, we start having problems with
[SPEAKER_00]: the numbers on the extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start getting undesirable aspects to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality goes down because they're not
able to clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not super motivated to climb in
that thing and scrub it like we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you start to lose repeatability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really where the 55 gallon
barrel excels is that it's small.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps it even.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps it in small enough batches to go
from space to pace to space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's repeatable and it's easy to clean
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see this in other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Frenchy Canole doesn't make hash in a
400 gallon barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes it in the same damn size that the
little washing machines are because you
[SPEAKER_00]: get better extraction rates and you get
more consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we just tried to replicate that
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Eric says, produce a standard
operating procedure that's not painful to
[SPEAKER_00]: an employee that doesn't add undue process
or headache or reasons to get yelled at or
[SPEAKER_00]: any of that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the 55 gallon drum solves all those
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps the extract into a small
container so you don't magnify variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get really consistent dispensing of
organisms across the property from corner
[SPEAKER_00]: to corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most employees can rinse it out with a
hose and turn it upside down and clean it
[SPEAKER_00]: properly, which is the actual goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is one of the major components
that's missing from the commercially
[SPEAKER_00]: produced tea brewers that is becoming very
apparent in the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've worked with some facilities in
Vegas, which has a remarkably difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial things to navigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we tracked several facilities over the
course of a year and saw microbial issues
[SPEAKER_00]: popping up with certain types of tea
brewers in process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you know, we moved away from a
lot of types of equipment and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as unsexy it is and as disappointing as it
is, we by far get the best results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using a couple of blue barrels and a
hundred dollar pump from Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you listen to Dr. Ingham, so much of
compost tea was really designed to do the
[SPEAKER_03]: glue binding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was to bind the particles so that you
start to have the ability to take soil
[SPEAKER_03]: that had inadequate tilth and increase it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we started using it as these
inoculants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing was that as you start to
learn, you're not qualified on the
[SPEAKER_03]: microscope.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have no idea what you're brewing
and you end up seeing pathogenic problems
[SPEAKER_03]: resulting from your work because you're
kind of using voodoo science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the compost extract is
excellent because you're able to take what
[SPEAKER_03]: you want to take and put it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that compost tea designed for
building ground that isn't ready for
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation and preparing it, laying the
cover crops in, binding the soil,
[SPEAKER_03]: gluing it together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the purpose of it more than
the way we use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was a brewer too and I got to a
size in brew tank where I was probably
[SPEAKER_03]: like 250.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it got to the size where it was,
I got to climb up in the damn thing to
[SPEAKER_03]: clean it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It becomes a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_03]: It starts to become too big to service.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't want a centralized monster
tank to feed through because I'm like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you start leaving residue in the lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're starting to have pathogenic
contamination because it has to be clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you start to realize you're doing the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're starting in a closet and you're
trying to multiply it out to acreage.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also too, what we do now is also
millions of square feet of evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And compost tea is a remarkably powerful
tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our counterparts, Nick Tomasini,
goes by Humankind Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He uses a lot of compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you properly brew tea and you get
it onto the plants, I mean, next morning
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a new branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's some wild shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you do it right and you hit the
numbers that Dr. Elaine defines,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pure witchcraft.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times the compost tea is a
fourth quarter decision, not the way Nick
[SPEAKER_00]: uses it, but like to combat disease or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're throwing a Hail Mary at fourth
quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what my wife and I have done,
if Don was like, how do we circle back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the very beginning to circumvent problems
to not need a fourth quarter decision?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that strategy is getting back to a
compost extract, starting at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning, starting with organisms that
are distributed evenly from corner to
[SPEAKER_00]: corner, start with a tank that doesn't
also bring disease, and then monitor that
[SPEAKER_00]: process effectively and appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take a compost tea and you can
knock out powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to do it back in the earlier
years, but it was just too complicated as
[SPEAKER_00]: a business strategy, so we stopped doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can come up to a facility and stop
a whole bunch of nightmares with a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can also go back to propagation,
start fresh, start with a good extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: use the microscope to quantify your
trajectory as you go from start to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can avoid getting mold by making
watering changes, by making feed changes,
[SPEAKER_00]: by in a lot of cases making environmental
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know what came with regulation for
us is, prior in the black markets,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a by all means necessary approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could spray Michael butanol in the
last week if you really felt like that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what you were going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because we can't do these,
we have to get back to the beginning of
[SPEAKER_00]: the root cause, identify what the actual
issue is, and avoid hitting that island
[SPEAKER_00]: altogether.
