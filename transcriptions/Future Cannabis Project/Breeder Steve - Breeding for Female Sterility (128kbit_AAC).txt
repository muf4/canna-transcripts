[SPEAKER_04]: to think the way I think of it is I've got
this huge palette of colors to work from
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's the best palette of colors and I
can draw on that to make any shade of
[SPEAKER_04]: anything and I don't I don't feel limited
to just pursuing two or three paths I
[SPEAKER_04]: really like to keep the keep the door wide
open to what what is required and what
[SPEAKER_04]: people want and I think from a production
point of view what people are going to
[SPEAKER_04]: want is going to be sterile versions of
those plants so once you've got the plants
[SPEAKER_04]: you want then you want to work on making
sterile versions of them because the
[SPEAKER_04]: sterile plants won't take seed so if you
want to grow a field with no seeds in it
[SPEAKER_04]: even if the neighbors have hemp all around
you need to have sterile plants so that's
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be the real one of the notable
features of the current cannabis genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: renaissance are seeing there's so many
more people involved in cannabis genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: research now than ever was on more
professional level than there ever was
[SPEAKER_04]: more academic level let's say you're going
to see a lot of advances from plants you
[SPEAKER_04]: don't need to trim to plants that can't be
seeded and plants that mites don't eat
[SPEAKER_04]: plants that are very very resistant to
different fungal issues it's I think we're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to see an enormous leap in cannabis
genetics just in the next five years like
[SPEAKER_04]: there's going to be more happening in
cannabis genetics in the last five years
[SPEAKER_01]: than has ever happened you were talking
sterile before right the sterile plants
[SPEAKER_04]: that I'm referring to that I've seen and
that I'm endeavoring to reliably produce
[SPEAKER_04]: they right now I've only about 50% success
rate but I need them to be at a hundred
[SPEAKER_04]: but those plants have no pistols they're
female plants with no pistols so you can
[SPEAKER_01]: smother them in pollen so they they're
barren basically they're barren they won't
[SPEAKER_01]: make them cannot get pregnant okay so so
is this something is this something new or
[SPEAKER_04]: has this been our I've seen is there a
word for that first time I saw it was in
[SPEAKER_04]: well the sterile females was essentially
it but the there's different roots to it I
[SPEAKER_04]: found and the first plants I found were in
96 and there's hormonal ways of inducing
[SPEAKER_04]: this and some people aim for polyploidy
mutagens others go for monocloids I think
[SPEAKER_04]: the monocloid is the way to go there's
also the possibility of doing it by gene
[SPEAKER_04]: editing but I'm not as happy about that
it's the problem I find with gene editing
[SPEAKER_04]: that scares me about it is that there's
been instances of the bacteria used to cut
[SPEAKER_04]: the chromosome is it ends up occasionally
inserting its own genes into the organism
[SPEAKER_04]: so you end up with a transgenic plant even
if you didn't mean to because maybe you
[SPEAKER_04]: know you think gene editing oh it sounds
nice and clean but it's not as it's not as
[SPEAKER_04]: clean as it could be yet and it's still in
its infancy but let's say there was a gene
[SPEAKER_04]: for hermaphrodism and you had a great
plant you loved that plant but it threw
[SPEAKER_04]: some bananas at the end every time and
you're like I can't keep this plant I hate
[SPEAKER_04]: hermies I can't but I don't want to lose
it because it's the only one I've got that
[SPEAKER_04]: tastes like whatever so you say if only I
could get in there and just remove the
[SPEAKER_04]: hermaphroditic trait that would be great
but if in doing so you introduce a foreign
[SPEAKER_04]: gene then you may regret it in other ways
down the road so for me the jury's out on
[SPEAKER_04]: it in a way and I wouldn't I'm all about
learning from these techniques but I would
[SPEAKER_04]: be really loathe to release anything done
that way without knowing a lot more about
[SPEAKER_04]: it because I'm not convinced it's all
ready for release but I'm totally
[SPEAKER_01]: convinced it needs to be studied you know
the concept here is basically sterile
[SPEAKER_01]: females and then you could plant a field
full of sterile females and never have to
[SPEAKER_01]: worry about the hemp farmer down the
street impregnating you know the fox in
[SPEAKER_01]: the hen house coming in impregnating but
sterile plants you put them out they
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot make it see they're incredible but
what you're saying is that we don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: you know it's like every pharmaceutical
drug commercial like this will this will
[SPEAKER_01]: solve problem a but you'll have anal
leakage and you'll die none of this this
[SPEAKER_04]: is a I was only talking about that in
reference to gene editing as a pathway the
[SPEAKER_04]: other ways of doing it through mutagenic
breeding really is not gonna have any risk
[SPEAKER_04]: of transgenics there's nothing about that
the the other the hormonally induced ones
[SPEAKER_04]: the other way of doing them there's not
hormonally induced with and doesn't bring
[SPEAKER_04]: you back to the tissue culture angle is
pollen culture some people do it as anter
[SPEAKER_04]: culture but you could take a single grain
of pollen they come I mean think how much
[SPEAKER_04]: grains of pollen you'd have in one gram of
pollen it's mind-boggling if you think of
[SPEAKER_04]: those grains of pollen as a haploid seed
and you raise that grain of pollen in its
[SPEAKER_04]: own test tube into a callus and from the
callus you initiate green growth and start
[SPEAKER_04]: a new plant that plant is a haploid it
doesn't have a mother and father is only
[SPEAKER_04]: the father so it's a haploid the cannabis
is typically diploid so it's got two sets
[SPEAKER_04]: of chromosomes and one from the mother one
from the father same as you and I are we
[SPEAKER_04]: talking somatic embryogenesis well yes
somatic embryogenesis is a callous culture
[SPEAKER_04]: that is callous culture but growing you
can do callous culture from somatic
[SPEAKER_04]: embryogenesis is when you do callous
culture and you encapsulate it for a
[SPEAKER_04]: synthetic seed so that's the somatic part
you want it sleeping so you're taking
[SPEAKER_04]: you're making tissue culture dormant for a
little bit and encapsulating it is somatic
[SPEAKER_04]: embryogenesis but that starts as callous
culture typically but callous culture is
[SPEAKER_04]: usually a callous is an adventitious root
so when you look at the bottom of your
[SPEAKER_04]: trunk right above the soil line there'll
be some little white bumps on the bark and
[SPEAKER_04]: if you buried them they would grow into
roots so those little bumps are called
[SPEAKER_04]: adventitious roots also known as callous
so if you sanitize the surface of that and
[SPEAKER_04]: took a razor and nicked off some callous
you could propagate at a cellular level
[SPEAKER_04]: and raise up you know you could put those
callous in a blender and make it into a
[SPEAKER_04]: million little callous cells and grow them
in a suspension culture and then as they
[SPEAKER_04]: get to a size where you want them to have
some green because it's very easy to have
[SPEAKER_04]: them growing in the white the trick is to
get them a different for every variety but
[SPEAKER_04]: to get them to initiate the green growth
and you typically would do that by
[SPEAKER_04]: changing the spectrum of the lighting over
your bioreactor and hormonal initiation so
[SPEAKER_04]: the once you've got those little
artificial seeds in system suspension you
[SPEAKER_04]: could start encapsulating them but that
has nothing to do with the sterile females
[SPEAKER_04]: other than the callous culture could be
initiated from if you're doing it just
[SPEAKER_04]: from a mother you're just making cuttings
of that mother but if you're doing it from
[SPEAKER_04]: a single grain of pollen you've got you're
doing it from a plant you've never seen
[SPEAKER_04]: yet you know and when you grow that plant
out from a single grain of pollen not a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of people are doing that i know i
think i know two other groups actually
[SPEAKER_01]: doing pollen culture right now and this is
something that you're researching yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: this is something we're playing with now
because because i think and i really want
[SPEAKER_04]: i'm working on the financing in-house
testing because right now for sequencing i
[SPEAKER_04]: have to send it out so we can prepare the
sample but we would send it out for
[SPEAKER_04]: sequencing but it's quite expensive and
especially when you want to sample high
[SPEAKER_04]: volume so let's say i want to sample a
million grains of pollen you look for a
[SPEAKER_04]: specific trait you know that's a bit cost
prohibitive sending that out at 1500 bucks
[SPEAKER_04]: a pop for sample right so if you can get
high volume sample the equipment which is
[SPEAKER_04]: very expensive but if you can get that and
run it in-house and keep it busy then it
[SPEAKER_04]: makes sense so sifting through and weeding
out plants even from seedlings right if
[SPEAKER_04]: you've got a million seedlings started you
can take a little punch out of the second
[SPEAKER_04]: or third leaf that's growing from each one
and you could say okay you know whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: trait you're looking for if it was purple
or green or sterile and non-sterile you
[SPEAKER_04]: could separate those plants out you know
male female or hermaphrodite you can
[SPEAKER_04]: separate those plants out at a very young
age and and if you're looking for one
[SPEAKER_04]: that's say the highest in cbdv which one
if you have a known marker for cbdv then
[SPEAKER_04]: you're saying which ones have the the best
concentration of that marker you know
[SPEAKER_04]: which ones are really going to push the
cbdv so you can start once you can start
[SPEAKER_04]: isolating your selections you know through
lab assisted selective breeding even
[SPEAKER_04]: without doing any transgenic madness you
can have some really stellar information
[SPEAKER_04]: quickly from large batches and that saves
so much time you know you still want to
[SPEAKER_04]: take the contenders and finish them off
and see them in in under real conditions
[SPEAKER_04]: but just being able to thin the herd out
by looking under the hood that's a huge
[SPEAKER_04]: advantage because those pollen grains are
going to make a haploid plant which has a
[SPEAKER_04]: single chromosome rather than you and i
have we're diploids because we got one
[SPEAKER_04]: strand from our mother and one strand from
our father whereas that one only has the
[SPEAKER_04]: strand from the father never met the
mother and we went ahead and took it to
[SPEAKER_04]: the next level so so starting with
haploids you can use that and cross it to
[SPEAKER_04]: itself later and make a double haploid and
it's got the identical two strings of of
[SPEAKER_04]: genes so there's different pathways you'll
see people using to get to the sterile
[SPEAKER_04]: females that important thing to remember
which i was about to touch on earlier but
[SPEAKER_04]: we switched here somehow but there's two
types of sterile females in in the world
[SPEAKER_04]: we see parthenocarpic which is the virgin
fruit which is the only way i'm interested
[SPEAKER_04]: in that will not take the pollen and then
you have stenocarpic plants and that has
[SPEAKER_04]: little aborted seeds in it and that's
useless for us so that's like the seedless
[SPEAKER_04]: watermelon seedless grapes and you get
those little white pips in them and stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: but they don't develop a finished seed but
nobody wants thug that's all polluted with
[SPEAKER_04]: little white seeds right so it's not good
enough that they abort them later which is
[SPEAKER_04]: stenocarpy we don't want them to make them
in the first place that's parthenocarpy
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's the the big dividing line i've
seen a lot of breeders fail to make
[SPEAKER_04]: sterile females using polyploids and
polyploids are how stenocarpic plants are
[SPEAKER_02]: made are people using these procedures in
in this in the state or or i've seen one
[SPEAKER_04]: american and one in spain and then us in
colombia so there's and the main challenge
[SPEAKER_02]: would be the the cost of doing this the
lab costs i don't think so for the
[SPEAKER_04]: straight up sterile females you don't have
to spend you know millions of dollars the
[SPEAKER_04]: first time i saw it was in 96 and it was
out of somebody's basement i mean you
[SPEAKER_04]: could make these it was like you know when
the first sterile females came up is when
[SPEAKER_04]: people started trying to make them a nice
seed and it was before anybody was using
[SPEAKER_04]: silvery and people were using other
hormones like aba and it's basically just
[SPEAKER_01]: a freaky little what's the form factor
like if people can create sterile females
[SPEAKER_01]: and you could plant a whole field of it is
the form factor like could you create
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds where if i pop those seeds every
female is sterile or is it tissue culture
[SPEAKER_04]: or do you have to have one mom that's what
we're working on now the best i've done is
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 so i'd get 100 female seeds and only
half of them had pistols but i want to
[SPEAKER_04]: release those with 100 without pistols so
you can you can make a selection right now
[SPEAKER_04]: without with only getting half as steriles
you can make a selection and propagate
[SPEAKER_04]: those in tissue culture but ideally i
would like to be able to make the seed 100
[SPEAKER_04]: at that sterile so that they can just go
straight into the field without having to
[SPEAKER_04]: be propagated any way shape or form i have
recently brought up an american friend
[SPEAKER_04]: that has a lot more training than me in
molecular genetics and he was growing
[SPEAKER_04]: spice in the 90s early 2000s he'd come to
visit me in switzerland he's a longtime
[SPEAKER_04]: spice fan spice grower he was growing
aquaponic sweet tooth in like 2000 and now
[SPEAKER_04]: he's spent the last 20 years getting
degrees and studying molecular genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: and he said hey i want to do a phd on
cannabis if your company can sponsor me
[SPEAKER_04]: i'd do it with you guys so we were able to
bring him in so it's really fun to build
[SPEAKER_01]: the teams so with him specifically what
what kind of problem what kind of tasks
[SPEAKER_01]: problems do you want to ask him was
solving like like like what's what's
[SPEAKER_01]: what's his first project find us a powdery
mildew resistant genes you'll be looking
[SPEAKER_04]: at that the fungal resistance is a big
part of it um but also the sterile females
[SPEAKER_04]: is i said that's really got to be a strong
focus on each of the pathways of doing it
[SPEAKER_04]: to chart them and what's good and bad
about each of the pathways we found
[SPEAKER_04]: towards doing that the fungal resistance
goes on i stand that's really key always
[SPEAKER_04]: to watch but as far as like if i send out
um prepared samples to be sequenced i
[SPEAKER_04]: can't read the information that comes back
so i require a genetics interpreter that
[SPEAKER_04]: knows how to look at a sequencing analysis
and say okay here's what you're looking at
[SPEAKER_04]: and they explain it to me and they can
decipher that so he's really gifted at
[SPEAKER_04]: that sort of thing and he showed me a lot
of the work he's done has been in tracking
[SPEAKER_04]: specific markers in lettuce and he would
attach a glow in the dark gene to the
[SPEAKER_04]: thing he's looking for and then it would
make it very obvious because all the
[SPEAKER_04]: lettuce sprouts that had it glowed in the
dark so i mean that's transgenic lettuce
[SPEAKER_04]: but you know we don't necessarily want to
eat that lettuce or smoke it but to be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to work under the hood like that not
just to look under the hood is an asset i
[SPEAKER_04]: don't necessarily want to making
transgenic cannabis with but i want them
[SPEAKER_04]: to be able to help me identify and track
markers for the development of traits got
it you you you you you you you you you you
you you you
