[SPEAKER_00]: Are you still planning to cultivate or are
you just going to let it go fallow for a
[SPEAKER_01]: year actually I'm gonna go probably take
it all out when I brought a permaculture
[SPEAKER_01]: guy in from Layton from the permaculture
conference I was involved in so he flew in
[SPEAKER_01]: yesterday and took a look at my property
and we're gonna start getting ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: play a radish all over the benches because
everything regrast in from all the because
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the initial work a couple years ago
so the whole thing is all so you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: grow radishes so that I can break up the
soil and then I can mulch it in and what
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll do is it'll let me start building
soil because see the thing is that if you
[SPEAKER_01]: follow Colorado Oregon Washington model
the first year first year and a half or
[SPEAKER_01]: two of legal everybody got paid really
well because there was this shortage of
[SPEAKER_01]: product that could move into the system
through regulated people but California
[SPEAKER_01]: because California made the deal with law
enforcement to allow each county to have
[SPEAKER_01]: its own control over the market in that
county 65% of California is a desert and
[SPEAKER_01]: so where you have storefronts they're
concentrated and in places like Humboldt
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're gonna have a couple in
Garberville Red Way that you go to Arcata
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortuna not Fortuna but Rio Del then you
go into Arcata Eureka area where they'd be
[SPEAKER_01]: like you know 10 there by the time you're
done you're gonna have like 40
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries in Humboldt County total like
watch how many they're gonna really build
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gonna build three or four in Rio
Del you're gonna have there's a new one
[SPEAKER_01]: open and a nice one too there's a nice
dispensary in Red Way I just drove by I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't wait to go inside and it's gorgeous
and it's called the country club and
[SPEAKER_01]: good-looking spot so I'd love to go in
there and check it out but you go one
[SPEAKER_01]: there I think they're gonna pop one here
there'd be one up the road there's mine
[SPEAKER_01]: then they'll be down the road so by the
time you're done how many will there be if
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll be maybe 10 in Arcata 10 in Eureka
that'll be 20 just within that little
[SPEAKER_01]: distance McKinleyville will have a couple
so you're gonna have in Humboldt County
[SPEAKER_01]: with 120,000 people so say 30 say I'm over
exaggerating 40 say we have 30 total in
[SPEAKER_01]: the county that means for every 4,000
people you have a dispensary that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: work in a rural area it just doesn't and
so you have places like Humboldt that are
[SPEAKER_01]: popping up stores everywhere but there's
no population here if we had a million two
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred thousand it'd be incredible for
the store owners but the store owners
[SPEAKER_01]: about to take a real beating because
they're gonna all compete with each other
[SPEAKER_01]: to the death over who's gonna be able to
get in the cheapest pot and then you get
[SPEAKER_01]: to a point where it gets down to a 1%
margin like Walmart then you got companies
[SPEAKER_01]: they like the one that just popped up in
Arcata where they're doing delivery only
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's basically the Costco weed
because what you do is you pay them a
[SPEAKER_01]: membership fee and the membership fee to
them allows them to just deliver it to you
[SPEAKER_01]: direct so you can get away from the nasty
stores because they overcharge you by 400%
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like who the fuck is putting four
times on the price it's not really true it
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone has a cost of production and so
when you create a system where you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: allow the whole state to have storefronts
and you have these huge deserts and you
[SPEAKER_01]: favor areas that can produce massive
quantities of cannabis before you allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry to kind of stabilize remember
it was supposed to be a five-year delay
[SPEAKER_01]: but anything over an acre well that
anything over an acre we still don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: anything over an acre each each you could
have multiple acres but you can't have a
[SPEAKER_01]: 48 acre grow you can have 40 contiguous
acres with a touch but it's not one plot
[SPEAKER_01]: of 40 it's zoning it's it's it's semantics
but the bottom line is it lets you get
[SPEAKER_01]: around to that issue so what you have is
you have mega producers producing and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're burning investment dollars so most
of these big companies aren't making any
[SPEAKER_01]: money at all they're losing money and they
that's a strategy and we've been saying
[SPEAKER_01]: this for years that's an oligarchy model
when I took a look at this years ago I
[SPEAKER_01]: said look it's gonna be an oligarchy model
you're gonna have a few big companies come
[SPEAKER_01]: in and price worry but everybody out of
existence and then as soon as everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: gone they'll raise the prices to what
works for them that's the oil companies so
[SPEAKER_01]: you have two or three major refineries two
three major producers everybody else buys
[SPEAKER_01]: gas for them prices the same everywhere
you go regionally same thing here with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and so for us you know the only
way we can survive the only way we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about this is to do regional
survivability where if you're in Michigan
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're in the cherry areas you get
together with all your other farmers if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in southern Humboldt you're in this
this regular valley this is the center
[SPEAKER_01]: strip through the Eel River if you're over
in Palo Verde that's a different
[SPEAKER_01]: Appalachian if you're in in you know
southern Mendocino hot or dry or if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: in Trinity all those places have unique
characteristics and they're pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: clustered each one of those groups those
gardeners those farmers have to work
[SPEAKER_01]: together in some capacity and form their
own alliances so that what you can do is
[SPEAKER_01]: you can share IP you can share assistance
and labor and you can get yourself to more
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient model the dream of us all being
owner-operators and running our own little
[SPEAKER_01]: farm and be able to make money and have a
brand a brand means people know who you
[SPEAKER_01]: are doesn't mean you have a hat and a
t-shirt it means people recognize you and
[SPEAKER_01]: how do they recognize you when you what
you're going to drive it to every store in
[SPEAKER_01]: the state you're going to drive it they
moved a pound last month so you each each
[SPEAKER_01]: place moves a pound a month so you've got
you know 12 stores move 12 pounds you grew
[SPEAKER_00]: a thousand pounds yeah and yet the to work
together the cooperative model as
[SPEAKER_00]: California has it right now is is somewhat
cumbersome I mean there's a four acre
[SPEAKER_00]: limit in terms of exactly you have to be
only 10,000 square feet or lower as an
[SPEAKER_00]: individual farm and then collectively you
can't be over four acres so you're still
[SPEAKER_00]: put at you know it's still a cumbersome
process and an additional cost to go
[SPEAKER_01]: through to become a cooperative it lets
you be about 16 people because you got if
[SPEAKER_01]: you can only have four acres and it gets
40 four thousand square that gives you
[SPEAKER_01]: about 16 people per group so if you just
choose the 16 people you grew up with but
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the additional time of working
together is 16 individual owner-operators
[SPEAKER_01]: what's your choice yeah go home and go
pour go do it on your own show me how
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to do this on your own show
me show and then there's the model of like
[SPEAKER_00]: flow Connors coming in as the largest
distributor outdoor in California
[SPEAKER_00]: currently and they they're sort of looking
at the Sunkist model where all the orange
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers are branded under Sunkist as
orange juice you buy orange juice it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's Sunkist but it comes from different
orange farmers but are the orange farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the profit or is Sunkist the
company getting the majority of the profit
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the question when it comes to some
model like flow Connors but even no matter
[SPEAKER_01]: how you look at it though ag is that the
farmer always gets screwed in ag it just
[SPEAKER_01]: it's what it is and so you that's why you
have to have multiple permits you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: just be a farmer the dream to be a farmer
is a dream but the reality is you're in
[SPEAKER_01]: the lowest price point of the entire
supply chain so flow can is got a
[SPEAKER_01]: chokehold on the sungrown because they're
basically beating everybody by price so if
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to if you get flow Connor
products through the distributor they're
[SPEAKER_01]: lower than other sungrown models it makes
it difficult for other distributors to
[SPEAKER_01]: compete with them because not every
distributor can afford to lose a million
[SPEAKER_01]: and a half a month so so flow can does
bleed in a million and a half a month at
[SPEAKER_01]: least from documents that got released
into the public now they don't they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: they won't publicly address that but
documents got released and somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: brought it up that said hey look it looks
like you're losing a million and a half a
[SPEAKER_01]: month and so if you're losing a million
and a half a month then how exactly is
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone supposed to compete with you at
that level so if your model and I
[SPEAKER_01]: understand this because basically like I
said earlier that that is the model of new
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses it's price war it's can you get
enough investment so that you can bleed
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody out long enough to outlast them
and so the thing is that yeah you can flow
[SPEAKER_01]: can is grabbing up farmers and putting
them to work but are they are those farm
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't know I'm not involved with
look Anna but I don't seem to see people
[SPEAKER_01]: jumping up and down and believe that they
are either so I would assume that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not getting paid very well because if your
company's losing money the idea that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're paying you a lot of money to lose
money doesn't make any sense to me it's
[SPEAKER_01]: more a strategy of let's get the bottom
line as low as possible and then let's
[SPEAKER_01]: dump and then that way we can get market
share and then hopefully market share
[SPEAKER_01]: converts into value of business and then
that's an acquisition model I don't see
[SPEAKER_00]: does it mean that the price for the farmer
money ultimately go up it could possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: go up in time but I look at Oregon as the
for individuals that have recognition like
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington only a couple farms are really
making good money you know what's that fat
[SPEAKER_01]: hand up there's doing really well because
they put what fat hand to do drop the
[SPEAKER_01]: price in half so when they came into the
industry the first thing they did was cut
[SPEAKER_01]: it from 60 to 30 instantly when price war
grabbed huge market share use that to
[SPEAKER_01]: drive their infrastructure and
advancements so they can operate at that
[SPEAKER_01]: level but if you're not able to operate at
that level where you can drop your price
[SPEAKER_01]: by half price war it out grab share and
then use the share to build so you can
[SPEAKER_01]: still live at that margin how are you
going to do it see the problem with the
[SPEAKER_01]: small farmers in our regions is that they
had to go through the same amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure development as anybody that
was big meaning that if you had a water
[SPEAKER_01]: crossing to fix for your for your you know
1,500 square foot heritage farm I get 25
[SPEAKER_01]: plants you still had to go spend 50 grand
to get that culvert fixed just as if you
[SPEAKER_01]: had an acre so there was no easement
that's the political thing here is that we
[SPEAKER_01]: made it easy for you to do this no you
didn't and you didn't make it easy at all
[SPEAKER_01]: it's as difficult as it could be and it's
as expensive as it could be so that the
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller farmers are going to get buried
alive that's where with that that's but if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a 2,500 5,000 you know now you're
talking 40 farmers form a collective
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's still it's it's four acre cap
and to me the only way that any bus and it
[SPEAKER_01]: is I'm going to do this is to work that
method I mean for me what I did for as
[SPEAKER_01]: many years I've been doing this I've been
putting plants in the people's hands you
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't get your hands on I mean if it
was red hot in the market I had my hands
[SPEAKER_01]: on and I moved it into the public right
away and I didn't hold it back for myself
[SPEAKER_01]: so only I could have it I moved it into
the into the the grower world so that this
[SPEAKER_00]: way we're always constantly fresh and
trendy so are you suggesting for farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: to that are getting together informing
cooperatives are working on that but
[SPEAKER_00]: they're growing similar cultivars so that
they have more larger product to offer or
[SPEAKER_00]: they're focusing on just a few cultivars
instead of a large variety what is your
[SPEAKER_01]: advice my advice on that would be if you
have enough people you have to realize
[SPEAKER_01]: that first you got to figure out what's
overproduced so you take a clear look at
[SPEAKER_01]: the market you say anything under 20% and
numbers don't mean a damn thing to me in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of how I smoke it but I'm being
crystal clear as a dispensary owner that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff doesn't have some numbers on it the
market still doesn't really care and it
[SPEAKER_01]: has no extraction value so if you're not
going to have a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids present you can't blow the
material so you can't have your tops move
[SPEAKER_01]: into the world and all your lowers go
because if the numbers aren't prime the
[SPEAKER_01]: market doesn't want to buy it so the
market is still numerically driven the
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers are low the product won't move you
have to take a look at the nurseries that
[SPEAKER_01]: are selling product because right now it's
a freak show track and trace isn't in play
[SPEAKER_01]: they got rid of they got rid of track and
trace here the SIPCA system in Helmbolt
[SPEAKER_01]: got whacked out metric hasn't really
kicked in fully because nobody's really
[SPEAKER_01]: annual yet but the nurseries that are
throughout the state most of them sell
[SPEAKER_01]: very similar products whatever was hot and
trendy in their mind and so a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers run in and get those the big
operations run in and get those well
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to be a nice oversupply come
November so when these large monster
[SPEAKER_01]: operations start spewing I mean they're
dropping some of these operations are good
[SPEAKER_01]: for 250,000 pounds a year so some of these
guys are dropping 12 to 20,000 pounds a
[SPEAKER_01]: drop you don't want to be in that wherever
those varietals are that are in those
[SPEAKER_01]: production models you don't want to be in
you need to be in something that is a
[SPEAKER_01]: little differentiated so that it's not
fitting into that same mega category
[SPEAKER_01]: because then you're going to have to work
off of efficiency they're going to get you
[SPEAKER_01]: on efficiency so you need to go into
things that are trendy in the terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: what people desire if they like fruits and
earths that means they're liking some kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of cherry pie laid on top of a cookie
which is almost all these new modern
[SPEAKER_01]: varietals that are blisteringly hot or
they're a sherbet tied into something or
[SPEAKER_01]: it's an OG woven into a fruit or it's it's
the gorilla glue because of the because
[SPEAKER_01]: the numbers and the and the quantity is
woven in with some kind of fruit little
[SPEAKER_01]: differentiations so that you're not just
running the base varietal and if you can
[SPEAKER_01]: get enough of the small farmers that can
produce at a similar production
[SPEAKER_01]: methodology and are in similar situations
then what you have is enough of that
[SPEAKER_01]: product to actually satisfy your
distributors where the distributors can
[SPEAKER_01]: say hey listen we don't really want to buy
six pounds off you because they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: filling niche dispensaries what they would
much rather have is there be 600 pounds of
[SPEAKER_01]: it available so they can at least move a
supply chain and get it moved I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: the major issue with this whole problem
for us is holding the product once you've
[SPEAKER_01]: harvested it it does not move through the
chain quickly so what you have to look at
[SPEAKER_01]: is first where do we get differentiation
where do we find something that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: fit that doesn't fit into the bigger
picture but it's desirable and then make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure the numbers are hot if you got over
three five on the turps you got over 20 on
[SPEAKER_01]: the numbers your your number looks good on
a shelf because those numbers drive sales
[SPEAKER_01]: and until the market the consumer realizes
that numbers don't really mean a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: except in efficiency for extraction where
we're kind of stuck with it and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to understand that if you go to
some of these big distributors some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these big processors they have buildings
full of weed that are brown that is
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting there because they can't move it
at the pace so you need to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: your product is not overly monoterpene
dominant because the monoterp is great for
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh frozen where we can freeze it we can
extract it but how much of that is moving
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's cheap now too and so how much
how many people are really consuming fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: frozen pen pens killing it but that's
distill it in turps combined the fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: frozen model is for people who like to
smoke bho and it's not as many people as
[SPEAKER_01]: it was the you just don't see it when i go
to events i don't see the torches
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere anymore not like i used to so
that market was never massive it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: hot so everybody's going to shoehorn it
into a tiny market you're kind of screwed
[SPEAKER_01]: so if you're going to go into that market
you have to be monoterp driven but if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to go into something that's
going to sit for five and a half months
[SPEAKER_01]: before it moves it has to have a couple of
characteristics that are important it has
[SPEAKER_01]: to have an incredible density of flour so
that each time it gets handled in this
[SPEAKER_01]: process it doesn't break apart into pieces
and it has to have a really good deep rich
[SPEAKER_01]: sesquiterpene base so that it holds flavor
when it's consumed because most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff you see is damaged if you're going
to get into pre rolls because pre rolls
[SPEAKER_01]: are hot you better be crystal clear about
who's moving them and at what rate of
[SPEAKER_01]: speed and that way you be able to
determine how much of your product you
[SPEAKER_01]: convert to pre roll and move versus how
much do you hold back and then move when
[SPEAKER_01]: it's appropriate because as soon as i
grind it i oxidize it and i diminish it
[SPEAKER_01]: then i hold it and it diminishes and by
the time it gets to somebody it's a c
[SPEAKER_01]: minus and it was an a and from somebody
who knows a tremendous number of farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: and then sells the product the difference
in what they grew and what i sold is so
[SPEAKER_01]: different there's no word for it and it's
not the farmer's fault and the farmers are
[SPEAKER_01]: looking like shit because of this because
they're all looking like they can't grow
[SPEAKER_01]: the outdoor guys don't know what they're
doing and indoors better it's not it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor models are primarily people that
are much more funded you could afford to
[SPEAKER_01]: spend a couple million minimum to build an
indoor model you typically have other
[SPEAKER_01]: investment groups around you tied into
supply chain management which means your
[SPEAKER_01]: product moves quicker and more
expeditiously so indoor i'm looking at two
[SPEAKER_01]: months old outdoor i'm looking at seven
months old so why is that because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that they don't have the money so
their funding doesn't allow them to have
[SPEAKER_01]: enough licenses to speed this up and to
control the quality so if you look at why
[SPEAKER_01]: in a state a state means all processes
controlled in-house and so in a state
[SPEAKER_01]: model is always considered better wine
than sending it to a subcontractor to
[SPEAKER_01]: process even though the subcontractor is
going to do the same process the idea is
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're controlling the variables of
quality more definitively and so that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the thing that i see with cannabis is that
until we have an ability to get product
[SPEAKER_01]: held correctly in stasis so we don't have
deterioration of the product holding it in
[SPEAKER_01]: in some black plastic totes in a garage
waiting to get processed is not what i
[SPEAKER_01]: would call the right method but what do
you do you have to have an extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive sophisticated system to hold so
then we'll pass it on to other bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: entities and they'll do it they don't have
the facilities either right to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature and humidity all controlled at
the level at the level needed and for the
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties because not every variety wants
the same control so the bottom line is
[SPEAKER_01]: you're having to be very specific and
we're not we're being very general and
[SPEAKER_01]: what it's doing is it's just destroying
the perception of value of these products
[SPEAKER_01]: so the customer becomes dissatisfied with
sun-grown and they become satisfied with
[SPEAKER_01]: some sun-grown parts that move through but
a lot of it is they keep going lower and
[SPEAKER_01]: lower pricing and what it does it takes a
lot of these small craft people that
[SPEAKER_01]: produce some exquisite probiotically grown
you know regeneratively grown cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that's environmentally friendly
people put a lifetime effort to get that
[SPEAKER_01]: good they're producing world-class pop but
the consumer market doesn't care because
[SPEAKER_01]: they figure hey for half the price i can
get something pretty close they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it and i think that that's such an
issue with us right now that it makes
[SPEAKER_01]: these conversations just you know what do
you do and i tell people hey if you ask in
[SPEAKER_01]: my opinion on what i'm doing i was going
to go crude and then i started laying out
[SPEAKER_01]: the numbers the other day and i realized i
would be better to lose 15 grand than to
[SPEAKER_01]: lose 100 grand and at best maybe make it
back so what i get to do is i get to run
[SPEAKER_01]: my farm all year and not get paid myself
that doesn't make any sense and so i think
[SPEAKER_01]: that the long game is is especially places
like humble county more than most places
[SPEAKER_01]: is that the the brand value of humble is
strong outside of california not in
[SPEAKER_01]: california as much because california the
big markets sf in la and and those groups
[SPEAKER_01]: are caught up with their own hype scene
and so humble doesn't have because each
[SPEAKER_01]: each each region is competing for who's
the top of the food chain well they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to buy our product and neither does
la in the same way small groups do the
[SPEAKER_01]: education has to happen and the pricing
has to be correct but the farmers that are
[SPEAKER_01]: growing here have to be able to survive
long enough to do it and they also have to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to realize like in their initial
conversation we had about genetics the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that you have might not be yours by
the time you put it out because utility
[SPEAKER_01]: patents from these you know the box group
these guys are screwing around like 17 18
[SPEAKER_01]: patterns right now utility patents big
broad patents on you know one-to-one no
[SPEAKER_00]: mere scene they own that it almost seems
like a strategy that you're suggesting is
[SPEAKER_00]: to pull back from the farming if you can
and focus your energy on you know like let
[SPEAKER_00]: your hold your permit and do all the hoops
and the fees to keep the permit alive but
[SPEAKER_00]: you can all you can also file that you're
not growing and so you don't have to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: the tax on the cultivation and then put
your energy into preparing for when the
[SPEAKER_00]: markets open up both in the states and
eventually globally building that business
[SPEAKER_00]: so you have the structure of your business
solid so you have what your marketing and
[SPEAKER_00]: branding is going to be what your
relationships are going to be what your
[SPEAKER_00]: message is stand out globally really
because we're looking at the possibility
[SPEAKER_00]: of global trade in the next ten years and
definitely state-to-state trade we're
[SPEAKER_00]: already there's already talk about trade
between California and Oregon and how
[SPEAKER_00]: would that affect the market wow because
they have such oversupply in Oregon so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the same same situation it's just
that you know how do you financially
[SPEAKER_01]: handle this and so for me I mean I went
back to work you know with consulting so I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean I'm traveling all over the place to
make money and it's sure the hell not what
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to do but I I had made the plan
based off of the other states that went
[SPEAKER_01]: legal I followed how they operated and I
said hey there's a beautiful window that
[SPEAKER_01]: when legality opens up there's this
incredible opportunity to capitalize pay
[SPEAKER_01]: back your investment on the farm break
yourself even so now the farms not a
[SPEAKER_01]: liability it's an asset most of these
farms are liabilities right now really
[SPEAKER_01]: because most people didn't get their there
they haven't got the whole sequel
[SPEAKER_01]: component done they haven't done all the
environmental so that you have like two
[SPEAKER_01]: years expensive whoa it makes everything
else cheap the permit is not expensive it
[SPEAKER_01]: is the work to get the permit that's
expensive and that was something that I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought I'd be able to recover it can get
a business loan like every other business
[SPEAKER_01]: no we never expected that I never expected
as a slow so I never expected any miracle
[SPEAKER_01]: to occur but I expected California to
follow the other states in the same way
[SPEAKER_01]: with each state had the same exact first
year of legalization all farmers got paid
[SPEAKER_01]: so the first year in Oregon first year in
Colorado first year in Washington farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: made money after that prices went down and
then we went into this overproduction
[SPEAKER_01]: situation California complete opposite
which blew my mind and I was wrong like I
[SPEAKER_01]: built my farm and aggressively went at it
so that I could recover the cost in the
[SPEAKER_01]: first year and I just basically wiped out
my capital so what it did is it put me
[SPEAKER_01]: into a situation where I realize all right
well where we are now because none of this
[SPEAKER_01]: plan seemed that this doesn't make sense
and it's it's the largest cannabis economy
[SPEAKER_01]: in the world probably is California and
we're probably the most inept in what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing and regulatory regulatory
regulatory wise you know and it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just unbelievable and it's kind of
shocking that we had this advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: watching Colorado do it watching
Washington do it you know there was this
[SPEAKER_00]: possibility that we were going to be the
first proposition failed prop 19 and then
[SPEAKER_00]: so it seemed like you know people were
like oh well maybe this is a blessing
[SPEAKER_00]: because we'll get to see the mistakes made
and yet Colorado and Washington as messy
[SPEAKER_00]: as they bed and Oregon have seemed to be
better than California I mean California
[SPEAKER_00]: is just the biggest shit show well it's
because we're so much bigger things which
[SPEAKER_01]: is bigger it's much bigger we make it we
make in California making Colorado Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: and Washington look live and we are and it
just is so everything we do is different
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're so powerful and big as it is
you know you got 40 million people and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's money here so the the way that you
created the deserts throughout the state
[SPEAKER_01]: just created a disaster for sales and they
didn't people didn't really understand
[SPEAKER_01]: that the society isn't so caught up on
purity or they wouldn't have fast food you
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't have such incredible obesity and
and lack of health in the country because
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of that's coming from the food
source what you're eating you're being
[SPEAKER_00]: poisoned well if people care I mean I
think there's a hope that people are awake
[SPEAKER_00]: up to that and there are a lot there you
know or less organic food is a huge market
[SPEAKER_00]: you know why do people do there is a huge
market in the Bay Area and in LA there's
[SPEAKER_00]: people that will only eat organic food but
we're talking about let's compare it to
[SPEAKER_01]: the regular market so huge compared to
what regular so organic is how big a ratio
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to regular go to your local
supermarket tell me how big the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: aisle is tell me how big the supermarket
is there's a it's a substantial niche you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to say it's a niche though yes it's a
niche and who is in that niche if it was
[SPEAKER_01]: in any of these rural regions it was pot
growers fueling it and I said this for
[SPEAKER_01]: years I believe the cannabis organic
cannabis production drove organic food
[SPEAKER_01]: production simultaneously because the
people who were growing weed organically
[SPEAKER_01]: were like hey we want to buy organic food
and it became a market they could afford
[SPEAKER_01]: it but right now I notice that the liquor
store is selling a lot more pizza than
[SPEAKER_01]: normal and that's the cheapest because
it's cheaper you can afford it in town and
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't know what's in it versus a lot
of the restaurants and other restaurants
[SPEAKER_00]: in town have you know largely organic food
and so it's more expensive double double
[SPEAKER_01]: and so the thing is can you afford it and
does do do the people who buy organic
[SPEAKER_01]: produce smoke a lot of pot who buys pot
that's this is the med med question that
[SPEAKER_01]: meds trying to get you know sophisticated
stoners and that's an oxymoron it is
[SPEAKER_01]: because stoners historically a blue-collar
workers they're people who work hard and
[SPEAKER_01]: they use cannabis because it allows them
to have very little side effects the next
[SPEAKER_01]: day it lets them relax it lets them have
some kind of ethereal moment you know
[SPEAKER_01]: moment after work lets their body well but
wealthy don't smoke a lot of pot they
[SPEAKER_01]: never have they like cocaine and champagne
and opiates and that's not what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: making and that's not what we're selling
and so the blue-collar individual in
[SPEAKER_01]: America is the one who buys the
predominant amount of cannabis if you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to see places that move a lot of weed
they're not in Beverly Hills they're in
[SPEAKER_01]: Compton Compton dispensary moves more weed
than Beverly Hills dispensary Beverly
[SPEAKER_01]: Hills is doing a lot higher price point
but they're definitely not moving the same
[SPEAKER_01]: quantity of weed coming out of those shops
in Compton because the people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: living in in those type of situations
lower price cannabis works I'm from I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: from blue-collar New England so I grew up
in a blue-collar reality I didn't it
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't raised in wealthy Humboldt County
where there was money bubbling out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground like wells so what you have here is
this really odd it's not accurate it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: reflection of an inaccuracy that people
that are regular have money this is
[SPEAKER_01]: regular people who had money no longer to
any of the grower communities have money
[SPEAKER_01]: go to any grower community in the
California and ask them are you doing well
[SPEAKER_01]: financially tell me anyone raise their
hand and say yeah I'm doing great I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: making money my business is thriving very
very few cultivators some distributors are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing well some extractors are doing well
a couple stores are probably doing well
[SPEAKER_01]: processors you know that kind of stuff
secondary outside of cultivation the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators show me anybody that's doing
well and in those regions and this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: change in the last five years obviously I
last couple years and it's nationwide I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean I go around the US and I see it
across the US that you're seeing changes
[SPEAKER_01]: in global economy you're seeing it in all
type of businesses that your amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: money that you make in any job is
decreased versus management so management
[SPEAKER_01]: and radically change in what they make
worker radical change and what they have
[SPEAKER_01]: that's disposable income that directly
reflects it the cheap markets are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: become the ones the only way that we
survive as our little regions is that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have US wide sales and we have global
sales and all we need is really US at
[SPEAKER_01]: first because if you go to anywhere from
the Midwest down in the southern region up
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't have the ability to cultivate
year-round like we do and they most
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely have a horrific time through
the summer when you would normally
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivate go to Florida try to grow in
1990 90% 90 degrees 90% humidity tell me
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're going to produce out there so
you have to go indoor and so once you
[SPEAKER_01]: start running these indoor operations your
cost of production skyrockets once
[SPEAKER_01]: California and Oregon starts releasing
cannabis across the US you think any of
[SPEAKER_01]: these companies are going to actually be
able to compete price-wise and so as a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis consumer when you go to the store
do you typically buy Wagyu beef do you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you don't buy 40 bucks an ounce meat
now I'm not saying you're a meat eater but
[SPEAKER_01]: if you do you typically buy what you can
afford very few people buy that they have
[SPEAKER_01]: to advertise it to very wealthy or they
advertise it as a special occasion like a
[SPEAKER_01]: graduation like a high-end bottle of
alcohol like you don't you may not drink
[SPEAKER_01]: $400 scotch but when your son graduated
you drank the bottle of scotch so once
[SPEAKER_01]: every four years when a kid graduates you
buy one you got married you got one but
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly you're drinking Johnny Walker red
and you know 20 bucks well they wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: be selling so much of it and so the
problem with cannabis pricing is that in
[SPEAKER_01]: order for people to pay higher prices they
have to understand why they're paying it
[SPEAKER_01]: and they have to have enough exposure and
with the new clients that are coming in
[SPEAKER_01]: the new customers regular pot wipes them
out so they get high as hell on anything
[SPEAKER_01]: so they go well it's like alcohol when you
were 12 and you first had your first beer
[SPEAKER_01]: you're really a discerning micro beer
connoisseur at that moment I only like
[SPEAKER_01]: stouts you didn't know a damn difference
and so that's the problem is that people
[SPEAKER_01]: that are coming in don't have any
experience with really quality and it
[SPEAKER_01]: takes a minute to start to be able to say
well I got you the aftertaste was
[SPEAKER_01]: radically different the quality of the
high was better and man the lucidity was
[SPEAKER_01]: better just better drug cannabis better
experience cannabis well that takes a
[SPEAKER_01]: minute to get that education and when
people are buying products most people are
[SPEAKER_01]: very cautious about price very few people
just close their eyes and say I buy what I
[SPEAKER_01]: want they look at the price tag and that's
the reality and so the problem with it is
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get it into some level that
works for the farmer you you you you
