[SPEAKER_00]: In working with nutrients, there's been
quite a change over the last probably 30
[SPEAKER_00]: years, and it is getting to be quite a
long time ago, where almost all
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients were sulfated micros.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had iron sulfate, copper sulfate,
magnesium sulfate, zinc sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years, they've gradually been
changing more into chelates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chelates, you use an element that actually
grasps onto the micronutrient and holds it
[SPEAKER_00]: and makes it more available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chelate essentially means claw.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a structure where the element
you're trying to hold there, usually a
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one to start was probably really
iron that was used greatly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would latch onto the iron, and it keeps
it more available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the sulfated ones would change more
by pH, what was available and what was not
[SPEAKER_00]: available would wash out more so,
where the chelated ones tend to hang
[SPEAKER_00]: around a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find these days that almost all your
micronutrients that are being used are
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much chelates.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of different types of
chelates, some that allow the
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrient to be available at a higher
pH or a lower pH, which is also one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: changes that have come along over this
period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back when there were mostly sulfates,
most of the pH's that people looked to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow at were much closer to a pH of seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might look at your pH to be growing at
would be a 6, 6 to a 7, 3 or 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we've gradually gone more and more into
chelates, we find that the chelates are
[SPEAKER_00]: much more available when you're getting
down to 6 or slightly below 6.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to then now put our growing ranges
for pH's, maybe 5, 5 to 6, 5 or 6,
[SPEAKER_00]: 4 in that kind of a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a little bit up or below that
thing, I don't think you're going to find
[SPEAKER_00]: a real problem with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something to keep track of because as
you're watching it, it will tend to wander
[SPEAKER_00]: in a certain direction and the closer that
you know where you want it to change,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the quicker you start your change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people that are producing nutrients
wouldn't be doing their own chelation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a total industry on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're manufacturing the base elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sourcing the raw materials to then
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing the final mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's so crazy about nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're paying for so much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not all that difficult to manufacture
your own nutrients.
You're paying for so much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're paying for so much water.
