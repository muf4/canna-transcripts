[SPEAKER_02]: The plants that you received were bred by
Josh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'll tell you about what he did to
make them, and he'll give you the correct
[SPEAKER_02]: name on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the main point was that I was so
impressed with them in flower form that I
[SPEAKER_02]: knew that it was something that had an
ability to absolutely catch an attention
[SPEAKER_02]: of a customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something that you can't deny it
when you smoked it, when you smelled it,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you felt the effects, and it was
quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want that material to be shared so
that individuals can enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was his desire, too, is to see
the public get their hands on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're back to another breeding
discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to let the guys introduce
themselves, and then we can start getting
[SPEAKER_02]: into some questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again, thank you for taking the
time out of your lives to listen to these
[SPEAKER_02]: discussions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Graham, Mr. Bob Hemphill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been breeding cannabis since 1998.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1995, and collecting clones since about
the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And growing cannabis for production is how
I've made my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just dedicated most of my time to
preservation work with just keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: strains alive that weren't even market
valuable anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And amazingly, 20 years later,
they've come back around where the clubs
[SPEAKER_01]: need to have something besides the cookies
on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just trying to have a diversity in the
gene pool so we can get those old school
[SPEAKER_01]: buzzes and just that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really what I'm up to.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys kind of know me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Joshua Rutherford.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really a breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a Paul and Chucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: But straight up, I feel like what I'm able
to do is I have a good nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a good taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got blessed right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first two plants I ever grew was
strawberry cough and ATF.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were legit cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe once or twice have I seen the ATF
that even is in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just got blessed that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so every time I got something else
that wasn't there, it was like beep,
[SPEAKER_03]: beep, beep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I throw stuff away so fast, I'm heartless.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's the best thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's probably other things that you can
pull.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what it allowed me to do is to make
some money and to kind of be pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: self-funded.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a small partner.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, so this one is a pie hoe from
Canterado Genetics I got.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was feminized.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I wanted to sift through and make
sure I got the ones that were going to
[SPEAKER_03]: have any herms, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not really down with colloidal
silver or whatever the other stuff is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I had accidentally learned a
technique by throwing too much sebum.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put these seabird guano pellets down,
which is super high in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I hermed out the whole bottom of my
Obama Kush one time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just the bottoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, OK, well, that's
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I searched and searched and searched.
[SPEAKER_03]: And somewhere I found that too much
nitrogen will force herm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was like, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I tried it another time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried it three or four times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's pretty predictable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can buy these seabird guano pellets,
throw them down pretty hard, water them in
[SPEAKER_03]: really hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I did with the pie hoe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I also had in the room this
Catholic school girl that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this rural Kush, seven from
Kevin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was actually scratching my head
on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm just kind of reading into
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was scratching my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hit up Gene on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was like, what should I do with
this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is this going to just be a bunch of
herm bullshit?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, apple doesn't fall far from
the tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, OK, that's not enough
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it kind of is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I felt.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went for it, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I ran 300 seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I spent all night going through those
cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I pulled out about six of them and
then smoked them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the one I kept.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've run it twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't herm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I let it run extra long and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've kind of checked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's definitely stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's real big and beefy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I run it in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super floral.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't put it in the fruit category.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's not a lot that I call floral.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or that's come across my palate that's
really been floral.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a different customer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, my mom, my parents actually smoked
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably shouldn't say that on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a couple weeks ago for the first
time in like 30 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just let them have a little bit of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was perfect because it's a real
bright, uplifting, happy high.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom was just like, what is this flavor?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of like this muted lemon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that's fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's real muted and florally rosy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, so I was super happy with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I was coming down, I wanted to
give something back to Kev because he gave
[SPEAKER_03]: me some stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was like, oh, this is perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for being cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a nice one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing was, before I had to get
into it, what's nice about the panel is
[SPEAKER_02]: that I consider Graham like a
preservationist because he's someone who
[SPEAKER_02]: holds for as many times I've talked to a
man, he holds varietals for time and
[SPEAKER_02]: preserves them because he believes in the
pricelessness of it, not just in business,
[SPEAKER_02]: but to himself and to the cannabis
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Hardy is a scientific reader where he
has a very extensive background in many
[SPEAKER_02]: different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it gives you a different direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Josh says, I'm just a pollen
chukka.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the truth is I wanted to see people
who were just pollen chukkas because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's where everybody started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happens is that you start to
believe you don't have a validity if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not someone special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the truth of it is that you have to be
able to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to get a plant that's that quality
from someone who's just a pollen chukka
[SPEAKER_02]: lets you realize that you also can
succeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's important because it lets you
take and inspire other people who are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to follow you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every one of you will eventually have
someone who takes your place in the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's important to be able to have
people that are going to take your place
[SPEAKER_02]: that have good ethics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a desire to smoke kill weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you're going to be an old man
filled in a land full of boof.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or women.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's beautiful to have the diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll let Hardy go.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the whole point of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That your lack of full time professional
breeding doesn't diminish your validity at
[SPEAKER_02]: all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that to me, you are the symbol
of people who love weed and let their
[SPEAKER_02]: taste guide them in their process.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's key.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Hardy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have Cora Genetics and was a Zen Care
Collective.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were one of the first dispensary
delivery out of Mendocino 9.31 program.
[SPEAKER_05]: And rode that out till the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then Mendocino County, as we know,
discontinued the 9.3.
[SPEAKER_05]: So at that time, just switched everything
over to R&D and breeding and working with
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD cultivars.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was that focus in 2000.
[SPEAKER_05]: 2009, 10, where you tell people,
show lab results, and they'd see CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, why are you growing this?
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't relate to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to the point earlier, one thing was
even this was 2012, if you got caught with
[SPEAKER_05]: lab results or seeds, you were a
sophisticated operation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you were in more trouble.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you had pitchers, and this is
something, seeing this evolution.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, being a pollen chucker,
it's like, we were all chucking pollen in
[SPEAKER_05]: the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back here, when it was like growing up
around here, when you had to hide out in a
[SPEAKER_05]: fucking tree, when you had a helicopter
coming over you sideways, and you just had
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit of pollen that you had to put
on high and pollinate on that plant at a
[SPEAKER_05]: certain time, but it was only one little
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is how the especially this is
ground zero.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's amazing to see this many people
here, like coming out like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know things are changing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we are like, everybody in here is
like, pioneer to the roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this is coming back home this last
year and traveling so much, it's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you guys are, this is the shit right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like as far as when you're gonna find good
old genetics and people that really have
[SPEAKER_05]: that heart of soul, and this last year
having to travel around and seeing the big
[SPEAKER_05]: corporations that are coming in,
and just this general disrespect or
[SPEAKER_05]: disregard for the history of the plant,
that people here are responsible for
[SPEAKER_05]: keeping this plant alive, and being
stewards of these genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's just kind of coming together,
and part of this is like collecting this
[SPEAKER_05]: data and part of that IP, because we all
have something special to offer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't discount that, because everybody
here has something, their own kung fu to
[SPEAKER_05]: bring to the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I was gonna say is, when you first
began in the 95 zone, what was the stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that you were working with when you first
got into cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it must have had a profound impact
on the fact that it made you love it so
[SPEAKER_02]: much that you never let go of it,
because you're a dedicated collector.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the stock you were working with
when you began?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I don't have any of those
seeds anymore, but at New Year's show,
[SPEAKER_01]: between 94 to 95, I scored some bud from
Humboldt, and it was purple and grape and
[SPEAKER_01]: just dank as fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what encouraged me to breed
with the males and females the next year,
[SPEAKER_01]: is because I wanted to have some more of
that, because in years prior to that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just grew Mexican bag seed, because
there was no dank available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a shame.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, I really didn't know about
breeding brothers to sisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just didn't seem right to me,
so I out crossed that strain to Southern
[SPEAKER_01]: Virginia lines and didn't keep it pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I would have open pollinated that
line and kept it pure, I would really have
[SPEAKER_01]: had something special, because it was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll never forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was at a Grateful Dead show.
[SPEAKER_01]: That next spring, I still had some.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was these really pretty girls
from California on a dead tour,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I showed them a bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't even say that I grew and bred
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just said it was from Virginia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just laughed at me and started
clowning me, thinking I was lying,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to pick them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I still think back, and that was some
amazingly dank, just Afghan purple shit
[SPEAKER_01]: that was probably Urkel-related.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I think that was the little
heyday of that transition from the last of
[SPEAKER_02]: the outdoor that still remained before the
raids here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the raids came, and people's
populations compressed, and then indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: just blew up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when I started seeing a lot of
these old lines being woven out,
[SPEAKER_02]: because they just didn't work on the
indoor platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I don't have a lot of the stuff
from that either.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm trying to go back and dig
through time and find older people that
[SPEAKER_02]: were able to hold on to little people
pieces, because none of us really don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think knew what we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of thought that it was going to be
here forever like that, because it had
[SPEAKER_02]: just come into our hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't really have the same level of
appreciation for the scarcity now that you
[SPEAKER_02]: did then.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were like, whoa, I'll get more good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you went into the early pervs,
and then you were talking about this first
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that you really started messing
around with was that the ATF cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I actually still hold it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only thing I've been able to
keep my whole damn grow career.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've lost a lot of stuff, but we kept it
among three guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it came into the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started busting it out, and $4,000 a
pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured the game this out real quick in
a year and a half, $4,000 a pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: See you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are in your own in that basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's the muskiest, earthiest
thing I think I've ever smelt straight up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of sniff around to see if I can
find anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like $4,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: First floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to talk to anybody that has any
experience with that cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Josh and Kelly have some connection
to the Matanuska.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure the exact difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people say it's the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's real fluffy, and I could see it
across the room in that jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all would be like, what's that one?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's white.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bring that one over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's interesting, because
marketability, it's fluffy.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you grab it out of the jar,
it's like, oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you pop that thing open, and it fills
the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested to actually start working
and putting some stuff into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: My goal this summer is to run a bunch of
stuff and find some mails that I think
[SPEAKER_03]: will put some stuff on it, and just try to
start learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what Jackson said earlier,
I know this ATF really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can walk into a garden and see crosses
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found that the other day in a 502
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a Cali crush crossed with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, before she could say ATF,
I was like, ATF.
[SPEAKER_03]: These three leaves, they always look the
same.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, how'd you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: I go, I've been staring at that plant for
10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about you, Big Hardy?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're an old school cat from the day
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and that's one thing with the
strings these days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody had mentioned earlier,
looking at the chemo type.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've gotten so caught up in this name
game anymore, it's like having to
[SPEAKER_05]: backtrack from this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was one thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking at CBDs and other cannabinoids,
it's like, okay, where are the origins of
[SPEAKER_05]: this?
[SPEAKER_05]: One recently is the varins.
[SPEAKER_05]: And where the varins are, the origins of
the varins.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're finding more from like the
Africa, from Africa and like Laos areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why is this happening?
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like, it's having to backtrack
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of these older sativas that
weren't marketable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it's still that smell, and it's out
there, and that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's up in these areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Jerry, for instance, it's like with
that Panama red, and going back,
[SPEAKER_05]: and like these poisons, and like you go
back in history, and on this lineage,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's identifying the baseline.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something the last couple years
I've been working on is bringing these
[SPEAKER_05]: older cultivars back, and getting that
baseline back, and then sort of moving
[SPEAKER_05]: forward from there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like looking at it like that color
palette of like you have your CMYK,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, you have your basic colors.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's start with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start with this, and from there,
we identify these different traits,
[SPEAKER_05]: and now that we're able to look at the
chemotype and genotype of what these,
[SPEAKER_05]: what are the constituents of the cultivar
that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like if you're looking to make
extract, and that's all you're looking
[SPEAKER_05]: for, you want that orange to juice with
those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you're going for just a certain
cannibinoid, and identifying those
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics, so it's like we've been
monocultured so much here, especially in
[SPEAKER_05]: Northern California, being run by Sauer,
Diesel, and OG, because this is the
[SPEAKER_05]: market.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what's putting the paycheck in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these cultivars have been lost that
were, actually have probably more of a
[SPEAKER_05]: value, because of what they have inside of
them, instead of the marketability of what
[SPEAKER_05]: that pretty flower looks like per unit,
you know, that's going to a market.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like looking at these cultivars at
what we're growing, maybe not per gram,
[SPEAKER_05]: per square meter, or per foot per light,
but milligram.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like what's inside of this?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something looking into,
especially the original cultivars.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are where the treasures are,
and starting to backtrack right now,
[SPEAKER_05]: and actually collect the data,
because that's where that IP that all of
[SPEAKER_05]: us have worked our ass off for is of
value.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you, we're going to get into
some, I'm going to ask Graham,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what directions are you moving
into?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're here in Cali, but you're in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question is going to be,
you know, what directions are you seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: in your region?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're global.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see a global picture, because you are
connected to so many different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's this way we'll be able to see
what's going on here, what's going on
[SPEAKER_02]: where you are, what's going on from your
view on a worldwide picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mostly I just am working on some real
strong Northern Lights indicas and hash
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, and trying to get the old school
indicas in the seed form so it's more
[SPEAKER_01]: accessible to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also working on constantly doing open
pollinations on different land races just
[SPEAKER_01]: to preserve them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, I'm also working on
several different lines in CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to isolate the CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working on a Panama Red that
originally went from two to one to three
[SPEAKER_01]: to ones in the next generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this next generation after that,
I've just found a 39 to one, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited to flower that out
and check the percentages.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the land races you're
playing with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just try to work with and preserve
any that I can get my hands on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, a lot of people in seed
buying markets say they want land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really want good land race that works
well for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want every land race because
there's a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, when you're doing a true
open pollination, you're not even calling
[SPEAKER_01]: out the hermaphrodites, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just mostly for preservation and
to look for good strains that maybe I can
[SPEAKER_01]: pull the next seeds out and make out
crosses with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that would work for the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I do find a good one that I can
release, I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's lots of times there's problems
with the line or the source doesn't want
[SPEAKER_01]: it released pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I can understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because I I've seen some of the
Northern Light, the work you're doing to
[SPEAKER_02]: the hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that was stuff that was red hot
and ultra quality in its time frame.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it I think got kind of diluted as time
went by.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I try to tell people the source
material was not weak.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was some stunning stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's killer that you're going back that
route.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like it's pretty well
received, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I see some I see some traction
around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just basically trying to
duplicate a lot of Neville's work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, Sensi Seed Bank didn't
do a good job in keeping those genes
[SPEAKER_01]: pulled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had the old cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, just the NL1 came to me from
when I was working with Coastal Seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: KU had gotten it from Classic Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was just things came together in a
really good situation with that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Canorado just gifted me some two by
fives that he made F2s on and the original
[SPEAKER_01]: F1s were made from Jim Ortega.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a 80 seed bank stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm real excited about that,
because that's, you know, just the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that I can help share that into the gene
pool again is just a good place to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I'm older and the problem is
that you have all these fond memories of
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff from a day when people try to tell
you that, you know, that shit's outdated.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm like, I'm telling you,
no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you pine for the memories in the
past.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I see people digging things out,
I get excited because it lets me know that
[SPEAKER_02]: things are still alive and lets you also
know that your belief that trends
[SPEAKER_02]: continuously move forward roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was cool to see the Northern
Lights work you've been doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was some of the first kind,
but that I got a chance to smoke when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to say something that's
not quite on that topic, but I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: get it out here to everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first moved the Emerald Triangle
in 97, there was an amazing amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every farm had their own genetics,
amazing strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, there was a purple wave and then
there was the OG diesel wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically a lot of farms stopped
growing those original genetics just to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell their bud easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they got on the purple bandwagon and
then they got on the gas bandwagon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the people still have the
genetics here in the county.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be your neighbor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be your family, relatives,
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find those old seeds and get them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not going to work with them
yourself, give them to someone that will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's try to preserve some of this
amazing gene pool that's still intact
[SPEAKER_01]: around this county.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good segue to what you asked
about, like some of the trends we're
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing in Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're closed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing comes in our little legal box
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's super unfortunate, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can get stuff out, for instance,
like how did I get that out?
[SPEAKER_03]: I sold it to myself as a medical patient
from my rec farm to me, and then it can go
[SPEAKER_03]: out from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can't put anything back in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the trend has been really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, you know, everyone's really
excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: The weed on the shelves is starting to
look better.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're just so steps so far behind
where we were before they killed medical,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: The good weed on the shelves is just hydro
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you open it up, some of it smells
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't want to say none of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some good cultivators.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, kind of as I purveyed the
whole scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just seeing a lot of the hot stuff
that comes through that people want to
[SPEAKER_03]: lash onto.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wedding cake, you know, cookies,
crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do want to say, like I feel like,
you know, we're a couple years ahead of
[SPEAKER_03]: you guys in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's starting to turn, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just had a couple of bills that came up
to allow, they're not voted in yet,
[SPEAKER_03]: but to allow for small farmers to sell
direct.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the head of the LCB, the Liquor
Cannabis Board, spoke twice publicly about
[SPEAKER_03]: being behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this, like, I actually called these
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, you know, like, this would save
my family's life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, 10 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turn around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, we'd pay our bills in 10
days if I could sell this weed that I have
[SPEAKER_03]: here that people actually really want.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I go into the stores,
they go, is it over 20%?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it look like a cookie?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I went, I had, I'll just kind
of go off on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a really, you know, I don't want to
be too negative, but a hard experience
[SPEAKER_03]: this summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had, I brought in some, you know,
I'm actually not in the retail market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've just been kind of like creeping
along.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I brought some really beautiful
depen to retail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, you know, we do the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I package it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did all of it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I trimmed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put it in these jars, one ounce jars,
two flavors, garlic breath in the pie hoe,
[SPEAKER_03]: rough trimmed, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: $55.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ungrown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what else can you want?
[SPEAKER_03]: I even said, hey, man, show me what you
got in the price range.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, 150, 175, 200 bucks on your
shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, brown from last year, yellow from last
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, don't you think this looks better?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it would sell?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: This, you know, nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because all they want is that above 20%.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want that fucking tight thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they go, they go, what else you got?
[SPEAKER_03]: I go, dude, I grew all this weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm two miles from your store.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm the guy on the TV that they want
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, what else you got?
[SPEAKER_03]: You got some sex lube?
[SPEAKER_03]: You got some chapstick?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, no, bro, I'll go make some
sweatshirts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: But just kind of telling all that that,
like, I feel like that's still coming big
[SPEAKER_03]: for you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, we've been talking over and
over again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just starting to see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm personally feeling encouraged.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some guys that just started,
you know, bought a license.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they started with 16 lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they got certified dominion seed
skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he came over and helped to make the
selections.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're selling out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're crushing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's talking about this little 16
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're just, you know, they're doing
the thing we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_03]: but just, you know, nano almost,
microbe, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of what I see coming for
Washington is just kind of the slow,
[SPEAKER_03]: slow thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be honest, I'm waiting for another
wave of it because the federal curtain
[SPEAKER_03]: hasn't dropped.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we haven't really talked about that
yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like the people who we think are big
boys in California, they might not be the
[SPEAKER_03]: big boys when the federal curtain drops.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Canada is, I brought it up last
night.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's scary, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just, you know, that's how I see
it is like we got to keep doing this,
[SPEAKER_03]: coming together, share with each other,
find a way to survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This last year, it's like traveling more
and working in Switzerland and Africa as
[SPEAKER_05]: well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have now India and Colombia
blowing up.
[SPEAKER_05]: These people talking thousands of
hectares.
[SPEAKER_05]: This qualifies right now as hemp and it's
that 0.03%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Switzerland, it's 1%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Macedonia just opened up 1.5%.
[SPEAKER_05]: They use 0.03% as this baseline.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this last year was breeding seeds,
especially for the European market,
[SPEAKER_05]: African market.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want feminized auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just field planted and they're
going in and harvesting with combines.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just looking at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all going into isolate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have this, this market that is just
CBD hungry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what qualifies that is this 0.03%.
[SPEAKER_05]: These new cultivars though, it's when to
harvest them as well, because we have
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you go at eight weeks and
you're, you're going to be right under
[SPEAKER_05]: that hot point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of a sudden you hit nine 10 and
some of these will jump up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And depending on the climate and work,
you're taking tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can have vitro culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming from the U S going to Switzerland,
the same culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's the way it's performing just like
anything, but it's environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you look at the whole profile of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is how this is evolving so
rapidly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now it's this hemp thing after
this farm bill passed, especially here in
[SPEAKER_05]: the States, it's on the scalability.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the one thing with the CBD
market right now here in the States,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's this, there's this huge demand last
week.
[SPEAKER_05]: The state in California, they said that,
and this is something I don't know if it's
[SPEAKER_05]: been talked about or whatnot, but is that
male pollen is the state is looking
[SPEAKER_05]: regulators looking at it as a weapon.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something that the, this is
somebody that doesn't know what they're
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about, but at that same time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's that going to do for a breeder
to restrict you?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're going to have a male plant that
you can't flower that male pollen out or
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to, you know, these are
things that are in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are so regulated here, like you can go
to Vermont right now and $25 permit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have 500 acres, you could plan
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, we're here dealing with,
we're dealing with the most intense
[SPEAKER_05]: adverse conditions pretty much on a global
scale right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially here where we've
spearheaded this movement.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as things change, it's like adapting
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the one thing it's like these
new strains, everybody has something
[SPEAKER_05]: unique here and it's that something
differentiating.
[SPEAKER_05]: You do have to feed into this,
you know, the market, what it dictate
[SPEAKER_05]: right now and the consumers is going to
dictate what a farmer grows as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's growing something that is from
your heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you, do you see, uh, in your opinion,
you know, as genetics move globally,
[SPEAKER_02]: product moves globally, do you see,
uh, material moving from one place to
[SPEAKER_02]: another specifically?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see, uh, individuals that you
believe will become dominant in the
[SPEAKER_02]: production model?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there opportunities for the U S to move
product globally?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, which is an opinion
question, but you know, how do you feel
[SPEAKER_02]: about it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something right now we're,
we're falling behind very quickly,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially with, you know, CBD and isolate
and what they're able to produce and in
[SPEAKER_05]: Africa and these other countries and have
these establishing these international
[SPEAKER_05]: markets with importing and exporting
through, through Canada, um, through
[SPEAKER_05]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Through these other companies and a lot of
these other businesses, they don't want to
[SPEAKER_05]: touch the U S market.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's enough profit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't need to deal with the
regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've been getting seeds right now to
try to get a true breeding seed regulated
[SPEAKER_05]: within the state of California or within
these other states for export to go
[SPEAKER_05]: through and get your international
narcotics bureau license for exporting.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're behind and I don't know,
you know, moving forward on that,
[SPEAKER_05]: it takes the capital.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and that's the thing we're talking
about, you know, the, the research and the
[SPEAKER_05]: capital behind it to move this forward
requires help from private sector,
[SPEAKER_05]: but also the academic sector and finding
that here in especially California with
[SPEAKER_05]: the new hemp bill.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have an academic tie to a
university, we're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: allow to cultivate and breed hemp
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like growing the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's where we're, we're able to do
right now is cross breed to something you
[SPEAKER_05]: get that is just fire dang that it tests
at that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Zero three percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's him to explain that right now to
the authorities and the powers would be,
[SPEAKER_05]: they still don't wrap their head around
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's breed the shit out of everything
we can to get the dank out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it qualifies as hemp, that's what
they're going to look at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't, you know, if you have the
Terps and you have a whole cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_05]: profile, as long as it doesn't have THC in
it, it qualifies as hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always think that, you know,
once the big guys get playing,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're just going to pay somebody to
change that limit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, from point for three to 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, no, I saw where I asked a
question to someone who was in hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: importation years ago for fabric.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, why do you get the product
from Hungary?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said because they can use
cultivars that have higher THC levels and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're allowed and the production quantity
per square foot is increased.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said that you can't get what we need
as a production plant to give us a
[SPEAKER_02]: profitable product that has that lower THC
percentage.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't want the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted the biomass to do fabric.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, he was explaining to me how US
was not a hemp leader in that because we
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't allowed to use the plants that had
too high of a THC level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, for some reason, the plants
that have the quality for fabric are just
[SPEAKER_02]: over that amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, and it just doesn't make
sense to spend so much time trying to hunt
[SPEAKER_02]: it back when you could just go to Hungary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were pumping it out freely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for them, it worked because they
needed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that as time goes on,
you know, the US would do it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that in the way our model works,
it always seems to favor the wealthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I think in Hungary it was
because they want to have business in
[SPEAKER_02]: general where they needed to have this
take place.
[SPEAKER_02]: They needed it to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, look, if everybody's making
money, it's okay because some money's
[SPEAKER_02]: better than no money on a commercial
industrial crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to me, the US is a different model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the same situation as,
you know, when do we start to kind of get
[SPEAKER_02]: this together?
[SPEAKER_02]: For you, Graham, as you're looking
forward, what's a direction you'd like to
[SPEAKER_02]: see yourself in a couple years?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just all pretend we're going to make
it because then it's easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise it's like, I don't know if I'm
going to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always tell people that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I don't know if I'm going to be
here or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's brutal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact is, if I don't believe I'm
going to be here, then I can't do
[SPEAKER_02]: long-term planning, which you believed
you're going to be here because you've
[SPEAKER_02]: been banking stock for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's something you'd like to see in a
couple years for yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, just personal desire as a
reader, as a collector, as a smoker,
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm definitely going to be in the game
in a few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be still in Northern California
in the Himalayan Triangle, ideally.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could stay here and make a living
providing seeds to the community,
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be my ideal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I feel like I don't want to go
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get asked to do a lot of international
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I was younger and I didn't have
family, it wouldn't be bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, tripping around the world
to do business as cool as it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: it steals time from your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been a gift to be alive here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I get the same go-to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to be able to stay here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And work on the farm that I'm building.
[SPEAKER_02]: And go into the genetic material that I've
sourced all these years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And be able to use that as trade to other
people who have other things that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can start to continuously mine so
that, you know, the majority of my life
[SPEAKER_02]: was spent doing the work that I love
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a farm you're building.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I own a farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's been, I mean, for 10 years,
I've been going after this dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Canada has been a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was able to buy a farm when I bought
my license.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a son and I'm married.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I would like to just be doing a
small farmer thing, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to have people come out to my
farm, maybe on Saturday, buy some weed and
[SPEAKER_03]: some vegetables.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once or twice a month in the summer,
do a big dinner and like feed some people
[SPEAKER_03]: and like showcase.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I like to get into stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love beer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love making beer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love roasting coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually want to set up a tropical
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grow a lot of lemons and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just want to get into caring me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I'm just a dork.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like kind of, you know, nothing big.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like, just have fun and showcase what
I like to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And make enough money that I can,
you know, live a good life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd ideally like to only work 30 hours a
week, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: The fantasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantasy.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the next couple years, where do you see
yourself going?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, develop the farm here in Mendocino
County and want to move forward with the
[SPEAKER_05]: nursery on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just mainly R&D.
[SPEAKER_05]: But being able to work with more of the
academic community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like work like with Eleanor here,
like the Canador, what they're doing with
[SPEAKER_05]: this Barium.
[SPEAKER_05]: And starting to take this initiative to
actually like, it's almost like starting
[SPEAKER_05]: over again.
[SPEAKER_05]: But these are, this is like that learning
process along the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here in California, it's just,
and especially on like these large
[SPEAKER_05]: phenohunts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like with Nat, it's like, this is
something, you know, being able to work on
[SPEAKER_05]: this on large scales.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the only thing that's limiting
in California right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the States is we need hundreds of
acres with hundreds of thousands of seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And being able to do these large select
through large populations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at this time in California,
it's rather difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: So looking at other locations to be able
to do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then bring the seed back here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's these new discoveries,
they're out there, you know, there's the
[SPEAKER_05]: white elephants and the golden unicorns
and something.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot that we still have still out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially these old strains are
starting to be reintroduced, where people
[SPEAKER_05]: are looking at it sort of like the
grinspoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you've ever grown that
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, just you're looking at it's
like, why am I growing it?
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's such a special little plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what it has in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, what it extracts and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's something that doesn't look the
best.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are you growing this?
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's like, what's it got inside?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, if I had like a multi-year
dream, it would be that the population
[SPEAKER_02]: that buys cannabis starts to really have
an understanding of what they're buying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can actually start to have real
product differentiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can start to have the subsets,
the sub markets create.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have individuals that specialize in
certain things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it lets the farms work lines and
develop the ability to have true
[SPEAKER_02]: appellation-like standardization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where in this region, these things have
been sorted out to do best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can only get these things in this
region.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it allows the regions not to have to
go head-to-head for who's got the best
[SPEAKER_02]: gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: But each one of these regions has
something that's uniquely distinct to that
[SPEAKER_02]: specific place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, what it'll do is it'll allow
you to start to have true long-term
[SPEAKER_02]: preservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if we're just the beginning of an
industry, and when I look at liquor,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, wow, you got 70, 80 years,
you guys have been sparking up.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we gonna be doing in 80 years?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we can do the building blocks of it
now and start to create some of that
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, you actually have the tools to go
forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because even though science takes over
many things, there's always a renaissance,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's always an outlaw.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always the renegade that wants to
buck that and do it their own way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're the ones that always brought
the wild shit forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I hope to see too.
[SPEAKER_02]: About advice to collectors and breeders
from someone who's done a lot of work and
[SPEAKER_02]: held a lot of work, what do you recommend
to people for just how do you do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: On keeping clones is just don't give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's difficult during moves and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just you just gotta keep the focus
and don't give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And always make sure your cuts are rooted
before you take your next mom and stick
[SPEAKER_01]: her in the flowering room or killer or
whatever you're gonna do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as far as breeding, just don't
breed with cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breed with something that's true to your
heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And try to bring something different to
the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question was how do you, like for you,
you've maintained the ATF for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the question for people is how did you
maintain it and what's some advice you
[SPEAKER_02]: have for people?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I'm someone who does what I do,
which is hold libraries for time and move
[SPEAKER_02]: material for time, I always tell people
redundant copies and make sure you give it
[SPEAKER_02]: to people that have an appreciation for
that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not big collectors.
[SPEAKER_02]: They only wanna hold one or two varietals
because they will not lose them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You give it to people who want a mass
library, that stuff gets lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I always tell people you gotta find
people who care about the variety so much
[SPEAKER_02]: that all they wanna do is hold that one
variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've lost varieties for years and I've
had people contact me and let me know,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, I'm just so happy with what I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go, what do you got?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they go, the stuff you gave me all
those years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go, you still got the stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realize I can remind that shaft and
get those valuable goodies back out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've lost them for whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can only hold so much stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the redundant sharing and it's
choosing who you have hold the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: People that just want everything don't
have an appreciation, they just want bulk
[SPEAKER_02]: collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you are a professional,
your bulk collection's in a different
[SPEAKER_02]: form, because usually you have people to
help you with it, or a more stabilized
[SPEAKER_02]: infrastructure so you can keep it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, if you wanna hold a specific
varietal for time, get two or three people
[SPEAKER_02]: who just love that varietal and it's all
they wanna grow because that's what works
[SPEAKER_02]: for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what you have is a redundant bank
in multiple locations of unconnected
[SPEAKER_02]: people so that you don't get caught up in
the law enforcement jam and you all lose
[SPEAKER_02]: your gear, or you don't get caught up in
where it got lost because the person just
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't need it anymore so they got rid of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wouldn't get rid of it because that's
what they use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's how I try to make sure I can
keep material alive is to share it with
[SPEAKER_02]: individuals who have a commitment to the
cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then hopefully we can do some kind of
out-cross or self-fit to hold material so
[SPEAKER_02]: at least we have some genetic preservation
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for you, you held an ATF cut for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all you need though, it's
water-wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: You banked it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We kept it because of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my buddy bought it for 4,000 just
for the cut back in the day and we were
[SPEAKER_03]: laughing at him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we started making money on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just three of us doing this little
start-out thing and we just kind of looked
[SPEAKER_03]: each other in the eyes and said,
it doesn't ever go past the three of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we kept it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, we agreed to give it to one
other guy and he was the only one that
[SPEAKER_03]: held it after a while because we all ran
it for years and years and it's kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: like, all right, they're sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been giving this one dude ATF for
five years and he's kind of getting sick
[SPEAKER_03]: of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we always, it worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, I had done some moving around
and I was able to get it back and it still
[SPEAKER_03]: does really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now I need to start saving it
because I've realized the value in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like one of those right next
to me doing the workhorse for me and I
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't really given it as much
appreciation because I'm really excited
[SPEAKER_03]: about new things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And kind of like going around,
but luckily I had some buddies that were
[SPEAKER_03]: just doing work, just making money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they didn't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as I've gotten into legalization and
everything's stable, it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: when you were saying that, man,
through the moves, it was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh God, I'm so glad I don't have to move
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so glad I can have as many damn plants
as I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a relief because it's such a,
it was very hard to move.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very hard to ship a clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: All this stuff is like, people don't
realize it's the, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard, especially because you,
in order for it to have any time in
[SPEAKER_02]: between tending, you have to have it in a
pot size big enough or a system that has
[SPEAKER_02]: enough capacity to take care of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you're having to make sure that
you're constantly doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if your life gets bumpy, you end up
coming home and seeing a, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a rack of dead animal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're just like, oh, that didn't work
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's honestly why I hit him up because I
heard him wrapping on some other stuff and
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just like, man, that's impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you got to be a solid grower,
some solid skills.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to be really disciplined to like,
stock all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a service to the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's some, you know, thank you for
like, you know, and to others that like,
[SPEAKER_03]: do that work in library and yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know the librarians get,
and the things I noticed, all the guys
[SPEAKER_02]: that are good librarians, they're wary
because everybody wants to borrow your
[SPEAKER_02]: books, but they don't give a shit about
bringing them back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just want to take them and copy
them and pull the cover off and put their
[SPEAKER_02]: own cover on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't even want to give,
any credit to the varietal itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a disrespect to the plant
that did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look at plants in some respects
different because I call this old AK cut
[SPEAKER_02]: the cut that bought my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whenever I look at my home,
I will always think of that plant because
[SPEAKER_02]: that was the plant that I used to buy the
home I live in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That plant was so valuable that I could
generate enough funds from it to put a
[SPEAKER_02]: house that my kids live in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have like a different emotional
connection to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you see people just kicking it
like it's a piece of trash, you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: kick them in the ass yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what drives you to hold and
keep.
[SPEAKER_02]: For you, you know, are you doing a lot of
banking?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you involved in a tremendous amount
of scientific work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you holding stuff in in vitro form
still?
[SPEAKER_02]: You still holding stuff?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's vitro right now is the focus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's working on that here.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where right now in Switzerland,
they're much more ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that even in Africa with what
they're doing, it's like they're even
[SPEAKER_05]: taking mails and putting them in the
library.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going through and trying to keep
our hands on everything right now and
[SPEAKER_05]: alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it allows that to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just being able to share that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to this point, we're saying as well as
this being responsible of carrying on that
[SPEAKER_05]: torch, but giving the people that's worked
with that to move it forward to where you
[SPEAKER_05]: have it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that goes back to even like on some of
this or these older strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the indigenous people that like
from Panama, or you have the, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: these different African scenes that were
have been kept alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they're going in somebody else's
hands who when it was criminal,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like this sort of like with Neville.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we look at the baseline of
genetics and like Sam, the skunk man,
[SPEAKER_05]: and you go back to the Hayes brothers here
and these genetics that originated here
[SPEAKER_05]: that went back to Amsterdam and then kind
of have floated around.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this basic gene pool this is what
we're working with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be able to share that information
and know stuff like Neville, like with
[SPEAKER_05]: what you're working with these different
old cultivars and being able to share that
[SPEAKER_05]: as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's, and this is why vitro is
really good right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you've been working with it as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the other thing with it as well is
being able to transport the germplasm,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, much more stable format and in
a much more efficient way to move it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not sure about, you know,
regulatory stuff, but in terms of moving
[SPEAKER_02]: things in general, it's always better when
it's preserved, protected and compact.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and that's something as in vitro
with experience right now, they don't
[SPEAKER_05]: really question it.
[SPEAKER_05]: As even, you know, it's with shipping,
but with the right permits right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what qualifying is hemp and
doing your due diligence to have lab
[SPEAKER_05]: results right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it's being able to share that and put
it at different levels.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's being able to do it at different
locations, like throughout the world and
[SPEAKER_05]: let somebody else propagate in different
areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something like in this area,
it's like you have something from
[SPEAKER_05]: Mendocino that's performing well out on
the coast, that's really resilient,
[SPEAKER_05]: but yet won't do well in the, you know,
in inland areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you seeing pockets of material in
Africa that still goes back in time,
[SPEAKER_02]: like that hasn't had the Dutch
infiltration?
[SPEAKER_02]: See, like when I was over in Hawaii in the
mid 80s, it was the last of the Southeast
[SPEAKER_02]: Asian varietals grown in the cane fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I go there and I get to experience
some world class cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was perfect because the soils,
the climate all matched up with those type
[SPEAKER_02]: of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you had this incredible
combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I go back, you know, years and
years later and I got this white kid
[SPEAKER_02]: that's telling me about you need to check
out the Aloha White Widow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, that's not what I'm
looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for the Cambodian that used to
grow out here, that used to take top your
[SPEAKER_02]: head off, make you almost pee your pants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to sit on the toilet, smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were like, oh no, no,
you want the White Widow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, no, I don't want the White
Widow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what the White Widow is like.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I want is the things that were from
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did Africa have the ability to hold
material in constant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you still have, like as someone who's
discovering stock, because to me I'm like
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanistan, Afghanistan got hammered,
all over Asia got hammered from war.
[SPEAKER_02]: Africa had so much war and famine and
issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you're mining material, you still able
to mine some of that killer stuff from the
[SPEAKER_02]: past or is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's getting polluted quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to find.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was in this last year went to
through Ethiopia and then the Seychelles
[SPEAKER_05]: Islands right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's even finding these old land races
where all of a sudden it's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh, these guys were here from Amsterdam a
couple of years ago and we have a White
[SPEAKER_05]: Widow mango.
[SPEAKER_05]: That we open pollinated with all our land
race stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all of a sudden this, what's happening
is it's harder and harder to find from
[SPEAKER_05]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was years ago, Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I traveled through Vietnam,
Cambodia, Lao Thailand area trying to,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then even that was mid 90s and you're
still running across places where people
[SPEAKER_05]: had brought other genetics in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is one thing going back in this
diversification and being able to keep
[SPEAKER_05]: things from the origin, Southeast Asia,
India, Africa and keep these genetics
[SPEAKER_05]: separate and being able to do testing and
that's like the kind of the backstep of
[SPEAKER_05]: documenting this.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like, yeah, Africa it's anywhere in
the world right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Erie and Jaya, Papua New Guinea.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going there and these areas people
have been there with cannabis or hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing because, you know,
for me, for my background from being in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis when it was coming over from all
these places throughout the year in cycle,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just let me experience a range of
effects that I don't experience now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call most of the stuff we play with not
homogenized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I want is I want to be able to
have these unique directions to fit what I
[SPEAKER_02]: want to do and how I want to feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, if people try to tell me that,
you know, it's your imagination,
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're, you're dreaming that things
were better at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, Oh no, no, they, they had
unbelievable effects and the directions
[SPEAKER_02]: were phenomenal and they were very unique
in the way they sent and how you made you
[SPEAKER_02]: feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just, you don't see this except in
some very rare cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see stuff that's highly marketable
and a quality, but like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you working with some of that stuff,
the Panama's, I remember some killer
[SPEAKER_02]: Panama's that were just thumping and the,
the flavor profiles were unique in the way
[SPEAKER_02]: it made you feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: The feel was unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the problem is that as soon as we
started to hybridize it down so that it
[SPEAKER_02]: would work in our climates, as soon as we
started to try to bring it indoor,
[SPEAKER_02]: we basically just started culling it out
of existence and we dumbed it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We turned the qualities down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you know, for me, when I try to
get, when I meet people that like you,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I've known you for a long time,
but I know that you're, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you scour in the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm always like, did you find some
goodies someplace?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, is the goodies still remaining
somewhere?
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, and unfortunately the goodies
are out there, but they're just not
[SPEAKER_05]: marketable.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, for the, for the most part,
but the, some of these cultivars that take
[SPEAKER_05]: 14 weeks that the flowers still have 14
weeks is like a football and it hasn't
[SPEAKER_05]: filled in.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, but this is something that it's good
to have in the toolbox.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, let's not get, let's not get,
let this go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think right now that's these
different unique cultivars that we run
[SPEAKER_05]: into.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's keep it alive or share it with
somebody else.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's like that, it's that
cannibinoids that feed your
[SPEAKER_05]: endocannibinoids, you know, everybody's
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something that one strain it's like,
is that could be that key that helps you
[SPEAKER_05]: like with epilepsy, it's three to 5%,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Of people that are affected by say
Charlotte's web.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what are the cannibinoids within that
cultivar that are accessing your
[SPEAKER_05]: endocannibinoid profile?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something collecting big data
right now going into this on the
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmacogenetic level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is identifying these genetics,
plant genetics, and then a person's makeup
[SPEAKER_05]: and seeing that 80 year old lady that's in
Australia that just got help from a
[SPEAKER_05]: certain profile and helped her epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have a three year old child
in America or somewhere else that you'd
[SPEAKER_05]: never know that this particular balance of
a one-to-one fight.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something working one and it
was finding these old land races from,
[SPEAKER_05]: from Africa.
[SPEAKER_05]: As well, but developing a full cannibinoid
profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm talking like 5% THC,
five CBD, five CBN, CBG, CBDV,
[SPEAKER_05]: THCV, flatlined across the board or these
different profiles.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you identify a cultivar like
that, being able to put it in vitro and
[SPEAKER_05]: put that on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're good on time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a little bit of time for some
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys got some questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shoot them while you're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did, why did import weed stop coming
in the country?
[SPEAKER_02]: Import weed stopped coming in the country
primarily because I was somebody that was
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in the enforcement of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what it was, was it was a function
of, of size.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when the people were shipping drugs
into America and in around 1980 is when
[SPEAKER_02]: the door really got shut, the,
the, the difficulty to ship a product into
[SPEAKER_02]: the U S became much more difficult and it
is a lot easier to ship a suitcase full of
[SPEAKER_02]: cocaine than a truckload of cannabis and a
suitcase full of opium is a lot easier to
[SPEAKER_02]: ship than a truckload of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was a function of the economy
and the U S instantly kicked up its
[SPEAKER_02]: domestic production to make up for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that what we did is we lost,
you know, the access to a lot of these
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible type effects and highs and the
tones that were there were also about the
[SPEAKER_02]: experiences you got when you smoked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people in the United States are in
their own paradigm.
[SPEAKER_02]: America is its own little planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it, it just skewed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after a couple of years,
basically nothing was coming in on any
[SPEAKER_02]: quantity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got to the point where America was
really jamming the whole Mexican drug
[SPEAKER_02]: trade because we were producing so much
herb up here in, in Northern California
[SPEAKER_02]: that it was really cutting back on the
amount of money made in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you talk to people in Mexico,
you can talk to villages and they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh man, when they, when you guys started
really lighten up heavy, you financially
[SPEAKER_02]: broke us because we didn't realize that it
wasn't just cartels moving weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was villages moving weed and that the
cartel may have been the trafficker,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the villager was the producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we started becoming competitors
with the Mexican farmer and we didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really understand that for them it was
life and death because they didn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: alternative forms of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cannabis was the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just come up growing weed and
you also can't collect weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have a license, you can only
have six plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I always throw six plants out there
for enjoyment, but oh my God, how the hell
[SPEAKER_02]: do you bank varietals for time and breed
and reproduce when you're only legally
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed six?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it forces everyone to go right back
into a criminal status.
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone's like, yeah, it's only a
misdemeanor, but I'm like, the point is
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's still a criminal status and you
would get your product seized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you don't have an ability to hold a
living collection unless you have a
[SPEAKER_02]: permit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for most people, man, that's no small
trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Answer your question.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's asking what's the major differences
between the Northern Lights cuts you hold
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're all named with those
numerics.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the significance of that and what
does it mean to you and how you use them?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would really need the guys here that
originally bred the Northern Lights
[SPEAKER_01]: strains to answer all these questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from what I've read and understand and
what I've heard through the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: culture is Northern Lights number one is
the pure form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, three, we're crossed to Indica's.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now five, six, seven, eight,
nine, we're crossed to Sativa's to
[SPEAKER_01]: hybridize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all five has the best bag peel and the
best marketable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But NL2 has the strongest, most Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of Juniper, just real Kush smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern Lights number one is the backbone
of all the other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can smell it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the building block.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what Neville used.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he had a clone and he wanted to
recreate that clone, that was the male he
[SPEAKER_01]: used.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he wanted to make a pure hash plant
off the hash plant cutting, he back
[SPEAKER_01]: crossed off of the Northern Lights number
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he wanted to bring Big Bud to the
market and he just had the Big Bud clone,
[SPEAKER_01]: he back crossed off of Northern Lights
number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real building block.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as by itself, it's great smoke,
but it doesn't have the bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That answer your question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're shooting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get you next.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're saying how do you go from bag
appeal to smoke appeal an actual reality?
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone screams education,
but if you want to get an education in
[SPEAKER_02]: America, you're going to go broke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the issue with education in our
situation is to be able to have some
[SPEAKER_02]: loosening of the regulation that allows
you to have events where individuals can
[SPEAKER_02]: come and meet cultivators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then cultivators can then be able to
sit down and casually, without trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: sell them a product, expose them to what
they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they can also explain to them why
they like it, where does it shine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people who smoke, you got to
remember, most people nowadays can't roll
[SPEAKER_02]: a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sell cone rollers and stuff,
and I personally don't like a filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm somebody who likes to taste the
weed in his mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cardboard in the mouth just doesn't do
it for me the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's because that's what I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I realized that nobody can roll a
joint anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: They use devices to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're using a bong or glass and
you're torching it with the lighter and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're burning that shit, burnability is
an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you're smoking it in a tube,
it's definitely an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where the pre-rolls,
people don't have issues because by the
[SPEAKER_02]: time you smoke it, it's dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the combustibility is incredible,
but you're lacking the quality of flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's this reality of why are you
putting the product on the market?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people who buy the product have to
understand this is the truth, that these
[SPEAKER_02]: things are on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing when you explain to people why
the tomato is on the table, because it
[SPEAKER_02]: fits in a lug.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why does the Cavendish banana sold
compared to other bananas?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because lo and behold, it doesn't need
refrigeration when you ship it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes good enough and it doesn't
require refrigeration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those financial concerns dictate the
consumption reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when people say education,
people are like, oh, people are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be doing the education.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yeah, people who are trying to
make money who don't know what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I see people in Napa running terpene
seminars and I'm looking and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: roll me a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that doesn't mean you're legit,
but if you can't even break up some weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: the amount of weed you've handled in your
life is probably pretty small.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're the last person I'm going to ask
for for an in-person demonstration on how
[SPEAKER_02]: to appreciate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be an incredible scientist and
you can explain to me why I get the
[SPEAKER_02]: response and reaction I do from what I'm
doing, but you're not the one I'm asking
[SPEAKER_02]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn me on to good grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we need is we need people
like yourselves that are career smokers,
[SPEAKER_02]: career growers who can appreciate quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can sit down with customers in a
cannabis manner, which is non-aggressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let them try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can say, look, see,
this is nuggy and it works and we sell it
[SPEAKER_02]: for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But personally, we smoke this looser
looking hay like weed because for me,
[SPEAKER_02]: the quality, the high is perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they go, well, how do I buy stuff like
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go, all right, now we need to
figure out how do we get it to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's try to work out the supply
chain like we talked about this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you get customers that want your
product, you're no longer pushing drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are pulling drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a radical difference in
business velocity when that happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm asking Bob some good questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was calling Bob says his nickname.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody had a nickname.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always fascinated with when I met him,
he was somebody who was explaining to me
[SPEAKER_02]: the varieties he held.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was going through the chain of
custody in a manner that made me laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, how the fuck do you remember
that many names of who held it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was so conscientious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why when I was saying to him,
how do you hold material?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's these little things I notice
in people that I don't think other people
[SPEAKER_02]: understand about what drives you to do it
and what level of desire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for Josh, a humble guy, fantastic and
highly knowledgeable gardener in a market
[SPEAKER_02]: that's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted him to be able to explain,
how do you integrate those worlds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he's a superior farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for Hardy, the questions that I wanted
to get out of him were, using your
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge of the current scientific
situation and the global situation,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's your thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And from that point, man, there's a
trillion questions you could ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so shit, I mean, I think we covered
what I wanted to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is, is there something that
you want to know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there something you feel that you could
ask any one of these people to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of direction?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really the truth of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: My question was for Hardy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've done a lot of research with
different cannabinoids in different
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties from all around the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you found in your most recent
research of different cannabinoids besides
[SPEAKER_04]: CDD or THC that you've been able to reach
a level on or finding some potential?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the Varins.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you're familiar with
Doug's Varin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then finding this lineage of where it
came from and bringing that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a particular strain, though,
that is not appealing as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's been one that has taken a lot of
time and money and patience to move it
[SPEAKER_05]: forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has moved forward when you see a 2%
to 3% gain in those cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like it's been significant with
the Varins, more so than THC being able to
[SPEAKER_05]: take something in a couple back crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting it up to above 20% in these
desirable terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, to that point, it's the Varins
that we've been looking at to increase.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the highest threshold you've
gotten?
[SPEAKER_05]: 8% right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's getting that over that 10% right
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a lot of testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can have that same phenotype and
that same expression and something back
[SPEAKER_05]: crossed up to even we've seen as far as
with the Varins is you're going to six
[SPEAKER_05]: generations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And while all of a sudden out of 100
tests, all of a sudden you see an outlier
[SPEAKER_05]: spike where it's going up above even 1%,
2%.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there are these outliers that
will shoot up to above over 5.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's how many tests do we have to
run before we get that 10?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed sometimes that when we're
looking for specific cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're trying to run them, there seems to
be a blockage from other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like the plant's competing
with what it's going to produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you're working with THCV,
which is just so trendy right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: are you seeing interrelationships with
other cannabinoids that are linkage,
[SPEAKER_02]: like drag?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you see another cannabinoid,
do you notice that it stops the production
[SPEAKER_02]: of THCV?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we know there's limits on what can be
formed within the cookbook.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, to that point is that seeing
with the THCV is as well the spikes in THC
[SPEAKER_05]: as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's identifying those particular high
THCs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all of a sudden you'll see CBD
completely knocked out altogether.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's right now it's being able to
put that in a contract controlled growing
[SPEAKER_05]: environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because how much do you know, this is
something as these environmental
[SPEAKER_05]: conditions, at what point is that as well
being attributed to that makeup?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got one more question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be for any of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You only get one question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sit down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have any of you had specific experience on
using certain precursors for turkey
[SPEAKER_04]: production and say a soil mix?
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you done anything with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as far as CBD goes, I know if you
can get a more fungal dominated soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to get a higher test result.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that help?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you're looking for?
[SPEAKER_04]: Somewhat.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I noticed that there's different
turkinoids that you might have some kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of input that you use as a fertilizer that
may increase that turkinoid level because
[SPEAKER_04]: of that specific input.
[SPEAKER_04]: Has anyone done specific tests of
different soil mixtures and studied the
[SPEAKER_04]: levels of turkinoid variances depending on
the input material?
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't done that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, well, I was just going to like
just kind of reemphasize what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: saying that that does exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like people that taste my weed,
and I'm not saying this is necessarily a
[SPEAKER_03]: good thing, but I've been using a lot of
the same mixes for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they always say, you're all your weed
tastes has a real similar deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's a bit mix, like what I'm
putting in there input wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bit environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a bit like my biome.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, I guess, the part that I wanted to
put up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm touching the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm touching the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy I learned to grow from,
he taught me how to mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he goes, you're sweating good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he goes, shake that shit off.
[SPEAKER_03]: He made me shake my drips off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think about it every time I'm mixing
soil that the sweat's going in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's going to taste, you know,
somebody, it's kind of gross when you
[SPEAKER_03]: think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But somebody is going to taste that down
the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that it's leaving an impression.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and my what's going on with
me is what's going on with my microbes to
[SPEAKER_03]: my emotions, my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've you know, it's a little bit
weird, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always try to approach my gardens with a
clear head.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I have to stop and smoke a joint,
take a walk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't always do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've always tried to put little signs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And stuff to remind me like, chill out,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never work angry when I work on the
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that really does.
[SPEAKER_02]: I chill because you are rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like with your kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You deal with your children.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to make sure that you turn down
your personal shit with any decision you
[SPEAKER_02]: make with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because otherwise, you're harsh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that impact on them is tremendous
because they're sensitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look at plants the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just tell people, that's why I love
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it slows me down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't be aggressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't be hurried or rushed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to move at the plant's pace.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that changed the way I
perceive life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It let me understand a natural
progression.
[SPEAKER_02]: That things can only move at the pace they
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you try to go past that,
you miss things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you cause problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I agree, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I turn down my drama.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're monkey brain or whatever they
call it, everything breaks around you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just causing more problems by being
in that space.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any testing on that?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost taking inputs out.
[SPEAKER_05]: With breeding, how far can you push a
plant to stress?
[SPEAKER_05]: For dry farming, for instance.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen a lot with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of a sudden, you just pull the plant
off water.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of a sudden, it doesn't fill up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the flower, the way it changes,
and the terpenes within it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really taking as much as possible
out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as input and seeing its
performance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because some plants, they can't handle it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just move through onto the next.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of these ones that are really
vigorous.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we've taken these vigorous plants
and then put them in a greenhouse that's
[SPEAKER_05]: got mites, that's got bugs, that's got PM.
[SPEAKER_05]: Throw it next to these plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: How does it perform?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it getting these diseases?
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them that don't pull them back
outside and keep working with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: How much duress and stress can be put on
the plant and see good performance?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's like looking at it from an
athlete point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you give it a little input,
it's kind of bringing it back down and
[SPEAKER_05]: taking everything out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you give it a couple pellets
of sea bird guano or whatever it may be,
[SPEAKER_05]: that fertilizer, and then you watch that
change.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, one more question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strawberry cough, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a deep question for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be something that no one in the
cannabis community knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the Rapture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an old NL.
[SPEAKER_01]: G13 hash plant cross from North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question was, what do you regret
losing the most?
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost a plant that would have come out of
like the late 80s out of Brycelin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you lit it, it looked like a
burning tire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got so high when I smoked it that
I'd lay down on the couch and my girl
[SPEAKER_02]: would come in and I'd wake up and she'd be
wiping my face with the rag, asking me if
[SPEAKER_02]: I was sick because I was feverish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would mumble, no, I'm just really
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had the most complete effect I've
ever experienced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was stunning cannabis in every
aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a visual quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a growth quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a quality, a high that was unreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got killed by mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, oh, we'll go find more like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I realized quickly that that was a
memory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the one I wish I had back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so green, it was almost like blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used to call it the blue varietal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it literally would make regular people
ill.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would fold you over and kick you in the
ass and send you home and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: come back when you're grown up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The beauty of cannabis is that all of us
have that special thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I've always been trying to
explain to people, you don't have to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: big banker, but you got to bank a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to make sure you keep some stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to make sure you're involved in
some breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let anybody talk shit to you because
you're a pollen chucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're somebody who has historically done
what we've done since the dawn of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've chosen things to put together for
your desire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when people ask me, what should I
smoke?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I'm not qualified to tell you
because I'm not you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can put you into things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can help you understand why you like
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But fundamentally, I'm not you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not qualified to tell you what you
should like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like telling someone who they should
love.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not qualified.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you lost something good,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've had a lot of stuff in your hand,
boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't cry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't cry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, I lost the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where you come in with the
sharing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like being breeding seeds and
taking these times.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like they're your children.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's like the one thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like spreading that right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like back in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_05]: And running into walls and losing these
certain genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what drove me back to go to
Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like finding this was happy pizzas.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you've been to Cambodia,
but you eat this fucking pizza and you're
[SPEAKER_05]: tripping.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're in Cambodia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a different level to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was something when you could grow
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a nice producer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would grow under the man's need as well
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could put it in a mixed bag of
tricks and get 5,600 a pound.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had different colors.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't that name.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's like some old Southeast Asian.
[SPEAKER_05]: These long flowering times.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just these soaring psychedelic highs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that different feeling.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's part of that backtracking.
[SPEAKER_05]: And finding what exactly, like one of them
was CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was reaching out to Ringo and Jaime
when people were first introducing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the Juanita Lagrimosa and that,
you know, that canatonic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those old genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, okay, well this was Oaxaca.
[SPEAKER_05]: This region, Colombia.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, where were these things coming
from?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then trying to search those out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's like when you mention that with
Africa.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's this getting is we're losing this.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, these unique ones that are out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's being able to find these special
ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at what point you want to share these.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you don't want them to go under the
wrong hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something we're going to be
facing right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Being breeders, I think, coming more and
more.
[SPEAKER_05]: As we've got the bigger players that are
coming in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they don't realize the time and the
energy that's put into these certain
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how rare and special they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something that we have to
protect.
[SPEAKER_05]: True, true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything you lose that you wish you knew?
[SPEAKER_03]: The strawberry cough I lost that I had
right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've thought about it a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've popped some beans and I haven't
found anything that was that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure it was the strawberry
cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've seen the cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had that, you know, that's very
distinguished.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like real thick smoke, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was the first plant that we ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember we had two plants under two
lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got six pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like blown away the first time that
it ever happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was very easy to trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just these little golf ball nugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which most of the cough is not the
strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this bigger, you know, denser,
fluffier.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really because I was medicine
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I came into cannabis from a bicycle
accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got hit by a car.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was fucked up really hard for a couple
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just like learning to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Walking around the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoking as much weed as I could.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was that strawberry cough that like
really was able to help me manage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a damn shark's breath that I
lost it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got stuck with the shark's breath
cutting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hated that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I took a cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought it was a strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I messed it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a shark's breath.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could never get rid of that fucking
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say thanks for taking the
time to spend the day with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a privilege to have you all as an
audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would love to have you give a hand
to the individuals that put this together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And give a salute to yourself too,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because really, you all, we worked hard to
get here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You worked hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that you're still here doing your
thing means that you didn't give up during
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of hard times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you didn't give up under the
oppression that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a testament to willpower and
resiliency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I salute you for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much for your time
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, serious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
