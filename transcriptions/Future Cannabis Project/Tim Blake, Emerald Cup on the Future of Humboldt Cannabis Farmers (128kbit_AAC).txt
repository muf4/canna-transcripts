[SPEAKER_01]: I want to now turn it over to Tim,
who had a very interesting perspective on
[SPEAKER_01]: taxes and issues dealing with the farms up
north and what's happening to them because
[SPEAKER_01]: of the tax crunch, for lack of a better
word.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you could kind of explain what's
going on and how you're seeing that world
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, because to me it was
fascinating, because being in Southern
[SPEAKER_01]: California and dealing with a lot of
indoor growers and distributors and banks,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not seeing the landscape that you're
seeing in the trenches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's even larger than a tax issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a calamity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look four years ago, we brought up
about 400 people to Eureka to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: gathering of the supervisors in the fire
department, everybody to talk about how
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to embrace cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a standing ovation at the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an incredible experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last week, the BCC came up to Humboldt to
do their road show, and there were less
[SPEAKER_00]: than 35 people in the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nobody that showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were more people from the state than
there were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I explained to them that's because
they've given up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Justin talked about a grieving going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swami talks about a thousand cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically have people that it's a
perfect storm, where it wasn't just the
[SPEAKER_00]: taxes, it is the taxes, but it's the land
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the cultivators that have to
now apply to building codes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got them having to deal with water
boards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up north, you could get away with doing
whatever you wanted for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me, because the water boards and
fishing game weren't in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that they're in, it's like they used
to fly helicopters, and then you had to go
[SPEAKER_00]: get a warrant, prove that you could go in
there, and they'd go to a lot of trouble
[SPEAKER_00]: with cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you just fly over with Google Map,
you see it on a computer, you send the
[SPEAKER_00]: $10,000 to $20,000 a day fine,
tell them they've got to shut down,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're sending out hundreds of notices
throughout Humboldt, and Trinity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're shutting down the markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that have been here for 40,
50, 60 years doing this, if you looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: the size of Mendocino and Humboldt,
Trinity, and Emerald Triangle,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's larger than most of the small states
in this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was like they said, if this was a
coal issue with coal farmers, or if this
[SPEAKER_00]: was a farming issue in Kansas,
there's more farmers being wiped out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Emerald Triangle than there are in
Kansas, or any place where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: subsidizing farm labor and farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are those farmers having trouble even
getting through the licensing process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they getting licensed locally,
at the state?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're talking about that,
you've got less than 300 licensed farms in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino, less than 400 in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're having a very challenging time
because of, Ed Rosenthal said it,
[SPEAKER_00]: we argued years ago, and it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt, Mendocino, they weren't made for
traditional farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The land's steep, there's no soil,
lack of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's challenging, but then you've got
deserts out here that are bringing 500,000
[SPEAKER_00]: square foot farms in, and they're taking
the water from the Sierras, or wherever
[SPEAKER_00]: else they're taking it from, and they're
not in trouble, but the landowners up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino can't use their own water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between the building codes, the taxes,
everything, you're basically going to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at 75% of the people that built this
industry are going to be gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to that, you've got the micro
businesses, and they're not letting people
[SPEAKER_00]: do home micro businesses, for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product makers, the small people that
did all that are gone, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited about 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: I voted for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with Fiona and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're going to be in a great world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consumers are going to get the best
products they can ever hope for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have cost-effective
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a huge advocate for all the people
rotting away in jails across this country,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I don't want to say it's negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great thing we're going into,
but he asked about what we're seeing for
[SPEAKER_00]: the small farmers and small product
makers, and it is an extinction event that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going through right now.
Thank you.
