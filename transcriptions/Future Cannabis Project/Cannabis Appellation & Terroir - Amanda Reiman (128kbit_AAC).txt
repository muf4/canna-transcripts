[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are here with Amanda Ryman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amanda is with Glowcona and she is a
presenter for our April 2nd, the Path to
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Appalachians event.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Amanda, if you could start off just
giving us a brief introduction of
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself, who you work with and sort of
how you got interested in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, how you got engaged in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hi everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope everyone is enjoying their time at
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am currently the Vice President of
Community Development for Glowcona.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glowcona is a cannabis distribution
company up in the Emerald Triangle that
[SPEAKER_00]: works with a network of small,
sustainable, sun-grown farmers and does
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution across the state,
packaging and promotion for the sun-grown
[SPEAKER_00]: and sustainable methods related to
cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working with the cannabis people
for over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: My background is a social worker and
public health researcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started doing work with the
dispensaries in San Francisco back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: early 2000s and really starting to study
how these facilities were operating as
[SPEAKER_00]: health service providers and what they
were doing in terms of being really good
[SPEAKER_00]: community health partners, which is so
interesting because the conversation now
[SPEAKER_00]: in light of the COVID virus around
cannabis has really been patient access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting to see the discussion
around cannabis kind of return to that
[SPEAKER_00]: more medical framework, which is what it
was like when I first started studying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was really all about how do
we get access for people who are sick to a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that is currently illegal?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I really studied how patients were
accessing cannabis, but also their
[SPEAKER_00]: behaviors around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So specifically looking at how the use of
cannabis impacted their use of other
[SPEAKER_00]: substances, most specifically opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really was interested in looking at
that framework because nobody was studying
[SPEAKER_00]: it back in 2002, 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was very little known about who
patients were or why they were doing what
[SPEAKER_00]: they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I continued studying that and looking
at that from a public health perspective
[SPEAKER_00]: through 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I went to work for the
Drug Policy Alliance as their manager of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana law and policy, really starting
to get more involved on the policy end as
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization started taking off as a
policy change around the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: starting with Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then in 2016, I worked on Prop 64 here
in California to legalize cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was a very, very preliminary step to
the shift of moving cannabis out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: illicit market, out of the criminal
justice system, and moving it more into
[SPEAKER_00]: the field of public health, alternative
health and medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So legalization being that very,
very initial step to start moving cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: away from criminal justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we passed Prop 64 in California,
I decided that what my role really should
[SPEAKER_00]: be next is to be boots on the ground and
trying to ensure that the system that we
[SPEAKER_00]: were going to create after legalization
was a system that was going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: supportive of smaller entities and of
methods that were going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: environmentally friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see a reason to unleash a whole
new industry onto the world that was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to rely on energy intensive cultivation
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was not going to look at this
through the lens of sustainability and
[SPEAKER_00]: climate change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came to work with Flo Khanna and I
moved from Oakland up to Mendocino County
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Emerald Triangle to really focus on
the promotion of sustainably produced
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and to ensure that the policies
that followed after legalization would
[SPEAKER_00]: help support those small and smaller
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do now up in Mendocino is a lot
of non-cannabis work helping the greater
[SPEAKER_00]: community, whether that be farming
communities, nonprofits, healthcare
[SPEAKER_00]: communities, better understand how
cannabis can be integrated into the work
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're doing to bring a net benefit
to the communities that they serve.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you talked a lot about farming
sustainably and sort of going back to
[SPEAKER_01]: those smaller farmers, can you tell us how
focus on the sustainability and those
[SPEAKER_01]: small farmers led you to becoming engaged
with Appalachians and sort of what that
[SPEAKER_01]: means for these small farmers in those
communities?
[SPEAKER_01]: You also mentioned access for cannabis
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so maybe if you can talk about the
dynamic between, you know, maintaining
[SPEAKER_01]: those smaller markets, sustainability,
and then also on the other side,
[SPEAKER_01]: access and sort of what Appalachians for
the industry as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, one of the things that we're
looking to do in cannabis is to
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiate, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The consumer really has no idea what
quality means coming out of an illicit
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in an illicit marketplace,
you don't have a lot of choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically have access to what is
available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, there isn't a lot of
opportunity for scientists and artisans
[SPEAKER_00]: and people to have an open discussion
about what quality means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under prohibition, you know,
consumers started looking at quality as
[SPEAKER_00]: orange hairs, tight nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what does that really even mean
in the grander scheme of things?
[SPEAKER_00]: The public was also led to believe that a
higher THC percentage was indicative of
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really no surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under prohibition, if I'm going to take
the risk of going and buying a product on
[SPEAKER_00]: the illicit market and engaging in a
criminal activity and I get that product
[SPEAKER_00]: home and it doesn't give me the euphoric
effect that I was looking for because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not high in THC, it's higher in some other
cannabinoid, I'm going to feel ripped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to feel like I didn't get what I
paid for, that the risk wasn't worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, through prohibition,
cannabis started to be bred for what
[SPEAKER_00]: people wanted to buy on the street,
which was higher THC cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the benefits of legalization is
that we get a chance to step back and
[SPEAKER_00]: really start thinking about what makes a
quality cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for the farmers up in the
Emerald Triangle, where I work,
[SPEAKER_00]: who for a long time have worked to develop
genetics that were in line with the
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir and where they were growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're growing outdoors and
you're growing in a clandestine method,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you lose a whole year's crop because
you didn't pick the right cultivar to go
[SPEAKER_00]: with the environment in which you're
trying to cultivate, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there really was no plan B.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw a whole generation, multiple
generations of artisanal farmers up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Triangle breeding to go with the
environment in which they were producing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now that things are legal and we're
looking to establish an artisan
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace, it is very important that we
look to how other products have been
[SPEAKER_00]: designated as artisanal for centuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really brings us back to the
Appalachians program and looking at how
[SPEAKER_00]: burgundy and champagne and port were
protected by looking at the terroir and
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment in which these products
were produced and making the designation
[SPEAKER_00]: that certain products can only be deemed
with certain labels if they're part of
[SPEAKER_00]: that terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really fits in very, very well to
cannabis, given the artisanal qualities
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been developed through
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prohibition did give us something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave us this wide array of very,
very specifically produced cultivars that
[SPEAKER_00]: we may not have had if cannabis had gone
the way of conventional agriculture from
[SPEAKER_00]: the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting to your question about access,
I think it's less about access to an
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of cannabis and more about access
to a certain type of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that we see with this
artisanal cultivation are novel
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, cannabinoids that aren't
being mass produced that are extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial for certain therapeutic
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an example I'll give is THC-V.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC-V is a novel cannabinoid that is not
found in many cultivars on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is found in very high amounts in a
cultivar that is produced by Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: Spirit Botanicals in Mendocino County
called Pink Boost Goddess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a very unique cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is produced in a small batch,
but it has a very high therapeutic
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So allowing these small artisanal farmers
to take advantage of their terroir and to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce these cultivars that may not have
broad commercial appeal, but have very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific therapeutic potential I think is
really going to help patients better meet
[SPEAKER_00]: their needs than they could with this kind
of broad stroke, blue dream, 21% THC
[SPEAKER_00]: approach that we're seeing more in the
mass marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially when there's no consistency
between the term blue dream between
[SPEAKER_01]: different areas, different jurisdictions,
right across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at less like just Merlot,
which can taste very different depending
[SPEAKER_00]: on where it comes from, and Burgundy,
which can only be called that if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: produced in the Burgundy region of France
from these very specific vines in a very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific type of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while it's important for something
like the wine industry, the buzz that you
[SPEAKER_01]: might get from a Burgundy versus a general
Merlot may be similar, but you have
[SPEAKER_01]: different tastes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds like for the cannabis
industry, you're talking about really
[SPEAKER_01]: fundamentally different effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so potentially even a more important
concept in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're talking about being able to
differentiate and consumer knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: around differentiated effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to that point, you know, when it comes
to how the product is produced,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we're talking more about the
land and the terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we're talking about effect,
I think we're talking about the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between like Mezcal and Coors Light,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're both alcohol, but folks
report very different effects from hard
[SPEAKER_00]: liquor, liquors within hard liquors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's something that I'm excited
about because I think that under
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition, the cannabis consuming
community had no way to take advantage of
[SPEAKER_00]: these very specific differences between
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you use the word term terroir?
[SPEAKER_01]: A few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you just let us know, and for the
audience, can you let us know what the
[SPEAKER_01]: definition of a terroir is?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a very sort of complicated
term that has a lot of possibilities in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the sort of the connection
between the term terroir and then sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: the overall appellations, the term of
appellations, maybe how those are
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So terroir basically refers to the
environment in which the product is
[SPEAKER_00]: produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about the sun, the moon,
the water, basically the natural elements
[SPEAKER_00]: that come into contact with that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the belief is that the combination of
those elements in the place where that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is being produced can result in a
very different outcome for that plant than
[SPEAKER_00]: if it was produced somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, for example, if we're talking
about a cultivar, let's say like lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: tree, if you grow lemon tree on one side
of the hill, you may get a very different
[SPEAKER_00]: effect and outcome of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than if you grow it on the other side of
the hill based on where the sun hits,
[SPEAKER_00]: the acidity of the soil, the wetness of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so part of the process of establishing
appellations is determining where these
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir regions are located.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that's really interesting is
that terroir doesn't necessarily follow
[SPEAKER_00]: with political boundaries of counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have an area of terroir that
spans two or three counties, but still is
[SPEAKER_00]: considered terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's something that's going
to be really interesting as we start this
[SPEAKER_00]: process of developing appellations is to
look and see how terroir does and does not
[SPEAKER_00]: conform to political county boundary
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the land is really what drives the
terroir designation and figuring out which
[SPEAKER_00]: appellations encompass not just terroir,
but the practices that come out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir for that community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have soil that's extremely
acidic, then you may have a community
[SPEAKER_00]: practice that involves amending that soil
through natural means in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: establish a more hospitable cultivation
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everyone in that terroir is engaging
in that same practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it maintains the uniformity of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned sort of the benefits to
local communities and to farmers that have
[SPEAKER_01]: spent the last decades cultivating certain
forms of cultivars that maybe weren't as
[SPEAKER_01]: attractive to the overall illicit market
because of this lack of knowledge for the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you tell us a little bit about the
potential effect that appellations
[SPEAKER_01]: protection for certain terms would have
for those farmers, for those communities,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the sustainability of farming as an
industry and as a means of someone's
[SPEAKER_01]: livelihood, especially coming from a
company like Flocana that many of us here
[SPEAKER_01]: down in the Bay Area view as kind of a
conduit to those smaller farmers,
[SPEAKER_01]: representative of sort of a conglomeration
of those farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us what it means for the
industry itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it means a lot from both
ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's a really important
part to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, from the production end,
it means a lot because it allows the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers to better categorize and describe
what they're doing and know that that
[SPEAKER_00]: description is going to be uniformly
accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, folks are talking about dry
farming, for example, which is using no
[SPEAKER_00]: additional water at all, but basically
tapping into the watershed that's already
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it results in the most amazing tasting
cannabis, similarly to dry farmed wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really have, you know, retain a lot of
those terpenoids and flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not adding water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So folks that are able to dry farm want to
be able to talk about that process and
[SPEAKER_00]: have it be universally accepted and
acknowledged of what that means for the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that follows down the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So folks like Flocana can market that and
use that in branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the consumer at the other end
understands what that means because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: protected term that you can only use if
you're doing a very specific type of
[SPEAKER_00]: farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're able to go and feel
confident when they go into a dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: that if something says it's dry farmed,
they're going to get those terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoids and those impacts in the plant
that they're expecting given what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: telling them dry farming does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it creates this kind of reliability and
validity all the way through the supply
[SPEAKER_00]: chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that allows the artisanal farmers to
more explicitly and accurately talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows us to more accurately and
explicitly market and brand what those
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers have to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it allows the consumer to more
accurately and explicitly get the product
[SPEAKER_00]: that they want and to be able to make that
choice at the counter to say, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: choose the product that has had the least
impact on the environment from the farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: that's taking the most care and
stewardship of their land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's producing this cultivar that I
know is not going to taste like this or
[SPEAKER_00]: look like this unless it was produced in
that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the system that we're trying to
set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look, just like wine, not everybody is
going to be like, I want the dry farmed
[SPEAKER_00]: artisanal terroir cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's absolutely going to be room in the
marketplace for a more mass produced
[SPEAKER_00]: general product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need it all, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to have a balanced market that
has something for everyone, but
[SPEAKER_00]: establishing that artisanal marketplace is
what is going to be very important for the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers that are farming in 2,500 square
feet of land or 5,000 square feet of land,
[SPEAKER_00]: or who are only doing sungrown,
which means they're getting one crop a
[SPEAKER_00]: year versus someone that's growing in a
large all season greenhouse that is
[SPEAKER_00]: getting six crops a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to develop a system for the
marketplace to hold up that small batch
[SPEAKER_00]: crop as special, unique, and in demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really we're talking about a
mechanism to more easily differentiate the
[SPEAKER_01]: market in some of those large producers
that have these greenhouses, no matter
[SPEAKER_01]: whether they're in Southern California in
the middle of the desert, in Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: California in the middle of Oakland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those products are generally coming out
fairly similar because you're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: control the environmental inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're basically saying that those
farmers that are toiling in the soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: the sun, that have these very specific
inputs that are very different from those
[SPEAKER_01]: large greenhouses or those large
warehouses that are in North Rose,
[SPEAKER_01]: they should be able to have an easy way to
differentiate their product to their
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to talk about who they are as farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of prohibition,
the farmers were ignored, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like the cannabis just suddenly
appeared at the dispensary or appeared in
[SPEAKER_00]: the dealer's hands or the seller's hands
on the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the Appalachian program
is going to be a wonderful way for farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: to finally get the recognition of the very
specific methods that they've been using
[SPEAKER_00]: to limit their impact on the environment
and to produce a very unique high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very important story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that lends itself outside
of cannabis farming into food farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really hope that this will help
consumers start asking these questions
[SPEAKER_00]: about their food and not just their
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we don't see this as being a
silo of cannabis and sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But rather a gateway to a further
discussion about sustainability and
[SPEAKER_00]: artisanally produced food products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there, you know, we've heard a lot
about the positives of the Appalachians
[SPEAKER_01]: projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any aspects of this that are
sort of controversial?
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw the CDFA regs drops on February
20th, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have there been any points in there or are
they missing anything that you think
[SPEAKER_01]: should be included in sort of this
baseline?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think one of the big discussions
is going to be what is terroir?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think within that discussion,
one of the big points that we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to have more discussion on is the use
of unamended natural soil, native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are folks who have been
growing in the ground but have been
[SPEAKER_00]: amending those soils for decades because
of inhospitable growing environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the question is, does that
amendment preclude them from claiming
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachian designation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And does it have to be that the soil has
been untouched?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or can we say there's a certain percentage
of native soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you've been amending the soil but
you've been using amendments that come
[SPEAKER_00]: from your environment over a certain
amount of time, does that now count?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about people that grow in smart pots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to have to go into the soil
in order to be considered an Appalachian,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if they're producing under full sun?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's one discussion that's
going to have to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other is going to have to be
the difference between a geographic
[SPEAKER_00]: indicator and an Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can definitely have geographic
indicators that we do for wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're growing in an all season
greenhouse in Oakland, you can still have
[SPEAKER_00]: a geographic indicator that tells people
that this product was produced in Oakland,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the same as an Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's going to have to be
some discussion, including legal
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion, about how we really
operationalize Appalachian versus
[SPEAKER_00]: geographic indicator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a really good point because,
right, in terms of the consumer,
[SPEAKER_01]: I live here in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the consumer, being produced
in Oakland, within Oakland's borders,
[SPEAKER_01]: and employing Oakland residents could be
very important to that consumer and very
[SPEAKER_01]: important in a very different way than
knowing exactly where your product is from
[SPEAKER_01]: and how it's grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So last question, thank you so much for
all this information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last question, is there anything,
any sort of discussion, any person that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're really particularly interested in
hearing from at this April 2nd event that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to hold online now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any sort of thing that you're particularly
excited about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say I'm so excited about the
lineup of speakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said a few times I feel like it's
getting the band back together because you
[SPEAKER_00]: really found a lot of folks who have been
doing this a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that one of the big pieces of
value that all of us will bring to the
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion is a recognition and an
observation of the evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of us came into this yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think on average, the speakers have
probably been doing this for at least a
[SPEAKER_00]: decade or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that we've really seen the
evolution through prohibition and
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization and can really speak to that
in the larger context of the past 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years, rather than just kind of since
2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we try to get that historical context
because especially in issues like this
[SPEAKER_01]: that affect legacy markets, small farmers,
business, you know, that perspective and
[SPEAKER_01]: that perspective that has some
developments and evolution over time is
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much for your time this
morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really look forward to seeing you
on April 2nd.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't wait to have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be sort of a grand
