[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Omar Figueroa and here is
Lauren Mendelson and I've been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis law for almost 20 years,
starting doing freedom defense and now
[SPEAKER_00]: transitioning to legal compliance and
helping people getting their permits and
[SPEAKER_00]: their licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way I see the shift in my practice
is before I used to help people escape
[SPEAKER_00]: their nightmares of incarceration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's helping people realize their
dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we got to think about what
the dreams are because the dream cannot be
[SPEAKER_00]: make as much money as possible in a
non-sustainable manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nowhere else I would rather be
than here in Mendocino County with the
[SPEAKER_00]: small farmers who have shown up to attend
this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for the work you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing the creator's work and it's
an honor to be with you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to discuss sourcing to
sales and Lauren is a brilliant attorney
[SPEAKER_00]: who has been working with me for the past
longer than a year and she's extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: well versed in the law and the regulations
and it's a joy to be able to have an
[SPEAKER_00]: interchange of ideas with somebody who is
brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's a legal disclaimer that we
cannot give legal advice today because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in the context of a presentation
with many other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably better for you not to ask
questions about your own situation but you
[SPEAKER_00]: may ask hypothetical questions and then we
can give you hypothetical answers to those
[SPEAKER_00]: hypothetical legal questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not here to give you specific
advice about your situation and it would
[SPEAKER_00]: be imprudent in the extreme to be
disclosing private personal facts in a
[SPEAKER_00]: forum like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please don't ask any questions that
would reveal your confidences and your
[SPEAKER_00]: secrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess today Lauren will tell us what
we're going to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just briefly some of the things that we
wanted to touch on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just an introduction to the new governing
law here in California, the Medicinal and
[SPEAKER_02]: Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety
Act, an overview of regulatory agencies,
[SPEAKER_02]: overview of the license types in the
supply chain, and room for questions and
[SPEAKER_02]: answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go through a history of
cannabis laws in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1913, cannabis became illegal in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first state to prohibit
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And prohibition increased when in the
1950s, mere possession was a felony.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1996, we had Prop 215 and that was the
watershed legal event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm used to shouting at judges with no
microphone in the courtroom and that
[SPEAKER_00]: explains my awkwardness with the
microphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, in 1996 we had the
Compassionate Use Act, which legalized
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for medical use, not for adult
use, and it required a written or oral
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation or approval from a
physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also gave a defense to patients and
caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2004, that was the birth of the
Collective and Cooperative Defense with
[SPEAKER_00]: Senate Bill 420 and we also had state
identification cards for medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: patients and caregivers and you can still
obtain those state identification cards
[SPEAKER_00]: and use them to get a tax break at a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2010, Senate Bill 420 and Senate Bill
1449 was proposed and it was a way to take
[SPEAKER_00]: the wind out of Proposition 19 and it
decriminalized possession of up to one
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't change the penalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still a $100 fine with no jail
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It simply took away the right to a jury
trial for misdemeanor possession of less
[SPEAKER_00]: than one ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2015, the legislature was trying to
tame the wild tiger of medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and it passed first MRSA, the Medical
Marijuana Regulation Safety Act,
[SPEAKER_00]: which sounds like an infectious disease,
and it also set up a new regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: agency, the Bureau of Medical Marijuana
Regulation, Bummer, and this is because
[SPEAKER_00]: this legislation was written in haste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was rebranded as the Bureau of Medical
Cannabis Regulation and the Medical
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Regulation Safety Act and it had
a system of dual control where you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a local permit in order to get a
state license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this allowed jurisdictions to ban
cannabis activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was done at the lobbying of the League
of California Cities and the California
[SPEAKER_00]: Association of Counties and they wanted to
control the collectives and cooperatives
[SPEAKER_00]: that they could not tame with the criminal
law.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2016, we had Proposition 64,
which quasi-legalized the adult use of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for adults 21 and over and
quasi-legalized because it did not repeal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis prohibition entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is not legal like coffee is
legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still many marijuana crimes except
the penalty has been reduced or modified
[SPEAKER_00]: from felony to misdemeanor, from
misdemeanor to infraction, from some
[SPEAKER_00]: infractions to now it's legal to possess
cannabis in private.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also legal to give away cannabis,
up to an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2017, the legislature at the urging
of the regulators who were saying we
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot come up with two sets of
regulations, one for medical cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: one for adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have the same standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decided to consolidate both statutory
regulatory frameworks for adult and
[SPEAKER_00]: medical and it created this new law,
MALCURSA, the Medicinal and Adult Use
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the current regulatory
framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the justification for all the
regulations that we're now seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has dual control in effect,
so you must have a local permit in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to obtain a state temporary license and as
a practical matter, you also need to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a local permit to get an annual license.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that was a great overview and so
now after hearing all that background,
[SPEAKER_02]: here we are today with this new MALCURSA
law and this is governing the commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what we're talking today is about the
commercial side of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: MALCURSA didn't do away with a patient's
right to cultivate their own for their
[SPEAKER_02]: medical needs and it also didn't do away
with an adult's right, if you're over the
[SPEAKER_02]: age of 21, to cultivate six plants per
residence.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is specifically about cannabis
activity that's gonna be ending up on the
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial market for people to purchase.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some key elements of this law,
there are M and A license types for
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinal or adult use of each different
type of license you're gonna be designated
[SPEAKER_02]: either M or A with the exception of
testing labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rules are pretty much the same for
the M and the A's with the exception of
[SPEAKER_02]: potency limits on edible and manufactured
cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, the rules are pretty much
the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's possible to vertically integrate your
operation to have a cultivation license
[SPEAKER_02]: and a manufacturing license and a
distribution license and a retail license
[SPEAKER_02]: and different combinations of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just can't also hold a testing lab
license.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has to be totally independent and
that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want unbiased test results.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no residency requirement like
there is in some other states meaning you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have to live in California to get
one of these licenses and so that's not an
[SPEAKER_02]: issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some local jurisdictions may have
residency requirements or residency
[SPEAKER_02]: preferences into their ordinances but at
the state level there is not one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There I mentioned these potency limits on
manufactured products and we'll go into
[SPEAKER_02]: that a little bit later but basically
edibles and things like tinctures,
[SPEAKER_02]: any of these products that have been
manufactured with cannabis are now capped
[SPEAKER_02]: either per serving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Edible product have to be 10 milligrams
per serving.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have more than 100 milligrams
per package and that's uniform across
[SPEAKER_02]: adult and medicinal and so there's
definitely an effort to try to increase
[SPEAKER_02]: that cap for the medical market but that's
the way it stands right now and for
[SPEAKER_02]: non-edible other manufactured products.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a cap of 1,000 milligrams per
package and 2,000, that's for adult use
[SPEAKER_02]: and 2,000 per package for medicinal and so
we can talk more about that later.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lab testing requirements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically any product that's sold at a
retailer has to be lab tested for certain
[SPEAKER_02]: things and has to pass based on a certain
criteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's packaging and labeling
requirements.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're pretty specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of information you have to fit on
this label.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all products have to be entered into
the track and trace program at the state
[SPEAKER_02]: level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some counties like Mendocino also have
their own separate track and trace program
[SPEAKER_02]: and this is so the authorities can find
out where the product is moving,
[SPEAKER_02]: if anything's been diverted and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Local control means that in California
here your local government really has the
[SPEAKER_02]: final say on what kind of cannabis
activity you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are in a place where they have
banned a certain type of cannabis activity
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't get a state license for it
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to find someplace else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or change the law where you live,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lobby your local government to change the
rules which many people are doing
[SPEAKER_02]: successfully and it just takes people like
you and I and all of us to show up to the
[SPEAKER_02]: meetings and put our information,
what we want on the agenda and speak up at
[SPEAKER_02]: public comment and write letters and so
forth and run for office.
[SPEAKER_02]: And taxation in this new law, there's
levels of tax on cultivators as well as on
[SPEAKER_02]: purchasers and it's pretty high right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The levels for that are $9.25 an ounce on
flour, $2.75 an ounce on trim and $1.29 an
[SPEAKER_02]: ounce on live plant material which has to
be weighed within two hours of being
[SPEAKER_02]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are just some of the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're gonna go over the main
regulatory agencies and there's three of
[SPEAKER_00]: them depending on which type of activity
that somebody is engaging in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within the Department of Consumer
Affairs there's a newly created agency
[SPEAKER_00]: called the Bureau of Cannabis Control.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the successor agency to Bummer,
the Bureau of Medical Marijuana Regulation
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is led by Chief Lori Ajax.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's considered the lead agency and it
regulates and licenses distributors whose
[SPEAKER_00]: job it is to get from one licensee to
another and perform certain testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: quality assurance and taxation functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Retailers are the ones who have interface
with the public or patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbusinesses may have interface with
public or patients or they could be
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators, manufacturers and
distributors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then testing labs and as Lauren said
testing labs cannot have any other type of
[SPEAKER_00]: license.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to basically ensure that the testing
lab has no financial interest in the
[SPEAKER_00]: outcome of the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: For cultivation we have the Cal Cannabis
Licensing Branch and that's within the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Food and Agriculture and
they also administer the Track and Trace
[SPEAKER_00]: program and they also issue processor
licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then manufacturing is overseen by a
newly created bureau, the Manufactured
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Safety Branch within the
Department of Public Health and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: also issuing a new type S shared
manufacturing facility license.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in addition to those agencies,
those three agencies are going to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: ones that are issuing the licenses for
these cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other agencies at the state level
that are also involved in regulating
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis businesses and so they have
regulations that you have to follow,
[SPEAKER_02]: enrollment programs and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the more prominent ones are the
Department of Fish and Wildlife if you are
[SPEAKER_02]: a cultivator you probably, hopefully know
all about the Department of Fish and
[SPEAKER_02]: Wildlife as well as the water boards.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Department of Fish and Wildlife is
looking at making sure that you are
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping streams and rivers and lakes
clear, clean and keeping the wildlife
[SPEAKER_02]: within those waterways clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you're a cultivator there is,
you need to get, have a lake and stream
[SPEAKER_02]: bed alteration agreement from the
Department of Fish and Wildlife or
[SPEAKER_02]: written, a written notice from them that
one is not required based on the specifics
[SPEAKER_02]: of your property.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and the State Water Resources
Control Board also has a new enrollment
[SPEAKER_02]: program for cultivators that you can go
online and fill out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have an online enrollment form and
there's different programs for water
[SPEAKER_02]: quality as well as for water rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to make sure if you're a
cultivator you're checking out the water
[SPEAKER_02]: board.
[SPEAKER_02]: Department of Tax and Fee Administration,
they are collecting well they're,
[SPEAKER_02]: that new cannabis tax that I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: The distributors are going to end up being
the tax collectors and it's all going to
[SPEAKER_02]: get back to this Department of Tax and Fee
Administration.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a distributor you need to get a
special distributor tax permit from that
[SPEAKER_02]: agency.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Department of Pesticide Regulation has
some specific, there are specific
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticides that are approved to be used on
cannabis and specific ones that are not
[SPEAKER_02]: approved on cannabis and there's a list on
their website so make sure that you are
[SPEAKER_02]: looking into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's others as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're going to go over the different
types of license categories and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: designation M for medicinal, A for adult
use for each type of license except for
[SPEAKER_00]: the laboratory testing license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those don't have any designation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is possible to have two of the
same types of licenses on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: premise, M and then A license on the same
premise and B.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many businesses that have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for cultivation there's five types and
those are based on size and there's three
[SPEAKER_00]: main categories, indoor, outdoor and mixed
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a nursery type license and
then a processing only license that does
[SPEAKER_00]: not authorize cultivation but does
authorize sorting, curing, grading,
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: For manufacturing we see five license
types now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the type six which is non-volatile
extraction or solventless Rosin technique
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the type seven volatile
extraction that's often BHO extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, winterization using ethyl
alcohol is not considered volatile
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction, it's considered type six
non-volatile extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also have infusion that does
not authorize extraction, that authorize
[SPEAKER_00]: the production of cannabis goods infused
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a packaging and labeling
license that the state will issue and that
[SPEAKER_00]: is only for packaging and repackaging,
labeling and relabeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen any state licenses issued
in those categories yet because it takes a
[SPEAKER_00]: local government to amend its local
ordinance and issue those kind of permits
[SPEAKER_00]: before the state will issue a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the newest type of license is a
shared manufacturing facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: type S license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that works, if somebody has a
type six, type seven or type N license,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're eligible to register it as a
shared use facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a fairly simple form,
two pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once the primary licensee is
registered as a shared use facilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: then other manufacturers can get a type S
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type S shared manufacturing facility
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laboratory testing, there is no difference
between medicinal or adult use laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distribution, there's basically three
variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The full distributor who is responsible
for tax collection, quality assurance,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ensuring laboratory testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The self distributor, and that's somebody
who basically can only transport their
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis from themselves to licensee to
another licensee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the transport only distributor
who can transport their own and other
[SPEAKER_00]: licensee's product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The self distribution and transport only
distribution licenses, those do not allow
[SPEAKER_00]: the product to get to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they cannot transport to retail
locations because otherwise there would be
[SPEAKER_00]: no guarantee that the cannabis goes
through quality assurance, laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, and tax collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to go through a full distributor
before retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now retailers, there's basically two types
of retailers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is the storefront
dispensary, which can include delivery as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as on-site consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is something that gives the
storefront dispensary an edge over
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery services.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they may have greater operating
costs, but something that California does
[SPEAKER_00]: allow is consumption lounges, and I think
that's something that you will see in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future as more local jurisdictions are
comfortable with cannabis regulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will see more consumption lounges and
more cannabis tourism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the delivery only retail,
which is basically a delivery service,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that does not allow any storefront
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, we have the micro business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micro business is three or four out of the
following types of licenses, cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: up to 10,000 square feet, manufacturing,
but no solvent, no volatile solvent
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction, only non-volatile or
solventless extraction, distribution,
[SPEAKER_00]: and or retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, the Bureau of Cannabis
Control also issues licenses for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that works, in order to get a
license for a temporary cannabis event,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can last up to four days,
somebody must first get a license to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis event organizer, that's a type 14
license, and then with a cannabis event
[SPEAKER_00]: organizer license, you can go to a local
jurisdiction, get local approval for the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis event, and then once you have
local approval, the state Bureau of
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Control will issue a temporary
cannabis event license.
[SPEAKER_00]: High Times has a cannabis event organizer
license, but they did not get local
[SPEAKER_00]: approval, and they are not able to get a
temporary cannabis event license for their
[SPEAKER_00]: High Times Southern California Cup
starting today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the Bureau of Cannabis Control
might be engaging in enforcement action.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have threatened any licensees who
participate in sales at the High Times Cup
[SPEAKER_00]: with disciplinary action against their
license.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a little flow chart that shows the
basic order of events throughout the
[SPEAKER_02]: supply chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a question in the back, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Non-volatile and solventless extraction
techniques versus state.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you guys know what Mendocino's
regulations are regarding a non-volatile
[SPEAKER_07]: and solventless extractions and how they
compare to the state?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I've heard that, for instance,
like ice water hash or rosin or something
[SPEAKER_07]: like that doesn't require a separate
permit in the county of Mendocino,
[SPEAKER_07]: but on the state level, saying you need
specific licensing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You would need a specific manufacturing
license to make ice water hash or rosin,
[SPEAKER_02]: even if you're not using any solvents,
if you're still transforming the raw
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis flower into some kind of a other,
you're extracting in some form the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids from that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need a manufacturing permit for
Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are issuing non-volatile type 6
permits, and then you would need to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: state license for that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I understand your question correctly?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a flow chart that shows the
basic order events throughout the supply
[SPEAKER_02]: chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You start with the flower being
cultivated, then it is optional if the
[SPEAKER_02]: product might go to a manufacturer to be
made into oil or edibles or something of
[SPEAKER_02]: that nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It then would go either straight from the
cultivator or after the manufacturer to
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution, but it would go by way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in between these, the distributor has
to carry it from cultivation to the
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, the cultivator can have a
self-distribution license, but the only
[SPEAKER_02]: licensee that's allowed to transport
cannabis goods is a distributor and an
[SPEAKER_02]: employee of a testing lab, because testing
lab employees have to be transporting
[SPEAKER_02]: samples to and from the testing lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: So distributors of any sort, the three
different types that Omar just mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: or a testing lab employer, the only types
of licensees that can transport the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, at the distribution stage,
really what this is indicating is where
[SPEAKER_02]: the lab testing will occur at that stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: The distributor is responsible for making
sure that is arranged, that happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: The laboratory employee will come to the
distribution facility and will collect the
[SPEAKER_02]: sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: An employee of the distributor has to be
present.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has to occur on camera, and the
sample is collected to be brought back to
[SPEAKER_02]: the testing lab to be tested, and then the
results will be sent back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be sent back to the distributor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And only after the lab testing has
occurred can it make its way to a retail
[SPEAKER_02]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering about licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside of having a testing lab,
is there any licenses that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: combine, like a gardening license and
distributor license, or a delivery and a
[SPEAKER_01]: lounge license?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any regulations that don't allow
for one person to hold multiple license?
[SPEAKER_00]: At this time, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2023, I think there's gonna be
limitations if you have the type five
[SPEAKER_00]: large licenses, and you'll be restricted.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a limitation currently on the
number of medium cultivation licenses that
[SPEAKER_02]: people can hold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is on there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're limited to one type three license.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is at the state level.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just talking really about the state
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many cities and counties might limit you
to, let's say, one permit in this county,
[SPEAKER_02]: or two permits throughout this county per
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just really the state regs that
we're going through, but you always want
[SPEAKER_02]: to check your local jurisdictions' rules
as well to see if they have separate
[SPEAKER_02]: restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just gonna ask about the
manufacturing piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a cultivator, I always thought that
we had to get everything tested first
[SPEAKER_04]: before it moves on to the next stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's okay then to have it manufactured
into pre-rolls or something, and then have
[SPEAKER_04]: that tested?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it just seems like a cost for
cultivators to turn their product into
[SPEAKER_04]: something from the bulk flower
designation, and then have it tested,
[SPEAKER_04]: and open up all that packaging and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, which is why you might want to do
testing on your own, just to make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that your product is okay before you go
through that expense, but it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: required.
[SPEAKER_00]: Internal testing, because if it fails
testing, it could be destroyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't want it to fail, but it's not
required that the cultivator tests it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be tested at some point before
it gets to market, and that responsibility
[SPEAKER_02]: is put on the distributor now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But traditionally, cultivators were the
ones to test their medicine before taking
[SPEAKER_00]: it to the dispensary, and then cultivators
are still probably gonna do that even
[SPEAKER_00]: though it's not required as an internal
control, and also because they don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to risk putting all this product into the
hands of a distributor, and then once it's
[SPEAKER_00]: in the hands of the distributor,
it can't get to a retail market unless it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets a certificate of analysis showing it
passes testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if it doesn't, it can be
remediated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it can't be remediated, it has to be
destroyed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the only way to get your product
off-farm if you don't have a distributor
[SPEAKER_04]: transport-only license is that the
distributor has to come to your farm and
[SPEAKER_04]: take it, and then send it to the
manufacturing facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're gonna, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I just see one more question in the
back over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: What does remediation consist of?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would mean some type of further
processing in order to remove either there
[SPEAKER_02]: was maybe there was some extra chemicals
in there that shouldn't have been or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe doing another, you know,
I'm not a manufacturer, so I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: what they do, but they do some process by
which they are further refining the
[SPEAKER_02]: product, and it might, the second time you
test it, it might pass, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, there's circumstances where you
cannot remediate a product, and that is
[SPEAKER_02]: dependent on basically what it tests
negative for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you want to come talk to us
afterwards, we can send you, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: where you can find those exact regs and
find out more about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know in other industries, we've sent
products to various labs and gotten all
[SPEAKER_03]: kinds of different results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they come together pretty close,
and sometimes they're all over the place,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it depends on the lab and who did it
that day and how many drinks for lunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have we got any feedback on this
industry's accuracy of lab testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: When California Normal conducted ring
testing, which is taking the same sample
[SPEAKER_00]: to different labs, there was wildly
varying results, and they also did the
[SPEAKER_00]: same sample to the same lab at different
times, also with wildly varying results,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's because the labs were not
accredited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that the Bureau of Cannabis Control
is requiring accreditation, or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: applying for accreditation, we're gonna
see less variance in the labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've definitely heard a lot of horror
stories from cultivators, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: who were not getting consistent results,
and those labs were manipulating test
[SPEAKER_00]: results by drying the samples so that they
would score higher and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if the lab tends to have higher THC
results, then more people will start going
[SPEAKER_00]: there, and so I think there's been a lot
of gaming of lab results.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more a function of unsophisticated
consumers who equate potency in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: THC with quality, and it's like,
you know, with alcohol prohibition,
[SPEAKER_00]: people wanted the strongest hooch,
and as we know, the strongest hooch is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably not the most appealing when you
have a choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, nobody goes and buys,
you know, grain alcohol, but you would if
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol was illegal, and so I think that's
a function of cannabis prohibition is the
[SPEAKER_00]: substitution of potency for quality,
and, you know, people were gaming test
[SPEAKER_00]: results, and there's a lot of
inconsistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect that we'll see less variance in
test results over time as people do that
[SPEAKER_00]: ring testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the Bureau of Cannabis Control
would do well to submit the same samples
[SPEAKER_00]: to different labs on different days and
see if the results match up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called ring testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like a term from laboratories.
[SPEAKER_06]: With the knowledge of the testing results
not being consistent, does a cultivator
[SPEAKER_06]: have the option of having another test
done with another facility if their crop
[SPEAKER_06]: fails the test before it's destroyed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: After remediation, yes, but the current
regulations don't allow it, but you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to stay with the first lab for the
second test post remediation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think, Ron?
[SPEAKER_10]: You can test, and that first test doesn't
go in the track and trace system,
[SPEAKER_10]: whereas the subsequent tests do,
so as a cultivator, and if you got good
[SPEAKER_10]: contracts, you'd want to have your product
tested so that if it gets to the
[SPEAKER_10]: distributor and it comes back positive,
you have some recourse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you suggest putting that into,
say, the agreement with the distributor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to do a very quick overview
of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, there is no limitation on how
many specialty small or cottage licenses
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody can stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, the cow cannabis cultivation
licensing will issue one type three
[SPEAKER_00]: license, but because there is no limit on
stacking, there's been a lawsuit filed by
[SPEAKER_00]: the cow growers association because the
EIR for these cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations said we are not going to allow
the consolidation of cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: in the hands of the few, and we want to
have numerous cultivators, so there's
[SPEAKER_00]: current pending litigation on that issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The latest appears to be that there may be
some sort of settlement where the future
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations will have the one-acre cap
that's the hopeful view, and I hope that
[SPEAKER_00]: does happen, but right now, as far as the
license types, it really depends on the
[SPEAKER_00]: local jurisdiction, so Mendocino County,
and correct me if I'm wrong, does not
[SPEAKER_00]: issue licenses for 22,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're capped at 10,000 square feet,
and that is not unlocking the full
[SPEAKER_00]: potential of malcursa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are looking at the state law,
and the type three license is issued in
[SPEAKER_00]: many other jurisdictions, in Salinas,
in Monterey, all over Santa Barbara
[SPEAKER_00]: County, Sonoma County, San Luis Obispo
County, and so there's no reason why there
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be type three licenses in
Mendocino County, and it's something that
[SPEAKER_00]: is not baked into California law.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a feature of the local ordinances,
and I'm so happy that we're now seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: people running for supervisor who
understand the cannabis industry and who
[SPEAKER_00]: are sympathetic and who get it and who are
no longer like the supervisors of old who
[SPEAKER_00]: are trying to stymie cannabis at every
turn, and so the message from malcursa and
[SPEAKER_00]: local control is if you don't run for
public office, then you will be ruled by
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians who simply don't know what
they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not at the table, you're on the
menu.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a type four license called
cultivation, and that doesn't really have,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, square footage limits,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, in Mendocino it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other jurisdictions, there are no
limits to the type four nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Question in the back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, if you were to be in a seed
production, you need male and female
[SPEAKER_09]: plants, and I'm interested if you have a
nursery license, does that mean that you
[SPEAKER_09]: can have an unlimited range of male and
female plants in order to create seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not budding, I think you can,
yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the females have to bud in order to
create the seeds, and the males...
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino is 5,000 square feet of
flowering for genetic expression in seed
[SPEAKER_06]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not baked in a state law.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the current ordinance in Mendocino
County, and once we see successful
[SPEAKER_00]: nurseries, they'll start lobbying for more
realistic limits.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's no, you cannot have flower for
sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know Humble, but if you talk
afterwards and I get your name,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can look into it for you and get back to
you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The type five license is not yet
available, and at this rate, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: scheduled to be issued until 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a part of Prop 64,
so even if some lobbyists try to advance
[SPEAKER_00]: the date to 2021 or 2020, that might be
unconstitutional.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing precluding the California
legislature to pushing that date back or
[SPEAKER_00]: making it a permanent ban on the type five
license, and there's gotta be some
[SPEAKER_00]: pushback at the legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's gotta be people who are
pushing to advance the date for the type
[SPEAKER_00]: five license, and there needs to be
pushback to push back the date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of 2023, what about 2028?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question back there?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, what's the point of a type five if
they're handing out type threes by the
[SPEAKER_07]: dozens to individual companies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good point because of the work
around, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're using like same parcel and
then putting many, many stacking,
[SPEAKER_00]: many other types of licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, maybe the point of a type
five really is for administrative
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much easier to get economy of scale
on a massive grow than to try to replicate
[SPEAKER_00]: that on a whole bunch of smaller grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so somebody who's looking to
consolidate, I think, would want a type
[SPEAKER_00]: five.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you raised a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cultivators can package and label
non-manufactured cannabis that they
[SPEAKER_00]: produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so non-manufactured cannabis products
basically means pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else is non-manufactured?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe Keef?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like, you know, the packaging your
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, break it down into eight,
put it in beautiful packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can package and, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you just need to make sure that you
follow all the rules that apply to
[SPEAKER_02]: packaging and labeling of cannabis
products, which are actually, which are in
[SPEAKER_02]: the regulations from the Department of
Public Health.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where the packaging and labeling
rules are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to kind of cross-reference
those rules to see what your packaging has
[SPEAKER_02]: to be like.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just, we just went through this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look at it for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: It talks about the different license
types.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the graphics that we're showing
you up here, we pulled straight from these
[SPEAKER_02]: agencies' websites.
[SPEAKER_02]: All this information is available for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, the last slide has some
links.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll talk about manufacturing
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So manufacturing of cannabis goods.
[SPEAKER_02]: These operators are going to be licensed
by the Department of Public Health.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we mentioned earlier, they are going
to make cannabis products by way of
[SPEAKER_02]: extractions, infusions, or other methods
of transforming the raw product into a
[SPEAKER_02]: manufactured good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Extraction here means separating
cannabinoids from plant material.
[SPEAKER_02]: This can either be done with solvents,
which can be volatile or non-volatile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically is, you know, likely to blow up
or not likely to blow up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or mechanical methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Infusion, is using plant material or
concentrates to create a cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say you're making edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: You buy cannabis oil that's already been
extracted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to put it into your cookie
dough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are doing an infusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's packaging, which is
putting finished cannabis products into a
[SPEAKER_02]: container and marking them up for sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you have a packaging license
from the Department of Public Health,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can package and label other people's
products for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now there's, we talked about this
earlier, the shared manufacturing
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities licenses that are now
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully that will make licensing
feasible for more mom and pop smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: operators who can't afford a commercial
kitchen of their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can pool their resources now,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm excited to see when those start
being issued.
[SPEAKER_02]: They started accepting applications for
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also talked earlier about the THC
limits on edibles and other manufactured
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't need to go over that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some regular, this is not part
of the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of the manufacturing regulations
issued by the Manufactured Cannabis Safety
[SPEAKER_00]: Branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically for packaging, cannabis,
manufactured cannabis products,
[SPEAKER_00]: they cannot resemble traditional food
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: The packaging has to be opaque.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no more of those beautiful see-through
containers where you can see what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a great example of a
regulation that is onerous to the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Products must also be packaged before
being released to the distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for manufactured cannabis
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the distributors don't really have the
facilities or so the MCSB thinks to
[SPEAKER_00]: conduct sterile packaging operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The packaging must also be tamper evident
and child resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we've seen a proliferation
of wasteful packaging in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it must be resealable if there are
multiple servings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Labeling, the primary panel has to include
the product identity, the THC conduct,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the universal symbol,
which we see on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is meant to identify the products as
originating in California and to deter
[SPEAKER_00]: diversion and detect interstate commerce
in California cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also an information panel,
which includes a list of ingredients and a
[SPEAKER_00]: warning statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the universal identifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product cannot be referred to as
candy, so no more, I wonder what's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: happen to cookies since that's,
we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it cannot be attractive to children.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So distributors are, they play a really
important role in this new supply chain
[SPEAKER_02]: that's been created.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have a distributor in order to
transport products between licensees.
[SPEAKER_02]: There has to be a distribution license at
least once in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to go through a distributor,
if not more than once.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're licensed by the Bureau of
Cannabis Control.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we mentioned, they arrange for lab
testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're checking for proper packaging and
labeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also collecting the taxes on both
ends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're gonna be collecting the
cultivation tax from the cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or in the instance where it goes straight
to a manufacturer, they might have to
[SPEAKER_02]: collect that cultivation tax from a
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they're also, and they're gonna also
collect the excise tax from the retailers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not a tax on the retailers,
but the retailers collect it from the
[SPEAKER_02]: customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And distributors can act as wholesalers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can operate storage facilities if
they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can just do storage for other
operators or other distributors.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can package and label dried cannabis,
but not manufactured cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, all cannabis and cannabis
products must pass through the distributor
[SPEAKER_02]: before being sold to a customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone can apply for a distributor license
except testing labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: In an earlier iteration of the law,
distributors had to be totally
[SPEAKER_02]: independent, but that has since been done
away with.
[SPEAKER_02]: We mentioned earlier the three different
types, full distribution,
[SPEAKER_02]: self-distribution, and transport only.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as well as the fact that distributors
have to register with the Department of
[SPEAKER_02]: Tax and Fee Administration for this
special cannabis tax permit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no tax on distributors.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no tax on distributors at the
state level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different cities and counties might impose
a tax on either all operators or certain
[SPEAKER_02]: operators at different rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe in Mendocino counties,
they have a tax on all operators at the
[SPEAKER_02]: same rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was 2.5?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 2.5%, no matter what type of
operator you are in Mendocino county.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nothing at the state level directly on
distributors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally went to a licensed retailer
in early January.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was close to a 40% effective tax
rate on my purchase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so there is an effort in Sacramento
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bill to lower the taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully the effect will be lowering
taxes on operators and the consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how far along that's gotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing laboratories are licensed by the
Bureau of Cannabis Control, which is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a surprise because initially they were
licensed by the Department of Public
[SPEAKER_00]: Health, which is the logical agency to
regulate testing labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Bureau, I think, wanted to have
more control so that they could adjust the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers and it wouldn't be set more
inflexibly by scientists at the Department
[SPEAKER_00]: of Public Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: The testing labs have to be independent of
other licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a testing laboratory
license, you can only have testing
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're an employee of a testing lab,
you can only work for testing labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot work for other licensees.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a provisional or temporary
testing license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are for labs that meet all the
requirements, but they're awaiting their
[SPEAKER_00]: accreditation pursuant to the
international standards organization
[SPEAKER_00]: 17025.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sampling is required and the minimum or
the maximum batch size is 50 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if there's like a thousand pound
transaction, it must be broken into 20,
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 pound batches and each batch must
individually pass testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many required tests for
cannabinoids, foreign material,
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals, microbial impurities,
mycotoxins, moisture content, residual
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many tests are required.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not required of wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not required of any other
agricultural commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think in retrospect,
it's good that we can get all this like
[SPEAKER_00]: fine grain detail information about
cannabis because future archeologists are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to look at all this data to see the
state of pollution on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the testing will be phased in
throughout 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the certificate of analysis is what
the testing lab issues when a sample
[SPEAKER_00]: passes testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you are a distributor or a
manufacturer or a cultivator, you want the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab to issue the certificate of analysis,
that is the good to go to a retail piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without a certificate of analysis,
the product cannot be transported to a
[SPEAKER_00]: retailer.
[SPEAKER_08]: If a dispensary still has existing
inventory that didn't have to go through
[SPEAKER_08]: the testing requirements after July 1st of
this year, it will all require a
[SPEAKER_08]: certificate of analysis, which means it
has to be collected by a distributor again
[SPEAKER_08]: and then go to testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're in this brief transition period
where basically M and A licensees can work
[SPEAKER_02]: with each other back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't matter, but that's all
going to stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything actually has to be tested
starting on July, you know, 1st.
[SPEAKER_02]: So putting all that aside, we're just
giving you what the rules are for the
[SPEAKER_02]: regular period, not the transition period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of wrapping up, retailers are
licensed by the Bureau of Cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: Control.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is when we talk about dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not called retailers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this includes sales of cannabis,
cannabis products either at a storefront
[SPEAKER_02]: location or by delivery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dispensaries, retailers can no longer
package and label products there on site.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't make the pre-rolls there
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything has to come prepackaged and
ready to be sold when it arrives at the
[SPEAKER_02]: retailer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can conduct sales exclusively by
delivery if they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So mobile, you know, retailers are okay at
the state level.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a lot of cities and counties,
they're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to make sure you're checking
your local rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the retailers collect the state excise
tax from the customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And make sure that gets paid back to the
distributor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they are, no, that's all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're just going to make sure that
tax collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this has to be, and they have to
display on the receipt that the excise tax
[SPEAKER_02]: has been included in the amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's rules about how they have to
display that to the customer if you're a
[SPEAKER_02]: retailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So microbusiness, as we said, has to be
three of the four, cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing, non-volatile, distribution,
or retail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then cannabis event licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's event organizer licenses,
which you need to get in order to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: temporary cannabis event license.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the event license is something,
for example, the Emerald Cup, hopefully,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we're all hoping this year they
will get a temporary cannabis event
[SPEAKER_02]: license.
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, someone behind the scenes has
to get their event organizer license.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has to be approved by your local
jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what they did not do properly
down in San Bernardino.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can have cannabis sales there,
but everyone has to be a retailer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't just have a retailer license
to be selling at one of these temporary
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis events.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no consumption of alcohol or
tobacco on the premises.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can only occur, as of right now,
at a district agricultural association or
[SPEAKER_02]: at a fairground, one of these county or
state fairgrounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a map of the different
California fairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an Assembly Bill 2020 that would
lift this restriction and allow cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: events to occur anywhere that the local
jurisdiction permits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this has to do with collectives and
cooperatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of you might be wondering what
happened to the collective and cooperative
[SPEAKER_02]: law.
[SPEAKER_02]: You thought it was good until next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You thought you were still protected under
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, collectives and
cooperatives, if you are truly part of a
[SPEAKER_02]: collective or cooperative, as it is
defined here on this, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: little page in the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a handout from the Bureau of
Cannabis Control.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless that is the case, you need a
license to be doing commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simply being part of a collective or
cooperative, it'll be, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it could be a defense in court against a
criminal prosecution, but it's not going
[SPEAKER_02]: to protect you against the civil penalties
of, you know, operating a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: business without the proper license,
basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if you're part of a collective or
cooperative, chances are you still need a
[SPEAKER_02]: state license for what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the handout from the Bureau of
Cannabis Control has the lethal words,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would call it at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, you have to comply with all
applicable local rules and ordinances for
[SPEAKER_00]: operating a cannabis collective or
cooperative in that local jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in a banned jurisdiction,
you have to comply with a ban.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the Bureau is saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commercial cannabis activity has an
incredibly broad definition under the
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicinal Adult Use Cannabis Regulation
and Safety Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it makes it difficult to use the
collective or cooperative workaround to
[SPEAKER_00]: engage in commercial cannabis activity
without a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the Bureau calls unlicensed
operators.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, licensees can only conduct
commercial cannabis activity without a
[SPEAKER_02]: licensee.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you find other licensees once
you have a license?
[SPEAKER_02]: This next slide shows you, you need to
search for licensees.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least one way to do it is through these
agencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: The licensing agencies have websites and
you can search for other people who've
[SPEAKER_02]: gotten their license so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can search by county.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can search by type of license.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you would search here and there's basic
contact information or at least a name so
[SPEAKER_02]: you can get in touch with another licensed
operator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here are some resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to check out the different
websites for each of these agencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as one quick stop for all of this
information, just cannabis.ca.gov.
[SPEAKER_02]: The state has set up a really great
resource informational website there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we might have made our time
limit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent job.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much, Omar and Lauren.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
