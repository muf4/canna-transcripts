[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Mark Lefster and I'm going to be
giving a quick overview kind of of the
[SPEAKER_01]: world of controlled environment challenges
that we see moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll touch on some of my own research but
also research of other individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to put up this slide because
these are the factors that ultimately we
[SPEAKER_01]: have to care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've talked about a bunch of these
ones through the sessions up to this
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the past chair of a group known as the
NCR 101.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a controlled environment working
group that's sponsored by the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as such we're trying to develop,
well not standards, we don't work on that
[SPEAKER_01]: directly, but we try to develop
methodologies and patterns and
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations for people to do growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a list of all the different
factors that we consider to be important.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be other ones that need to be
added in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the big claims of the NCR 101 was
that we were the ones that came up with
[SPEAKER_01]: the idea of PAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will see later that maybe we defined
it incorrectly, but that's a bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: larger challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It at least allows us to start talking
about things on the same level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the challenges that I've been
seeing for the last 20 years that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been working in this field is that when we
started in this area most people talk
[SPEAKER_01]: different languages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people would talk about lumens,
foot candles, watts, micromoles,
[SPEAKER_01]: and all these things were being used
interchangeably.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of our goals has been to try to
actually unify so that we can at least
[SPEAKER_01]: compare apples to at least oranges so that
we're not comparing something totally
[SPEAKER_01]: different on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can walk your way through these
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the energy factors,
the water factors, atmospheric factors,
[SPEAKER_01]: earth or substrate, as well as the
structure in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The part that we have the poorest
understanding by far is the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though that's the system that we're
actually trying to allow to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our understanding of what it does and how
it behaves is actually quite poor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we go through energy and light,
I'll show that I think we have a poor
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water, we're okay with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't say we're great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Atmosphere, we're reasonably good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Substrate, still up for debate whether or
not we're quite where we need to be as a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole, but back to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, I argue with a lot of plant
growers specifically because they keep
[SPEAKER_01]: telling me about how they have to improve
the quality of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from my perspective, I'm trying to
improve the quality of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil is just a mechanism for me to
transfer the nutrients and the water and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that is required for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm slowly destroying the soil,
it doesn't bother me because I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: make my plant healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to grow healthy soil,
then don't put plants in it is ultimately
[SPEAKER_01]: what the solution is for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So challenges that we have with the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, specifically in the world of
cannabis, we have a large challenge
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's been illegal for so long that
it's not even really considered a crop in
[SPEAKER_01]: its true sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a plant and it falls in a lot of
categories under that place, but plant
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder rights and legal jurisdiction on
who owns what is still up for debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a variety or a strain or a
chemophore, whatever you want to call it,
[SPEAKER_01]: these aren't protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I grab one of those seeds, it's now
mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it doesn't fall under any legal
category, at least from a Canadian
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, and most places around the
world fall into that same place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike if you're growing wheat,
where there is an actual genetic mapping
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can do and you can identify the
phenotypes that are being present in this
[SPEAKER_01]: and as such, it can actually belong to
somebody so that we can allow for the
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding and the operation of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of the large challenges
that the government is going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: start to challenge or put forward across
both Canada and the United States and
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we get into the whole breeding
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is the same as all other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a plant and they have a bit of a
genetic variation that happens and they
[SPEAKER_01]: like to mutate and modify themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen many plants that you'll have
two branches and one branch is one
[SPEAKER_01]: chemotype and the other branch is a
different chemotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get that with apples where we
do grafting and we see these differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can see those also with the
marijuana or the cannabis strains also.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have the other regulatory
challenges and the actual operational
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So operation diseases, energy and
electricity, which we've been chatting
[SPEAKER_01]: about for the last couple days here,
the economics and the policy and
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately the end products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is it that we're actually after on
these things?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at it from an environmental
standpoint, the light water atmosphere,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that I've talked about,
has to be determined.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we play with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that you'll see in
this slide, which is why I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: highlight that is most people are used to
growing plants with an overhead light
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of LEDs and their lower
temperature, there's nothing that says
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can grow, put lights below or in your
canopy or from the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: We follow the principles of having
overhead lights because the lights were
[SPEAKER_01]: really hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we said, well, we're just going to
mimic the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to stick them up in the roof and
shine it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants really don't care where the photo
photons come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as a photon is coming to it,
it can come from the bottom or from the
[SPEAKER_01]: side or from the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't matter if it comes from an
electrical lighting system or from a solar
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant does not care what a photon is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it is released from the reaction and
a photon is released, the plant will
[SPEAKER_01]: utilize it as it sees fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally we have our production
challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an area where the engineers as
well as a few others have to step up
[SPEAKER_01]: because right now with the amount of
production that we have out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't have enough labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people don't want to go around and do
pruning continuously within their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's relaxing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a whole, this is going to be highly
labor intensive and we just don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: enough labor for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to figure out how to automate a
lot of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm expecting we'll start pushing
these things down where human actually
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't touch the cannabis plant the
moment the seed is put into the ground
[SPEAKER_01]: until it comes out the back end.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have observational or there'll be
computer systems for tracking this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there won't be any human intervention
actually physically touching any of these
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything will be automated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you go through the list,
the drying, trimming, grinding and
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction, all these things have to be
automated.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these things have come from the
underground market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of them are quite good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the big challenges we're going
to have to have is actually trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out which ones are acceptable and
which ones aren't and the policies that
[SPEAKER_01]: need to be put forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this session and the groups that are
involved with this have at least been
[SPEAKER_01]: making these efforts to try to put forward
some of these, but there's still a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: disinformation out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear a lot of growers telling me what
they're planning on doing and I just shake
[SPEAKER_01]: my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in awe that they'd be willing to do
this to a plant and I'll discuss a few of
[SPEAKER_01]: those as we work our way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is my laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk about almost everything that's
in that loop there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of pretty pictures and that's why
I like to hold it up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a quick plug for myself,
the kale plants in the center,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what started my whole PhD world
on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I cared about kale before anyone else
did for some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little did I know that other people would
care about it because when I started
[SPEAKER_01]: people would say, what the heck is kale?
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you can actually buy it as a salad
at McDonald's, which I find even more
[SPEAKER_01]: surreal that we've gone to that state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is kind of an overview of what my
laboratory does, but it's also an overview
[SPEAKER_01]: of the parts that I'm going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the parts that are bolded are how I'm
going to walk my way through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll talk about the history a little
bit and then the research areas that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do work in the post-harvest,
the processing and the monitoring systems
[SPEAKER_01]: out of this and I can talk for a really
long period of time on those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see a little bit as I'm working my
way through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But predominantly the last half will be on
LEDs and the first half will be on other
[SPEAKER_01]: projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the start of controlled environment
basically started, well if you want to go
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way back to the beginning,
was probably the Babylonians period that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually started it with the hanging
garden type systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there has been other efforts along the
way to try to bring it inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the Second World War there was a
big push for this as we were doing island
[SPEAKER_01]: hopping during the Pacific campaign.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so trying to figure out how to grow
plants in places that normally don't grow
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're on a deserted island,
how do you pull this off?
[SPEAKER_01]: After a while it was the Air Force
predominantly that was in control of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Russia did a lot of work with the
biosystems out of this and then NASA kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of took it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if we're ever going to leave Earth
or Earth's orbit we have to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce food for us to actually stay in
those locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first one is the SELS project,
part of the larger bread board project
[SPEAKER_01]: that they had down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a lot of them that has been
tied together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They deal with a very, very small chamber
type system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually at best one meter by one meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a lot of cases we have to worry
about all these different control factors
[SPEAKER_01]: within a very, very tight space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the jokes that I've always said
is that if you give me enough energy I can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow any plant in a thimble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not a joke, we can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just takes a lot of energy to try to
control this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The larger your buffer the less energy you
need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second picture is a plug for
University of Arizona, Gene Giacomelli,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was my master's advisor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they ended up building a growth
chamber that went to the South Pole.
[SPEAKER_01]: The part that's fun about this is
ultimately the food pseudo okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately the people have an affinity for
plants and people love plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that little area that you see in front.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this area in front right here is
actually just two seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of the most popular places at
the South Pole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people have to book it weeks in
advance so that they can sit there and do
[SPEAKER_01]: work or have a supper there so that they
can stare at the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are in the middle of a snowy glacier
for all intents and purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is kind of highlighted
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of tell stories about amongst
ourselves that if you were going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: isolated from the rest of the world for
the rest of your life what's the one
[SPEAKER_01]: organism you take with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me it would be a plant probably
kale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately I know I don't like kale that
much but it's at least one that I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that will survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has its own quirkiness that makes
it interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not one that's more passive like
lettuce which doesn't do very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of a feisty type plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're walking through this is a
bunch of the NASA stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to hang out with anybody
they're kind of fun projects here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked for Orbitek for a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I arrived this was the biomass
production system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It flew on the space shuttle for a couple
missions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the work that we were doing actually
evolved into the veggie plant system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two systems that are sitting on
the space station right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it allows the astronauts to have
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the mandates that came about
through this is the astronauts now mandate
[SPEAKER_01]: that all future human space flight using
NASA technology has to have the ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow plants which for my perspective is
quite cool because used to be that
[SPEAKER_01]: slightly people cared and now people care
a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the fun stories is that when they
tasted the lettuce the first time they
[SPEAKER_01]: said it was some of the best tasting
lettuce or the best tasting lettuce that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've ever had in their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: About a year later they grew kale and they
asked what the kale tasted like and they
[SPEAKER_01]: said it tasted like kale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the further technology that's
happened here is the APH so the advanced
[SPEAKER_01]: plant habitat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these chambers are about a foot and a
half by foot now by foot now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roughly in size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're fairly small and the full
control system for controlling regulating
[SPEAKER_01]: everything like temperature CO2 you name
it is all occurring in that chair that's
[SPEAKER_01]: spot on the side here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the actual chamber.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can do fairly good work and very
controlled spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why I highlight this is usually
the people who are pushing the technology
[SPEAKER_01]: is this side.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of cannabis in the deep
pockets that have been arrived because of
[SPEAKER_01]: that some of the work is now flowing back
the other direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this ebb and flow that's
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the world of geology oil field is the
one that controls the technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: NASA uses it to go explore Mars but then
sometimes Mars technology can come back
[SPEAKER_01]: and help the oil industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from my experience working for a
year in the oil industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I worked on a project called Urban
Barns.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an indoor plant growth system.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was when they were fully up and
running.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our biggest claim to fame was that we were
growing lettuce in under kosher conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: so no insects on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we actually were functional
economically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our last quarter we made 20 bucks and then
they went to funk thereafter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were profitable for one quarter I
can say which I thought was exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So into my type of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did that work to try to make it
economically viable and I realize that as
[SPEAKER_01]: an academic ultimately I suck at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My ideas are usually too cutting edge too
far out there and doesn't always make it
[SPEAKER_01]: to the economic side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think at some point they're all
going to reach that point but I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to ever be the one that will see
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a freeing experience once you
realize that the ideas you have aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: probably going to happen within your own
lifetime because it means I can push on a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of crazy things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the big challenges that we were
talking about was how do we actually deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with the light and between controlled
environments and greenhouse type
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately I ended up building this
greenhouse for the northern space and so
[SPEAKER_01]: it actually has a wall that can actually
move itself up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the summertime it keeps it open
unless it starts getting too hot and then
[SPEAKER_01]: it will close itself up.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the wintertime when there's no light it
closes itself up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can actually use this as a
temperature regulatory and light
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also has some temperature management
systems that also come in on these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can actually see the plants are
growing reasonably happy right on this
[SPEAKER_01]: side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can actually start playing with
these different factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping as we start moving down some
of this lower carbon footprint type that
[SPEAKER_01]: we actually start to evolve technologies
to store heat that's being produced in the
[SPEAKER_01]: daytime and able to use that in the
evening or in the cooler period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's one of the challenges that we
ultimately have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also done work on tropical
greenhouses so trying to develop cooling
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's a fairly standard tropical
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the top roof with a sawtooth
design.
[SPEAKER_01]: Air comes out and flows out through the
top there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up developing a system to actually
cause cooling on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically we use fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cheated if I can call it that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I added a misting system into the
middle of it so it actually causes a
[SPEAKER_01]: coolant loop to actually start to form
naturally within this side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a natural convection loop system
using just water out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The advantage of it is I can chill down
the greenhouse to about five degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: cooler than outside ambient temperatures
and it allows you to actually maintain
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why I'm highlighting this is
one because I did it and I think it's kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of cool technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the second thing is is that I find
that there's a lot of growers both in the
[SPEAKER_01]: tomato industry as well as the cannabis
that are resistant to trying new ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sometimes you have to set aside 10%
of your greenhouse or your growth area and
[SPEAKER_01]: just try new technology and see if it
works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't say all of them work but there is
places that we need to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to be the big huge canopy or
aurora or such like that, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they should have their own branch that
are doing these technologies to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: test some of these parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also worked on watering and control
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as part of one of these we actually
developed an automated monitoring system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was basically a camera that stared
at a fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the fruit grew, you can actually see
the fruit in the center right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has a web camera sitting right
there, the fruit sitting in the middle
[SPEAKER_01]: here and we're just taking pictures of the
fruit as it slowly continues to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have done this work in the past but
they usually use tensometers or calipers
[SPEAKER_01]: to try to measure them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We measured it about every couple seconds
as it was growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the part that's kind of fun about this
is we can actually see the growth pattern
[SPEAKER_01]: as it moves itself up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from 55 millimeters as it moves up to
55 and a half and you can slowly see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a resolution of fractions of a
millimeter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is like basically 130 seconds of
an inch kind of side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very, very fine changes that can occur
on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in some cases we can track this as
normal healthy growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case we actually are in drought
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not pumping enough water into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the case that we found in one
situation is my student actually was doing
[SPEAKER_01]: a test.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came back and I started looking at the
data and I go, something's wrong with your
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he goes, no, no, everything's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about 10 minutes later I came back and
I looked at it and I go, the plant's still
[SPEAKER_01]: shrinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fruit's still shrinking in size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he walked back out there and
realized that he had unplugged the pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we missed one watering cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was fast enough to watch one missed
watering cycle, which is literally in our
[SPEAKER_01]: system it was a one hour period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And drought conditions usually at best is
three hours, typically six to 12 hours is
[SPEAKER_01]: when most people will observe this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the technology ability of using web
cameras, which is fairly basic,
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed us to be able to monitor missing
one watering cycle or missing one system
[SPEAKER_01]: that we were, so if the nozzle was plugged
we can actually start to track these
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the funky things that we found
about this, and I have no good explanation
[SPEAKER_01]: for this, is we started seeing this
oscillation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the plant was growing or the fruit
was growing it was oscillating up and
[SPEAKER_01]: down, up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not a very big oscillation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like less than a one-thirty second
of an inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a very small oscillation and it
wasn't making sense why this was
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we zoomed in on one of these things and
it basically was telling us that as I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: watering my tomato fruit for some reason
it shrinks, which makes no sense
[SPEAKER_01]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you add water things should expand.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's up taking the water and should
go through an expansion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why I'm highlighting this
is it tells me that we know nothing about
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that the plants are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that they're growing and they're
going to continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I backtrack on that you can see that
they're continuing to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's all this data buried in that
we just call noise, which isn't actually
[SPEAKER_01]: noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's useful information.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just too stupid to understand what
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through technology, AI, and all these
other things maybe we'll start to figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out what the plant is trying to tell us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They speak a language.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just suck at understanding what that
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we will slowly start to figure this
thing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So other fun projects that I've worked on
and I am continuing to work on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a porous concrete type
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually took, we're not using
Portland cement.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using actually a steel slag out of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm growing grass on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The part that's kind of fun about it is
it's a pH between eight to 10 pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody says that you should grow
between five and a half and six and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our research is showing that you can grow
up to eight without any problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean that we have to change our
nutrient ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the next one you can see that our
ratios are being changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a standard rockwool cube,
which is sitting right around that six and
[SPEAKER_01]: a half normal is where it starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our three different porous concrete
cubes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had to go to a double nutrient
solution to get the same kind of size out
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference is that this is quite an
elongated leaf and elongated stem system.
[SPEAKER_01]: While this is more dwarf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can actually start to control by
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a calcium effect as well as
a bit of a nutrient effect that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: starts to play on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it has a lot of other applications
more than just the controlled environment
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it allows us to actually start to push
these boundaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So working on carbon dioxide enrichment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can also do CO2 enrichment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of our projects is using
biomass as a heating system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We heard yesterday most people have to
compost or landfill most of the residues
[SPEAKER_01]: from the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can start doing anaerobic digestion
that'd be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my cases I'm just wanting to burn the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I could recycle them almost
directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm producing a lot of CO2 through
the combustion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately my goal is why can't I use
that same CO2 over and over again to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually grow the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So theoretically you can be carbon zero at
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually you could go negative in some
cases if you can manage this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of regulatory
requirements for them to actually get to
[SPEAKER_01]: this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know in the island of Montreal
they've actually got to the point where
[SPEAKER_01]: they actually tell us we're not supposed
to be burning any wood because it causes
[SPEAKER_01]: too much emissions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I developed this technology which
basically pulls all particles out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's basically a great big
electrostatic precipitator type system
[SPEAKER_01]: that can pull stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as such it's quite good at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hopeful that the government at
some point will allow me to start to use
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's still in its earlier stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully in the next couple years it
will start to reach itself out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to jump into light now which
is ultimately what my main baby is and
[SPEAKER_01]: what I work on predominantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about these basically the
different wavelengths and the different
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum that comes about from these.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you see here this is our big solar
output.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody says LEDs if it's blue it's
blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my standard statements.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see that we have a full width
half medium which is actually fairly wide
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which actually means in some cases we can
get up to 150 nanometer width.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this causes a lot of issues because
ultimately we're averaging over the 150
[SPEAKER_01]: and getting the plant response as we move
across that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not playing with hyper narrow
wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're dealing with slightly narrow
wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what's the impact if we try to go
even more narrow out of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what a lot of my research is
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw the slide before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the whole wavelength that we have
we talk about the green gap space here
[SPEAKER_01]: lower productivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately because of our phosphorus
coated systems that we have we can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually produce a bunch of light within
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My gap that I talked about last time is
right in that 680 to 700 seems to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people don't seem to care about it
which is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But me as a researcher hey if people don't
care about it it's usually a good place to
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so trying to figure out how we can
actually see what the responses of these
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that the technology has been
slowly improving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I stole this from Morgan Patterson with
his permission of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's done a lot of work on how much
is the efficacy and the output of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're slowly improving on
efficiency of the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can see blue is slowly creeping
up to be the maximum output.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red systems also are improving.
[SPEAKER_01]: He added amber because I've been ranting
about it for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's still a long ways up but it does
have the theoretical capability of being
[SPEAKER_01]: just as efficient as everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might be dead before this happens but it
will be getting up to that point at some
[SPEAKER_01]: place there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can see the other kind of
lights and their efficiency that come
[SPEAKER_01]: about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why this matters is ultimately
we're trying to fit different pegs into
[SPEAKER_01]: different holes and they aren't always a
perfect fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that efficiency is one of the
things we're chasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately we also have to be aware of
how the plants actually respond to a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our standard system that we use is our
basically metal halide HPS system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fluorescent is still a good system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just don't get an exceedingly high
light output out of most traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: fluorescent systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: White LEDs which are basically the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are getting a better system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I usually recommend to people to stay
in that place and LEDs are used for other
[SPEAKER_01]: secondary applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll explain why I make that statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's our standard McCree curve that
everybody's familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the whole hog engine
system that he also did it as a mapping
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a bunch of older technology that
they use for these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was done back in the 1970s before
LEDs came along.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of been the standard on how
we're going to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and most people looked at this
chlorophyll pigment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have our chlorophyll A is the dark
coloration here and our chlorophyll B is
[SPEAKER_01]: the lighter green coloration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we looked at it and say well they kind
of line up with this peak here and they
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of line up with this peak here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we look across at the bottom here
they don't really line up on that shoulder
[SPEAKER_01]: and this edge doesn't seem to line up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how come we have fairly good
efficiencies when we play here which is
[SPEAKER_01]: good because it lines up with chlorophyll
A but then we play in this area and it
[SPEAKER_01]: still grows plants exceedingly well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I come down to the green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get quite as good a result.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I was a student I looked at this
and goes we don't understand the system
[SPEAKER_01]: and everybody goes no no no it's well
explained.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pigments cause photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I look at the different kind of systems
I can choose LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the first LEDs that people
played with was actually that 680 LED does
[SPEAKER_01]: not work well at growing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get long spindly plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody likes them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost destroyed the LED industry
initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ten years later then we end up with our
660.
[SPEAKER_01]: 640 started coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: People started being quite positive to
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Few tests were done on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people have never really grown larger
scale with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it falls in that nice little peak area
where that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't we do more work with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The short answer is no one has.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look at metal halide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fairly broad spectrum across it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot more blue but still has a fair bit
in that amber coloration lacking in the
[SPEAKER_01]: red as opposed to HPS which is very amber
driven on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of blue and a bit more red
than we actually see in the metal halide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people like HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bruce Bugby and the crew at Utah have done
a lot of work trying to figure out what
[SPEAKER_01]: these different sensors are.
[SPEAKER_01]: The different systems within the plant
based.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a paper of his in Nature that
was published two years ago or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can actually see these are the
standard LEDs that I've shown you before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we actually have all the pigments
that are within plants and the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: responses of the human eye systems also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with this it makes it look like
there's a lot of sensors that are present
[SPEAKER_01]: on this and they have the ability to
actually monitor these different
[SPEAKER_01]: wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are very slight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm at very dim light conditions I
get a fairly strong response out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm not sitting at dim light conditions
I go to bright light conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swamp out that and I actually don't get
any of the responses at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then human eye response and then our
different plant responses and overlaying
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that the amber kind of follows
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry the HPS follows the amber spot
that's right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are kind of the some of the
conclusions that were made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the things that I've been
pushing for for quite a period of time is
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that within the cannabis world
we've had this idea that red light is very
[SPEAKER_01]: good for flowering and blue light is very
good for vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done a lot of literature review.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done a lot of my own studies on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of studies on this both on cannabis
as well as other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is a plant that behaves like all
other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that is is up for debate but it is a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as such in most of our cases we
find red light drives photosynthesis and
[SPEAKER_01]: blue light is used as a stress response
induction system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the sensory system which causes
the plant to be aware that it should start
[SPEAKER_01]: to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's different mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have purely red it will still
flower but it's because of a saturation of
[SPEAKER_01]: energy that starts to occurring and the
plant goes okay I'm just happy fat enough
[SPEAKER_01]: that I can now start to go to this
flowering period.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can use my my blue for actually
induction of these flowering quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bruce Bugby has also published this paper
which just came out actually a few days
[SPEAKER_01]: ago which is based on the Emerson effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So up to this point par has been between
400 and 700.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came along and says well if I start
adding my far red light into this I can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually induce better yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if I measure it based purely on a
par response I basically am increasing my
[SPEAKER_01]: yield in this lettuce under 400 micro
moles of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if I but if I take it and change my
par to 750 now it starts behaving like a
[SPEAKER_01]: normal curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge that happens with this is if
I give only far red my plants will not
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Emerson effect is this combined effect
of other wavelengths of light with the far
[SPEAKER_01]: red light.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I provide just far red light I'm not
going to get a positive response.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to have the two light system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're using it as kind of an
induction to say let's get my plants woken
[SPEAKER_01]: up by giving it some far red.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting a little bit of red because
of the tails that happen on these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately it's not completely driven
by that system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's saying that basically some of our
units of measure might be incorrect which
[SPEAKER_01]: makes for a lot of people to pull out
their hair because we've been staying with
[SPEAKER_01]: 400 to 700 of the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So work that I've been working on which I
think is kind of fun is we've been looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at really high intensity type light
systems and different locations and how
[SPEAKER_01]: intense we can get up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case we're getting up to about
1400 micro moles of light and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at what the growth rate was at
different wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking at our amber.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at our red and we're looking
at our blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is on tomato which is one of our
model plants out of this and you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: blue light seems to be non responsive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a bit of a yield increase as I
start to increase and then it seems to
[SPEAKER_01]: flat line out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were small plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand it's not full growth out of
this one but my red light actually gets a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice bell curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything over a thousand for red
basically is starting to cause negative
[SPEAKER_01]: growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actually causing light saturation
on the plant and so going above that isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I go for amber light, pure amber light,
then it actually seems to maximize at
[SPEAKER_01]: about that 800 and it starts to drop off
after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I start combining these then it starts
doing a whole bunch of funky stuff and we
[SPEAKER_01]: get those kind of linear responses that
we're expecting to see out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So different morphology out of all of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually see amber though causes
some photo bleaching systems on this and
[SPEAKER_01]: so we have to understand why those are
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I do the same tests on lettuce I can
see amber causes my maximum growth rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red out of the system and then my combined
as my blue so slightly better responses
[SPEAKER_01]: for my lettuce relative to my other
pigments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean my other wavelengths that are
working on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The part that I find kind of fun is that
depending on how you grow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is varying intensities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have very small smaller plants to my
large plants but then I get my whole
[SPEAKER_01]: anthracine and pigment accumulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can get into very very dark
colorations, high high anthracine
[SPEAKER_01]: accumulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I make the statement that
blue induces a lot of photo pigments as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as other parts of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I jump ahead here to my amber
you can see that I actually are getting in
[SPEAKER_01]: that photo bleaching type system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm actually causing destruction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But under the combined coloration I'm
actually getting depending on what my
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio is I can start changing a lot of the
phytochemicals that are present within
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here's just a quick summary of them
which I think is kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: As kind of the last part that I have for
the last three minutes before the
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately we've done some work on amber
amber wavelengths and just started to
[SPEAKER_01]: filter these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually took different wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: So five nine five and just put a notch
filter in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did a six fifteen and did an
end filter on this to try to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: control what happens if I shift my
wavelength slightly within this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the resultant out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So five nine five fairly normal looking to
a compact plant by going to a six or
[SPEAKER_01]: three.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just literally taking a notch out of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I do the same basically
overlaying the other wavelengths out of
[SPEAKER_01]: that I end up with this intensity is the
exact same wavelength is shifted in some
[SPEAKER_01]: cases three to five nanometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that caused that large of a
differential of the response of how the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back to that statement I said we don't
understand what plants are up to here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're trying to figure out how
these are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when somebody says I tested at my
location and I got this response but I
[SPEAKER_01]: tested at a different location and I got a
different response.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible it was a temperature
differential which caused a difference in
[SPEAKER_01]: your I'm not saying temperatures and
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying temperature of your bulb caused
a two to three nanometer shift of the wave
[SPEAKER_01]: output and you are getting that response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to start to figure out how
these shifts are happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from a policy standpoint if we're
saying we're chasing always the most
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient it might not be the most
efficient for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can see our fresh weight and
our photosynthetic rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do a lot of photosynthetic
measurement on this and you can see these
[SPEAKER_01]: two are quite similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they result in a different result and
very high photosynthetic rates here but
[SPEAKER_01]: not very good growth rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we need to try to separate those
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So main takeaways of this science is a
poor understanding of plants and base of
[SPEAKER_01]: many of the assumptions are incorrect.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to come to NCR 101 I'll rip a
few more things apart at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not willing to do it quite here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to have a better understanding
of how plants evolve into these
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean that we don't have a good
ability to grow the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just don't have a good explanation on
why it's doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Individual wavelengths can be both
positive, negative and neutral.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in some cases we find them very
detrimental but in some cases very
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then ultimately I'm a big supporter of
Amber which giving plugs to companies that
[SPEAKER_01]: use broad spectrum lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a fan of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are interested in any of these
things I am part of almost all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well with the exception of ASHRAE.
[SPEAKER_01]: So NCR 101 which does a lot of standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: ASAB which did the plug before so thank
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as we're also trying to well DLC
also is a group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then SEEDS we're trying to work on
trying to set up standards for controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: environment across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anybody's interested in that
there's a few of us here that actually are
[SPEAKER_01]: on that committee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so trying to figure out what the
standards should be or how we can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: monitor and work these things forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all my acknowledgments for this
was from the main people that have worked
[SPEAKER_01]: on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this set of slides with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everybody that's in my lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a fairly large lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm willing to take some questions for
like I have a couple of minutes at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's known as Darth Vader.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an asteroid that landed near my
father's farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to go see it's at the
University of Alberta.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also love that little island there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's six sheep that hang out on a
coast of Scotland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's the epitome of controlled
environment because they can't go
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bring a boat in and then they have to
go grab them before they jump in the ocean
[SPEAKER_01]: and drown because they're full of wool at
that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you bring two boats in a few dogs and
then try to herd them together and get
[SPEAKER_01]: them off the island once a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate a little more
recommendations on the policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of dipped into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the one challenge that we have and so
I'm actually so I'm in Montreal which is
[SPEAKER_01]: part of Quebec and we have really cheap
electricity rates there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hover is between I've heard as low as like
three point two cents per kilowatt hour to
[SPEAKER_01]: as high as five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ontario goes above that obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're probably not going to have much
restrictions on power usage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here in California or Massachusetts
when they put on a restriction of some
[SPEAKER_01]: power I'm actually quite happy about it
because it means Montreal will export to
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys is what I'm after.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the challenge that we have
ultimately is that some of this technology
[SPEAKER_01]: for the amber sucks at efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you saw that on the slides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're putting in barriers we're
going to be testing them elsewhere which
[SPEAKER_01]: might be good because it's not a bleeding
edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just you're waiting for the new
technologies to come along.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there has to be a mechanism set up in
place to allow for new technologies that
[SPEAKER_01]: have the potential of being even better
down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until we get to that point it's hard
to make that full final recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the idea of a framework.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that the seeds group that I'm
working with we're wanting to do a ranking
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So high medium or low or bronze silver
gold however you want to rank them good
[SPEAKER_01]: better best type system so that and if
it's just power I think water electricity
[SPEAKER_01]: for light HVAC systems are three separate
systems and they should all be kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: grouped together but also allowed to be
worked independent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to focus on a high
efficiency LED but don't want to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: other stuff you should be allowed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the challenges that's
happening with the current policy is that
[SPEAKER_01]: people will cheat on one system versus the
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think all of them have to be
considered in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doctor for a given intensity of light does
the evapotranspiration change by spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that's a we're working a lot on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can change stomata opening and
closure by doing wavelength selection on
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So green light predominantly will close
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we still grow quite a happy healthy
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of the challenge is also leaf
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on the wavelength you're
using can control leaf temperature and
[SPEAKER_01]: stomata opening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just at the early stages of
having a good understanding of how these
[SPEAKER_01]: things are interplaying with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be perfectly honest we don't know why
stomata open or close.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have ideas we know that wavelengths
can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know temperature can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of factors but there has
to be some underlining mechanisms that
[SPEAKER_01]: will do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have a strong understanding
of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can control that and we should.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't mean that I'd say that you
should be betting the farm on that
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the amber LED did you look into the
efficacy on the plants of using the amber
[SPEAKER_03]: LEDs itself versus phosphorus converted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've done we have done both.
[SPEAKER_01]: The phosphorus coated is it has quite a
high efficiency out of it or efficacy out
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're comparable to almost every
other system that's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They play with the HPS as efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing narrow spectrum which is
what those last wavelengths were where
[SPEAKER_01]: we're filtering them down they suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so but I personally think they have a
greater potential of changing the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: than the broad spectrum does.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge is that I can't say with
certainty how that's going to play out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
