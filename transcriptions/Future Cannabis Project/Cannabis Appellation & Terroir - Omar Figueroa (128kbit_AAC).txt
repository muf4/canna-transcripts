[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're here with my friend Omar
Figueroa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Omar is the principal at the law offices
of Omar Figueroa.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been in the cannabis industry for
probably the last 25 or so years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a huge amount of fascinating
stories to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I please do hope that everybody that's
listening up to us today looks him up
[SPEAKER_01]: offline.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was going to ask him about his
background in the industry, we'd go on for
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 minutes just in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really just wanted to jump straight
into the topics that we're really
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Omar, how did you get interested in this
Appalachians project and sort of what
[SPEAKER_01]: brought you to us and to this point here
today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so I'm interested in Appalachians
because I see that as a way for craft
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cultivators to survive by
producing ultra premium products,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same as wine Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same as cheese Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really a way to honor the
specific geographical characteristics of a
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's also a way to honor the heritage
of craft cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're talking about the
heritage of craft cannabis, what would a
[SPEAKER_01]: system of Appalachians mean to some of
those legacy producers that have been in
[SPEAKER_01]: this industry for decades that maybe have
been on the wrong side of the law at
[SPEAKER_01]: certain points?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now are struggling to make a living.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would Appalachians do something for that
legacy culture, those legacy communities
[SPEAKER_01]: up in Northern California?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I think it would incentivize more to
transition into the licensed part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is because the only licensed
cultivators can apply, can submit a
[SPEAKER_00]: petition to establish a new Appalachian
under the proposed regulations in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this new world of Appalachians is
of course going to be limited to regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the cache of many cannabis
producing regions, which is worldwide,
[SPEAKER_00]: once there's an opportunity to put an
Appalachian on it and an identifier,
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of designation or seal,
I think that's super exciting for people
[SPEAKER_00]: who used to be persecuted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why they went to the Emerald
Triangle, which is composed of Mendocino,
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt, and Trinity counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're celebrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this celebration of their heritage,
I think, will incentivize people to come
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the legacy duty-free market,
some call it the black market,
[SPEAKER_00]: and go into the regulated cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned that sort of dynamic
between the historic illicit markets and
[SPEAKER_01]: those legacy markets and the current
regulated cannabis markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you just explain a little bit more
how having an Appalachian and sort of what
[SPEAKER_01]: that means for consumers, how that would
help those farmers compete more
[SPEAKER_01]: effectively against those illicit markets?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely by having like officially
recognized Appalachians, which will be a
[SPEAKER_00]: shorthand for a particular type of market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that will give an edge to the
struggling farmers in the regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis world who have been competing
against growers who don't have to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: taxes, don't have to pay licensing fees,
don't have to worry about regulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: and don't have to worry about testing
their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can use every type of pesticide,
fungicide, and herbicide that they wish
[SPEAKER_00]: without restriction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think once consumers realize that
cannabis from an Appalachian denotes not
[SPEAKER_00]: just geographical origin, but also
particular standards, practices,
[SPEAKER_00]: and cultivars, I think that consumers will
naturally be attracted to products bearing
[SPEAKER_00]: an Appalachian of origin designation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned that it's not just a
geographical indicator, that there are
[SPEAKER_01]: other aspects of how a plant is
cultivated, of what types of different
[SPEAKER_01]: substances are used on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give us an idea of sort of the
range of different inputs that we could
[SPEAKER_01]: have in a set of definitions of
Appalachian?
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether that does apply to the
chemicals, the pesticides that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using, how that would define sort of what
those practices are that we would want to
[SPEAKER_01]: communicate to ultimate consumers about
how their farmers are cultivating their
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there's a lot of flexibility in the
proposed regulations which require the
[SPEAKER_00]: petitioner who is proposing the
establishment of a new Appalachian to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify not simply a geographical area,
but particular practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the practices could be like a
practice like not using pesticides,
[SPEAKER_00]: not using herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could also be practices such as plant
by the light of the moon, plant in the new
[SPEAKER_00]: moon, harvest in the full moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those could be like practices as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as standards, and standards are
interpreted more to mean something like
[SPEAKER_00]: clean green certification or biodynamic
demeter certification or other standards
[SPEAKER_00]: that the petitioners of a new Appalachian
can propose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of like Chardonnay or
Champagne, which are particular varietals
[SPEAKER_00]: of grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the idea of having a geographical
region with a particular varietal of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: An example would be like Blue Dream in
say, Tomkai.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomkai region in Mendocino County is near
Redwood Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so an example of that would be Tomkai
Blue Dream, which would just simply
[SPEAKER_00]: specify a varietal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another option would be Tomkai Biodynamic
Demeter Certified, which would be
[SPEAKER_00]: specifying geographical region as well as
a standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it could be Tomkai hand cultivated and
everything had to be done by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be specifying particular
practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're applying for an
Appalachian, you said that the petitioners
[SPEAKER_01]: would have to apply to a certain body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under the CDFA regulations, who is the
application made to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a county-based application,
a city-based application?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a statewide to apply to the CDFA?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the application is submitted to
CDFA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to help make its decision,
the CDFA can appoint a petition review
[SPEAKER_00]: panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the petition review panel is supposed
to be composed of people with particular
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise in the area of Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_00]: One criticism of the proposed regulations
is that there's no time frame for
[SPEAKER_00]: decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no reconsideration of a
decision or appeal from a decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, technically a petition
could be submitted and then it could take
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 years for them to decide on it because
there's really nothing that incentivizes
[SPEAKER_00]: prompt review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we are proposing as members of
the INCBA would be procedural protections
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we can have review and so that the
process, you know, is also more
[SPEAKER_00]: predictable to those who are submitting
applications or petitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned that as one aspect of
sort of controversy within the set of
[SPEAKER_01]: proposed regulations coming out of the
CDFA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there other aspects of the
regulations, either procedural aspects
[SPEAKER_01]: like the lack of a timed review in which
you can expect to answer in an X number of
[SPEAKER_01]: days?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there other either procedural issues
that you have with the CDFA regulations or
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps there are substantive issues where
a term or a set of terms hasn't been
[SPEAKER_01]: adequately defined?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there other pieces of it that was sort
of we see troubles with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we want a longer public notice
period so that the public has a greater
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't have to be constantly
checking to see if a new petition has been
[SPEAKER_00]: submitted because it's going to be a long
enough comment period that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can check every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to check every single week
because if you don't check every single
[SPEAKER_00]: week, you know, then things could get...
somebody could submit an petition for the
[SPEAKER_00]: establishment of an appellation that is
really wholly objectionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: With regard to, you know, ways to improve
the process, the INCBA Appellation
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcommittee has identified ways to make
this whole process more accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, the way they are proposing to
fund the whole cannabis appellations
[SPEAKER_00]: program is with a one-time fee of
approximately $20,000 to file a petition
[SPEAKER_00]: to establish a new appellation of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this $20,000 is supposed to fund the
cannabis appellation program in
[SPEAKER_00]: perpetuity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're proposing instead would be a
more reasonable filing fee, like say half
[SPEAKER_00]: of that $10,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every 10 years, there could be
like a renewal fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would accomplish the objective of
funding the cannabis appellation program
[SPEAKER_00]: in perpetuity, but it would not establish
such high barriers to entry that
[SPEAKER_00]: struggling farmers who are now competing
with unregulated, unlicensed, and untaxed
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators, it would allow them,
you know, the financial flexibility to
[SPEAKER_00]: submit an application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've had really constructive
discussions with the INCBA Appellation
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcommittee, and there are many brilliant
lawyers who are really like donating a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of their expertise and their time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have been formulating some
pretty well-thought out comments that are
[SPEAKER_00]: neutral on certain policy positions that
are controversial and that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're just noticing the policy
differences, but there's certain
[SPEAKER_00]: procedural recommendations that I think
everybody would agree with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we're gonna be making those
recommendations and hopefully the board
[SPEAKER_00]: can consider them and, you know,
perhaps this will be something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: INCBA will take, you know, establishing
the first appellations for cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: history is a momentous occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're lucky that so many members are
really an integral part of that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're really excited to be a part of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, thankful to you,
Omar, you sit on our board.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have countless attorneys that have
contributed so much time to this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had mentioned that, sorry,
let me just catch up to my thought on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had mentioned that the fee structure
seems both over burdensome and inadequate,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's sort of on both sides,
it's lacking a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under the proposed fee structure,
it seems like the burden to establish an
[SPEAKER_01]: appellation would fall on the farmers that
need it the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe the ones that are under the most
financial duress at times certainly like
[SPEAKER_01]: this one that we're in right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, my understanding is that
anyone could then take advantage of that
[SPEAKER_01]: appellation as long as they adhere to the
standards that the appellation sets forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so could you tell us a little bit
about the dynamics of maybe having a group
[SPEAKER_01]: of 10 farmers from the Eel River apply for
an appellation around the Eel River and
[SPEAKER_01]: then having sort of a different set of
people come in and take advantage of that
[SPEAKER_01]: appellation is that a concern that we
should have here that perhaps the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that are funding the appellation's
oversight committee aren't necessarily the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that are able to take advantage of
this in the long term?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point that you bring in
because they would have to be within the
[SPEAKER_00]: same geographical region and then also
adhere to the same standards, practices,
[SPEAKER_00]: or cultivars that are specified for the
appellation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's gonna be a piggybacking
problem, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you say only those who submitted
the petition can use the appellation,
[SPEAKER_00]: that also seems unfair and short-sighted
because as with wine appellations,
[SPEAKER_00]: many of these wine appellations were
established decades ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the companies and the
individuals who initially proposed those
[SPEAKER_00]: wine appellations, they are no longer in
the wine business.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've sold their businesses or they
passed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think we do have a free rider
problem with people piggybacking and that
[SPEAKER_00]: is a problem that many growers are facing,
which is growers are thinking like,
[SPEAKER_00]: why should I be the one to invest all this
time and money in establishing a new
[SPEAKER_00]: appellation when others, the free riders
behind me will come along and try to cash
[SPEAKER_00]: in on my appellation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the better question is like,
how do you enforce the standards or the
[SPEAKER_00]: practices or the cultivars for the
appellation?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you keep other licensed growers
from claiming the appellation but not
[SPEAKER_00]: really adhering to the standards,
practices, or cultivars and therefore
[SPEAKER_00]: diluting the goodwill associated with that
particular appellation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are really good questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And questions I'm sure that we'll get into
in depth on April 2nd, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I'm very excited about is that
while we were brainstorming, we came up
[SPEAKER_00]: with the idea of having a seal that
identifies official cannabis appellations
[SPEAKER_00]: in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And initially, I proposed having two
seals, one official seal that said
[SPEAKER_00]: official California cannabis appellation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have the fancy, you know,
like what's it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: The outer ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like the apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like the European seals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there would be a second seal that
would be proposed and it would have a
[SPEAKER_00]: uniform design element on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the inside, the proponent or
the petitioner would have their own design
[SPEAKER_00]: that they would propose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like that idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, you know, it seems like
real estate when it comes to packaging and
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling in such short supply that it's
not practical to really have two seals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Mary Shapiro has suggested just
having the one seal, which would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: outer ring would have a uniform design
element, which would probably say official
[SPEAKER_00]: California cannabis appellation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the inside, it would be like
blank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the proponent could propose their
own design and they would have their own
[SPEAKER_00]: creativity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there would be a small,
modest fee to use that official seal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would also help fund the cannabis
appellations program, because the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulations are structured currently
is they basically want to fund the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis appellations program in
perpetuity.
[SPEAKER_00]: By having really high fees at the
beginning and then no fees ever,
[SPEAKER_00]: ever after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that to me sounds like a recipe for
establishing a program that will end up
[SPEAKER_00]: withering away for lack of funding and
just kind of dying into irrelevance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are making several proposals for
establishing different sources of funding,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, such as having like,
you know, renewals for appellations every
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to pay a little bit more
money to keep that appellation current.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, like having an official seal
would incentivize official enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: against misuse, because now anybody who is
counterfeiting that seal is misusing an
[SPEAKER_00]: official seal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there would also be a value to
the producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would be happy to pay some money to
use the seal because they know that the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of California now has an interest
and is willing to allocate its resources
[SPEAKER_00]: towards enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited about this idea that
we all collectively came up with of having
[SPEAKER_00]: an official seal for cannabis appellations
that can be put on cannabis products and
[SPEAKER_00]: can help identify cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, that sounds like a great
idea from a couple of different
[SPEAKER_01]: perspectives, obviously, from the official
seal use and sort of having an
[SPEAKER_01]: interlocking type of seal that had that,
you know, that idea that this was
[SPEAKER_01]: sanctioned by the state and then had the
more specific sort of logo in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, you mentioned the
problem with funding enforcement of this
[SPEAKER_01]: going forward, you know, and if
enforcement does fall to the CDFA,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we hear and for those of us that
have seen the development of appellations,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we're aware that the wine and
the cheese industries have spent tens of
[SPEAKER_01]: millions of dollars enforcing these very
specific marks that become very valuable
[SPEAKER_01]: over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without that enforcement mechanism,
and without adequately funding that
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement mechanism, the appellation
really doesn't mean much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love that idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first time that I've heard of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you know, this idea of sort of
an interlocking seal would certainly go
[SPEAKER_01]: towards both of those points.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, current recognition of the
appellation and potential future funding
[SPEAKER_01]: of enforcement and continuing the program
and into perpetuity because that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: idea is that we're going to set this up
and $20,000 today isn't going to do much
[SPEAKER_01]: for enforcement in, you know, 20 years
down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The money's just going to be sitting in
like some, you know, state fund.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be like, you know,
sitting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to go towards the government
bailout, the cruise ship industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: Omar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be in the cruise ship pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Omar, thank you so much for chatting
with us this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really excited about this event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for continuing to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though we're doing it online instead
of in person, we're trying to recreate
[SPEAKER_01]: some of those wonderful things that we get
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do in person while we're going through
this difficult time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really appreciate your continued
support and we're really excited to speak
[SPEAKER_01]: to you on April 2nd.
[SPEAKER_00]: So am I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for doing this, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay safe everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
