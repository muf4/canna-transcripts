[SPEAKER_01]: Are you seeing pockets of material in
Africa that still goes back in time,
[SPEAKER_01]: like that hasn't had the Dutch
infiltration?
[SPEAKER_01]: See, like when I was over in Hawaii in the
mid-80s, it was the last of the Southeast
[SPEAKER_01]: Asian varietals grown in the cane fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I go there and I get to experience
some world-class cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was perfect because the soils,
the climate all matched up with those type
[SPEAKER_01]: of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you had this incredible
combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I go back years and years later,
and I got this white kid that's telling me
[SPEAKER_01]: about, you need to check out the Aloha
White Widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, that's not what I'm
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for the Cambodian that used to
grow out here, that used to take top your
[SPEAKER_01]: head off, make you almost pee your pants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to sit on the toilet, smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, oh no, no, you want the
White Widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, no, I don't want the White
Widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what the White Widow's like.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I want is the things that were from
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did Africa have the ability to hold
material in constant?
[SPEAKER_01]: As someone who's discovering stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because to me, I'm like, Afghanistan got
hammered.
[SPEAKER_01]: All over Asia got hammered from war.
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa had so much war and famine and
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you're mining material, are you still
able to mine some of that killer stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: from the past?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting polluted quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in, this last year, went through
Ethiopia and then the Seychelles Islands
[SPEAKER_00]: right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's even finding these old land races
where all of a sudden it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, these guys were here from Amsterdam a
couple years ago and we have a White Widow
[SPEAKER_00]: mango that we open pollinated with all our
land race stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of a sudden, what's happening is
it's harder and harder to find from
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was years ago, Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I traveled through Vietnam, Cambodia,
Lao Thailand area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even that was mid-90s and you're
still running across places where people
[SPEAKER_00]: had brought other genetics in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one thing going back in this
diversification and being able to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: things from the origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Southeast Asia, India, Africa,
and keep these genetics separate and being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to do testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of the back step of
documenting this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, Africa, it's anywhere in the
world right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Erie and Jaya, Papua,
New Guinea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going there and these areas,
people have been there with cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's amazing because for me,
for my background from being in cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: when it was coming over from all these
places throughout the year in Seychelles,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just let me experience a range of
effects that I don't experience now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call most of the stuff we play with not
homogenized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I want is I want to be able to
have these unique directions to fit what I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do and how I want to feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people try to tell me that it's your
imagination, that you're dreaming that
[SPEAKER_01]: things were better at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, oh, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had unbelievable effects and the
directions were phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were very unique in the way they
sent and how you made you feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't see this except in some very
rare cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see stuff that's highly marketable
and a quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're working with some of that
stuff, the pandemas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember some kilopandemas that were
just thumping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the flavor profiles were unique and
the way it made you feel was unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem is that as soon as we
started to hybridize it down so that it
[SPEAKER_01]: would work in our climates, as soon as we
started to try to bring it indoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: we basically just started culling it out
of existence and we dumbed it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We turned the qualities down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you know, for me, when I try to get
when I meet people that like you,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I've known you for a long time,
but I know that you're scouring the earth
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm always like, did you find
something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you find some goodies someplace?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the goodies still remaining somewhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, the goodies are out
there, but they're just not marketable for
[SPEAKER_00]: the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of these cultivars that take 14
weeks, that the flowers still have 14
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks is like a football and it hasn't
filled in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is something that it's good to
have in the toolbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not let this go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think right now, that's these
different unique cultivars that we run
[SPEAKER_00]: into.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's keep it alive or share it with
somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that cannibinoids that feed your
endocannibinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everybody's different and that's
the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that one strain, it's like is
that could be that key that helps you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like with epilepsy, it's three to five
percent, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of people that are affected by say
Charlotte's Web.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what are the cannibinoids within that
cultivar that are accessing your
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannibinoid profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something collecting big data
right now going into this on the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacogenetic level is identifying these
genetics, plant genetics, and then a
[SPEAKER_00]: person's makeup and seeing that 80 year
old lady that's in Australia that just got
[SPEAKER_00]: help from a certain profile and helped her
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have a three year old child
in America or somewhere else that you
[SPEAKER_00]: never know that this particular balance of
a one to one fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something working on and was
finding these old land races from Africa
[SPEAKER_00]: as well, but developing a full cannibinoid
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm talking like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Five percent THC, five CBD, five CBN,
CBG, CBDV, THCV, flatlined across the
[SPEAKER_00]: board or these different profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you identify a cultivar like
that, being able to put it in vitro and
[SPEAKER_00]: put that on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all told.
