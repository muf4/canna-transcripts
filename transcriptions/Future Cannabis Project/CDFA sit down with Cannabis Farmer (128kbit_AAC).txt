[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Chia Rodriguez, and I'm the
operations director of Mendocino
[SPEAKER_00]: Generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a cultivator, and we're here with the
Future Cannabis Project, and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: interviewing Richard Parrott from CDFA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, thanks for having me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, how are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Richard Parrott.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the director of the Cal Cannabis
Cultivation Licensing Division for
[SPEAKER_01]: California Department of Food and
Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we were just discussing a few
minutes ago about kind of how things have
[SPEAKER_00]: been going so far in 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the challenges that we've all
been dealing with, really, and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: see how we can just communicate and have
some conversation around some solutions
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe some ideas and see where we can
go from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an interesting year,
almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think any of us knew really
what to expect when we voted Prop 64 in
[SPEAKER_00]: fully.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought, oh, well, you know,
we've been in this Prop 215 for many years
[SPEAKER_00]: since 98, was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, myself as a farmer have
been working under that medical model for
[SPEAKER_00]: many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my county actually had a 99 plant
limit for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we cultivated under that for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as there was anything,
you know, a legal road to go down,
[SPEAKER_00]: we chose that option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been working towards that ever
since.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a, you know, it's been a
real challenge because it's it's like here
[SPEAKER_00]: you're pulling people from the total
darkness who didn't want to be regulated,
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to hide out in the country and grow
their cannabis and do their thing into
[SPEAKER_00]: this total light world and, you know,
into the white market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people weren't ready for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people dabble in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're kind of not sure if it's for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, from my perspective in
Mendocino County, we have a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of cultivators, as you probably
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a real big topic
conversation around like, so are you are
[SPEAKER_00]: you going to get licensed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know if I want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so everybody's having these
these internal conversations within,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the community about is it right
for them and whether they want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I operate Mendocino Direct
Generations, which is a group of about 60
[SPEAKER_00]: farms in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I try to help people become
licensed, figure out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the right way to do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interpret the regulations and apply them
basically and and help them get to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple of brands and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do a lot of farmer education around
everything and track and trace to
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides and all kinds of farming
techniques and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I really want to see my friends and
neighbors survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want them to get legal and get,
you know, get out there and get their
[SPEAKER_00]: license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've they've come across a lot of
hiccups along the way, like we were saying
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the biggest challenges is at
the county level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you're obviously working at the
state level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you work with the county officials
closely to help them learn and implement
[SPEAKER_00]: these sets of laws?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the unique things about
this new system or this new world that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're in, starting in 2018 with having the
dual licensing right.
[SPEAKER_01]: With both state and local licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the issues we've seen this
year as we've started to take applications
[SPEAKER_01]: for temporary licenses is seeing people
from the industry having difficulty
[SPEAKER_01]: getting their local license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been out there working with the
local governments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gone up north to the Emerald
Triangle and done training with the local
[SPEAKER_01]: official staff to explain how it works at
our state level, what our requirements
[SPEAKER_01]: are, understanding what the local
requirements are, and really helping them
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to educate the farmers when
they come in and say, how do I get
[SPEAKER_01]: started?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we realized that there's like you
said, we've gone from nothing to
[SPEAKER_01]: everything overnight without a real type
of phase in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you guys had to scale up to we did
from like we went from a full tilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went from, you know, when I started at
Cal Cannabis in it was in August of 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had 10 people and we have about close
to 80 today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've really scaled up and had to also
implement, you know, two IT systems,
[SPEAKER_01]: our online licensing and the track and
trace in a very short amount of time to
[SPEAKER_01]: get everything ready for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been a lot in a very short amount
of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, a lot of unforeseen
obstacles in 2018 that we've had to all
[SPEAKER_01]: overcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been a learning experience,
I think, for all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: For everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and the other thing is the
difficulty with going from emergency
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations to readopted emergency
regulations and now to propose permanent
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What my hope is for 2019 is with these
proposed permanent regulations out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: once we get through the process with
office administrative law and the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations become final, that's our,
you know, we really we've been trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: be heavy on education.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really having more types of materials
for the farmers to understand what the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to pick up a packet of 76 pages
of text and read it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think and for the most recent changes,
it was like 31 binders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was this photo going around
on the interwebs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was the Bureau's,
maybe from the Bureau's social media page.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have as many, but we had a
couple boxes that we dropped off as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of all the reference material and
everything it took to get to where we are
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a heavy lift.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also understand we understand how
hard it's been for the folks out there
[SPEAKER_01]: that are trying to get licensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we too are there to help people get
into the legal system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have people that we have
people that are staffing an 800 number
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're and we answer emails every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been really, really when I'm speaking
at events, I've been really pushing to
[SPEAKER_01]: have people who are applying for a state
license call us if they have questions
[SPEAKER_01]: before they apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read our reference materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of good reference materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have guides to, you know, the
application attachments, guides to how to
[SPEAKER_01]: fill out the cultivation plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been really, really focusing on
having people call us or email us if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not sure before they apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way their application could get
through a lot more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I'm seeing some at the
county level in Mendocino County,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people are getting hung up at the
building and planning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they really want to be selling their
cannabis on a legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they might even have cannabis that
they just harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet they cannot sell it because they
can't get through some of these obstacles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the uniqueness of the dual
licensing is they do need to get through
[SPEAKER_01]: local.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for the temporary licenses,
it was a must.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a local permit license or
other type of authorization for the annual
[SPEAKER_01]: license.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to provide that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we still notify the locals when we get
a state application and we have to ensure
[SPEAKER_01]: that the applicant won't be in violation
of any local ordinances or rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there is that communication with
the local local government.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if someone isn't in compliance,
the locals will let us know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can't we don't move forward
until we hear from the locals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any things that you're looking
forward to implementing that might make
[SPEAKER_00]: this system just a little bit smoother for
farmers so that we can I know that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to have this kind of head start
as cultivators to kind of get ahead of the
[SPEAKER_00]: game before the big guys came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we're you know,
we're we're obviously going to be focusing
[SPEAKER_01]: on more coordination with the local
governments.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we'll be doing as
we get into 2019, because we'll be issuing
[SPEAKER_01]: annual licenses, but also provisional
licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if you've talked at all
about the provisional licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are intended to help applicants that
are in a jurisdiction where they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: eligible to have a state license and they
would be in the track and trace system as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we'll be doing in 2019 is as we see
those jurisdictions that aren't done with
[SPEAKER_01]: SQL and their their their applicants or
candidates for provisional licenses,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to be doing education with
those local governments about how they can
[SPEAKER_01]: get their SQL process done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to be basically,
you know, going on the road and helping
[SPEAKER_01]: educate the local governments how they get
ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another thing for the small
growers, we had a some one of our
[SPEAKER_01]: supervisors was speaking here yesterday
about our Appalachians program that's
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in 2021.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll be that's something that we
see is really, you know, going to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: for the the craft grower, the small grower
where, you know, we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: Appalachians of standards practices and
varietals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that that's been very well
received in the by the by the smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: growers is something that they see really
benefiting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I actually had some of the the
people who are working in that department
[SPEAKER_00]: come to my farm and they did their very
first cannabis farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was at my farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We educated them a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swami was there and we kind of threw him
for a loop and really, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was my team and they loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I had a conflicting engagement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, I was going to be there with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully I can come back up one day
for tours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, we're really just
wanting to open communication and and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, show you guys what it's like to
live our lifestyle and cultivate cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and that we're not like weirdos in the
woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really like we're like everybody
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just, you know, we really love to
show off our work to when talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: applying from the state level,
because I know that there there are some
[SPEAKER_01]: obstacles at the local level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from the smaller farmers, when they're
applying for the state license,
[SPEAKER_01]: are have you heard of anything where
there's areas that need to be cleared up
[SPEAKER_01]: or areas where they're having difficulty?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're trying to make sure we
have enough information out there to help
[SPEAKER_01]: them through the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But have you heard of any areas where
they're struggling or need more help from
[SPEAKER_01]: us?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a lot of people feel like the
customer service has been really good and
[SPEAKER_00]: the website is a little hard to navigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a little bit more education would
be very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just basically I think the
biggest problem is interpreting the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations and and boiling it down to
some really basic points.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would help people a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think one of the biggest things was
we were under the impression that the
[SPEAKER_00]: micro business license would be something
that would be available to all small
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers that we could really get an edge
up on the regulated market, we could have
[SPEAKER_00]: our own distribution, we could have our
own manufacturing, we could process,
[SPEAKER_00]: we could package and we could cultivate
and or have a retail, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people had that in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself included in that I really wanted to
do that because I already had a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: brands for various like a topicals company
and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really just like an entrepreneur
and I just love to like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: do that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I thought, well, that's perfect for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but it turns out in my county,
Mendocino County, I cannot get the correct
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get that permit because of my
buildings, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm in the wrong zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not allowed in my zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so here I am somebody who really wants
to be doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't afford to buy a new piece of
property, nor would I want to move or any
[SPEAKER_00]: of that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to be able to just basically
do what was working well for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just keep going with it instead of
this stop start that's been happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in my community, tons of people
would do the micro business if they could.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that would be something that if
we could really work on that, that would
[SPEAKER_00]: help small farmers a great deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people would go for
getting a micro business license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, the micro business licenses
are under purview of the Bureau of
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as you know, there are three
licensing authorities in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we work very, very closely with the
Bureau.
[SPEAKER_01]: I attend all of the Cannabis Advisory
Committee meetings and the last meeting
[SPEAKER_01]: that was earlier this year, the last
meeting for 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a topic of discussion that's
going to be picked up at this next
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting, I believe, in 2019 to really
continue that discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: About micro business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be there part of the discussion and
working with the Bureau and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing what we can to try and help that
along.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a big topic of discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People talking about the vision that
industry had isn't really what's there
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's also, you know... Yeah,
there was a lot of like these,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, broken promises about like the
one acre cap too, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people, when I asked my constituency,
about like, what do you want me to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: Richard Parent?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all like, oh, make sure you ask
them about why, what happened there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened with the drop of the one
acre cap?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one is still under litigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not trying to hide behind it,
but because it is in litigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had to answer this question at
legislative hearings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure everybody's asking you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to answer the question earlier this
year at a public hearing in Ukiah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if you were there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in March.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I didn't attend that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a joint legislative hearing with
Senator McGuire and Assemblymember Wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we're being sued... Oh,
no, wait, I was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're being sued, I'm not able to
discuss it because it is being litigated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for the record, I've been advised by
our legal office that I'm not able to
[SPEAKER_01]: discuss it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, just to touch on that a
little bit, it is an issue for us because
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmers felt like we were going to get
a leg up and we were going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: cruise for a little while until these
larger corporations were allowed to start
[SPEAKER_00]: stacking licenses and all these kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I already kind of see that happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's disturbing in my area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing farmers jump ship.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think mostly it's because they just
don't have the money to scale up and nor
[SPEAKER_00]: do they want the headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just feel like, well,
maybe the universe is telling me it's time
[SPEAKER_00]: to do something else with my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of my neighbors and friends,
they might be like 65 years old and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're starting fresh with a new,
what am I going to do now?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my concern lies with my community
and my neighbors and my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to see them all thrive in the
long term.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's good for us to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did receive a lot of comments about the
acreage cap during our rulemaking process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all that information is out on the
Department of Food and Agriculture's
[SPEAKER_01]: website now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all released on December 7th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the draft final language and all of the
responses to comments were actually
[SPEAKER_01]: published on the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are out there for people to
review as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you about nursery licenses
because that is part of the cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: license types.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally applied for a nursery license
and I have a lot of people in my
[SPEAKER_00]: constituency and Mendocino generations who
have an application in for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in our community as well, there's a
lot of people who have that for seed
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether or not they're selling plants
or clones to anybody else, they just want
[SPEAKER_00]: that license so that they can keep the
genetics alive and they can make seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the heritage alive really ultimately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do you know much about what's
coming for the nursery licenses?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we feel we're all kind of in
the dark about what we can and can't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulations around the nursery is
still a little bit murky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things is, you know,
with the emergency regulations going
[SPEAKER_01]: through to the original version and then
the readoption and now having our
[SPEAKER_01]: permanent regulations, those are things
that we'll be focusing on getting more
[SPEAKER_01]: almost like I'm envisioning almost like
one or two page fact sheets about
[SPEAKER_01]: different parts of our licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're going to be working
toward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also you talked about our website
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of information and we just
have one huge page on our website.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the process of revamping the
entire Department of Food and Agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the Cal Cannabis Division,
we'll have new information that will be a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot more user friendly and kind of
organized in ways that I'm hoping the
[SPEAKER_01]: applicants in the industry would find
easier to use in reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're going to be shooting for is
almost like fact sheets on different
[SPEAKER_01]: topics and nurseries will be one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really looking forward to finding out
more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't dove too far into figuring it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just applied for it not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, always if there's
questions, just call us, call us or email
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although we're super busy, our staff are
we're answering the phones during our work
[SPEAKER_01]: hours and we're responding to emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not sure about something,
call us or email us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're more than happy to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know about the phase three testing
that just kind of is getting implemented
[SPEAKER_00]: at the first of the year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any insight for us as to how
you see that playing out?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't because that the testing is under
the bureau.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they the bureau oversees the testing
labs and the testing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're definitely, you know, following it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't have any any specific
information about phase three,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we'll be we'll be definitely following
the cultivators are just thinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that they were worried about the
whole testing thing in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually been seeing that it's it's
better and we're having more, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: good results from it in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, with the track and trace
like being implemented, we haven't really
[SPEAKER_00]: got there with the farmers besides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you wanted to talk about track
and trace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just I think there's been a lot of maybe
misunderstanding about track and trace.
[SPEAKER_01]: We keep hearing that people are saying,
when's it going to be launched?
[SPEAKER_01]: When will it be live?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was live at the start of January at the
start of twenty eighteen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Annual licensees will be using track and
trace, not temporary licensees.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a lot of questions as to why we
chose that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you look back at twenty eighteen
and you look at our original emergency
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations, then a readopted version of
the emergency regulations and now our
[SPEAKER_01]: draft permit regulations with so many
changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many things to be learned during
the temporary licensing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we had had the temporary licensees in
track and trace, it would have been,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, harder on the industry because
with cultivation, what we found are a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of cultivators got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just talk about the beginning of the
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got both A&M licenses because they
weren't sure which way they were going to
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we readopted the regulations and
clarified that you could have either an A
[SPEAKER_01]: or an M and it didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could sell to either an A or M.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them made decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I only need one license.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have been a lot of maintenance
in the track and trace system.
[SPEAKER_01]: People re-tagging plants, re-tagging
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So annual licensees will be using track
and trace.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have between the three licensing
authorities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they're approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between the three licensing authorities,
we've issued twenty three annual licenses
[SPEAKER_01]: so far and about seventeen have actually
been credentialed and are in the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are going to be our first users.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we get into 2019, we'll be done
issuing temporary licenses at the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: this year and then our authority goes
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as in 2019, we'll be issuing a lot more
annual and provisional licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'll see people flowing into track
and trace and they'll be using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know in your jurisdiction, you also have
a local track and trace system as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had SICPA with Cal Origin and that was
a whole crazy thing in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually the 12th permit in
Mendocino County and so I was thrown into
[SPEAKER_00]: that right in harvest of last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did our best and it was really
complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly the biggest complication was
actually just learning the system,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Internet, their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like to me that the track and
trace just kind of came to an end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sticker was really unusable after it
went to my distributor, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, well, what am I going to do
with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they weren't using the same
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the buck kind of stopped there and
they just threw that package away and they
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in my packaging and they didn't put
a new sticker on it because they weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: in metric yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just kind of like, why are we
doing this when the buck stopped there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we've talked with all of the third
party vendors.
[SPEAKER_01]: SICPA is one and so they're working on
being able to interface with metric for
[SPEAKER_01]: the licensees that are on a local system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're working on having their Cal
Origin system be able to integrate with
[SPEAKER_01]: metrics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've talked to them frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that they've done what they need to
do to get certified to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: interface with metrics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the goal is there for those licensees
that are in a local system to,
[SPEAKER_01]: as much as we can, limit any duplication
of entry and duplication of effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're working on that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask if you have any advice for
the farmers for the next year?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that the biggest advice
would be to, you know, we're all in it
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all working together.
[SPEAKER_01]: My hope is that 2019, we're through,
I think, the heaviest lift on getting the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see 2019 hopefully as a time for us to
really work on education and starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: try and, you know, work out the kinks in
our systems, really have engagement with
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, with all of the licensees,
be able to hear from them and look at
[SPEAKER_01]: things that can be fixed and tweaked along
the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I continue to tell everyone what we've put
out is our start.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't how the program is going to end
up looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make some changes along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the good thing about regulations is
that we can, you know, do subsequent
[SPEAKER_01]: rulemaking efforts to fix things as we
move along.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say this isn't what the program
is going to look like a year from now,
[SPEAKER_01]: two years from now, even three years from
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are going to change and morph as we
all learn more and figure out what's
[SPEAKER_01]: working and what's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd say, you know, hang in there with
us and communicate with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, you know, if you all have
questions, call us and we're there to
[SPEAKER_01]: listen and work together to, you know,
the goal is to get as many people into the
[SPEAKER_01]: legal system as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll be better for all of
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'd love to have you up on my
car many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
