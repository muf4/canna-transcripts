[SPEAKER_00]: And so is this kind of like some of the
top stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so this plant died because the
filter got stuck and the plant didn't get
[SPEAKER_02]: enough water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this fan, which gives the plant
circulation, was pointed in that
[SPEAKER_02]: direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when the humidifier comes on at
night, the humidity gets low.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the medium dried out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have it in... These are Hugo's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are 6x6 Hugo's.
[SPEAKER_02]: In growth and blocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have... Psychonutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: A company out of Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Residual from the... What's the name of
that group?
[SPEAKER_02]: Advanced Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're playing classical music?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they enjoying the classical music?
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so is each section a different
cultivar?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the far corner over there, those are
strawberry bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are gas leak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how did you settle on those
three?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did you get them from?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got them from LA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it LA Genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to look it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I've grown the wedding cake before.
[SPEAKER_02]: My last operation was closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a little bit different than
the variety that I was growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was always happy and so was my
customer base.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've grown the strawberry banana
before as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what kind of laser are you using?
[SPEAKER_02]: These are 1000 watt HPS single ended
bulbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, you have 6 in
total.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for how many square feet basically?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the canopy in here is about 96
square feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each table is a 4x8.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's 32 square feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Times 3.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you basically have this on a...
[SPEAKER_01]: Like automated basically?
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally automated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a 55 gallon drum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll use that for 3 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants are drinking anywhere from 10
to, let's say at this later stage,
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 gallons a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'll use this mix for 3 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then whatever's left, I dump and
refill.
[SPEAKER_02]: A and B and all the other nutrients that
are needed during the different stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what are some of those that you
like to add at different stages?
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk like when they're wee ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well in the beginning the A and B,
the grow, is pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have an A and B, you have a B
vitamin, a Zyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a Cal Mag basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calcium Magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you kind of progress,
what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what are you adding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well later in the stage you'll add a
silica to provide strength and I guess
[SPEAKER_02]: density as far as the base of your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then add it to promote root growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the beginning stages of
flowering, I'll add a potassium and a
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen additive for the first couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then phase that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nitrogen based additive helps keep the
plants green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in the changeover from metal
halide to HPS, it can be light shock and
[SPEAKER_02]: then that will start yellowing out your
leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the nitrogen helps number one with the
continued root development as well as the
[SPEAKER_02]: keeps the leaves nice and green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as we're nearing the finish line?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're nearing the finish line,
you want to give some sweeteners and a bud
[SPEAKER_02]: hardener, a bat guano, provides a little
bit of taste as well for that old school
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through the stages you'll ramp up your
PPM, which is your parts per million,
[SPEAKER_02]: as far as the nutrient level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the end you'll start to phase
that off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you peak at from a PPM
standpoint?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say about 14 to 1500.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it gets to 1600, that's not really a
big worry, but not really any higher than
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so, talk about what you were
like back in, were you in the city in New
[SPEAKER_01]: York?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean I grew up in New York and
I've had grows in Manhattan, Queens and
[SPEAKER_02]: Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just in an apartment or like in a
warehouse?
[SPEAKER_02]: I started out in an apartment that was
above mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I subletted an apartment when one of my
neighbors was moving out and they wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep the apartment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I subletted it for a couple of years
and that's where I taught myself how to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then later on I was able to get a
warehouse and expand it from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of what was this like in the
mid-90s?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, mid-90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was hot in New York in the
mid-90s?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the genetics that I had available to
me were, you know, few and far between
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's not like you can broadcast
what you're doing and it's hard to find
[SPEAKER_02]: like-minded individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody keeps to themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so actually you're keeping it pretty
cool in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: At night time, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, I'm saying like right now during
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like it's like in the 60s.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about 68 in there and I can check my
greenhouse grower controller to tell you
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly where it's at right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you feel the need to keep it that
cool?
[SPEAKER_02]: In later stages, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That promotes the purpliness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in like kind of peak growth,
you don't feel like you need to keep it
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're- No, in peak growth I go
anywhere from 72 to 78 and maybe as high
[SPEAKER_02]: as 80.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's kind of where I was getting
at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, okay, so you were growing what
in New York in the 90s?
[SPEAKER_02]: In the 90s I was growing Northern Lights,
Hawaiian, and then Afghan.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where were you sourcing those genetics
from given that you couldn't be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: I flew over to Amsterdam to get seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smuggled them back and yeah,
started the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was- Okay, so that's what you're
growing in New York and then you moved out
[SPEAKER_01]: to Seattle?
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved to Seattle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, any of these underground
operations that I've had haven't really
[SPEAKER_02]: lasted more than three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no good time for a bad thing
to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it happens, you're not
necessarily, you know, prepared for
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you have to deal with the
consequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So did something happen in New York?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The warehouse that I had, which was my
major source of income, was broken into.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the police showed up and arrested the
thieves and then put the grow on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was able to come out of that
unscathed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they got the double whammy of breaking
in and then being accused of it being
[SPEAKER_01]: their grow operation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you just never went back to that
space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Washed my hands and were they trying to
steal the flour or- The flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to find money or- Usually,
you know, you keep those two separate.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason to keep finished product
in your grow or money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And did they know, so they knew that you
had just harvested or- No, it was right
[SPEAKER_02]: before I was going to harvest too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a really hard blow and the smells
weren't entirely contained at that point
[SPEAKER_02]: because they were really, really stinky at
that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you think someone smelled it,
told their friends and their friends came
[SPEAKER_01]: in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as large as New York is,
it's also a small, tight-knit community,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in that arena.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the warehouse that I had was a grow
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess the nuance is that if it was a
grow then, then it's a grow now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they were arrested, you knew who it
was?
[SPEAKER_02]: I found out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew who it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And were you like, oh, I know those guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew who they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you like, you guys are assholes?
[SPEAKER_02]: No question.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why you left New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the beginning of the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after that- Sorry, how big was that
warehouse?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about, there were two levels or about
25 to 22 on each floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one floor was 2,500, the other one was
2,200.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just under 5,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both were going- On opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And were you getting like four turns out
of each room or- I had a vegetative room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were popping every four to five
weeks I was harvesting, one or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you go to Seattle and you kind of,
like, did you know people there or you
[SPEAKER_01]: just- Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then when the warehouse closed down,
before I moved to Seattle, I bought a
[SPEAKER_02]: house upstate and then grew upstate.
[SPEAKER_02]: New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right outside of Albany.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a commute of about an hour
and 45 minutes, two hours each way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did that for about two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then during a storm, the transformer
blew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the power company came to replace
it and I was obviously paying for power,
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't stealing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they saw that there was a lot of usage
in that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they visited my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on paper, my house was listed as a
farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wasn't at a source that a farm would
be using that sort of power.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when they saw it was just a
residence, they investigated further and
[SPEAKER_02]: then alerted the authorities and then
closed it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was- And how many square feet do you
have going up there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I had about 30 lights in that house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the cops come and, like,
did you take off or did you- I had
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody working for me at that point and
they were going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they followed that person and then
they arrested them, they detained them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were terrified at the prospect of
being locked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were a green card holder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they scared them into telling them
what was going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they were arrested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they put out a warrant for my
arrest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I surrendered and started that
whole horrible process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was the outcome of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted to give me a felony.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, give me jail time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the land that I was on was privately
owned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were on my property dressed as
the power company.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there were a bunch of holes in the way
that they approached it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just held Pat and my lawyer told
them that I wasn't willing to take a plea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of that, I accepted a
misdemeanor charge with time served.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was basically, you know,
slap in the wrist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even really have to pay a fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically they, like, didn't do the
warrant process properly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got off on technicalities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank God for technicalities.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you move out west, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I asked buddies, you know,
like, what can I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I got to recreate myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do you have any opportunities
for me?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I moved out to Seattle and worked
with some people that I had known from New
[SPEAKER_02]: York and started growing for the them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a small underground network and
they were on the cusp of going legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had a really genuine genetic that
they were working with that was highly
[SPEAKER_02]: touted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an OG strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I grew that for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I increased their production and all
their various grows and taught the people
[SPEAKER_02]: that they had in their underground
network.
[SPEAKER_02]: How to get more out of the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they opened their dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about the genetics and like
everything from how it grew to how it
[SPEAKER_01]: looked as a cola, to how it smelled,
to how it smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also what were some of the things
they were or were not doing that you were
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, let's do X, Y, and Z and
increase yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the genetics that they were working
with was an OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I don't necessarily want to be too
specific as to which one, but they had an
[SPEAKER_02]: original OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And OGs are notoriously finicky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have to provide the correct
environment for them to thrive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they like a high humidity and
vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that humidity has to drop off at
a certain stage in order to get the most
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the plant was kind of spindly in
that if you didn't train it, then the
[SPEAKER_02]: branches wouldn't be strong enough to hold
the buds that you actually would want out
[SPEAKER_02]: of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I set up trellis systems for them,
control their environment, and then not so
[SPEAKER_02]: much super crop as actually training the
plants, giving them stress along their
[SPEAKER_02]: growing period in order to make them
stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, you came out here?
[SPEAKER_02]: From Seattle, I moved to Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I lived in Oakland with a buddy
of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had a grow underneath his house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we grew a great ape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ballpark, what year was this?
[SPEAKER_02]: This was at this point about eight years
ago, so 2011.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2010 to 2011, I lived in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we grew great ape.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the shatter scene was just burgeoning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we would sell our flower and then turn
all the waste into shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were working with different
dispensaries in the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the problems that I ran into there was
that my partner had one way of doing
[SPEAKER_02]: things and I had another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so too many cooks in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the harves weren't always uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at the end of the day, it wasn't as
profitable as it could have been.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he didn't want to acquiesce as to his
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had my way of doing things,
problem being that I was going back and
[SPEAKER_02]: forth from Oakland to the East Coast to
visit my children because I hadn't seen
[SPEAKER_02]: them, I hadn't saved enough money in order
to move them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hadn't narrowed down a place where I
was willing to move my family open as an
[SPEAKER_02]: armpit, not a place that I wanted to raise
my children.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at some point, our relationship became
untenable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a buddy of mine who lived in LA had an
opportunity for me to take over a grow
[SPEAKER_02]: that wasn't doing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I moved to Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what were you growing there?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first came to LA, Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a popular stream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Popular stream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't go wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, New York, upstate New York,
New York City, upstate New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: Seattle, Oakland, down to LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of the differences you
noticed in each market in terms of what's
[SPEAKER_01]: hot, what's selling, what people want?
[SPEAKER_02]: On the East Coast, at that point,
there was a big cry for sour diesel and
[SPEAKER_02]: purple haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess a lot of the sour diesel was
coming from the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the purple haze was coming from
basically Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a niche market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was growing strawberry cough at that
point right before everything went
[SPEAKER_02]: haywire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a sativa, indica cross,
mostly sativa, which had a really nice
[SPEAKER_02]: effect in that you could smoke it and not
be couched.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it would let you off nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be creative on it and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was supplying the underground
delivery services at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that once I moved to Seattle,
then that being a West Coast market,
[SPEAKER_02]: the OGs were really what the public was
crying for and really wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found that to be consistent from
there down to down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the blue dream, I think, didn't have a
big hold in the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it pretendica.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't whack you over the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not for the streets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it did very well in dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: They couldn't get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the market here also feeds the market
over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you kind of have to, especially in the
underground market at that point,
[SPEAKER_02]: had to focus on where your market was and
where you were getting the most money for
[SPEAKER_02]: your end product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seemed that everybody who was
working in New York in the industry had a
[SPEAKER_02]: friend in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of times, the end product would
go out of state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's still true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the dispensary market was not
something that, once I had my own
[SPEAKER_02]: operation, I was particularly interested
in because of the way that the payout
worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't paying cash on the barrel
head.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to go back and forth and have it
on consignment.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not necessarily the most attractive
option.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you can get paid upon delivery,
talk about pricing trends over the past
[SPEAKER_01]: however many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the best year per pound?
[SPEAKER_02]: In the early 90s, I was getting anywhere
from $5,500 to $6,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I first started in the game,
I was a middleman.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would get my product from the
Midwest, where I went to school,
[SPEAKER_02]: and sell it to the underground market in
New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: There came a time where- Was this stuff
that was grown in the Midwest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the- So tell me about the Midwest
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we talking like Michigan?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's kind of the dominant Midwest?
[SPEAKER_02]: Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky area.
[SPEAKER_02]: The farmers out there, they grow corn,
basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the secondary market is marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they growing outdoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just kind of hiding it in the
cornfields?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the farmers out there- And this is like
early 90s?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is late 80s, early 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what were kind of the dominant
Midwestern corn strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: Back then, there weren't really any real
names that were attached to the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was either good or it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Largely indica-based, some sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But forearm buds, like healthy,
healthy outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent product.
[SPEAKER_02]: There came a time, though, where the
cocaine dealers in New York switched from
[SPEAKER_02]: that business to the marijuana business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the opportunities available for
middlemen dried up, unless you could speak
[SPEAKER_02]: Spanish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was getting squeezed out of that
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I adapted and became a producer rather
than a middleman.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what drove me to start growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're sourcing from the
Midwest, it's not Spanish speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're selling in New York,
where- Is it because there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexican weed coming up?
[SPEAKER_02]: It came from everywhere, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexico, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not speaking Spanish was a hindrance?
[SPEAKER_02]: To the underground market, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The major outlets for retail were
basically the delivery services and corner
[SPEAKER_02]: street sellers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the Mr. Nice Guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, half-baked.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a large, I guess,
marketplace at the bridge and tunnel
[SPEAKER_02]: points.
[SPEAKER_02]: So across from the George Washington
Bridge is Washington Heights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very well-known drug market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the out-of-staters would come over the
bridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And stop in that area to get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just go right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then go right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had connections up there,
but that community is all Latin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it basically changed from the Harlem
guys to the Latin guys being the gangs
[SPEAKER_02]: that were controlling what industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived on 142nd and Broadway for about a
year and a half.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like the middle ground between
Washington Heights and Harlem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when you were like, I need to be
growing my own.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't have to deal with- There was a
lot more competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the numbers started dropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the numbers went from 5.56 down to 5.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from 5 down to 45.
[SPEAKER_02]: At 45, I'm tripping out now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was making so much more money just a
minute ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's down to 45 around what year?
[SPEAKER_02]: That had to be 2000, 2001.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe late 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you moved to Seattle,
which was what,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years later?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, it had dropped to about
between 28 and 32.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oakland in 2011?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was around 28.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then dropped to between 28, sometimes 26,
depending upon when the outdoors came
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I moved to Los Angeles,
it was pretty steady at 28.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then went from 28 to 26.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is for all high-end indoor,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, all high-end indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the bottom of the market was like
late 2017 into 2018?
[SPEAKER_02]: Down to like 1600, 1400.
[SPEAKER_02]: For bomb, bomb indoors.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now, what are you kind of seeing
it climbing back up to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, recently, it's gone, look,
six, eight months ago, it was still around
[SPEAKER_02]: 16, 18.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now, it's 22 to 28.
[SPEAKER_01]: So beginning at 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're September, basically,
2019.
[SPEAKER_02]: At 22 to 28.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are your projections for,
you think it's going to hold steady there
[SPEAKER_01]: or drop again?
[SPEAKER_02]: The government has gotten involved because
there's pushback from big companies to get
[SPEAKER_02]: rid of the black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's been a lot of closures of
warehouses as of late, and also a
[SPEAKER_02]: crackdown on the light up and outdoor
farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: The diesel, the diesel generator.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's drawing prices up again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so whoever's still in business is
obviously benefiting from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's become a commodity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's obviously, because of
that, there's higher demand that's sparing
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And talk about, because you said you've
also grown outdoors too, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've grown outdoors a couple of different
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: The product isn't as good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly for my market,
[SPEAKER_02]: the discerning customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're defining a good product,
is it based on like look and THC?
[SPEAKER_02]: Old school heads can tell whether or not
it's grown outdoors or grown indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there are some times where you'll
get a light up that's passing for an end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess certainly there's more margins
to be made there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like my product to sell itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to have anybody come back
and tell me that it wasn't what I said it
[SPEAKER_02]: was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've always dealt with environments
that I can control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I'm going to put my stamp on it,
it's going to be the bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: In growing outdoors, there are so many
variables that you can't control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then you're at the whim of nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, the end product is
certainly not up to snuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it depends to who,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know plenty of amazing
cultivators who are old school people who
[SPEAKER_01]: can tell indoor and don't like indoor.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed there's an allure to the
sun-grown product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for me, I'm always kind of like,
you don't drink wine that was grown from
[SPEAKER_01]: grapes indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of like, I feel like
indoor obviously has the bag appeal
[SPEAKER_01]: because it looks perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can crank up the THC percentages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really for the streets, that's the end
result.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess what I'm getting at is the
judgment of what is and is not good is
[SPEAKER_01]: different for different people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your average LA market consumer is
basically, does this look like a shiny red
[SPEAKER_01]: apple?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it dripping with THC?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about when like kind of purple punch
and kind of the like, I'm just thinking of
[SPEAKER_01]: things that were desirable and like trends
you've noticed that have become fads and
[SPEAKER_01]: desirable in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess there's a lot of different strains
that have presented themselves that,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, get some noise.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then that noise kind of quiets down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it may be hot for a minute and then
it's not gorilla glue, for instance.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a time where you couldn't grow
enough of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people was like, well,
OK, I've had enough of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then you have all this gorilla glue
and then you can't get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then another strain will be heard
in a rap song or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it becomes desirable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you run to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, I try and stick with the tried and
true.
[SPEAKER_02]: OGs will always be marketable because they
do what you want them to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a smell that's reminiscent of
what you're accustomed to, much the same
[SPEAKER_02]: as a sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that a lot of these strains are
really nothing but residual from Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grandfather of all, the land race
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for me, I can't really gamble on
what's new, what's hot right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't feed my family that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a dip in the market and then
doesn't get what I thought it was going to
[SPEAKER_02]: three months ago after going through that
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've always stuck to what is tried and
true and is representative of what my
[SPEAKER_02]: market wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we forget the market, if you were just
growing for yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, those purples, they taste nice
and give you a nice effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as a grower, for instance,
purples take a lot longer to vegetate than
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the other strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then your calendar is extended and then
it costs you more to produce it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're not necessarily getting more
for the product at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it were me, first of all,
for me, it's not a hobby.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a way of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I were just growing for myself,
I would have all those different varieties
[SPEAKER_02]: because they taste nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have different effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also, I guess they have their
moments when you would want to consume
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you said the purples take a lot,
why is that they take longer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the flowering stage that takes
longer?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's the vegetative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genetics do different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants mature faster than others,
just like kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a big driver,
especially in the indoor market.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the past 30 years of what
people have bred towards, right,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like short plants, fast flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had this strain called SensiStar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took two, two and a half weeks to grow
large enough to flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with flower in six weeks, start to
finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.
And what happened to it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Once my warehouse was closed, I lost the
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with the strawberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, we used to call it strawberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think now it's more referred to as
strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was a wonderful plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Sensi, that would be an example of
something from a long time ago that you
[SPEAKER_01]: wish you could get your hands on again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure it has its roots from the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another strain that I really liked was
[SPEAKER_02]: AK-47.
[SPEAKER_02]: That strain grew vigorously.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in different systems, it'll grow at
different rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I had this NFT system that I was
using, and they really thrived in that
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And literally, nutrient film technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the buds that were coming off of that
plant were as large as your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Christmas tree size, like plants that
were, you know, eight feet tall,
[SPEAKER_02]: six to eight feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where were you at this point?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was when I was in Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Brooklyn, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't plant that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, a lot of those strains, like I told
you, I got from Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so some of those companies are still
in existence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of those companies that are still
in existence still have those strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, those things develop over
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because right now, you're growing
basically hydroponically, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've also grown in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you talk about, like, same genetics
that maybe you've grown both different
[SPEAKER_01]: ways and just some nuanced differences
that you've seen?
[SPEAKER_02]: I find that growing in soil, it takes
longer for the plants to develop in a
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the taste and the after
product is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the the bottom line for me is
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the time involved is always a factor
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it doesn't fit within the timeline,
then it's not going to be something that
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything is about kind of marginal
improvement in taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that lead to marginal per pound?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, I get good results out of the
method that I use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's been over trial and error
throughout the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of different ways to grow
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say hundreds, but maybe that's a
stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are certainly a bunch of
different ways to grow marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the variables then vary.
[SPEAKER_02]: The medium that you grow in, how long
you're going to vegetate, the nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: that you use, the techniques that you use,
the light spectrums that you use at
[SPEAKER_02]: different times.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those are factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you touch on light spectrums and kind
of your thought process of different
[SPEAKER_01]: stages of growth?
[SPEAKER_02]: The I guess the the plant in a vegetative
state likes blue light, which is a metal
[SPEAKER_02]: halide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the flowering stage,
likes a red light.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first couple of weeks in flowering,
your plant will start to stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And under a red light, that stretching can
be significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a lot of times, the grower will use
a metal halide.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the first two weeks of flowering to
keep the profile of his garden down and
[SPEAKER_02]: avoid stretching.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one technique some people would
use.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant needs the red light to flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And look, there are some people who use
blue light to flower or a combination of
[SPEAKER_02]: the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that I get good results with the
genetics that I'm using out of using the
[SPEAKER_02]: blue light.
[SPEAKER_02]: The white light in veg and the high
pressure sodium red light in the flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I account for the stretching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, when you're growing different
strains, they'll like different things and
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll react differently to conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other aspect of that is that all
strains don't like the same mixture that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're giving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'd be able to tweak their needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to pinpoint exactly what the
needs are for the different strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, the sour diesel doesn't like
additives.
[SPEAKER_02]: It likes a very basic soup, if you will,
nutrient mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: The formulas that I'm using right now,
that strawberry banana loves what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: giving it, as does the wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the gas leak, it could use a little
bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Additive list, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not saying that it would need more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably needs less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Less is more.
All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
