[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things we talked about briefly
the other day was going from some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: smaller greenhouses you've been consulting
with to kind of, you're now doing a
[SPEAKER_04]: project down in Salinas, which is a much
larger project.
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you talk about kind of some of the
nuance differences of scaling up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's an interesting project for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've been involved in dealing with
a lot of these bigger greenhouses when I
[SPEAKER_02]: was doing procurement and doing the
designing and equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we've come to a whole new level
where, you know, I'm involved in the
[SPEAKER_02]: production side of things or the actual
operations of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's just a lot of moving parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really surprised to see or I'm
fascinated by how many moving parts there
[SPEAKER_02]: really are with these big greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the corporate side of things,
whether it's a single investor or a big
[SPEAKER_02]: corporate group or whatever, this
corporate stuff is really, really slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing that's fast about
corporate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like on the smaller scale,
we want something done.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get it done that day or the things that
we talk about in order to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: get stuff done basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Eric's somebody that like when I
purchased a greenhouse and it's no
[SPEAKER_00]: disrespect to the company, but I actually
purchased the house because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing Eric as part of the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what I wanted was I wanted
troubleshooting support and I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who was conscientious about trying
to cut costs and keep profitability high
[SPEAKER_00]: and not make tremendous problems for the
operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's the component
that's taken place when you make these
[SPEAKER_00]: transitions from small to big is that
your, I always used to say the same thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: most people learn how to grow in a closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they built a big operation,
they just made that closet module bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're talking about these large
operations, the investor groups had to
[SPEAKER_00]: sink in, say some of these ops,
you know, 40, $50 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you've got $40 million of someone
else's money that you're responsible for,
[SPEAKER_00]: they always move slowly because they can't
make mistakes and come back from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It damages their reputations, but it
creates a situation where they have to get
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are competent at running
operations that are acre level and above
[SPEAKER_00]: undercover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's extremely rare for the old
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nobody running operations that
big period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where these problems are is
that when I get brought into jobs,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of times it's just to take a look at
the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we realize that the people that they
brought in were competent for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 5,000 square feet, but they're
most definitely not competent for 300,000
[SPEAKER_00]: square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a real problem in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you're seeing so many of
these big ops fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't because anybody's stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that the approach to it isn't
appropriate where the individuals who are
[SPEAKER_00]: running the facility have to have acre
level operational experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the individuals that integrate
how you grow cannabis in terms of what the
[SPEAKER_00]: market wants and how do we position it
price-wise and how do we position it in
[SPEAKER_00]: its sale points.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this disconnect between the three
groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: The commercial operator who's used to
running tomato, who knows how to run a
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, knows how to run injections,
knows how to maintain your diff so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not having environmental
fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person who knows herb and a catheter
that has the money, that process is not
[SPEAKER_00]: quick like it used to be for us when we
were in more self-control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I go into these operations
too, I trip out because you think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a quick decision, but it's a
long, laborious, dragged out process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's only so many guys like,
you know, we use Erica as an example,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I respect the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only so many of them in the
industry where they have commercial level
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge, but they understand cannabis as
a product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Kevin's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's exactly what I'm seeing a lot
is that, yeah, there's people that know
[SPEAKER_02]: the shit out of cannabis, but moving at
big scale and keeping it efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the cost of production really goes
up as people start to try to bring in the
[SPEAKER_02]: original nutrients or programs that they
had before, because now you're working at
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot bigger commercial ag level and you
need, basically what's happening is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is there's only a fraction of big
greenhouse guys that want to get into
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of them that have gotten into
cannabis aren't really interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: hanging out with the cannabis people,
if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we had a big disconnect where big
ag tried to come in that didn't know
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis lost their ass because they
didn't know the cannabis aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have the cannabis people that
didn't have the big ag guys to help them
[SPEAKER_02]: along.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's only a small fraction of big
ag guys that even want to be involved in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and make friends, I guess,
with the cannabis people, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's really a culture thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always been a culture thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now on this big level, there's also
the culture of cannabis people getting
[SPEAKER_02]: together with the big ag people and
everybody getting along and having the
[SPEAKER_02]: same goals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this go forward approach, we're going
to win type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really turns into an ego battle of
these guys know this, these guys know
[SPEAKER_02]: that, and nobody really actually vibes
together on these jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you finally get the vibes
right and you have these big ag guys that
[SPEAKER_02]: really love cannabis and really love what
they're doing and are really interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: what you have to say, a lot of times,
whether you're right or wrong,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're open to the conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get so many more things done,
and those are the ones that are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, like Kevin was saying,
there's not a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm starting to really pay attention to
this more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm kind of shocked at how many people
are running big stuff but aren't doing it
[SPEAKER_02]: from the experience of the big ag and
running big greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of surprising.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, if you look at all
the pot stocks and the way Canada was
[SPEAKER_02]: going and these big massive greenhouses,
how popular extractions are and things
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, a lot of these people are
getting by.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're bleeding out pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're starting to see a lot of,
especially up in Canada, the bankruptcies
[SPEAKER_02]: and different things, moving to outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like all of a sudden, everybody's
going to be a big outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, fuck, that's what we
started with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of coming full circle now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, it's really important to get
these things dialed in and work with the
[SPEAKER_02]: right people and knowing who the right
people are.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like the consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't all know what good quality is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the people that are involved
in this don't know who the good people are
[SPEAKER_02]: either because there's so many people on
LinkedIn and all over the place that come
[SPEAKER_02]: off like professionals.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really hard to vet people these
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've been lucky enough to have
been around the community and knowing
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin and Scott and all these different
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we actually do pull from each other
from time to time.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of us will reach out to each other
and say, yo, I got this situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's the best person to talk to about
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it could be irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be pinpointing one or two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we try to source and deal with the
best of the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those particular categories in order
to make a lot of these big things work.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do consulting as a business,
so to speak, because I have my own
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do though is I get brought in by
people that ask and say, hey, can you come
[SPEAKER_00]: in and take a look at this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I try to figure out where I see
the evident problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I try to get the people together
to see where there's friction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can try to figure out from my
pool of professionals that I know in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry who might be someone that we
could bring in, who might be looking for a
[SPEAKER_00]: new career opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's to create a success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is that when you're building
an industry, everyone at first was so
[SPEAKER_00]: hyper competitive that each person was
going to be the top of the food chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody went huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were going to take over the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all got the shit kicked out of them,
which just makes me fucking overjoyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what it does is it allows there to
be a pace of development that lets
[SPEAKER_00]: stratification for all operators to fit in
with these mega operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to satisfy the low cost markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to satisfy globalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it creates the awareness of what
small scale is because you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it is just trying to source
through the industry that we know from
[SPEAKER_00]: being in the industry and just saying,
hey, this is the right person.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the right person for the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my limitations and I'm not afraid
to admit them because that's not where I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to make my win.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the things that I'm good at,
I try to be very good at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've seen so much is that
everyone lied through their fucking teeth
[SPEAKER_00]: and no one told the truth about their
limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these investors are coming in to do
business and they get lied to by
[SPEAKER_00]: operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go into these places and you're
like, who the hell designed this shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you realize that the direction was
steered from the initial wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does is it makes all of us
look stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the problem is that it
diminishes us as cannabis operators
[SPEAKER_00]: because we all look like we're Charlottes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of telling somebody that you're
a fucking virologist, when really you know
[SPEAKER_00]: how to use a pump sprayer, it would help
because then you can actually hire a
[SPEAKER_00]: virologist and you can guide the
investment and you can guide the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the success of it, you develop your
reputation, you develop your success,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's not what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, like this is a train wreck and it'll
clear itself up, but some of the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen is just crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the teething of a new industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, whatever we did prior is
irrelevant to a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is this point forward and it
requires all of us to be a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: honest about what we're good at,
what we're not good at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't be ashamed to reach out for
assistance and don't be afraid to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: look, I know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can each of you just give a couple more?
[SPEAKER_04]: So just quickly, Eric, can each of you
give a couple of kind of like bad news,
[SPEAKER_04]: bears, things, witnesses that you've seen
fairly frequently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: To Kevin, who's designing these things?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of my starting points for
the war stories is like, who thought this
[SPEAKER_02]: up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who designed it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And who said okay to all these things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because nine times out of 10, when you get
in there with the cultivator or somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: that knows what's up, the greenhouse
facility isn't designed for working
[SPEAKER_02]: smarter, not harder, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it is is a lot of the greenhouse
companies design them, the builders that
[SPEAKER_02]: build them, sell them and design them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I found is that sometimes these
guys will sprinkle in a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that they've done at one of
these jobs to make this one masterpiece.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a little bell and whistle of all
these different little tricks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of the day, we didn't need
all those bells and whistles or little
[SPEAKER_02]: tricks, or maybe we need the whole trick
and not part of the trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we get into these situations where the
workflow isn't right and you go,
[SPEAKER_02]: who the fuck thought of this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's like, well, we went with
this company that's been designing
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses for 40 years, but they've
never grown anything one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all their knowledge for growing comes
from the people that have grown in them
[SPEAKER_02]: before, the other vegetable growers and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the cannabis growers in specific
regions and states that have these certain
[SPEAKER_02]: climates that everybody's only grown
primarily in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a whole different deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where I kind of get up a lot of
calls or situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like the designing and the
spending of the money, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the easy part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they got to have somebody
actually go grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And none of these guys in these big
scalable facilities were designed by who's
[SPEAKER_02]: running it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I haven't ran into one yet that is
designed by the guy that's running it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy's usually gone before the fucking
shovels even start the job.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how many times is a cultivator asked
to operate something or use nutrients that
[SPEAKER_03]: they weren't involved in any of those
decisions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this Scott here, by the way,
I just got in, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of times we get brought into a
facility and a bunch of boardroom members
[SPEAKER_03]: decided facility layout, nutrient
considerations, whether they're doing
[SPEAKER_03]: cocoa buckets, what have you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they throw a cultivator in there
and say, all right, here's what we got for
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
Go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the worst.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably 80%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cultivator though, the cultivators got
to say, listen, you're putting me over a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking barrel and I'm going to look like
I'm an idiot if I do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to be able to have faith in
yourself to say, I need to leave the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is, is that you see the
potential so greatly, at least from my
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences with when I talk to the
operators that are running these projects
[SPEAKER_00]: that were created by five or six people
before them, like the chain of failure
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't just one person made a mistake and
everyone else pays.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking multiple CEOs that got
canned because they couldn't, the
[SPEAKER_00]: investors canned the management group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone that the management group brought
in got canned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times they canned the guys
that was smart because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: argumentative because they disagreed with
the approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the people that had intelligence
got weeded out.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that were basically able to tell a
good story remained.
[SPEAKER_00]: They design a system that's going to fuck
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the cultivator that's supposed to
be there to run, it gets screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're in a situation that doesn't
pay off for you, it's best if you leave
[SPEAKER_00]: and find another operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what happens is you struggle,
you fail, you emotionally get wiped out
[SPEAKER_00]: because you want to succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're attached to that
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my thing with cultivators is you need
to vet the owners, the operators,
[SPEAKER_00]: the designers, as much as you do you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's both, you have to look at each other
or otherwise there's no way you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: these projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so simple, but it's the way that
it's been laid out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that for cultivators,
because I get hit up constantly saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, I'm in this position and I think it
sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, what do you think I should
do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell them, tell them fuck off and
get another job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they're going to break your
balls over every detail that they want you
[SPEAKER_00]: to execute that doesn't make any sense
because it's the motion that they set in
[SPEAKER_00]: play, that's ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't win there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cultivators with egos that won't listen
can't win.
[SPEAKER_00]: CEOs, investment groups with egos can't
win.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the part that's getting cleaned
out right now to where eventually as we go
[SPEAKER_00]: forward, you'll have cannabis operators
that have success in operation being
[SPEAKER_00]: involved with the design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like a good builder is involved with
the architect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The architect creates a project,
but the builder who builds it is part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the integration so he can say,
look, I see problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing is I see people
making changes constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see anything built and then ran as
built.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets completely modified over and over
and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time you come in, you just
like, you don't understand what anybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And salespeople are good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going off on, you go to LinkedIn,
anything you post, God help you,
[SPEAKER_00]: but anything you post, every reply is
someone trying to sell you a product to go
[SPEAKER_00]: along with that thing you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the thing is you're getting
bombarded nonstop with stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you even know what anyone's using?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know where there's success?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a database.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a blacklist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by the way, just quickly, Scott,
the, uh, the guy who ran the carpenteria
[SPEAKER_04]: facility into the ground is now the CEO of
said company.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just found that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got in the wrong business.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are they still in business?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's remarkable.
[SPEAKER_03]: That gives me hope.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to go back to, uh, still in business,
but anyway, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to, to go back to a point that Kevin
made that I think was really spot on is,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, a lot of times we come into a
facility under, you know, unfortunate
[SPEAKER_03]: circumstances, trying to make them better
and a really common pattern we see is
[SPEAKER_03]: there's an investment group that built
what they believe to be a state of the art
[SPEAKER_03]: facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually maybe, you know,
some range of a pile of shit to moderately
[SPEAKER_03]: successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't want to admit that they
built a bad facility or they don't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: admit that they made a wrong decision.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe they don't want to admit that one
of these sales people lied to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of that ego factor that
really leads to prolonged failure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and a lot of times these facilities,
like Kevin said, they might, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they might have a cultivator that ran a
four lighter and eight lighter and they
[SPEAKER_03]: try and put the common patterns are you
have investment groups that maybe don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want to admit that they made bad decisions
along the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's leading to their failure or they
don't want to admit that they have the
[SPEAKER_03]: wrong cultivator in position.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just get really, really married
to those things and just ride them off
[SPEAKER_03]: into the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would say, you know, probably the
top three reasons for failure of a
[SPEAKER_03]: facility that we see are investment group
that doesn't want to admit that they built
[SPEAKER_03]: the wrong building investment group that
doesn't want to admit they've got the
[SPEAKER_03]: wrong cultivator or a cultivator that
doesn't want to admit that he doesn't have
[SPEAKER_03]: the skills and doesn't seek the help
needed to be successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Couple of specificity questions between
the three of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: What percentage of the greenhouses you're
going into are retrofit versus new state
[SPEAKER_04]: of the art.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you're talking about the new
buildings that they build the wrong way,
[SPEAKER_04]: what are some common things that they do
that like examples of things they did
[SPEAKER_04]: wrong, even though it's a brand new
building?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, earlier on when I wasn't here,
I was listening to what you guys were
[SPEAKER_03]: saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, at the infancy of the
market, to be fair, there was a,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, there's 50% snakes and 50%,
we just don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Kevin was saying earlier,
we haven't gone this big before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's a lot of, um, guessing or
hoping, or, you know, somebody convincing
[SPEAKER_03]: you, this is the path.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it turns out not to be appropriate at
scale and it doesn't work properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for me, I, I ended up in a lot of
new greenhouses, but it's almost 50 50
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes, cause there's a lot of
retrofits that do go on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, at the end of the day,
a lot of the new stuff is even basic
[SPEAKER_02]: hoops.
[SPEAKER_02]: New PVC, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not always big, massive, fancy
greenhouses because people are scaling up
[SPEAKER_02]: to 10,000 square feet or more with PVC
hoops and trying to do ag exempt stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're getting all new plastics and
new, you know, way of doing things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so scaling up isn't always a fancy,
you know, a state of the art new
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a mixed bag, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so while there's a lot of new,
there's still a lot of retrofits going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, some of the common mistakes are just
things that are for workflow for
[SPEAKER_02]: contamination purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one of the things that we deal
with a lot, and I don't want to speak for
[SPEAKER_02]: both Kevin and Scott, but I know we all
deal with it is the cross contamination
[SPEAKER_02]: and setting up a workflow so that people
aren't going backwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really easy to have a facility
that causes people to go from clone rooms
[SPEAKER_02]: to flowering rooms or pass by the same
doors or the same areas sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't realize that some of that
stuff needs to be separated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these massive facilities,
you know, we try to create people that
[SPEAKER_02]: only work in the veg zones.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't go over to flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: The propagation people stay in the
propagation.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you, you know, tours don't
necessarily start out on the flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: rooms and then end up in the cloning
rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, which is most common.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very common because I get a lot,
I get toured around a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, you know, people are starting to
get the hang of it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it comes to the design,
you know, it makes sense on paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was somebody that just was looking at
something cool on paper, I would say,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you don't take into the
considerations that we're thinking about
[SPEAKER_02]: or the fallout that we've seen for some of
these reasons, then you'd look at these
[SPEAKER_02]: drawings and go, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like no way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I don't know,
what do you think, Kevin?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think, I think, like for me,
I see new facilities, both small ag exempt
[SPEAKER_00]: poops going in and they, I think they have
less problems with those in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: integrating how you use it because they're
more comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The newer facilities that I get to tour
their, you know, state of the art that
[SPEAKER_00]: word gets thrown around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, these things are impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that they're way too
sophisticated for an average operator to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they laid it out, they didn't lay
out the understanding that it's not normal
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't use chemical spray models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I chemically treat, I can control
most all pathogen problems, but cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is so regulated that it creates this
situation where you have to be hyper clean
[SPEAKER_00]: to the degree that like, when I show up at
jobs and I'm like, like, are you going to
[SPEAKER_00]: address me?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go, no, no, we know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I'm a fucking vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, where's my contamination shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that I noticed is that,
you know, every investment group has some
[SPEAKER_00]: attorneys on the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lawsuits aren't hard to file when your
business partner is a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really starts to create issues
where the nurseries, and even if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: in-house nursery, if it's your in-house
nursery, you have to treat it like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get sued because you're going to
end up killing your own business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for, you know, offshoot nurseries that
provide to the public, the diligence they
[SPEAKER_00]: have to put together to make sure they're
protected because there'll be no
[SPEAKER_00]: forgiveness for the mistake because the
margin is so small that you can't make it
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: In years past, we could make mistakes
because we were all in the learning curve
[SPEAKER_00]: and we all had a different level of
ability to what we could do because lack
[SPEAKER_00]: of legalization changed our ability to
actually put together stable
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that all that's in play,
man, it puts you in a hell of a vulnerable
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's where the rise of the
labs are coming in, where the technology
[SPEAKER_00]: to get around these issues with orchid,
to get around it with bananas,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get around it with strawberry,
they had to go that route because they
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't control it any other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to transfer it in our
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think that that's important for
nursery operators to understand that the
[SPEAKER_00]: technology that's coming out to deal with
these issues is expensive and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: simple to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to make sure you're clear
that that's going to be the future that's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you make the decision to be a
nursery operator, you develop partnerships
[SPEAKER_00]: with these groups or you become your own
laboratory-based system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think a lot of the conventional
agricultural practices we had in how we
[SPEAKER_00]: function prior are going to change
dramatically, just like socially with the
[SPEAKER_00]: coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this shit just changed the world
in a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really hard to convince these
facilities to make the decisions that will
[SPEAKER_03]: help them ultimately.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of our biggest obstacles is,
you know, a lot of times so many other bad
[SPEAKER_03]: things have happened that now when it's
time to make a call that will really,
[SPEAKER_03]: really help you, it's hard to pull the
trigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the runway's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: The runway's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of money they've paid to fuck
around already is excessive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so by the time we get called in,
the shit's hit the fan more than once.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's part of the problem that we run
into is that we're not always called in at
[SPEAKER_02]: the design phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not always called in when things are
about to kick off.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, here and there,
but they're few and far between.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what ends up happening is that the
shit hits the fan so many times,
[SPEAKER_02]: the runway of money is gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they don't make it this next six months
or whatever, it's over with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so can they afford or make the changes
that are necessary at this point?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do they trust us because they got
PTSD?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the thing too is that, you know,
you don't want to spend any money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have to hear one more motherfucker
tell me they want to pick my mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to pick your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to spend any money on the
initial, but they will beg you to come in
[SPEAKER_00]: and pull this shit out of a trench.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, it's so much cheaper to
not make the mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's an arrogance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, like I said, I kind of like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that the arrogance gets beat back
because it, it lets there be a more
[SPEAKER_00]: normality of the operators that are coming
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everyone was so smart from the onset,
there would be no room for the small
[SPEAKER_00]: operator.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I see myself still as a
small operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I want to be as a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never want to do large canopy for my own
production because it's not in line with
[SPEAKER_00]: what I do, but it doesn't change the fact
that I know that we have a need for the
[SPEAKER_00]: larger operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that there's a humility period
that's taken place and now you'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be able to come into these
operations as they move them and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, look, this is a strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's figure out, you know, how do we move
forward correctly without putting
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves into a fucking graveyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really when I get brought in a
lot is like, you guys are ready to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you're going to recover the
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then the, no one has any
faith.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, like I said, I always look for the guy
that's got the huge bags under his eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: and fucking retreating hairline because
he's the guy with the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he took it bad, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just want to be told the truth by
someone and everyone who's involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: these big operations doesn't want to lose
the jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to miss out on the big payday
when it sells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone thinks it's going to get sold for
a billion dollars and everyone's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: dance in the money bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's farming and it's just so
weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's surreal to see it in person.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
