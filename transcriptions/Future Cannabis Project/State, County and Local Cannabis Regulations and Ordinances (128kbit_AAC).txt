[SPEAKER_05]: Lynn is going to talk to us about two
things today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Federal, so you're going to learn about
the feds, and also she's going to give you
[SPEAKER_05]: a short summary on what's going on in the
state.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the greatest challenges right now
is lack of information and misinformation
[SPEAKER_06]: about what's going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is a great way to educate the
broader community that's directly
[SPEAKER_06]: interested in this issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: So on November 8th, we legalized cannabis
in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a long haul, and I know a lot of
people had different opinions about it,
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's okay, and there was a lot of
people involved in the drafting,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I think it was really the best piece
of legislation that we could have possibly
[SPEAKER_06]: come out of there with, given the broad
array of stakes holders who had a say in
[SPEAKER_06]: this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody from the governor, to the
police, to the industry, to patients,
[SPEAKER_06]: to anti-marijuana groups, and on and on
and on.
[SPEAKER_06]: But really, the biggest task is
implementing this law.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people say, hey, we won,
we're done, and you have crazy things
[SPEAKER_06]: going on, like the Prop 64 compliant
cannabis stores.
[SPEAKER_06]: That does not exist, and there is no such
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have lots of people taking advantage
of new folks like you trying to get into
[SPEAKER_06]: the industry, saying, you know,
give me $20,000, I'll get you a license.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are no licenses.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, just a few cities in the state have
licenses, but for the most part,
[SPEAKER_06]: there are no licenses.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody who wants to say, you know,
$20,000, I'll give you a license,
[SPEAKER_06]: don't believe them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I'm gonna do tonight is really just
talk about two huge issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first is probably the most important,
because with what's going on in
[SPEAKER_06]: Washington, D.C., we may not be able to
actually have a legal cannabis market here
[SPEAKER_06]: in California, despite what happened on
November 8th.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you may know that the Attorney General
of the United States, Jeff Sessions,
[SPEAKER_06]: thinks marijuana is the worst thing he's
ever, yeah, boo.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many people know about Jeff Sessions?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just raise your hand if you have a good
sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, most of the people, so I'm just
gonna give you one of his quotes to give
[SPEAKER_06]: you an idea of who he is.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said he thought the Ku Klux Klan was a
pretty good group until he found out they
[SPEAKER_06]: used marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he continues to threaten, yeah,
so this is who we're dealing with,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: He continues to threaten to come in and
shut down marijuana markets in the states
[SPEAKER_06]: that have recreational marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has said for the most part he's not
going to interfere with medical unless
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a gross violation going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: But he is threatening, pending the
resources he can garner, to come in and
[SPEAKER_06]: shut down Colorado, Washington,
California.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we've done at the Drug Policy
Alliance, and I don't know if I mentioned
[SPEAKER_06]: that, you said who I was?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I'm Lynn Lyman, sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the state director for the Drug Policy
Alliance.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we work on more than just marijuana,
let me say that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are trying to end the drug war
outright.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a bill this year in the
legislature.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Assembly Bill 1578, and we have
information about it in the back.
[SPEAKER_06]: My colleague, Kat Packer, back there by
the table, raise your hand, Kat.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of you may already know her.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's information about the bill
there, but essentially what the bill is is
[SPEAKER_06]: it says that California law enforcement
and tax dollars cannot be used to help the
[SPEAKER_06]: feds interfere with our marijuana market,
absent a court order.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that doesn't stop intervention
completely, because the feds can still
[SPEAKER_06]: come in on their own.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's only 4,000 DEA agents for the
whole country, so there's only so many
[SPEAKER_06]: people they're gonna be able to send in
without the help of our local cops.
[SPEAKER_06]: As you might imagine, the police lobby is
pushing back really hard against this
[SPEAKER_06]: bill, as is the League of Cities.
[SPEAKER_06]: The League of Cities is one of the
strongest lobbying arms in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_06]: They represent the 480 cities.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they are lobbying along with the
police chiefs to stop this bill,
[SPEAKER_06]: because they want to be able to cooperate
with the feds and shut you down.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is exactly what they wanna do.
[SPEAKER_06]: They wanna bring in the wrath of the
federal government to get this done.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's Assembly Bill 1578.
[SPEAKER_06]: The author is Assemblyman Reggie
Jones-Sawyer right here at a South LA.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't know who he is, you should
write it down and Google him.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's only a handful of
cannabis-friendly, truly cannabis-friendly
[SPEAKER_06]: legislators in Sacramento, and so you
should know who they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should contribute to their political
campaigns.
[SPEAKER_06]: They really stick their necks out there
for our issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would ask you all, if you work for
us, if you work for an organization or a
[SPEAKER_06]: business, we are asking for letters of
support.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you go see Kat in the back or see
me afterwards, we can tell you how to do
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, please sign up with the Drug
Policy Alliance list, because we'll be
[SPEAKER_06]: sending out alerts about what's going on
the next vote.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did make it through our first
committee, which was the Public Safety
[SPEAKER_06]: Committee.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did win that vote last Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the next vote's gonna be on the
Assembly floor.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we expect it to be a pretty big
battle.
[SPEAKER_06]: If any of you have relationships with your
local mayor, city council members,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're trying to get cannabis-friendly
cities to come out and say that they
[SPEAKER_06]: support this bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: West Hollywood, I believe, will be the
first city to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That vote's coming up next week here in
West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the Assembly Bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the federal piece.
[SPEAKER_06]: Other things going on from the federal
level, really, at this point, is just
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to stop the madness.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bills that we've been moving for many
years in the federal government are still
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're bipartisan bills.
[SPEAKER_06]: They get more Republican votes each year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are bills that address the
banking problem, address PTSD for
[SPEAKER_06]: veterans.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in terms of an actual marijuana
legalization bill at the federal level,
[SPEAKER_06]: nobody's bothering with that at this
point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, we're just trying to fix some
of the issues we've been trying to fix for
[SPEAKER_06]: years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm gonna move on to the state,
because I think that's where there's so
[SPEAKER_06]: much going on, and way more than I can
talk to you about tonight.
[SPEAKER_06]: But how many people have heard of the
Governor's Trailer Bill language?
[SPEAKER_06]: Raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Prop 64, like MRSA, or now MCRSA,
are both intended to go into
[SPEAKER_06]: implementation on January 1st.
[SPEAKER_06]: So licensing is supposed to begin on
January 1st.
[SPEAKER_06]: Under Prop 64, because it's a
voter-mandated initiative, they have to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or they will be in violation, and we would
be able to sue them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they have to start recreational by the
1st.
[SPEAKER_06]: They already started on medical.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do believe that both licensing types
will go into effect then.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there is a bloody battle going on
between now, really just the rest of the
[SPEAKER_06]: next month, about what those regs are
gonna look like, and what the framework is
[SPEAKER_06]: going to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there were differences between Prop 64
and the medical regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you'll hear this term
reconciliation.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what everybody's talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: How is the government gonna reconcile the
differences between the two bills?
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a number of issues at stake.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, if you are trying to get into this
business in a serious way, you really
[SPEAKER_06]: wanna know about the Trailer Bill
language.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Trailer Bill 200.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I know that there's some people in
here who have specific questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: It touches on everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Governor put out his language.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, that's what reconciliation is.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the medical regs.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then a couple of weeks ago,
the Governor put out his hybrid,
[SPEAKER_06]: essentially, of how he wants things to go
forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the process is that for the next
month, he has to negotiate with the
[SPEAKER_06]: legislature about what's gonna be in
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are many people in the legislature
who aren't happy with what he did.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some people who are.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some advocates who are happier
with him.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are others who aren't.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's people all across the spectrum on
the issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the final language will be part of
the California state budget.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how it works.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the budget has to pass by June 1st.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's not a lot of time to weigh in
on everything from dual licensing,
[SPEAKER_06]: co-location, medical cards, testing and
labeling.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything is almost like everything is up
for grabs again, and now we have a month
[SPEAKER_06]: to figure it all out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just gonna pause and see if anybody
has a specific question about
[SPEAKER_06]: reconciliation or the Trailer Bill
language, because there are dozens of
[SPEAKER_06]: issues, and I don't have time to go
through them all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anybody have a question?
[SPEAKER_06]: You said something about co-location,
co-licensing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you explain that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Co-location.
[SPEAKER_06]: Co-location.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what the governor is proposing on one
hand is a unitary regulatory system
[SPEAKER_06]: between recreational and medical with two
different license types, and a medical
[SPEAKER_06]: license and a recreational license.
[SPEAKER_06]: That part we think is a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason is that when the feds come,
they're coming for recreational.
[SPEAKER_06]: So anybody who really wants to hold on and
hold their place in the medical market,
[SPEAKER_06]: it makes sense so you don't lose
everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: That if you are gonna lose something,
you just lose the one side of your
[SPEAKER_06]: business.
[SPEAKER_06]: What the governor also did that some
people have more of a concern with is he
[SPEAKER_06]: said that you can't be in the same space.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can have both a medical and a
recreational, say, retail license or
[SPEAKER_06]: manufacturer's license.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't be in the same physical space.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the kind of issue that me as a
social justice advocate, we're going to
weigh in.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they're important issues for those of
you in the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a number of groups who
represent the industry in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_06]: The California Cannabis Industry
Association, the California Manufacturers
[SPEAKER_06]: Association, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a number of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if one of these pertains to the
part of the business you're in,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're gonna want to get involved with
those folks.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that is the issue at stake,
that he's saying you can't be in the same
[SPEAKER_06]: physical space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I'm Aaron with Canister Brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you just go a little deeper on that
medical and recreational side in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: what they're allowing you, if you go
recreational, what that will affect?
[SPEAKER_06]: The licensing itself?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, so in 2015, the legislature passed,
so in 2015, I see you're getting your
[SPEAKER_06]: camera, so I'm gonna say it again for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like video tape.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in 2015, the legislature passed and the
governor signed was then MRSA,
[SPEAKER_06]: the Medical Marijuana Regulatory Act or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was the first time in California's
20-year history of legal cannabis that we
[SPEAKER_06]: have had state regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: But those regulations are not set to take
place and to go into effect until January
[SPEAKER_06]: 1st of 2018.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we wrote Prop 64, we aligned the
timing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they have to give out the recreational
licenses in January 1st as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's been a lot of talk about
they're not gonna be ready, it's not gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: happen, particularly from the assembly
members who want to delay licensing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are saying if you delay recreational
licensing, you have violated Prop 64,
[SPEAKER_06]: we will take you to court.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't say that about medical,
but we can say that about recreational.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the other hand, the safest license to
have right now because of the federal
[SPEAKER_06]: government is gonna be the medical license
because Jeff Sessions has made it clear
[SPEAKER_06]: that he's not as interested in shutting
down medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's interested in keeping recreational
marijuana to keeping prohibition going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's two license types.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I answer the question?
[SPEAKER_03]: It does and my follow-up is, if you go
medical and don't opt for the recreational
[SPEAKER_03]: right now, will that impact future to get
recreational or would you still be on a
[SPEAKER_03]: list to be able to get that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that anybody who's a good
actor, so you try to set up your business,
[SPEAKER_06]: you try to follow the rules, hire an
attorney, take the time to get all the
[SPEAKER_06]: right permits, make sure you're a thousand
feet from the school, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're doing that as a medical
business right now, you are gonna be in,
[SPEAKER_06]: believe it or not, a very small percentage
of what we call the good actors.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are the ones that the cities
want to get the recreational licenses to.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's about building a relationship with
your city, with your community.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you give back?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have some kind of community give
back program, community service?
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are the medical actors who are
gonna be first in line for those
[SPEAKER_06]: recreational licenses.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't think it takes you out of the
running to wait.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there might be an argument for
spending more time really working on your
[SPEAKER_06]: medical business, building your
reputation, and then in a few years when
[SPEAKER_06]: things settle down, you know, going for
the recreational license.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you said they needed two different
spaces out apart, two different addresses
[SPEAKER_01]: right next to each other, what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that wasn't addressed and that was
exactly our question.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're just door to door,
is it okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have to be a foot?
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't say.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's also not the best written piece
because it's very vague.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says no co-location essentially.
[SPEAKER_06]: The same premises is what it says.
[SPEAKER_06]: It cannot be on the same premises.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so those are the kinds of details
that are now being negotiated in
[SPEAKER_06]: Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quick question about transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now when we try to move it to our
store, we can't move it legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just wondering if they're gonna
give transportation licenses or how we can
[SPEAKER_00]: legally move our stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: The transportation license is key.
[SPEAKER_06]: So right now under and out, so obviously
not for business purposes, but under an
[SPEAKER_06]: ounce is now legal for transporting 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: No violation of the law if you have under
of an ounce in your vehicle.
[SPEAKER_06]: More than that, you are definitely in the
hot water right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: But January 1st, I believe the
transportation licenses, there's not a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of controversy about that particular
license type.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think everybody knows we need it and I
think it's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't heard anything about not doing
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you have more than one license?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes under Prop 64 and yes under MRSA.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many license types you can have is one
of the topics of negotiation under
[SPEAKER_06]: reconciliation right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it's called vertical
integration.
[SPEAKER_06]: So can you have different license types?
[SPEAKER_06]: We allowed that under Prop 64,
except for testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Testing always has to be a separate
license.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have a testing license,
you can't have any other licenses.
[SPEAKER_06]: Under MRSA, there was more restrictions
around which license types you could have,
[SPEAKER_06]: depending on the one you already had.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the governor's reconciliation
essentially says we're just gonna go with
[SPEAKER_06]: the way it is in Prop 64 and let everybody
have, basically allow vertical integration
[SPEAKER_06]: except for testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing that the governor did
though, that doesn't concern me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, we wrote that into Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what does concern me is that he
stripped it of the anti-monopoly language
[SPEAKER_06]: we had put in.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are concerned about monopolies and
about big businesses kind of taking this
[SPEAKER_06]: over.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had done two things to prevent
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We delayed the large cultivation licenses
for five years.
[SPEAKER_06]: We said nobody gets the type five
licenses, which was 22,000 square feet or
[SPEAKER_06]: larger.
[SPEAKER_06]: So five year delay on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we said you have to get your
license renewed every year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the issues that the regulators
have to review specifically is whether
[SPEAKER_06]: you're trying to build a monopoly,
whether getting you this license could
[SPEAKER_06]: possibly lead towards a monopoly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they get to make that decision every
year.
[SPEAKER_06]: The governor took those pieces out in the
current reconciliation language.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it feels more open to monopoly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we will probably have to weigh in
on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're a small business and that's
something you want to weigh in on,
[SPEAKER_06]: again, some of these industry associations
are certainly doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me talk about one last issue that may
not be as important to you, but is so
[SPEAKER_06]: important to us at the Drug Policy
Alliance.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think for people who've been in the
cannabis industry for a long time,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is an important piece.
[SPEAKER_06]: So under Prop 64, we denied
discrimination, I'm sorry, we prohibited
[SPEAKER_06]: discrimination against people with a prior
drug conviction on their record.
[SPEAKER_06]: So right now, most of the people who've
been in this 20 year regulated,
[SPEAKER_06]: quasi-regulated market in the medical
cannabis industry have been risking their
[SPEAKER_06]: lives.
[SPEAKER_06]: And many of them have done serious time in
jail and in prison.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even beyond cannabis, we know that
when you look at who uses and sells drugs
[SPEAKER_06]: in this country, it's roughly equal across
racial lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: When it comes to marijuana, white people
sell and use.
[SPEAKER_06]: At higher rate, but for all drugs,
it's roughly equal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet if you are black or Latino,
you are far more likely to be arrested and
[SPEAKER_06]: convicted for a drug crime.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are black, you're four times more
likely to get a marijuana felony.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're Latino, you're two times more
likely to get a marijuana felony.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have been building in this
discrimination, and then it becomes
[SPEAKER_06]: institutional racism.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once you have a record,
you can't even get a certificate to be a
[SPEAKER_06]: hairstylist.
[SPEAKER_06]: In this state, if you have a criminal
conviction on your record.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it seems so crazy for the first time,
legalize something that has been a
[SPEAKER_06]: controlled substance and say, and yet all
you people who have been doing this,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can't get into this market because you
have these records.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the people with those records tend to
be predominantly black and brown young
[SPEAKER_06]: men.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we fought hard to have this provision
in Prop 64 to basically say they cannot
[SPEAKER_06]: deny a license based on somebody 's
record.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're trying to undo it,
particularly in the assembly.
[SPEAKER_06]: The police chiefs, the law enforcement
lobby, this is the one that really sticks
[SPEAKER_06]: in their craw.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got it into medical, into the medical
regulations that you discriminate against
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody based on their record.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the reasons in the end we had
to oppose that legislation, even though we
[SPEAKER_06]: worked on it for a decade.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as we could go to the voters with the
initiative, we did the right thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we said there will be no
discrimination in licensing under Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the other thing I'm gonna ask of you,
since you're all on this list,
[SPEAKER_06]: or ask Jackie to ask of you, is to sign on
to a petition about this to the state
[SPEAKER_06]: assembly that we'll be distributing
probably in the next week.
[SPEAKER_06]: So please, when you get that email from
Jackie or from us, open it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Take the time to sign on because we have
to let them know that the whole industry
[SPEAKER_06]: is not okay with that kind of
discrimination.
[SPEAKER_06]: And not just let it be me and the industry
and double ACP standing up there by
[SPEAKER_06]: ourselves opposing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what happened two years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: So please, don't let us go to sexual load
on that issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next up, so we just talked about the
federal.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're gonna talk about the county.
[SPEAKER_05]: So LA county.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is going on in Los Angeles county?
[SPEAKER_05]: And why are they doing the things that
they want, or trying to do the things that
[SPEAKER_05]: they want to do?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna find out about that from
Jonathan Svetko right over here from
[SPEAKER_05]: Angeles Emeralds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_05]: He has been working his butt off in the
county.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone else has been focused on state
and city.
[SPEAKER_05]: This man right here is taking charge in
the county.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's gonna really fill us in.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're gonna be shocked if you know some
of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's bring up Jonathan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the next few minutes, let me try my
best to crunch down what we've been doing
[SPEAKER_04]: in a little over a year, about a year and
a half now within LA county.
[SPEAKER_04]: My journey on this started back around
February, March of last year when we had
[SPEAKER_04]: the ban craze that went up and down the
state.
[SPEAKER_04]: The state's, at the time, MRSA regulations
pretty much said that if the local
[SPEAKER_04]: jurisdictions did not regulate,
that they had the option to either adopt
[SPEAKER_04]: what the state did or just ban altogether.
[SPEAKER_04]: Around that time is when the LA county
ended up deciding that they were gonna put
[SPEAKER_04]: in a ban, and they already had to be a
little clear here.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a ban already on dispensaries
within what is called the unincorporated
[SPEAKER_04]: LA territories of LA county.
[SPEAKER_04]: So LA county in general is, or they have
88 cities that are incorporated within it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have a very large portion of that
territory that is unincorporated,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is where it came to affect me.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ban that already existed there was for
dispensaries and delivery services,
[SPEAKER_04]: or at least the dispensaries part.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the ban that they ended up putting in
coming in last year ended up extending
[SPEAKER_04]: that, expanding it to manufacturing,
delivery services, and cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So while they never expressly allowed for
those portions of the cannabis industry to
[SPEAKER_04]: be in there, within the medical side,
they also didn't ban it until that moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when that ended up happening,
pardon me, when that ended up happening,
[SPEAKER_04]: we quickly sought out any organization,
any group that we could attach ourselves
[SPEAKER_04]: to, to see how we can help out,
what we can do our little part in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And along the ways we certainly met each
and every one of the LA city groups that
[SPEAKER_04]: certainly have been working together as
best as they could on that, towards the
[SPEAKER_04]: fight on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But none of them did we notice have any,
I don't wanna say interest necessarily,
[SPEAKER_04]: but their focus wasn't in on the LA county
unincorporated areas at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we quickly found ourselves pretty much
alone, trying to stand up against this
[SPEAKER_04]: ban.
[SPEAKER_04]: We ended up taking a, we went to a
conference down in San Diego where we
[SPEAKER_04]: ended up meeting California Cannabis
Industry Association.
[SPEAKER_04]: And down there someone in the audience
ended up asking what are they doing in the
[SPEAKER_04]: LA area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was no focus again at that time
from that group itself in LA, and I
[SPEAKER_04]: foolishly raised my hand and said,
well I know a little something about it,
[SPEAKER_04]: and turned out and said that that
conference turned around with everyone
[SPEAKER_04]: else kinda asking me as if I was someone
that was an authority on that when it
[SPEAKER_04]: wasn't, when all I'm doing is try to get
the word out there and see where I can get
[SPEAKER_04]: help.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shortly after that I had one of their,
I had the Deputy Director of California
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis Industry Association reach out to
meet with us, and he was thankfully
[SPEAKER_04]: located in Redondo Beach where I myself
am.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from there we started making plans on
how we could fight back against this ban.
[SPEAKER_04]: Reaching out to anyone and everyone,
friends that we could at the time,
[SPEAKER_04]: many of you probably know her,
Tracy Ryan from Canna Kids, certainly came
[SPEAKER_04]: out, helped us out with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're always grateful for her on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we stood up there, the first
meeting we had, and there was a good six
[SPEAKER_04]: of us, six to seven of us I think total at
that time, that went to speak against
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we were looking at is a county
was looking to introduce a ban that would
[SPEAKER_04]: have been extended for up to two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they had their first portion that would
have been great, we're gonna have this in
[SPEAKER_04]: for a year with an optional second year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we ended up finding and effecting
change on is they ended up coming back and
[SPEAKER_04]: saying, you know what, we're gonna hold
back and we're gonna just do this for 45
[SPEAKER_04]: days and review this from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had our first chance of what it
understood to kind of play within this
[SPEAKER_04]: game and also what that victory kind of
meant for us to where rather than them
[SPEAKER_04]: just saying we're gonna do the full two
years, we're gonna start off with the 45
[SPEAKER_04]: days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since then we obviously ended up
organizing better, trying to get our
[SPEAKER_04]: efforts going on there, and we were
quickly introduced to Drug Policy
[SPEAKER_04]: Alliance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have been phenomenal partners in
trying to change what's going on in the
[SPEAKER_04]: county.
[SPEAKER_04]: The education piece that Lynn mentioned on
there, it's something that I can't stress
[SPEAKER_04]: enough how much of a moving target it's
been, not just for us as operators,
[SPEAKER_04]: because the concept keeps changing,
but also for the county.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's not something that you can,
we've learned quickly, you can't expect
[SPEAKER_04]: them to know everything and everything all
the time, which gives us an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_04]: educate them as best we can.
[SPEAKER_04]: And along the way we had a discussion last
year with one of the supervisors and they
[SPEAKER_04]: were very active in trying to understand
how they could raise funds towards their
[SPEAKER_04]: efforts with homelessness, fighting
homelessness within LA County.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you may have heard last year where
the county ended up introducing at one
[SPEAKER_04]: point a bill that would have actually
taxed cannabis to help towards that
[SPEAKER_04]: homeless cause they were looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was due to the efforts that we
came out there, we ended up speaking to
[SPEAKER_04]: them and it was interesting that they had
no clue at the time that Aurora,
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado ended up using its revenues from
taxes on cannabis to go towards their
[SPEAKER_04]: homeless crisis they had.
[SPEAKER_04]: That unfortunately was not as much of a
win as we wanted to, and while we
[SPEAKER_04]: disagreed with them taxing us before
regulations, we saw that as a great
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunity to have a foot in the door to
start the discussion.
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple weeks after they passed the idea
of having that bill put on there in
[SPEAKER_04]: November for that, they actually repealed
that because unfortunately United Way,
[SPEAKER_04]: one of the largest homeless advocate
groups out there, decided that they did
[SPEAKER_04]: not want cannabis money to go to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they ended up repealing that altogether
and that died two weeks afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Since that time, to speed up a little bit
on this stuff, in January, January,
[SPEAKER_04]: February or so, the supervisors ended up
finally putting in their recommendations
[SPEAKER_04]: as to how they want to see some
regulations go forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are two aspects of it, one on the
reclamation side that we disagree with
[SPEAKER_04]: strongly.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is if you end up taking a load and you
look at the unincorporated area of LA
[SPEAKER_04]: County, the richest resource they have is
the agricultural zone land.
[SPEAKER_04]: That land takes up 39% of the zoned areas
within unincorporated LA.
[SPEAKER_04]: The supervisors proposed to not allow any
type of cannabis based activity within the
[SPEAKER_04]: agricultural land.
[SPEAKER_04]: And instead, they want to allow for
cultivation, manufacturing, so on and so
[SPEAKER_04]: forth, but only within the industrial and
commercial zoned areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: By comparison, we look at those two parts,
they together make up just about 1% of the
[SPEAKER_04]: total zoned areas within LA County.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when the supervisors have already
stated that their goal is to maximize the
[SPEAKER_04]: transition of this illicit market into a
regulated market, if they're going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: looking to do that, we don't agree that
giving us only 1% of these zoned areas is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to allow for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we disagree with them on that and of
course we have more education process
[SPEAKER_04]: going forward on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But more curiously, what's really
disturbing to us is towards the end of
[SPEAKER_04]: that, first meeting or that meeting where
they introduced their regulation
[SPEAKER_04]: recommendations, we had one supervisor
that tacked on a last-minute amendment to
[SPEAKER_04]: where she had suggested that she wants to
clean out essentially all the illicit
[SPEAKER_04]: operators within the county itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when asked where they would pull the
funding from, the CEO's office quickly
[SPEAKER_04]: volunteered that last year they ended up
winning a settlement against Wells Fargo,
[SPEAKER_04]: which well kind of heard how they ended up
doing this stuff with their consumers last
[SPEAKER_04]: year, and that they have $25 million
sitting around that they can use towards
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is extremely alarming to us because
again, if their goal is to maximize the
[SPEAKER_04]: transition to the regulated market,
why in the world would they spend $25
[SPEAKER_04]: million towards closing down these
operators first?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've been fighting that now for the
last several months and maybe some of you
[SPEAKER_04]: might have gotten some of our e-mails from
everyone or seen some of the stuff around.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been an interesting battle because
we're trying to do this education piece
[SPEAKER_04]: again towards them, trying to tell them
that that is not the proper way to be
[SPEAKER_04]: spending these funds, if spending them at
all makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been waiting for a while to get this
report that was going to come out from the
[SPEAKER_04]: sheriff's office, from the county council
and the DA's office as to how they would
[SPEAKER_04]: propose to spend these $25 million.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the report's been a little elusive for
us, and thankfully along the way we had
[SPEAKER_04]: Cat did some great work on this,
to where we discovered the report was
[SPEAKER_04]: actually attached to the previous mention
of the Wells Fargo settlement back in
[SPEAKER_04]: November.
[SPEAKER_04]: So had Cat not been looking back in
November to find out where this report
[SPEAKER_04]: was, we would not have seen that their
recommendations came out to actually using
[SPEAKER_04]: about $20 million of this 25 to actually
close down all the operators.
[SPEAKER_04]: Currently they have a list of about 70
operators.
[SPEAKER_04]: So 70 operators and that is focused
primarily now on the dispensary side of
[SPEAKER_04]: things because they're certainly most
visible when it comes to this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are using third party data
practically just using weed maps to find
[SPEAKER_04]: out who these guys are.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's our stated statement on
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The $20 million piece is a little
concerning us on there because part of
[SPEAKER_04]: that if you look in the footnotes on the
report, it ends up saying that the
[SPEAKER_04]: sheriff's department was actually asking
for about $15 million alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So out of three different groups,
the sheriffs wanted $15 million of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The county council or the report ended up
suggesting to give them only $3.8 million,
[SPEAKER_04]: but if you do the math and you read
between the lines, there still is a
[SPEAKER_04]: potential where altogether there's about
$30 million that they want to use to shut
[SPEAKER_04]: down the operators.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as we keep doing this education piece
trying to discuss with the board,
[SPEAKER_04]: the board of supervisors on how that is
not the right way to enforce before
[SPEAKER_04]: regulating us, we have been fighting that
to where they have delayed this report to
[SPEAKER_04]: be published around six times already in
the last two months.
[SPEAKER_04]: This last Tuesday though, they finally
ended up sitting down to listen to this
[SPEAKER_04]: report.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the report, part of that was a
presentation given and the presentation of
[SPEAKER_04]: showing that they have currently closed
down 31 operators in the last couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: years.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have 49 that they have enforced
against at the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are an additional 26 that are
currently under investigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they want to use these funds now to
actually go after them to shut down the
[SPEAKER_04]: operators.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been a challenge for us as far as
trying to organize everyone for it so that
[SPEAKER_04]: we can, you know, fight back against this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of this is then because there is what
everyone pretty much calls this
[SPEAKER_04]: whack-a-mole game.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many people in the industry certainly
understand or have seen how they will shut
[SPEAKER_04]: down the operators.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll pop back up in a couple of days
and continue on, including some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: operators themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not been something that they have
seen or taken as seriously as they needed
[SPEAKER_04]: to for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This last Tuesday though, we had enough
people come out to the meeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's something that I'm going to call
out for you guys as well too to please
[SPEAKER_04]: understand that this fight is still not
over.
[SPEAKER_04]: But while the report was heard over there,
70 of us ended up showing up to this
[SPEAKER_04]: meeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: 70 of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me stress that because we started this
with only six, seven of us actually showed
[SPEAKER_04]: up the first time a year ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: 70 of us showed up to give our testimony,
to show them why it was not the right way
[SPEAKER_04]: to regulate, to enforce before they
regulate against us.
[SPEAKER_04]: To show them that if they ended up doing
that, it would also promote a illicit
[SPEAKER_04]: dangerous market as opposed to having safe
access for patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at the map on there,
you'll see clearly that in the northern
[SPEAKER_04]: part of the county, which is the largest
unincorporated areas on there,
[SPEAKER_04]: patients would literally need to drive
about two hours in order to get to the
[SPEAKER_04]: nearest legal dispensary so they can get
the medicine that they need.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not something that's very practical
on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to say that at the end of that
meeting, the supervisors decided not to
[SPEAKER_04]: vote one way or another on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And have withheld it and have only at this
moment accepted the reports coming in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we take that as partly a victory that
we ended up holding back the enforcement
[SPEAKER_04]: piece on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's also, there was another point in
this thing that was really interesting to
[SPEAKER_04]: see the change happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have now started to use the rhetoric
that there are good operators within a
[SPEAKER_04]: county.
[SPEAKER_04]: The narrative has changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the supervisors who ended up
previously at the meetings ended up
[SPEAKER_04]: stating that she recognizes that we have
won as far as Prop 64 goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some data on that I want to give you
on that real quickly is that on the county
[SPEAKER_04]: side of things, the county voted actually
59.5% in favor of Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that means each and every of the five
districts ended up voting in favor of it
[SPEAKER_04]: as well too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That same supervisor at that previous
meeting ended up stating that while she
[SPEAKER_04]: recognized that she has to regulate
according to what the people said,
[SPEAKER_04]: she still said that marijuana was a
gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we took quite some exception to
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we had our meetings with them
afterwards on that, we tried to understand
[SPEAKER_04]: where they were getting their information
from.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it that they're pooling their
facts from?
[SPEAKER_04]: And quite frankly, in the end,
what we got was a lot of crossed arms and
[SPEAKER_04]: telling us that that supervisor has a
doctor friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the doctor friend told her.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is what she's basing her opinion
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we're angry on that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's give it a little chance here as
well too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to put that out there because it is
really about educating them so they
[SPEAKER_04]: understand what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So part of our education piece has also
been we've been fortunate enough that they
[SPEAKER_04]: have a department within there that is
called the Office of Marijuana Management.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Office of Marijuana Management is
made up of several different departments
[SPEAKER_04]: from the county, about 12 of them or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they all together are going to have to
coordinate their efforts on writing these
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We ended up having the opportunity to take
them out to Palm Desert and to Palm
[SPEAKER_04]: Springs so they could see what a licensed
facility looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we took them first to a cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the cultivation site, it was something
that was good for them to understand
[SPEAKER_04]: because they did not understand the power
consumption piece that comes into
[SPEAKER_04]: restricting a market to strictly indoor
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't advocate that it should be
looking to obviously give the largest
[SPEAKER_04]: amount of opportunity for people to make
this transition.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we want that agricultural piece within
the county opened up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Outdoor, greenhouse, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was hopeful, it was nice for them to
see because they didn't understand this
[SPEAKER_04]: one cultivation site ended up using 4,000
amps worth of power.
[SPEAKER_04]: When on average, for those of you who may
not know, your home will have about 100 to
[SPEAKER_04]: 200 amps.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they understand now they're getting to
the point where they understand the
[SPEAKER_04]: electrical concerns that will go on the
grid as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also on the dispensary site,
we've got to take them for that and we're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to continue on with the extraction
piece, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have that opportunity and the reason
I bring that up is because after Tuesday's
[SPEAKER_04]: meeting, we had ended up having joined to
a second meeting on Wednesday on there
[SPEAKER_04]: where we were informed that this Office of
Marijuana Management is actually going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be changing its name to the Office of
Cannabis Management.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we take that as a really good sign,
as an indicator that a county does intend
[SPEAKER_04]: to regulate soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: They understand the issues that are behind
the stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the stigma that can be caused by
causing, calling it marijuana,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, so those are some of the
successes that we're seeing in this thing
[SPEAKER_04]: on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to kind of point out more than
anything else and sum it up to give you
[SPEAKER_04]: guys a chance to ask any questions you
may.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the county side now going forward,
we have held them back obviously from
[SPEAKER_04]: putting this enforcement piece out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't mean that it's finalized.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not done by any means.
[SPEAKER_04]: The money itself is still there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They still can use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They still have the temptation for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need to still start continuing on
this discussion, this narrative with what
[SPEAKER_04]: it means to be a good operator.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you will see our group along with DPA
and others and CCIA to start doing efforts
[SPEAKER_04]: in the next several weeks as to defining
what it means to be a good operator,
[SPEAKER_04]: doing community outreach, showing that we
want to obey the guidelines that are set
[SPEAKER_04]: forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of the operators themselves haven't
had a chance to really read through that
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff to understand what they need to
follow by.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on that piece, that's where we say we
want to reach out to everyone here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you can tell others as well too,
we need more support as this goes forward
[SPEAKER_04]: because we are fighting a huge battle.
[SPEAKER_04]: The county itself intends its regulations
to be a piece that will be distributed
[SPEAKER_04]: towards the other cities within the county
that have not done the regulations yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be an interesting thing
because one thing that we've recognized as
[SPEAKER_04]: well too, for instance, the county ends up
having their environmental department that
[SPEAKER_04]: actually is contracted out to 85 of the 88
cities.
[SPEAKER_04]: The same also kind of goes through with
their fire department as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when they're writing these regulations,
these cities that could also write their
[SPEAKER_04]: own regulations need to find a way to be
copacetic between the two because you're
[SPEAKER_04]: not going to have fire department come in
and say, oh, I step into this side of the
[SPEAKER_04]: street.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that means I've got to regulate
differently than I would on the county
side.
[SPEAKER_04]: But all that's going to be a group effort.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whether you are yourself within the
unincorporated area that we're discussing,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're fighting on this a lot, or within
one of the other incorporated cities,
[SPEAKER_04]: I really would like you guys to have your
help and please join us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come over where you can so we can work
together towards getting that figured out.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much, Jonathan.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have time for questions for him and
he'll be around afterwards if you need to
[SPEAKER_05]: talk to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Aaron with Canada Sewer Brands again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell me how this county regulation
would be associated with the Bureau of
[SPEAKER_03]: Medicinal Cannabis Regulation from a state
level?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they talking between those
organizations or is it just kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: isolated regulating?
[SPEAKER_04]: So on this one, I want to refer back to
the meeting that Kat and I ended up
[SPEAKER_04]: attending on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really encouraging.
[SPEAKER_04]: At a previous meeting, she ended up
hearing a lot of rhetoric that was very
[SPEAKER_04]: discouraging as to what they understood
the issues to be aligned as far as
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations go.
[SPEAKER_04]: The county has proven this last Wednesday
that they are finally listening.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are seriously learning.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're educating themselves on how this
enforcement piece, along with regulations
[SPEAKER_04]: and everything else, will work on the
state level as well as local.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I understood your question
correctly, it was a matter of are they
[SPEAKER_04]: discussing this with the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_04]: We seem to see indication at this point
that they do, finally.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, we also have their
ear.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are able to educate them and provide
them the information they need for that as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are you suggesting to them to have some
continuity between state and local?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I mean, it gets really gray.
[SPEAKER_03]: The state can say one thing, but it really
comes down to what the city itself says or
[SPEAKER_03]: the county in this case.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, on the county end of things,
they're concerned, they're focused right
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are recognizing that the state
certainly has their piece to take care of.
[SPEAKER_04]: The county has the other stuff that they
certainly were concerned with right now is
[SPEAKER_04]: how do they regulate in a way that makes
sense with also the other surrounding
[SPEAKER_04]: communities around us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way, you're not literally going to
be different from one side of the street
[SPEAKER_04]: to the other, and also how that affects
all the other cities within the county
[SPEAKER_04]: itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're understanding, at least enough,
this is their lane.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a challenge because they've
tried to introduce certain ideas that
[SPEAKER_04]: we're trying to educate them from.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have to spend their resources
and energy on because the state is going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be taking care of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Courtney right here, who's in addition
to being one of my volunteers,
[SPEAKER_05]: who's amazing, and also working with Canna
Kids, you're all over the place,
[SPEAKER_05]: is doing a lot of work in the cities.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's going to tell you a little bit
about what's going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just give them a quick update.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, in what city are you working?
[SPEAKER_07]: Santa Monica.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So tell us, so here's the thing,
before you start, is a lot of the work
[SPEAKER_05]: that you're hearing about tonight,
that for those of you who haven't gotten
[SPEAKER_05]: involved yet and maybe want to get
involved, as you can see, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: different levels to all this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're the kind of person that likes
to speak out and fight for things,
[SPEAKER_05]: the places you can probably do the most
work is in cities, in the county.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's definitely room in the state,
but obviously a lot of people in
[SPEAKER_05]: Sacramento doing things.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in your cities is where your
community, the city councils all over
[SPEAKER_05]: California right now are having these
conversations more and more and more every
[SPEAKER_05]: day about what is going to be their
cannabis policy for their community.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it takes people, like us, to go out
there and do it and actually show up to
[SPEAKER_05]: these meetings and speak and let them know
that, hey, we're there and we don't want
[SPEAKER_05]: the story to just be dictated by law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just one side of the story.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to have fair policy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Courtney, tell us what you are doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Jackie, for inspiring me to get
involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: Santa Monica passed an ordinance
permitting two dispensaries, and that was
[SPEAKER_07]: over two years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: So with the passing of Prop 64,
clearly it was time to move forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pleased to say that they were very
responsive to cannabis, and they also,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, had some change in their mindset
about what the concerns were.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the issues that I raised is that
because cannabis is illegal in Santa
[SPEAKER_07]: Monica, just working out of my home office
and working with cannabis is technically
[SPEAKER_07]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Lord Jones was there, two of the
founders, and they spoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are just in manufacturing out of
their home for their product line,
[SPEAKER_07]: Lord Jones.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was another party that was also
kind of hoping to have a presence in Santa
[SPEAKER_07]: Monica outside of dispensary zonings.
[SPEAKER_07]: There were a number of people that came
out to address this issue, and one of the
[SPEAKER_07]: concerns they had was, how do we have a
dispensary with this zoning restriction if
[SPEAKER_07]: we have nursery schools all over town?
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we figure out where that's going to
be?
[SPEAKER_07]: So some of the residents came out and
said, you know, made some suggestions
[SPEAKER_07]: about where they might want to place these
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also consideration about how much
traffic those dispensaries will encounter,
[SPEAKER_07]: because that's something that you want as
a thriving dispensary business,
[SPEAKER_07]: of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now, the purpose of this particular
event was to have a study session to
[SPEAKER_07]: address those issues and learn more about
what those issues were.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why I attended, because Jackie
inspired me to get involved, and one of
[SPEAKER_07]: the ways to get involved is to present
those issues and say, hey, I'm a resident.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my concern, and I would like to be
represented in this fashion.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was how that went down.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would say it was successful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing's moving forward yet, but they are
putting together an advisory board,
[SPEAKER_07]: and on that board will be individuals who
are involved in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I have requested to be a part of that
organization.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's hoping.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to really give you a punch on what
she was just talking about in Santa
[SPEAKER_05]: Monica, because I was there that
particular night.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's a city, Santa Monica.
[SPEAKER_05]: You would think that they kind of are hip
and know what's going on, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Two years into deciding that they're going
to have two medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensaries, forget about adult use
recreational, they want no part of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't even really understand this
brand, Lord Jones, which is like a medical
[SPEAKER_05]: brand, chocolates, and I don't know what
else they have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, topicals and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they got up there and were like,
hi, we live in Santa Monica, we work in
[SPEAKER_05]: Santa Monica, we're manufacturers,
and they were like, manufacturers?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they didn't really even understand
that there were secondary products in the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just thought it's all about flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or bongs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or bongs.
[SPEAKER_05]: They really truly didn't know,
and you could see the looks on all their
[SPEAKER_05]: faces.
[SPEAKER_05]: The light bulbs were going off,
and they were like, oh, you mean there's
[SPEAKER_05]: other businesses in cannabis that don't
need a storefront.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have to watch cannabis being
cooked, do we?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Warehouse areas or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't even understand that,
and this is two years into them having the
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it takes people like are in this room
and Courtney and others to go up there and
[SPEAKER_05]: tell them this stuff, because otherwise,
they're going to make bad decisions,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what we're here to talk about.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to add one more thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you did want to get involved,
one thing I did was just go to the
[SPEAKER_07]: drugpolicy.org website.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is a section there, Action
Toolkits, and they have some pro tips
[SPEAKER_07]: there on how to get involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: I also wrote an article on Direct Cannabis
Network that you can read about to see how
[SPEAKER_07]: we can change things, looking back at
prohibition when alcohol prohibition
[SPEAKER_07]: ended.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can start new and have a 2020
hindsight.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Courtney.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could put that right down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And while I'm here, I want to tell you
guys about West Hollywood, because here we
[SPEAKER_05]: are in West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_05]: I spend time in West Hollywood at the city
council as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this coming Monday, May 1st,
630, right over there on the other side of
[SPEAKER_05]: the park is the city council chambers.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are putting marijuana on the agenda
to actually start to have a discussion
[SPEAKER_05]: about what they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ironically, West Hollywood was the first
one in California to really get behind
[SPEAKER_05]: medical marijuana, a lot of that having to
do with HIV and AIDS at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they got in front of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they've got to catch up with adult
use.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Monday, May 1st, 630, if you're a West
Hollywood business or thinking about being
[SPEAKER_05]: a West Hollywood business, I encourage you
to get there and speak.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody can speak.
[SPEAKER_05]: But of course, if you live in the
community, work in the community,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's even more powerful.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're going to need to even keep a
city like West Hollywood, which is as
[SPEAKER_05]: progressive as it may be, we still have to
make sure that they have fair policy,
[SPEAKER_05]: like some of the things Lynn was talking
about, they don't have discrimination and
[SPEAKER_05]: all those things.
[SPEAKER_05]: We still need to make sure even in the
most progressive cities.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I encourage everybody to come down to
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: One more short speaker and then we're
going to wrap this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this person, Terry Blevins,
I just met recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: Terry, come on up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Terry is in the law enforcement security
side of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as we go forward with licensing and
compliance, security is a big issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Terry, give us a few minutes and let's
talk about some of those things that you
[SPEAKER_05]: do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Say hi to everybody first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me, Jackie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you're a member of LEAP as well,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is LEAP?
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell people what LEAP was and what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: LEAP is an amazing organization.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole time I was a police officer,
I always had a conscience about the drug
[SPEAKER_02]: laws and the things that were going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never agreed with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never knew that there were other
police officers out there that felt like I
[SPEAKER_02]: did.
[SPEAKER_02]: But LEAP is a national organization.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's made up of over 5,000 people,
mostly law enforcement and former law
[SPEAKER_02]: enforcement officers, who basically admit
that we lost the war on drugs and say we
[SPEAKER_02]: recognize the fact that drugs probably
shouldn't be illegal, at least the softer,
[SPEAKER_02]: what might be considered softer drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that during the war on drugs,
a lot of harm was done to certain
[SPEAKER_02]: communities within the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's basically things that Lynn has
touched on and you've touched on and
[SPEAKER_02]: Jonathan touched on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that has gone on for
decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: And LEAP basically fights.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have lobbyists in Washington,
DC, and they promote drug trafficking.
[SPEAKER_02]: They promote policy reform, fight against
over incarceration, and mandatory
[SPEAKER_02]: sentences, and all of those laws and
policies that inflicted harm on certain
[SPEAKER_02]: communities.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, because we need law enforcement on
our side, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or even ex-law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_05]: We definitely need that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot more of them out there
than people might think.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have a company called Armaplex
Security, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So what types of security do you do to
help cannabis businesses?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, cannabis businesses require a
special type of security.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we provide security for all
types of industries, but we specialize in
[SPEAKER_02]: that specifically, just because it is
something that requires a unique type of
[SPEAKER_02]: approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that we do, we start off
by helping businesses that are applying
[SPEAKER_02]: for their licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because one thing that some people might
not realize is that when you apply for a
[SPEAKER_02]: license, a large percentage of the points
that are attributed to or that are given
[SPEAKER_02]: to you have to do with your security plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've seen people try to do their own
security plans, and it doesn't always work
[SPEAKER_02]: out that well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the things that we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're happy to help with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I've been told by some people in the
room that security plans are usually
[SPEAKER_05]: required as part of an application to
assist for a license.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you seen that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not seen any regulatory agency that
does not require a security plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it can be up to a third of
the overall points that you get for your
[SPEAKER_02]: license.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that we do is we provide
security design for the space,
[SPEAKER_02]: because if we can get involved early on,
we can help design the space so that it
[SPEAKER_02]: can be secured more easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: We provide installation of CCTV.
[SPEAKER_02]: Access control systems, biometric access
control systems, alarms.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also provide security officers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing that we're working on
right now that I've had a lot of questions
[SPEAKER_02]: about this is the insider threat.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of cannabis businesses have said,
how do we keep our employees from stealing
[SPEAKER_02]: from us?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's bound to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're developing a program right
now that it's an employee training
[SPEAKER_02]: program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it involves engaging employees so that
they're less likely to steal from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that we find in the
security industry is that employees who
[SPEAKER_02]: steal didn't feel engaged with the company
that they were working for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the things that we're
working on right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had a great response from people
in the industry so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to finish this up, what advice do you
give to, cannabis businesses that are
[SPEAKER_05]: going to go for license as they're
thinking about security?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know that we've talked about it a
lot, but I don't think it can be talked
[SPEAKER_02]: about too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody that decides that they're either
going to go into the cannabis industry or
[SPEAKER_02]: stay in it for those businesses,
pre-ICO, Prop D, other businesses that may
[SPEAKER_02]: be operating outside the law who want to
become legal, it's going to be all about
[SPEAKER_02]: compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compliance is going to be really huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be possibly the most
regulated industry in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so owners right up front need to have
that compliance mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they need to do is they need to
create a compliance culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: As an owner, if you're interested in
compliance, you can't do that by yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get your employees on board.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to create a compliance
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a big part of that is securing your
facility and training your employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the things that we can
help do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's thank Terry for giving us all that
wonderful information.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much, Terry Bodes.
Thank you.
