[SPEAKER_00]: Hey there, Bam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to say, man, thank you so much
for doing that show last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned so much from you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got raided in April, and I've been
trying to kind of like talk about what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was blasted all over
Instagram, the local newspaper,
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook, and everybody thought it was
just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everybody started getting raided.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now shit's kind of popping off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're raiding this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been trying to speak out,
kind of like watch what I'm saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to work in behind the
scenes and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like watching you guys last night gave
me so much faith and hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned so much like I've been in this
for in the industry for 10 years myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, this is my first time
getting raided like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just I find solidarity in the fact
that this is not just happening just in
[SPEAKER_00]: this county.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happened everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we all come together, we can figure
this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they keep us isolated, they're just
going to keep fucking everybody for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really hope to work with you guys
and other industry leaders, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking love everybody.
