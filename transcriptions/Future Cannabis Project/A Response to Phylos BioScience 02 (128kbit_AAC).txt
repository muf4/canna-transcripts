[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why we got to, you know,
improve our scientific literacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to seek out people who understand
the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to encourage them to speak in our
community, to share their knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: and to break it down in ways that are
understandable to empower everybody in the
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Filos has significantly damaged the trust
of our community with genomics labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't let what Filos did actually
impact the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have to continue to engage in the
science, understand it, and deploy it in
[SPEAKER_00]: ways that are intentional and conscious.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to control these technologies and
deploy them for our ends, not have them
[SPEAKER_00]: deployed by others against us in ways that
make it so that we no longer have any
[SPEAKER_00]: choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to support people who have the
knowledge and expertise within our
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already mentioned that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to go back to our roots and we
have to really focus on these educational
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities and understand that what
we're doing in these moments and in these
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces is building culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're building resilience to a culture
that we are all, we've inherited,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we are also responsible for taking on
into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have to have events like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to share this on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that everybody in our community that
decided for whatever reason from all our
[SPEAKER_00]: different backgrounds to say, cannabis,
that's my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be about it now more than ever
because if we're not, five, 10 years from
[SPEAKER_00]: now, I mean, according to Mowgli Homes
straight up, their plan is to be at market
[SPEAKER_00]: in nine months and in two years have all
existing cannabis varieties be a thing of
[SPEAKER_00]: the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are his words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is it hubris?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it something that is probably not going
to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly that, you know, best laid plans
often fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, we have to expect the
Monsanto's of the world, the Syngenta's
[SPEAKER_00]: and anybody who wants to adopt that model
to come into our space and to bring their
[SPEAKER_00]: A game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen what they've done to
everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way that anything has ever
developed along a different trajectory was
[SPEAKER_00]: because people consciously chose to do so
and because they organized around things
[SPEAKER_00]: that they valued and their culture in
specific places across time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they developed these institutions and
they got network so that they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: could build a resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason that trend that was,
if I had the graphic, I wish I could show
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but basically 1904, three,
we had hundreds of varieties of every
[SPEAKER_00]: major crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So peas, melons, tomatoes, corn,
every single one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were hundreds of specific varieties
being grown across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were regionally adapted, specific
cultivars that were useful in their
[SPEAKER_00]: particular area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while they may not have had market
share to where they were growing billions
[SPEAKER_00]: of bushels and making tons of Monsanto
like money, they were actually building
[SPEAKER_00]: and maintaining crop diversity that had
incredible value that we've only now
[SPEAKER_00]: realized what was being lost in the 1980s
when they went back and they looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: what was available in the existing crop
germplasm banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was down to a handful of any one of
those crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went from hundreds to about a dozen,
maybe two dozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That right there, is something that we
can't let happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Filo says that they have in their catalog
400 varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we were to look at and have cannabis
in that chart, you would have cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: with at least 400 distinct varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their plan is to take those 400
varietals and turn it into a few dozen and
[SPEAKER_00]: have that be ubiquitous and be the only
thing anybody ever experiences and gets to
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what we've dedicated our lives
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not why we fought the good fight
and kept these plants alive under wartime
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept this plant alive and we took all
of this genetic resources from all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these different places that have been
developed over millennia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did so not just to hand it over to
a bunch of suits and not just to give up
[SPEAKER_00]: when the going got tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going's been a lot tougher.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used to show up with helicopters and
guns.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting marginally better.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're showing up with briefcases now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to stay on it and just stay
true to ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think just to get into some broader
breeding genetics things that need to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, quickly, germplasm maintenance,
collecting, storing, and preserving
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic diversity of isolated populations
and varietals is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to take your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got two seeds of something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, pop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a seed increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got one seed and it's a female?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, do a reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make thousands out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that is a genetic resource and
it's something that could otherwise get
[SPEAKER_00]: lost if we don't make seed increases
constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't keep these things isolated
and within their own niches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once we start crossing everything
together, we have essentially a race to
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom and we lose the unique
diversity that we have in specific
[SPEAKER_00]: varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Further than that, we need to get into a
climatization and trait improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the traditional land race varieties
were the results of hundreds and thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: of years of the climatization and
selection pressures that were exerted on
[SPEAKER_00]: plants by cultural complexes that valued
and cultivated them around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten, I explained some of these
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant as we know it is the result of
the choices made by the different diverse
[SPEAKER_00]: cultures that interacted with this plant
over millennia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our task as breeders is to keep in mind
that our decisions impact the gene pool of
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant in ways that have consequences
thousands of years into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the inception of modern hybrids,
there's been an emphasis on primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: trait improvement for increased yields,
reduced flower time, cannibinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, bud structure, morphology,
and appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've accomplished incredible improvements
in the plant over this time period in a
[SPEAKER_00]: very haphazard manner without the benefits
of advanced genomics or public
[SPEAKER_00]: institutions that would support us in our
efforts literally under siege during a
[SPEAKER_00]: drug war.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result is that we have lots of
varietals that have been significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: improved in a number of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we focus less on acclimatized,
stabilized, and isolated populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are relatively few acclimatized
heirlooms and pure unhybridized lines and
[SPEAKER_00]: those that do exist are incredibly
cherished.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get back to staying in our
lanes, staying in our communities,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and developing varietals and
cultivars that are unique to our area and
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to do it on the personal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personal cultivators growing their six
plants and being heirloom
[SPEAKER_00]: preservationists, creating preservationist
societies like the Audubon Society where
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually really get into this and have
just hobbyists who care only about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and describe in detail and
develop their own personal lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the thing that we need to be
encouraging and developing along with all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the commercial developments that are
going on and we need for the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: developments to be developing what's being
spoken about right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need farmers and breeders to develop
alliances with distributors and buyer's
[SPEAKER_00]: co-ops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buyer's co-ops is something that we as a
community developed in the hippie back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the land movement and it made the
renewable energy market a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made the health food market a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make heirloom varieties in cannabis
a thing that has market share and market
[SPEAKER_00]: space if we target every single side of
the supply chain and don't just look at
[SPEAKER_00]: here's commercial, here's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also need buyer's co-ops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get together buyers, buy that good good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, first of all, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of really good content there and I
think we've been talking a lot about this
[SPEAKER_01]: all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea of genetic diversity,
the idea of cultural diversity,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think you bring up a really good
point for people that are just growing for
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves or just growing their six
plants and the responsibility that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: by having these genetics and carrying on
the lineages here and for people such as
[SPEAKER_01]: myself that a lot of us that used to
cultivate and now have found other things
[SPEAKER_01]: to put our energy into but are still in
the cannabis industry, still have our love
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis, but still grow our six
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so much fun to work with that and see
all the diversity that we can and bringing
[SPEAKER_01]: out the genetics from the fridge and all
the old school stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really grateful that you came out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Jonathan Valdman.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Heart of Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming.
Thank you.
