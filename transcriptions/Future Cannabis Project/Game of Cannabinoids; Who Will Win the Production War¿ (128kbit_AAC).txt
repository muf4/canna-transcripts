[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot you had my full bio, so I was
grimacing a little up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to shorten that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so I'm really excited to be here
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get deep into some science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll leave a ton of time at the end for
question and answer, because I'm sure you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys will have a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: The game of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, a brief outline of what I'll be
talking about today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll compare.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we utilize the plant to produce
cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we utilize other formats,
whether using chemical synthesis in
[SPEAKER_01]: beakers, or are we genetically programming
bacteria to produce cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk a bit about the cost,
because that's going to be a huge driver
[SPEAKER_01]: of who's going to win this game of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk about some of the potential
effectiveness, efficacy, effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be different, depending on
where you source your cannabinoids from?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll talk about some of the
regulatory landscape, which is probably
[SPEAKER_01]: the most complicated part of this that we
need to tease through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll first just briefly overview how the
plant produces cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's what a plant does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's taking carbon dioxide out of the
atmosphere, and it's fixing that carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: and building sugar is what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once it's built that sugar,
it can then take that sugar and transform
[SPEAKER_01]: it into a variety of other compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what the cannabis plant does is it
takes carbon dioxide to form sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from sugar, and through a series of
steps, which I will just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: abbreviate, it'll take that sugar,
convert it to compound A, then convert it
[SPEAKER_01]: to compound C, then D, then E,
then F, and then eventually it's turned
[SPEAKER_01]: into a cannabinoid, dozens of steps later,
as outlined in this diagram right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about the details.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many enzymatic pathways and
intermediate compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just know that eventually that sugar,
through a series of steps, A, B,
[SPEAKER_01]: C, D, E, F, G, Z, is made into CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CBG is the precursor to many
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way you can remember that is it's
the OG, it's the original cannabinoid that
[SPEAKER_01]: then is made into THC, CBD, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason this becomes important is
when we start talking about how you can
[SPEAKER_01]: make bacteria produce cannabinoids,
you gotta figure out where in this
[SPEAKER_01]: sequence of steps can I utilize the
bacteria to produce, to do those steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also keep in mind that this is not
happening in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cell in the plant, or any cell for
that matter, it's like a little city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And parts of that cell are dedicated to
producing energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like the local coal plant
producing energy for the entire cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other parts of the cell are factories.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're producing certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of certain cannabis cells,
they're producing cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also parts of the city that
are used for defense, for all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very complicated landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what if there's a way that we could
just take the factories making
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and take advantage of that
one piece in the cell?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll talk more about that down the
road.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing about cannabinoid
production in the cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure as you all realize, is it is not
optimized throughout the entire growth
[SPEAKER_01]: phase of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really only get robust cannabis
production, or cannabinoid production in a
[SPEAKER_01]: very specific part of the cannabis plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The floral parts, and only in unfertilized
female flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not optimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means you're kind of wasting all this
time in the plant phase where it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: producing the real compound you're
interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we optimize that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And furthermore, it's only stored in this
one small part of the plant, in the
[SPEAKER_01]: trichromes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not stored throughout the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, not only are you limited to this
kind of time cycle of the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're really only limited to a certain
portion of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason cannabinoids are stored in
trichromes is, number one, they're fat
[SPEAKER_01]: soluble, so they can't really exist in the
aqueous leaf parts of the cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're actually toxic to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they're stored in these
protective little bulbous orbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will all become more important in a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you try to do an extraction from
the cannabis plant, you actually have to
[SPEAKER_01]: spend a lot of time and energy to get rid
of all the other unwanted compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you do an initial extraction of
the cannabis plant, you're basically
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling things based on their chemical
properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, you pull cannabinoids,
but at the same time, you're gonna pull a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of other stuff from the plant
because that other stuff has similar
[SPEAKER_01]: properties, chemical properties,
to the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're gonna pull chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna pull plant lipids and waxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna pull other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna pull flavonoids and all this
junk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to go through all of
these steps to get rid of all of that
[SPEAKER_01]: extra junk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's gonna create a lot of cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how efficient is it when we use the
plant and we're just interested in a
[SPEAKER_01]: handful of compounds?
[SPEAKER_01]: We just spend all this time and energy
getting rid of all the other stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: came along for the ride in the initial
extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we optimize for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so that's putting that aside for a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about some of the chemical or
the synthetic processes, the non-cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant processes that you can make
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's chemical synthesis where you're
building things.
[SPEAKER_01]: In beakers, you're not using living
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's cellular biosynthesis where
you're genetically engineering cells to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's cell-free biosynthesis where
you don't even need the cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need the whole city.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want the one factory in that city
that makes cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I harness that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll walk you through each one of
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so chemical synthesis, you have
beakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have any living organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're just basically building one
molecular building block at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're rebuilding your cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabinoid's a pretty complicated
molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for all intents and purposes,
chemical synthesis might not be the most
[SPEAKER_01]: cost-efficient way to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it's not the most sustainable
because all of the reagents you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: use at each step of your chemical
synthesis, these are things that you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: dispose of very readily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And furthermore, this can be very
inefficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're trying to each step of this
process, you end up actually creating a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of similar but non-identical
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you still have to go through
filtration and separation and all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the rest of this talk, I'm not
gonna talk about this too much because I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't think this is the future of
cannabinoid production from both a cost
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint, a sustainability standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: What gets much more interesting is
biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the same way that the cannabis plant
takes sugar, walks it through a series of
[SPEAKER_01]: steps to produce a cannabinoid,
we could engineer a cell that exists in a
[SPEAKER_01]: bioreactor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that cell can also take a sugar and
walk it through those same steps and
[SPEAKER_01]: output a cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I don't have to deal with growing
this plant and all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, before I talk more about this,
let's talk about the history of cellular
[SPEAKER_01]: biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it fall asleep?
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prior to the 1960s, the way that we
treated diabetics was that we would take
[SPEAKER_01]: animal pancreas, mainly pig pancreas,
we'd grind it up and we'd extract the
[SPEAKER_01]: insulin out of the pancreas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'd go through a very
complicated series of steps of extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: and purification, not too different than
what we do with cannabis, to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: roughly purified insulin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it wasn't very pure, it wasn't very
consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would give it to patients and
sometimes you would create sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: lethal reactions to it because batch to
batch, it was different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The porcine pancreases, just like cannabis
plants, are different batch to batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really only wanted one molecule,
the insulin, but all this extra stuff came
[SPEAKER_01]: along for the ride when you did your
extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you had to spend all this time
purifying all that other stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the 60s, they figured out a better
way to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was Genentech and this is what made
them a billion dollar company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they said, okay, let's figure out what
is the actual DNA strand in the human
[SPEAKER_01]: pancreas cell that's responsible for
insulin production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take out that piece of DNA and let's
stick it in a bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we boot up the bacteria,
lo and behold, it starts producing
[SPEAKER_01]: insulin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they basically took, one way to think
about this is they took the code,
[SPEAKER_01]: they took the code that codes for,
this is like computer software code.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took the code that codes for insulin
out of the human cell, put it into a
[SPEAKER_01]: different computer and then booted up that
computer and that computer is now reading
[SPEAKER_01]: that code and doing what that code is
instructing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how we got insulin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then we never needed to use animal
pancreases again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was 50 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is not new technology,
biosynthesis, biosynthetic production of
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, now let's take this one step
further.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are some of the companies
that have popped up to try and do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of companies working in this
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next one, next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so in theory, this sounds simple,
but I think there's a lot of nuances in
[SPEAKER_01]: how companies are gonna go about doing
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first,
[SPEAKER_01]: what type of microorganism are they gonna
use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it gonna be bacteria?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it gonna be a fungi?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it gonna be algae?
[SPEAKER_01]: And each type of microorganism has its own
peculiarities.
[SPEAKER_01]: What food do you need to feed it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What temperature does it grow well at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How easy is it to insert your DNA into
that microorganism?
[SPEAKER_01]: Input and output.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you feeding it sugar?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that organism has been genetically
engineered to take sugar all the way down
[SPEAKER_01]: to cannabinoid through dozens of steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you feeding it an intermediary
compound?
[SPEAKER_01]: So rather than feeding it A and having it
transform it to Z, are you feeding it like
[SPEAKER_01]: Q?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can take it to Z, but then you have
to go spend time and energy creating Q,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, you'd be able to give it sugar
and take it all the way through,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's gonna be very tough because of
all the steps involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might be that you create a
moderately expensive intermediate compound
[SPEAKER_01]: and then have the cell take it all the way
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, do these cells keep
all the contents inside of them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or can you engineer them to then,
you know, kick out the cannabinoids once
[SPEAKER_01]: they're done?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then it's even easier for you to
get a hold of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just floating in the aqueous
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to lyse the cells,
burst the cells open to get the compound
[SPEAKER_01]: of interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, take it a step further.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, the analogy I said about the
city.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the previous example, we're saying,
why don't we rebuild an entire cellular
[SPEAKER_01]: city with its own life support system,
its own hospitals and gardens and roads
[SPEAKER_01]: and all this stuff and cannabinoid
factories?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what if we just take advantage of the
one cannabinoid factory in the city and
[SPEAKER_01]: ditch the city?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what one of our faculty at
UCLA has been working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, traditionally, so instead of
building the city, he just focuses on,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, now it's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called cell-free biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just takes the enzymes, the cellular
factories for cannabinoids, puts those in
[SPEAKER_01]: a bioreactor, and he's theoretically able
to produce cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is still really, really early proof
of concept stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be years before it will know if
it's viable at scale, but people are
[SPEAKER_01]: working on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the advantages are now you no
longer have to deal with the cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've jumped from plant to bacteria in
a bioreactor, but that bacteria is still
[SPEAKER_01]: fickle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It produces waste products, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need to feed it sugar to keep it
alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It produces all sorts of other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's get rid of the cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just have the factory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it only produces one thing,
and there's no waste products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only produces cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really need to feed it sugar to
keep it alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so based off that, he's created a
spin-out company Invisine.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so to sum it up, what are the
kind of advantages and disadvantages of
[SPEAKER_01]: this approach?
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off, you could actually argue
that this is more environmentally
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable than growing the cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need lots of arable land.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need lots of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to spend all this time and
energy to grow the plant, to only extract
[SPEAKER_01]: out a small portion of it and then purify
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be potentially cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk more about that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot easier to scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I have a 100-acre cannabis farm,
and I want to 10x my output, how quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: can I go from a 100-acre cannabis farm to
a 1,000-acre cannabis farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: That might take me a couple years to ramp
up that capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're growing enough of your
synthetic creatures in a 10-liter
[SPEAKER_01]: bioreactor, you could scale in a couple
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just buy 10 other bioreactors and I
stick it in a room and I'm ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a lot more scalable, potentially
more consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, my cells are just producing the one
thing that I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to worry about dozens,
hundreds of compounds that the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant's producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's more continuous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like I have harvest to harvest
every month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be growing cells for a couple days
at a time and getting cannabinoids out of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the downsides?
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge upfront R&D cost, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Massive upfront R&D cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's regulatory issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this regulated under medical marijuana
laws?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does this even fall?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you be allowed to sell this over the
counter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Marketing issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumers clearly would be weirded out if
your vitamin was brought to you by some
[SPEAKER_01]: bug in a bioreactor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what about all the other potentially
beneficial compounds in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, the so-called entourage effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you be able to recreate that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll talk about more on that issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's talk about the cost
considerations, because that's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the biggest advantages of this
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are some prices of commonly used
over the counter compounds you can buy
[SPEAKER_01]: that are produced by microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks pretty cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: $10 to $50 a kilo for, this is basically
fish oil, penicillin, and a commonly used
[SPEAKER_01]: vitamin.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are microorganisms that they're
using to produce these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you look at the cost and you're like,
holy shit, for a kilo?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cheap, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So clearly this process over the last 50
years that we've been designing these
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria or microorganisms is we can get
the price down pretty low.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, now let's talk about
beta-cariophylline, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a terpene found in the cannabis
plants, also found in things like black
[SPEAKER_01]: pepper.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy naturally derived,
relatively pure beta-cariophylline,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on how much quantity you can
buy, anywhere from 20 to 150 bucks a kilo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also buy synthetic
beta-cariophylline, and it's cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, just the fact that synthetic
beta-cariophylline exists and is cheaper
[SPEAKER_01]: than the naturally derived
beta-cariophylline, it did not completely
[SPEAKER_01]: take down demand for natural
beta-cariophylline.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because the makers of herbal
products or fragrance companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of them sell off a firm that they
only want to source from natural products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the appearance of a cheaper synthetic
source did not just end the discussion,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though these are commodities.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are fungible things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beta-cariophylline's gonna do the
exact same thing, whether it's derived
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetically or naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stuff here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's compare CBD versus what we call
what biosynthetic CBD might look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I choose CBD derived from hemp
is that's probably what the cost of THC
[SPEAKER_01]: would also look like if marijuana cannabis
were allowed to be grown outdoor 10,000
[SPEAKER_01]: acres at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever price point that we can kind
of theoretically arrive at for CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is one day what THC will look like,
too, once it's grown at scale outdoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: as you kind of see happening in countries
like Colombia and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you find is that you could get
the price down from anywhere from tens of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars to hundreds of dollars per kilo of
substantially pure CBD derived from hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: grown at scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did I arrive at that number?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at opium, opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the opioids that we still use
in the pharmaceutical sector are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: derived from opium plants grown in places
like India.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they go and they extract out the
active compounds, purify it, and put into
[SPEAKER_01]: a pharmaceutical pill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those opium products, they sell,
even though they're naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: plant-derived, they sell for tens of
dollars per kilo, maybe $100 per kilo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when they're grown at large
scale and you have a full supply chain to
[SPEAKER_01]: back it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, approaching that price point,
it would look very similar to what we see
[SPEAKER_01]: with opium.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the biosynthetic side, you're also
gonna get in that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because you can look at many
other biosynthetic compounds that are sold
[SPEAKER_01]: in the nutraceutical sector that approach
that similar price point, that have
[SPEAKER_01]: similar chemical structures to
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now keep in mind, I'm not gonna
pigeonhole myself and give you a narrow
[SPEAKER_01]: estimate, because then in a few years,
I'll look bad if it's rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just don't ever predict anything in
public.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what somebody taught me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm giving you a huge range here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want you to see that it's
comparable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that there's a good chance that
biosynthetic could be five times cheaper,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe more, depending on where in this
range it falls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you're talking about deriving
cannabinoids from the plant, clearly CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: is gonna be the first cannabinoid to reach
an incredibly low cost because of
[SPEAKER_01]: wide-scale hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it'll be followed by THC eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: As for the other minor cannabinoids,
I don't know if we'll ever get to that
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because the current supply of
cannabis genetics, you don't have plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that are 25% THCV or CBG or all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the minor cannabinoids,
it's probably not gonna get to this price
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably gonna be significantly
higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for the minor cannabinoids,
I think it's highly likely that
[SPEAKER_01]: biosynthetic will be kind of the reigning
way to produce the minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because it's gonna cost the
same, whether you're trying to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: THCV or THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC in terms of the biosynthetic realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're changing is you're slightly
modifying the DNA sequence that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: putting into the cells, depending on what
cannabinoid you want to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're talking about just pure
individual cannabinoids and the
[SPEAKER_01]: biosynthetic process can trump the plant
derived on cost alone, is it game over?
[SPEAKER_01]: These things are commodities.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at traditional economics,
whenever you have commodity pricing and
[SPEAKER_01]: the price points go down to where nobody's
making any profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so is that the case?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think there's another possibility
we haven't explored yet that's gonna give
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant some, get up Rocky, get up
Rocky, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the plant has still got a shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's still got a shot, I'll tell
you why.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's why.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't gotten very creative with ways
to grow the plant or ways to change the
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolism of the plant and how it
produces these cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's one company, Trape Biosciences,
and what they have, or what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: working on figuring out, they've already
filed some patents, but what they are
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get the cannabis plant to attach
a sugar molecule to the cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_01]: it produces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by attaching a simple sugar molecule
to the cannabinoids, they suddenly become
[SPEAKER_01]: water soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has many implications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off, you're gonna get higher
yields, and that's because now that the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids are water soluble,
they can exist throughout the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not just stuck in the trichromes
outside of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extraction becomes a lot easier too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember what I said, extraction's
expensive because you're trying to grab
[SPEAKER_01]: for the cannabinoids, but you end up
grabbing all the other things that have
[SPEAKER_01]: similar chemical properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fats, the lipids, other cannabinoids,
flavonoids, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have one cannabinoid in your entire
plant that's water soluble, you don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: need to use ethanol and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do a water extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, potential ease of formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the cannabinoid's already water
soluble, they'll mix better into
[SPEAKER_01]: beverages.
[SPEAKER_01]: They probably will absorb better as well
into your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the other really interesting
game-changing piece oh, and this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: company, Trade Biosciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so another really interesting
implication of this is that because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: no longer beholden to the trichromes,
you're also no longer beholden to the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could theoretically just take the
plant and veg it, and you could just veg
[SPEAKER_01]: it all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: All day, you're just vegging the cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows up a couple, you just cut it
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows up, you cut it down, it grows up,
you cut it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many years have you had maybe mother
plants last for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Years, years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to worry about nursery,
clone, take it to flower, then the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: thing dies, and I do it all over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have one room that every couple
weeks you harvest, and you never need to
[SPEAKER_01]: throw it into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need light deprivation,
you don't have to deal with any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because the cannabinoids are being
abundantly produced throughout the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, now whether they can actually scale
this technology is one thing, but they've
[SPEAKER_01]: managed to do it at small scale and file
some patents around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's talk about the effectiveness
of all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, whether it's synthetic or it's
natural, it's gonna do the same thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: The real question is what else is actually
in the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: So CBD is a good example where you hear
people say CBD from cannabis isn't as
[SPEAKER_01]: effective as CBD from hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CBD is the same, it's gonna do the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real question is what else is
accompanying the CBD?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're talking about a hemp product,
it's not gonna have a lot of THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's talk about this notion of
whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a study where they gave
mice pure CBD and they measured
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The higher the bars are, the more
inflammation there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they found was at a low dose of
CBD, you still had a lot of inflammation,
[SPEAKER_01]: at this middle dose of CBD, you lowered
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you increase the dose again,
the inflammation returned, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a very narrow window of efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're dosing a patient,
that's not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was done with pure CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they did the exact same study with a
high CBD extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they matched it so that both mice got
the same amount of CBD, but this group got
[SPEAKER_01]: all the other stuff that came along for
the ride with the whole plant extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they found was that the more you
gave of that extract, that you had a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: reduction in inflammation without that
rebound at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not quite sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: What compounds in the extract are
responsible for this arguably superior
[SPEAKER_01]: dose response curve?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the mystery that we gotta tease
apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another study where they took
breast cancer cells in a Petri dish and
[SPEAKER_01]: they applied pure THC to one, and they
applied a high THC extract to the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they found was that yes,
the pure THC was able to inhibit some
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer cell growth, but the high THC
cannabis extract at the same level of THC
[SPEAKER_01]: was able to have significantly more
anti-cancer effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, is it of the dozens or hundreds
of other compounds present in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: extract, which one's responsible for this
increased effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it two of them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it 20 of them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it 200?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're trying to figure out
right now as a scientific community.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, last thing, regulatory
considerations, and I'll open up for Q and
[SPEAKER_01]: A.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a big mess right now over
marketing of food products.
[SPEAKER_01]: People throw out terms, no artificial
ingredients, all natural, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of those labels aren't well
regulated right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The FDA doesn't have an official
definition of what is actually all
[SPEAKER_01]: natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, despite that, despite there being
unclear regulation, the FTC, the Federal
[SPEAKER_01]: Trade Commission, has independently gone
after companies and sued them because they
[SPEAKER_01]: made an all natural claim that was
interpreted as deceiving the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you start talking about if you were
able to derive cannabinoids from other
[SPEAKER_01]: sources, would you ever be able to claim
that your product was all natural,
[SPEAKER_01]: no artificial ingredient, anything like
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that landscape look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, people have gone around,
lawyers will go around filing class action
[SPEAKER_01]: lawsuits against companies that
inappropriately label as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's individual groups of lawyers who will
organize class action lawsuits against
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're saying over half of
consumers are motivated to purchase by the
[SPEAKER_01]: all natural claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: That trend's not going away anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And soon, in the next couple years,
the FDA will finally define what it
[SPEAKER_01]: actually means to be all natural on a
product label.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we'll actually have some strict
rules and guidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frito-Ley recently pulled the all natural
claims on their products, waiting until
[SPEAKER_01]: the FDA officially puts in its ruling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, the companies are taking notice
of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a couple years ago,
Subway dropped all artificial ingredients
[SPEAKER_01]: from their food, including synthetically
made versions of naturally occurring
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they went with the slightly more
expensive natural produced compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is a trend that's not going
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so last thing to think about
is, depending on where you source your
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, it might impact where you're
able to sell it, OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are deriving CBD from cannabis,
you'll be able to sell it into the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I say cannabis, I mean marijuana
cannabis, not hemp, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're deriving CBD from cannabis,
you probably won't be able to sell it into
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutraceutical space, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's highly likely that the cannabis,
anything produced in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystem is going to stay sold in that
highly regulated system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's possible you'll be able to sell
it into the pharmaceutical sector in a
[SPEAKER_01]: very regimented fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what GW Pharmaceutical does.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow cannabis in the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: They extract out the CBD, purify it,
drop it in some oil, and sell it as
[SPEAKER_01]: Epidiolex, which was recently FDA
approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a possible viable path.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if you're deriving your CBD from
hemp, OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably you're not going to be able to
sell it into the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because the cannabis industry
has its own kind of protectionist measures
[SPEAKER_01]: that they can take.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably will be able to sell it,
depending on which government jurisdiction
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in, into the nutraceutical sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you probably will be able to sell it
into the pharmaceutical sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you are seeing pharma companies that
are getting ready to source hemp-derived,
[SPEAKER_01]: purified CBD for drug trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is clearly probably not going to
happen, because you have all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis businesses that are like,
we paid all this money, taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're going to let hemp CBD be sold
and mixed into cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't seem fair, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to put downward price
pressure on us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now for the last one, biosynthetic
CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does this fall?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's play a game, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, what do we think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they going to sell it into the
cannabis space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay or nay?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the same reason, self-protectionist
measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's jobs at stake, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that all these states have dropped,
are we going to suddenly replace all these
[SPEAKER_01]: jobs on these farms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that we allow this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the nutraceutical sector?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay or nay?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's question mark, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other examples of biosynthetically
made products that do exist in nature,
[SPEAKER_01]: but made by bacteria that are sold in
vitamins and supplements.
[SPEAKER_01]: That does exist, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's possible, depending on how
regulators decide to allow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about biosynthetic CBD for the
pharmaceutical sector?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the most relevant use
case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these guys want really, really,
really pure, purified product,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that probably makes the most sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So key takeaways, and we'll wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biosynthetic route is going to be
cheaper, most likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one area where it might be comparable
is maybe hemp-derived CBD, because you
[SPEAKER_01]: could grow that so large scale and
industrialize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for all the other cannabinoids,
biosynthetic's probably going to win on
[SPEAKER_01]: cost, especially for the minor
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is clear evidence of an entourage
effect, and therefore you might not get
[SPEAKER_01]: that if you're just producing one single
compound biosynthetically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumer perception of what your compound
is clearly is important today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will continue to be important going
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there are regulations coming in to
actually define what is all natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is that going to impact that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the source of what your cannabinoid is
likely going to impact your permissible
[SPEAKER_01]: sales channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you can see, there's a lot of
considerations at play as to what the
[SPEAKER_01]: future of cannabinoid production,
you can leave that there, will look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of wrapping this up,
in the game of cannabinoids, is it more
[SPEAKER_01]: like a civil war, or the US civil war?
[SPEAKER_01]: We just lined up troops on each side,
and you just hit at each other all day
[SPEAKER_01]: long until one side gives up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just competing on cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the race to the bottom?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this game is more like a game of
drones, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where there's subterfuge, and you have
spies, and they have an army of knights,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you have dragons, and there's magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because there's so many factors
at play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cost is one consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about cost, we talked about
effectiveness, we talked about consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: perception, and we talked about regulatory
permissible pathways for sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is how I see the game of
cannabinoids, and I'll open it up for Q&A.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a hand in the back first,
then boom, then okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent talk, very thought-provoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any idea about how you see this being
given to patients?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it going to be patch, oral,
and can you comment a little bit about
[SPEAKER_04]: formulations and bioavailability?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think oral is probably not gonna be a
great way to deliver cannabinoids for a
[SPEAKER_01]: very medical purpose, and that's just
because the absorption's so variable,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's so erratic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where things like some sort
of a, either some sort of sublingual
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery, or oral mucosal delivery could
be interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Transdermal could be a very interesting
route that's very standardized and stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's interesting, I actually think
there's a role for inhalation in some
[SPEAKER_01]: form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely not combustion, but maybe some
form of vaporization, or some form of
[SPEAKER_01]: aerosolization.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because it's just a very
consistent, quick, easy way to deliver
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in terms of oral, just like
take some cannabis extract, put it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: pill, I don't think that's ever gonna be
what a medical product would be recognized
[SPEAKER_01]: as, just because it's too inconsistent in
its effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Questions about CBD products and label
claims versus maybe drug claims of
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And efficacy and maybe onset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in your opinion, is that a safer way
for a company to kind of go through their
[SPEAKER_00]: operations, as opposed to what happened
like Curaleaf recently, where they had to
[SPEAKER_00]: rescind a lot of their claims on CBD and
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that has a lot to do with the
PBO, which is what you were saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the reason you can't make any
claims on CBD is because it's an FDA
[SPEAKER_01]: approved pharmaceutical drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you know, you can't make any sort
of, you can make wellness, I mean this is
[SPEAKER_01]: true of any nutraceutical, you can make
like wellness claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: So rather than like treat your insomnia,
it's like for a good night's rest,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how you have to phrase
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so the short answer is disease
claims, no, it's not gonna be possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be possible for THC either,
because THC has been FDA approved since
[SPEAKER_01]: 1986, in the form of Marinol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so you have to stay away from
disease claims, unless you're willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: go down the pharmaceutical drug
development pipeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, drug delivery claim, drug onset claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a little more leeway there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for quicker onset, use our
dissolvable tablets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a little more leeway there,
because you're not making a disease claim.
[SPEAKER_06]: So something different.
[SPEAKER_06]: So excellent talk, but I think it's
interesting that you were looking for a
[SPEAKER_06]: single winner when you clearly defined in
your talk three different channels to sell
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can see a world where there's three
winners, and I can see more than that,
[SPEAKER_06]: because as you said, the abundance of
certain cannabinoids and other compounds
[SPEAKER_06]: in the plant is different, and so you're
right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So can you see a world where there are
winners that are different in each of the
[SPEAKER_06]: commercial channels?
[SPEAKER_06]: And how much do you think the government,
so for example for the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_06]: channel, how much do you think the FDA's
perception of these compounds influences
[SPEAKER_06]: things?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because as a drug developer, I'll let you
know that my paperwork is significantly
[SPEAKER_06]: less complicated if I use a synthetic
homolog of something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so to answer your first question,
clearly you could very quickly be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: all right, anything derived from cannabis
is gonna float around in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything derived from hemp will just go
nutraceutical, and then all the synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff goes pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, there's a ton of
crosstalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have pharma companies who are willing
and ready to source synthetic hemp-derived
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD, and GW Pharmaceutical is the one
company that has an FDA-approved CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow the cannabis plant themselves,
and they create extracts from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's tons of crosstalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it would be a bit too,
it wouldn't do it full justice to just do
[SPEAKER_01]: it those three lanes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in terms of what you said about
perception, yeah, it makes it a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult when you're trying to go to the
FDA and say, hey, approve my drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee you it's gonna be consistent
batch to batch for the next 50 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and by the way, I derive it from a
plant, and I take it through all these
[SPEAKER_01]: purification and extraction processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of foreign to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a lot more scrutiny over
those processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanna make sure you're growing the
plant identical each time, and that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can reliably reproduce that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does add considerable difficulty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you speak to the various CBD
formulations and how they'll work with
[SPEAKER_03]: food products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you clarify the question a little
more?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the government seems to be at odds
about whether it's going to allow CBD into
[SPEAKER_03]: food products, and it's going back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just wondering if these various CBD
formulations have a relevance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only shot of you selling CBD as a
food product, AKA a dietary ingredient,
[SPEAKER_01]: is if it's derived from hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only basis you have any ground
to stand on, period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't even talk about anything outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not gonna be allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The FDA actually is perfectly correct when
they say you cannot sell CBD in food
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because as soon as CBD entered
clinical trials with GW, they created
[SPEAKER_01]: basically a moratorium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you can't sell this stuff
in the food product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pharmaceutical drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: GW staked its kind of flagpole on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actually very clear that that's
not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, because the FDA is under so much
political pressure from all of the folks
[SPEAKER_01]: who backed hemp as a way to revitalize
rural communities, predominantly
[SPEAKER_01]: Republican rural communities, that's why
the FDA is now willing to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: concession because of this intense
political pressure on them to allow CBD so
[SPEAKER_01]: that the hemp farm farmers can actually
grow a valuable crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has nothing to do with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all economic development of these
rural communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the driving factor behind these
conversations right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the formulations for the food
products, yeah, it's the hemp-derived
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that's gonna be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, going forward, here's likely
what's gonna happen is the FDA will come
[SPEAKER_01]: in and say, okay, here's the maximum
amount of CBD you can put into a pill or a
[SPEAKER_01]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cannot be overly purified beyond this
percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keeping it more of a hemp extract as
opposed to a pure CBD, which that's
[SPEAKER_01]: clearly a pharmaceutical drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you have to go through these
testing labs that we've done some,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've given them a license to certify that
your CBD product is accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect that's somewhere where the FDA
might fall in the coming months and years
[SPEAKER_01]: as they figure out the regulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have one more question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great presentation, thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Question is, have you seen any studies
that, you know, we're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: reintroducing terpenes and the entourage
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen any studies that deal with
the increased or decreased efficacy of
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes when they're reintroduced versus
naturally occurring?
[SPEAKER_01]: Short answer, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's only because we haven't,
there's literally, I could count on one
[SPEAKER_01]: hand the number of studies that have
compared pure cannabinoid to cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: extract head to head.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't even really know if the
entourage effect, if it's like how real it
[SPEAKER_01]: is or like when it actually occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't even, we remotely understand
and start comparing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a hemp extract versus one that was like
fractionated and then reconstituted into a
[SPEAKER_01]: specific combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say though, Didi Marie out of
Israel has done some studies where he
[SPEAKER_01]: takes a whole extract, cannabis extract,
and he'll sequentially break it into
[SPEAKER_01]: chunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what he's trying to do is to arrive at
the minimum amount of compounds from that
[SPEAKER_01]: full extract, that recreate the full
extract's effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in one particular cancer cell line he
was looking at, he found that it came down
[SPEAKER_01]: to four.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was four ingredients that he isolated
that when combined could recreate the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole plant extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's for these cancer cell lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe for other disorders, you need less,
maybe you need more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just curious if you know of any
pharmaceutical companies growing cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: so that it will have a higher amount of
minor cannabis or cannabinoids you were
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about, that may be the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it's not so much pharmaceutical
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: To my knowledge, there's only like one
pharmaceutical company growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's GW.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think all the pharmaceutical companies
now are just going to work with and
[SPEAKER_01]: purchase their cannabinoids from cannabis
companies, predominantly right now
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadian cannabis companies because
they're creating kind of like the
[SPEAKER_01]: cleanest, most pharmaceutical grade stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of your question, which was minor
cannabinoids, yes, it's not so much pharma
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all these cannabis genetic companies,
breeders, they're all scrambling to get
[SPEAKER_01]: these rare genetics that have high amounts
of these minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because, you know, what does a
kilo of CBD isolate sell for right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: $5,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does a kilo of CBG isolate sell for
right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or THCV, 100 grand, 50 to 100 grand,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that much more valuable because it's
so rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so it's really the breeders,
the plant breeders and genetics guys,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now are scrambling to find those genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They realize how valuable it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
