[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the OA Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to show you guys a couple tips
on how to use some of our products for
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to come over here,
we're going to just take a snip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I like to just kind of look
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see we've taken a couple off the
top here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is a nice one here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to look at that, gauge it,
cut it about right there, let that go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like how I like to do my
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too big, not too small, easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take that first clip, right on that 45,
a couple clones there, and snip off the
[SPEAKER_00]: top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's a lot of, I don't know what
you'd call it, science or different ways
[SPEAKER_00]: of cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we snip off the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing it for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of OCD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's some science behind it,
some transpiration, but that's kind of how
[SPEAKER_00]: we like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and clean, easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we do is if you're using the
microbial solution, what we like to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: we like to do a brew.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a four gallon brew pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do a brew for 24 hours and check out
the website for those videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we'll do is actually take the
whole clone and we'll dump it right in,
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire brew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just give her a nice bath.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the cuts you've just made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some biology, some beneficial biology
in those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we'll do is we'll actually take a
tip, dip it in FPF.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one milliliter per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go straight into the router.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now any router is fine for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I know there's a lot of different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of some tips we like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we actually take, make sure we
don't go all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of almost to the end there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to give her a little bit of room
and then we dip it straight into the
[SPEAKER_00]: biological solution here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: She finds a nice home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you'd like to get more questions,
feel free to DM us.

[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you next time.
