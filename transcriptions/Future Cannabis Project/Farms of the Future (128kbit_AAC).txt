So,
[SPEAKER_04]: the assumptions I want to start with for
this panel discussion is that indoor
[SPEAKER_04]: agriculture facilities will use a lot of
power based on sole source lighting as our
[SPEAKER_04]: main strategy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we're going to talk a little bit about
how business models and different growing
[SPEAKER_04]: systems are going to revolve around that
assumption.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we're going to also keep in mind that
crops being grown currently have
[SPEAKER_04]: limitations in terms of what price points
we can hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, as we look at how we're going to
utilize energy and utilities, light,
[SPEAKER_04]: HVAC, we do have limitations.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't use as much as we want to
whenever we want to because we may not be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to afford to sell what we're growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then finally, there's a lot of talk
when we're dealing with indoor agriculture
[SPEAKER_04]: about extremely niche crops, but there is
also a lot of different indoor ag food
[SPEAKER_04]: producing projects that are out there and
those niche markets will be quickly
[SPEAKER_04]: saturated and we need to think about what
we're going to be able to do in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: accessing a broader market.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I want you to keep those assumptions
in mind as we go through the panel
[SPEAKER_04]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that, I'm going to start by
letting each panel member introduce
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves and give a short presentation
on their company and their background,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start with Sam from
AeroFarms.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Sam Schatz.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a managing director at AeroFarms.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, basically, AeroFarms, we're controlled
environment agriculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been operating now a vertical farm
in Newark for the last three and a half
[SPEAKER_05]: years, a commercial farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: The company was originally founded in
2004, actually, out of the Cornell School
[SPEAKER_05]: of Agriculture and we were an OEM for much
of the 2000s and then we reformed the
[SPEAKER_05]: company in 2011 around owning and
operating these farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: We built our kind of first model three
farm back in 2013 and built many
[SPEAKER_05]: subsequent farms since then all in Newark.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I mentioned, we've been operating the
large scale production facility now for
[SPEAKER_05]: about three years.
[SPEAKER_05]: The design for that facility is about five
years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in the process right now of closing
on the funding of our next project,
[SPEAKER_05]: which will be in Virginia, which will be
the next iteration of the design.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're very excited about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have been selling to retailers like
Whole Foods and ShopRite and Fresh Direct
[SPEAKER_05]: and we've also brought in financing from
many different institutional types of
[SPEAKER_05]: investors, but just to summarize,
we've managed to bring in about $200
[SPEAKER_05]: million of equity capital over about four
rounds of funding over the last six years
[SPEAKER_05]: or so.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'll do is I'll talk next about the
technology, which is a very high level
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We built in a number of different spaces.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to show this video because if a
picture can speak a thousand words,
[SPEAKER_05]: a video can do much more than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I only have another minute here,
I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, this was one of the first farms
that we built.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's three towers.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was actually in an old paintball
laser tag facility that we converted to
[SPEAKER_05]: growing food.
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually operated this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was the next farm we built after
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one that we're actually still
operating.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is also in Newark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, these towers are about 36 feet high
and they're growing food year-round using
[SPEAKER_05]: 95% less water than field-grown crops,
about 50% less fertilizer and a small,
[SPEAKER_05]: small fraction of the land and zero
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_05]: The product that we grow doesn't need to
be washed.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can go right into the package,
which obviously skips a very big step
[SPEAKER_05]: because you don't need to wash it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't need to dry it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes right into the package and it can
be sold to customers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Currently, we're selling throughout the
Northeast about eight different SKUs.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can see here, we're growing using
LEDs, latest in LED technology.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything that you see here, Aerofarms is
vertically integrated.
[SPEAKER_05]: We designed, engineered, manufactured,
installed, and then we operate these farms
[SPEAKER_05]: and continuously improve on not just the
engineering components, but also on the
[SPEAKER_05]: growing algorithms that we use,
nutrient delivery and all of the
[SPEAKER_05]: supporting systems and harvesting,
packaging, seeding, germination,
[SPEAKER_05]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, wanted to share that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, a lot of great things to
discuss on this panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say that the leafy green part of
our business is just one part of our
[SPEAKER_05]: business and we're vertically integrated
to go into many different crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're actively pursuing many crops in
addition to what these systems are
[SPEAKER_05]: engineered for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Javid Abraham.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a lead systems designer at Agriculture
Consulting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Agriculture is a tech-agnostic New
York-based agriculture consulting company.
[SPEAKER_06]: We focus in controlled environment
agriculture and we consult mostly on
[SPEAKER_06]: greenhouses and vertical farms.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not married to one system type or
the other.
[SPEAKER_06]: We look at each client's needs based on
the particular market that they're
[SPEAKER_06]: operating in and the crop that they want
to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: We help them to plan their business for
profitability and for long-term success.
[SPEAKER_06]: We approach each project with a triple
bottom line.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perspective, looking at the social
benefits of their business, the economic
[SPEAKER_06]: benefits, as well as the environmental
benefits.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's really a lot that goes into
planning a controlled environment farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to look at market pricing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to look at equipment
availability, the crop you're growing,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then design around those parameters
rather than the other way around.
[SPEAKER_06]: We see a lot of companies and individuals
trying to basically force systems in
[SPEAKER_06]: places where they don't necessarily work
or trying to produce crops in them that
[SPEAKER_06]: don't produce a positive return on
investment in that particular market.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's basically setting yourself up for
failure.
[SPEAKER_06]: We try and steer our clients away from
that fate, essentially.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have had the opportunity to work on
over 100 projects in 20 different
[SPEAKER_06]: countries in the past four years.
[SPEAKER_06]: These services range from everything from
market research to farm design feasibility
[SPEAKER_06]: studies, as well as novel system due
diligence and investigations into system
[SPEAKER_06]: efficacy.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are really a lot of factors that
drive whether a client will choose to go
[SPEAKER_06]: with one CEA system or another.
[SPEAKER_06]: As you can see on that slide, there's
quite a few factors that we look at when
[SPEAKER_06]: we look at the way these systems operate
in these particular regions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Water scarcity is a big driver these days,
and we hear a lot about water use and
[SPEAKER_06]: efficiency in these farms.
[SPEAKER_06]: The difference between an evaporatively
cooled greenhouse and a completely
[SPEAKER_06]: enclosed vertical farm, a lot of that
difference comes to the water use of those
[SPEAKER_06]: particular systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: In California, for example, you would lose
more water through an evaporatively cooled
[SPEAKER_06]: greenhouse than you would through a
completely enclosed vertical farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: If water is really your pain point in your
operation, then we would look at how you
[SPEAKER_06]: can manage those specific resources based
on the strains in your particular region.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are an interdisciplinary group.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are a healthy mix of agronomists,
engineers, policy experts, and
[SPEAKER_06]: sustainability experts.
[SPEAKER_06]: As I said before, we look at each client's
individual needs, and we assess those with
[SPEAKER_06]: a triple bottom line approach and keeping
sustainability in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Grant VandenBush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Despite the very long last name and three
consonants, I am not Dutch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a Belgian heritage, so I guess
it was meant for me to come into this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I briefly touch on who I am and who
we are at Fifth Season, my role as Chief
[SPEAKER_01]: Category Officer, in the spirit of the
conference set by Derek, I just wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very briefly say on my personal
reason why.
[SPEAKER_01]: We decided and I decided to come to this
conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we think about energy usage for food
production, specifically for leafy greens
[SPEAKER_01]: and indoor environments, as we all do up
here, this is a really high cost driver
[SPEAKER_01]: for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figuring this out is a strategic
competitive advantage, but when you look
[SPEAKER_01]: at the mission of a lot of our companies,
it's also one that's sustainability
[SPEAKER_01]: oriented, and it's one with a higher
purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be a difficult conversation to have
when you think about the importance of
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to be competitive on your
energy usage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something that I think I have the
answers to, or maybe even we all up here
[SPEAKER_01]: on the stage have the answers to,
but I think coming together with this very
[SPEAKER_01]: diverse group is how we can find the
solution for how to have the conversation
[SPEAKER_01]: to share best practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: My role at Fifth Season as Chief Category
Officer is really to lead corporate
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy, marketing, sales, business
development, and broad line how we think
[SPEAKER_01]: about our overall go-to-market strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we grow leafy greens and herbs indoors
in robotic vertical farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have human-free grow rooms that are
connected to a highly automated production
[SPEAKER_01]: process that operates much closer to a
smart manufacturing system than it
[SPEAKER_01]: actually does a traditional farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris asked me to come on here and talk
about crop types and the purpose for some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the crop types.
[SPEAKER_01]: This map here that you see, I'm sure you
all have probably seen it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why I chose to continue to use
it is because it's still the driving
[SPEAKER_01]: factor for why our businesses are able to
be successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that 86% of consumers are
consuming leafy greens that are not from
[SPEAKER_01]: the state or even a locality from where
they're consuming them is just forcing
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers to settle for an experience
that, quite honestly, is not matching
[SPEAKER_01]: their beliefs when they walk up to that
category.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over the past couple years,
as you think about the wellness trend
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to infiltrate just about every
single decision of people's lives,
[SPEAKER_01]: retailers as well as consumers are looking
at the leafy green category with a new
[SPEAKER_01]: lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot of demand driving
leafy greens and herbs broadly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just from that kind of very
focused group.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of us do grow it for that as one
of the reasons amongst many others.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the other things I wanted
to quickly mention is that when Chris set
[SPEAKER_01]: the assumptions for this conversation,
I think one of them is really important to
[SPEAKER_01]: come back on, which is the consumer can't
pay $100 per ounce for leafy greens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of us here do have to face the
reality of a math problem that most farms
[SPEAKER_01]: have struggled with for hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so thinking through everything from
production to output to grow science and
[SPEAKER_01]: how everything comes together into a
system that allows you to justify the high
[SPEAKER_01]: capital expenditure for a lot of these
facilities is exactly what a lot of us
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with when we think about just trying
to compete on shelf with $2 a pound big
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf flat cooking spinach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, with that, I've got some prepared
questions for the group.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can kind of get the conversation
started.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to do is start with Javid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And since their company is more focused on
helping growers find ways to implement
[SPEAKER_04]: systems, what I want to do is ask you the
question, what type of growing systems
[SPEAKER_04]: have you seen most people looking towards?
[SPEAKER_04]: And kind of give us an idea of why and how
they determine the energy impact with
[SPEAKER_04]: those systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to answer your first question,
I would say it depends on the scale of
[SPEAKER_06]: investment or funding that they've
received so far and kind of what stage at
[SPEAKER_06]: development they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of kind of categorized as beginners
or people who are just entering this
[SPEAKER_06]: industry for the first time are often less
than looking at smaller pilot systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: So container farm systems are very popular
for that group.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then there is a constituency of
investors out there who are raising higher
[SPEAKER_06]: amounts of capital and looking to
implement novel larger systems that would
[SPEAKER_06]: go into a warehouse envelope.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are companies like Aerofarms and
plenty Bowery companies of that sort.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say it's a good mix between the
two.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's almost always there's an
immediate interest in going for a vertical
[SPEAKER_06]: farm envelope.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we always stress that our clients
should also assess the efficacy of going
[SPEAKER_06]: with a greenhouse for that particular
region.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we help them in kind of comparing
those two systems as far as energy use,
[SPEAKER_06]: yield output, cost of implementation,
as well as long term operational costs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there there are some regions in which
vertical farms will work well consistently
[SPEAKER_06]: year round and then others where
greenhouses can produce a bit more
[SPEAKER_06]: cheaply.
[SPEAKER_06]: It may be a bit further from the
metropolitan area, but you're still within
[SPEAKER_06]: local range.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sorry, what was your second
question?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's jump.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take that and develop that answer a
little bit further.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say if you look at clients that
you've had and compare small growers to
[SPEAKER_04]: large growers and let's let's make the
assumption that they do want to go to
[SPEAKER_04]: indoor farming, what sort of limitations
they have and even choosing equipment for
[SPEAKER_04]: their for their project.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's focus on the small grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the limitations are often capital.
[SPEAKER_06]: These systems aren't cheap.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not inexpensive to put LEDs over
every square foot of bed space that you
[SPEAKER_06]: have and to run those LEDs every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say it's a lot of capital
limitations more than anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there are some knowledge gaps as
well that we help fill as far as,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, what are the production
parameters for those particular crops?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you package them?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you maintain consistency day to day
in your output as well as how do you
[SPEAKER_06]: comply with a lot of the regulations there
are out there and bringing that product to
[SPEAKER_04]: market?
[SPEAKER_04]: So one more question for you on that is
when I was listening to one of the panel
[SPEAKER_04]: discussions yesterday and they were they
were given an example of how a farm has
[SPEAKER_04]: gone through a lot of different
generations of HVAC equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: My experience has been that a lot of the
small farms inherit their HVAC equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're inherent in your experience,
if you are inheriting an HVAC HVAC
[SPEAKER_04]: equipment, how does that play into the
choices that you might have?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have seen a lot of inherited equipment
in general.
[SPEAKER_06]: HVAC also inherited hydroponic systems and
inherited irrigation systems, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when it comes to HVAC, when it's
inherited, it's probably not sized
[SPEAKER_06]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when it's not sized correctly,
you're either you have too large of a
[SPEAKER_06]: system that'll kick on and off too
frequently and lower the lifetime of the
[SPEAKER_06]: equipment or it doesn't have properly
sized dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we find in general dehumidification is
often overlooked when it comes to
[SPEAKER_06]: completely, you know, enclosed systems
like vertical farms and humidity as one of
[SPEAKER_06]: the biggest challenges that we face when
you have crops growing in a box.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're constantly transpiring and you
have to keep those humidity loads down in
[SPEAKER_06]: order to keep vapor pressure deficit in
range and to maintain consistent growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_06]: And usually when equipment is inherited,
you're not sizing correctly or,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, not using basically the right
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next question would be for Grant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Grant, first, you didn't in your
overview, you didn't tell everybody how
[SPEAKER_04]: big your farm was.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first first thing I want to do is
set it up with you tell everybody like how
[SPEAKER_04]: large of the farm is that the season is is
getting prepared to open.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then next, how you guys determined what
equipment you were going to be using and
[SPEAKER_04]: what priority you put to making those
determinations as you designed your farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for asking me to do that,
Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a better model on a slide in a
panel that I'm on.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so hopefully you all don't get too sick
of me until then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the farm that we just finished is
60,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in it's in Pittsburgh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in a historic town called Braddock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the town with the last
remaining operating steel mill in
[SPEAKER_01]: Pittsburgh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really interesting place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that 60,000 square foot farm,
we have a 25,000 square feet from a
[SPEAKER_01]: footprint standpoint of of biodome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Space and then that translates to 126,000
square feet of growing space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all of the arable space,
if you will, of all of our stacked
[SPEAKER_01]: methodology or all of our our stacked
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that's that's due to the level of
density that we can get from from some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the automation that we have built into the
the biodome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so so that's the size of the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: The the initial we didn't enter this space
from a gross science standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually entered this space from an
automation standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of us have have Carnegie Mellon
roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were not a spin out from Carnegie
Mellon, but we have it was kind of a dorm
[SPEAKER_01]: room project, if you will, to say,
OK, how can we use robotics to automate a
[SPEAKER_01]: growing system?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that started out as around the size of
this table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then over over three, three years,
we kept we kept saying, OK, how do we how
[SPEAKER_01]: do we think about moving the plants around
the system to get to to get to automated
[SPEAKER_01]: workstations?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was and then it was it was
really taking that methodology and
[SPEAKER_01]: expanding upon that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use a hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have fill and drain trays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those trays are moved around the
entire entire growing operation via a
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of connected automation tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some some of it is off the shelf that
we've augmented with with our own software
[SPEAKER_01]: and our own hardware software,
hardware integration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of it is is stuff that we've
proprietary fabricated for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, Sam, kind of the same question
towards you, you know, for you guys,
[SPEAKER_04]: when you looked at, you know, the crops
you're growing or as you're building your
[SPEAKER_04]: business model, where did the HVAC
lighting conversation rank in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: importance to you guys as something to
solve, you know, as a priority?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think early on, we knew that,
you know, lighting and HVAC were going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be big priorities.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, you know, certainly they're
they're very much related.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, you know, the efficiency of the
LEDs as a direct impact on what HVAC
[SPEAKER_05]: systems you you're putting in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And obviously, all that's a function of
what you're growing and how quickly it's
[SPEAKER_05]: growing and transformation rates and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was very much top, top of mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think when we first set out,
we probably underestimated, like many,
[SPEAKER_05]: what was going to be needed from an HVAC
standpoint, particularly on
[SPEAKER_05]: dehumidification, you know, looking back
to 2013, 2014.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we've obviously been growing quite a
bit since then.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our next facility, which will be about
one hundred and forty thousand square feet
[SPEAKER_05]: of floor space, but probably the
production equivalent, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you take we'll have about two acres of
actual growing area.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll be the equivalent, roughly the
equivalent of about eight hundred acres of
[SPEAKER_05]: farmland in terms of production volume.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that one that that facility in
particular, we're taking a completely
[SPEAKER_05]: different approach on the kind of the
critical infrastructure side of what's
[SPEAKER_05]: needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then yesterday in a panel discussion,
we heard that times of the year in terms
[SPEAKER_04]: of the markets, you know, what what you
can potentially get at market for your
[SPEAKER_04]: product.
[SPEAKER_04]: We heard that times of the year impacted
growing decisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: How has how has those how have those sorts
of very, very variables impacted arrow
[SPEAKER_04]: farms as growing decisions or crop
selections?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, we, you know, our our
business plan is to essentially be a price
[SPEAKER_05]: taker in the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something that we're striving
for.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to be growing at a cost
structure that's competitive with the
[SPEAKER_05]: field farms in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in doing so, you know, really be in a
position where we can take the price
[SPEAKER_05]: that's given to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, that's somewhat aspirational.
[SPEAKER_05]: In certain instances, we have been doing
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: In other instances, it's been more of a
struggle.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that is the goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is, I think, the goal of this
industry in general is not just to produce
[SPEAKER_05]: with less inputs, but to produce
economically with less inputs than field
[SPEAKER_05]: farming.
[SPEAKER_05]: So so that kind of answers your question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we have seen some seasonal
variability in terms of order volumes,
[SPEAKER_05]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But generally, you know, since we're
selling into such a large market for a
[SPEAKER_05]: leafy greens, in particular, that hasn't
really affected us as much as it might be
[SPEAKER_05]: affecting some of the larger growers right
now.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Javid, a crop question for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: The majority of projects we see around the
country and really around the world are
[SPEAKER_04]: focused on leafy greens and culinary
herbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you do you have any examples of other
crops that are doing well in a completely
[SPEAKER_04]: lit environment?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So strawberries are kind of the next big
crop that a lot of CAA growers are looking
[SPEAKER_06]: to produce in vertical farms specifically.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a company in New Jersey called
Weishi Farms that is now growing
[SPEAKER_06]: strawberries and distributing them to
Michelin star restaurants in New York
[SPEAKER_06]: City.
[SPEAKER_06]: They cost about $50 a pound.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're they're very expensive,
supposedly delicious.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are served as a plating in one of the
multiple courses that you'd receive at
[SPEAKER_06]: this restaurant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as one of the plates, you get two of
these strawberries.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing else.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can see the kind of markets that
these products are getting into,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially on the on the culinary herbs
and niche crop side.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we we caution our clients about this
these markets because the size is limited
[SPEAKER_06]: and you can oversaturate those markets
pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are a lot of big players in the
Dutch agriculture industry that have
[SPEAKER_06]: focused on these markets and are paying
more attention to it in the United States.
[SPEAKER_06]: An example of that is the New York City
microgreens market, which is is largely
[SPEAKER_06]: controlled by a Dutch microgreens producer
that produces very cheaply in a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_06]: on Long Island.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they they compete with all of the
smaller microgreens producers in New York
[SPEAKER_06]: City.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's hard to build kind of a capital
raise around a market when you have or a
[SPEAKER_06]: limited market size when you have very big
players kind of stepping into the ring
[SPEAKER_06]: with very low cost of production.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've seen investors shy away from
those niche markets for that reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this question I'm going to give
to either Grant or Sam, how have your
[SPEAKER_04]: decisions or the decisions you've made
around energy purchases?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: How have your technology partners played a
role in that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether it be I know, Grant, you guys have
a microgrid partner.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you guys are working with Dell and
some other groups like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you really you know, how how much do
you rely on those relationships with the
[SPEAKER_04]: tech partners versus how much of the stuff
do you work on in house?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, Sam, I'll maybe go first and try
and try and keep it short.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, the the partnerships in this
space are huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So especially when you think about when
you think about energy, it is one of our
[SPEAKER_01]: our largest cost items.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you when you think about the great
math problem, that's how we often talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about it internally and externally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about trying to make the
economics work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Sam hit the nail on the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all want to be price takers in this
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only way we're going to be able
to to really start to move the needle in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of the product that comes out of out
of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the the technical knowledge of how
different energy solutions can integrate
[SPEAKER_01]: within a system is just not something that
that we have both had the time to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that would take us probably,
I don't know, 20 years to build the
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect farm on our own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it's and it's something that when we
when we need to connect information points
[SPEAKER_01]: across, we need the expertise of external
partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's something such as such as our
micro grid, where that allows us to take
[SPEAKER_01]: our our internal energy usage and how we
plan for energy uses on a daily basis
[SPEAKER_01]: based on what's in the biodome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we look at what's happening in the and
from the grid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we try to we try to manage and do
curtailment as best as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if it's if it's trying to even take a
step back and look at OK, having having
[SPEAKER_01]: high res high resolution controls on our
breakers, looking at high resolution data
[SPEAKER_01]: analytics on each of our panels and trying
to match that up with how our HVAC is
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling, pulling that together and being
able to bounce that off of somebody who is
[SPEAKER_01]: an external partner and say, hey,
does this does this look right for just
[SPEAKER_01]: just how I'm trying to understand what the
hell is going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's huge, because, you know,
we're we're a very small focus team.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to get the highest quality
plants out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really do rely on external partners
very heavily.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think certainly we rely on external
partners for some things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say, though, at a very high level,
like Aerofarms were our own technology
[SPEAKER_05]: partner and that we have a technology that
we built out, obviously in conjunction
[SPEAKER_05]: with many other players.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have a technology that we're
looking to deploy across the globe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the site selection where you actually
deploy that technology can solve a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: the questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the same reason why you have farms
in California, you may have farms that are
[SPEAKER_05]: located next to utilities where you get a
lower cost structure or have certain
[SPEAKER_05]: infrastructure in place.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a reason why farms are
in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's because they can produce with a
with a low cost structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a function of a lot of
different factors.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now there's new technology and those
that new technology is now going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: implemented across the globe.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that will be done in conjunction with
site specific factors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that can go a long way at
mitigating a lot of the costs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a little bit of a different way to
answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then one final question before we open
up to the audience for for questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to put this house to all three
of you because it might be slightly
[SPEAKER_04]: sensitive information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are any can any of you answer the
question?
[SPEAKER_04]: What percentage of your cost of goods of
material does utilities make up?
[SPEAKER_04]: So another way to ask that is how much on
a per pound basis, what percentage is
[SPEAKER_04]: utilities?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or whatever, whatever metric you are
comfortable using or sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess I'll take a swing and try to
answer that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of depends on the crop,
because not all crops take the same amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of usage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that if you as you think about the the
everything going on in the biodome,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have a mix of crops that's that's also
going to going to add into something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what we found, it's anywhere between
30 to 50 percent in terms of what our cost
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Javid, do you have anything to add to
that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would say it depends a lot on the
system type.
[SPEAKER_06]: The crop definitely plays a role in that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, I mean, when we when we look at
a greenhouse that has no supplemental
[SPEAKER_06]: lighting, your energy uses can be very,
very low and then your labor will be the
[SPEAKER_06]: higher cost component.
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost across the board, we see labor as
the biggest cost for these farms.
[SPEAKER_06]: Utilities does hover around 30 to 50
percent usually.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then that can grow if you have a
highly automated farm that uses a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: mechanization and automation instead of
that labor component.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam, do you want to add anything or?
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: With that being said, I think we have now
have some time for some questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll turn it to the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an earlier panel, we talked about how
the energy consumption of a farm or
[SPEAKER_00]: facility is not necessarily the greatest
contributor to the carbon impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often the fuel mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was just curious if you could
both or all three of you comment on what
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been seeing in terms of in your own
facility, the mix between electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption and other, whether that's
natural gas, delivered fuels, on site,
[SPEAKER_00]: thermal, renewable generators,
et cetera.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a so I can't comment on the total
carbon impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just finished the farm and we're we're
literally firing it up to have have crops
[SPEAKER_01]: on on shelves in the next 30 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that we hope to be
able to to share and be and be open about
[SPEAKER_01]: very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have natural gas that comes into the
microgrid to to a standby dispatchable
[SPEAKER_01]: generator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have so we have solar on our
roof as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you hope to offset that how much that
that will actually take over time as we
[SPEAKER_01]: think about ramping up to production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to we want to publish actuals once
we have them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think microgrids are are definitely a
great and I think there's a panel on those
[SPEAKER_05]: later today.
[SPEAKER_05]: A great opportunity for the sector in
certain instances, particularly where you
[SPEAKER_05]: have higher energy costs.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think there the challenges you
need something like 20 times the square
[SPEAKER_05]: footage in terms of panels of what you
would need just for your consumption
[SPEAKER_05]: during peak hours of the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you need all the batteries and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's it's huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that would dramatically impact
your site selection.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now all of a sudden you're you're
looking for, you know, two million square
[SPEAKER_05]: feet versus, you know, one hundred
thousand square feet of space.
[SPEAKER_05]: It dramatically changes that assessment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not to say that it can't be can't
be addressed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we we located specifically our
next farm will be in Virginia specifically
[SPEAKER_05]: because it had a reliable grid,
had reliable inputs for natural gas and
[SPEAKER_05]: for electricity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also that we felt the utility was
making efforts itself to diversify its
[SPEAKER_05]: portfolio and to move into renewables.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it's a bit of a different
approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, certainly we want to be
partnering with utilities where we have a
[SPEAKER_05]: like minded view in terms of the,
you know, their carbon impact over over
[SPEAKER_05]: the course of our of our farm operation.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys just sort of answered it,
Jim Pantaleo, Sam Grant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we talk about either owning a
building or leasing a building,
[SPEAKER_02]: it brings a whole nother question in with
respect to how much you can go off grid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this is a question for you,
Javid.
[SPEAKER_02]: What have you seen in terms of folks that
own their buildings versus folks that
[SPEAKER_02]: lease their buildings?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason I ask that is that I've
been a part of indoor farms where the
[SPEAKER_02]: buildings have been owned and leased for
the lease building.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to put photovoltaics up on the
roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could totally fine with the owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we left, they stayed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it didn't it didn't really pan out.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the other building, of course,
we owned it and we could have done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just curious what your what you
know about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think a lot of it comes down to,
you know, who owns the building and what
[SPEAKER_06]: they're going to allow you to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say in the planning stage,
it's really important to look at the
[SPEAKER_06]: zoning in that particular area,
what that allows for.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you are planning on using,
you know, microgrid or, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: other renewable energy tie ins that you
have the space for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's difficult to provide a concise
answer for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would say it really just comes down
to doing the due diligence beforehand and
[SPEAKER_06]: making sure that you can do those things
before you've invested either through a
[SPEAKER_06]: lease or an outright purchase.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_03]: AgriList just did a study and obviously
they do quite a bit of reports.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wondered your comments on vertical
farming, because the numbers in that
[SPEAKER_03]: particular study seem to be fairly high
with regards to not being profitable in
[SPEAKER_03]: the vertical side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know you just mentioned something
about labor as well, which I would expect
[SPEAKER_03]: with the cherry pickers and all that,
trying to do, you know, vertical farming
[SPEAKER_03]: is going to be a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just curious, just do you have a
consensus amongst you of where do you
[SPEAKER_03]: think that's going and how you may be able
to make it more efficient?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I think every project,
every farm is unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a lot of studies that
are published in this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Labor is often cited in them as being a
large cost, but there are so many factors
[SPEAKER_01]: that go into this very complex,
it's not even complicated, it's beyond
[SPEAKER_01]: that, complex math problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what's the rent?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the yield cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the, are you doing one crop or are
you doing multiple crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what is the HVAC strategy?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all these factors that come
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's, I think the vertical
farming space in particular has struggled
[SPEAKER_01]: because a lot of people are still trying
to approach the validation or the proven
[SPEAKER_01]: economics from a research standpoint
without really looking at kind of full
[SPEAKER_01]: production assumptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean by that is really looking at
it from a, okay, how do you balance all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these different work in process inventory,
inventory actuals, and also what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening from a marketing standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's definitely here to stay as
an industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's enough need for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's enough factors for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Labor is a component, but it's just a
component in a very, very complex problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think that's all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is very complex, but we've been
operating now the vertical farm that I
[SPEAKER_05]: showed in the video for about three years.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I mentioned, that was designed about
five years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we designed that, it was to prove out
certain KPIs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we as a company have consistently hit
those KPIs and now feel confident that
[SPEAKER_05]: future build-outs will get the unit
economics that we need.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in short, obviously we didn't,
this was so new when we were setting out
[SPEAKER_05]: to do it and it's still extremely new.
[SPEAKER_05]: This industry is in its infancy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were kind of triaging risk and we
really built the facility around,
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say more like flexibility because
we didn't know exactly what we needed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't know exactly what automation was
gonna be needed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't know exactly what critical
infrastructure was gonna be needed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we built it around flexibility so that
we could hit the KPIs that we needed to
[SPEAKER_05]: hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And having de-risked essentially the
ability to scale these vertical farms,
[SPEAKER_05]: the economies of scale in conjunction with
those KPIs, we feel confident we're gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: be building a much, much larger improved
design of that in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that says something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously every technology is different.
[SPEAKER_05]: What profitability means is different to
different parties.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's a lot of different ways to
kind of look at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: This industry is unquestionably here to
stay.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of tailwinds I think in the
industry as well to kind of keep driving.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just talked about LED efficiency and
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of improvements that are
kind of coming down the pipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just add one more thing to that is
that there are profitable vertical farms
[SPEAKER_04]: out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But all the answers up here touch on a
couple of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is profit?
[SPEAKER_04]: That means a lot to different people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you'll see right now in food
production in the vertical farming
[SPEAKER_04]: industry, oftentimes the smaller farms can
turn a profit.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're usually bootstrapped and
profit is measured maybe differently than
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody who's out doing a large capital
raise and building a mega vertical farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that was a great answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to see if Javita had anything
else to add to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we've seen a lot is entrepreneurs
building their businesses in kind of a
[SPEAKER_06]: step function where they won't set out
with positive unit economics.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll understand that they're going to
be operating at a negative margin for
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe a couple of years while they build
their brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then basically take up shelf space.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they can leverage that shelf
space for investment and further rounds
[SPEAKER_06]: and provide their investors with a roadmap
of how they're going to lower those unit
[SPEAKER_06]: economics and achieve profitability in the
future.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's going after that because it's
kind of the low hanging fruit of the
[SPEAKER_06]: industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's microgreens, smaller baby greens.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have lower lighting requirements
compared to other crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can manage those heat loads more
affordably.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a lot of existing standardized
automation and mechanization systems that
[SPEAKER_06]: are often borrowed from the Dutch
horticulture industry that are then used
[SPEAKER_06]: in this industry to reduce that labor
cost.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as the market expands, it expands into
other higher value crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: We see the labor become an issue again
with things like strawberries where if
[SPEAKER_06]: you're not operating on a size of farm
large enough, you can't use natural
[SPEAKER_06]: pollinators.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to hand pollinate or do some
other method for pollination.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that becomes very costly again.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it depends on the crop as well as the
size of your operation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and one more thing to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: At Urban Agnews, we look at three
variables and there's a lot of inputs that
[SPEAKER_04]: go into these three variables.
[SPEAKER_04]: Currently, if you think about light
intensity, you think about plant density,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you think about crop cycle,
and you look at the variables that make up
[SPEAKER_04]: those three measurables, you'll find
profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was curious if you could talk about the
commissioning process, whether that you
[SPEAKER_00]: perform yourself or whether that you had a
partner perform for your facilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: either when you were newly constructing in
your existing building, and then Sam,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have plans for commissioning for
your new facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we built new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was built from the ground up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We laid the concrete pad, everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's kind of HVAC commissioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think about that, there's light
turn on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's packaging commissioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of that stuff, we've worked with
partners where we've bought technology off
[SPEAKER_01]: the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from a full systems integration
standpoint, that's really proprietary to
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think within this industry,
it's pretty much proprietary to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really how you bring all of these
pieces together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really the real challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a full kind of commissioning
turn on plan with that, that we are at the
[SPEAKER_01]: tail end of now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was something, again,
back to Chris's earlier point,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was something that we worked on with
external parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our relationship with our utility has
been fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been really close since we went
from dorm room project to visionary mega
[SPEAKER_01]: farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We included them from day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that planning process, we worked hard
at probably a year and a half ago in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of, hey, what is this actual commissioning
schedule ramp up going to look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen really big dividends of
making sure that everything was really
[SPEAKER_01]: just well articulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we feel lucky that we actually did
that piece successfully.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree that the commissioning is
definitely proprietary, how you kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: integrate all the systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will say one thing that you should just
stress with these types of systems is
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a real estate component and then
there's the kind of improvements to that
[SPEAKER_05]: real estate that need to happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's the equipment itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of that is a bit of a dance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the earlier you have access to the
building to start installing equipment,
[SPEAKER_05]: the better because it accelerates that
timeline.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think from when we talk about like
permitting and early access and those
[SPEAKER_05]: types of questions, there really isn't a
playbook out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've had to work directly with the
permitting offices and the relevant
[SPEAKER_05]: parties to get into the building sooner
than maybe you normally would have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think establishing some sort of a
standard there would be a good thing for
[SPEAKER_05]: the industry because hopefully it would be
a good thing for the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: But getting early access to get that
process going is important because
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously these are expensive to build
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the sooner you start growing and
selling food, the better.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have time for one more question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's an important point,
Sam, that you just made, too, around
[SPEAKER_01]: these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of activity in the
cannabis realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you think about permitting,
when you think about commissioning from
[SPEAKER_01]: that standpoint, you do have knowledge in
some utilities, certainly not all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we've all been part of that
conversation here today or over the past
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of our facilities do have very
proprietary controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you think about panel boards,
where those are placed, how those are
[SPEAKER_01]: designed, how they're impacting certain
production systems, all of that is just
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be unique to really any type of
inspector.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for these size farms, it's something
that's new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for a lot of utilities and a lot of
inspectors, new means time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means time to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means time to become familiar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So making them aware of our, I mean,
literally since the first time we got
[SPEAKER_01]: initial, even almost napkin drawings was
what we tried to do because it's certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: a unique situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: With that, I'd like to thank the panelists
and thank everybody for your attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
