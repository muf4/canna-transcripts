[SPEAKER_00]: So within the county we have the
unincorporated areas which make up a
[SPEAKER_00]: population of about a million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially it becomes the fourth largest
city in the entire state of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the issue behind that is that the
Board of Supervisors have they've already
[SPEAKER_00]: said that their number one goal is to
transition operators to a regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're doing the math behind it
and the current recommendations they have
[SPEAKER_00]: for zoning which is indoor cultivation
only and that retail and all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of license types would have to be
within commercial or manufacturing zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: When all that adds up to only 1% of the
county's territory I don't know how they
[SPEAKER_00]: will be successful and able to transfer
you know to bring people over for you to a
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again with the math on there you're
looking at it the unincorporate areas have
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural zone land and that makes up
39% of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that 39% that they are not
allowing a ag plant to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate on there I don't see how they
will be able to get rid of the black
[SPEAKER_00]: market coming on there how they're going
to have to you know transition people over
[SPEAKER_00]: it just won't be successful if they do it
this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with any luck we certainly see a lot of
hope that we can get that changed up
[SPEAKER_00]: before they're going to vote on their
regulations which is around December
[SPEAKER_00]: January.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conversations we've had so far has
been a bit of a miseducation where they
[SPEAKER_00]: had concerns over having acres and acres
and acres of cannabis not recognizing the
[SPEAKER_00]: state has limitations behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be just part of an
education piece to help them understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have them acknowledging that the
voters have voted for this and they want
[SPEAKER_00]: it that works out very well however when
at the same time they're acknowledging
[SPEAKER_00]: that but in the same breath they also say
but I believe this is a gateway drug it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a little hard to them to kind of wrap
everything around you wonder where the
[SPEAKER_00]: sincerity is on that and when you try to
ask where is that where their facts coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from and their responses that I have a
doctor friend and my doctor friend told me
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's a little frustrating again you
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the supervisors I really do feel are
very sincere and want to get this done I
[SPEAKER_00]: just don't think they understand the
entire dynamics behind it and if they plan
[SPEAKER_00]: to do something like a phased approach
that still will not help an illicit market
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to thrive from there and they're
not going to be able to transition those
[SPEAKER_00]: operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phase approach to where they could say
right now we're only going to allow indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: and then maybe in a year or two three
whatever it is they'll say hey let's open
[SPEAKER_00]: this up now to actually do agricultural
zone lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within the ag zone itself they just
have currently stated that they recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: not having any commercial cannabis
activity of any sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're well absolutely it's already been
happening there well you know it's I think
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'd be more profitable for them
to do it that way than it is to spend the
[SPEAKER_00]: resources towards regulating people on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel very strong that we have a very
good opportunity to influence that through
[SPEAKER_00]: this education so you know with my
position now with an accounting on there
[SPEAKER_00]: with our efforts as the organization in
general with everyone coming forward and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of saying hey look this is an
opportunity you're missing out on I do
[SPEAKER_00]: think they're going to realize that and in
time for 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the surprising thing is this you know
I had some of them reached out and one of
[SPEAKER_00]: them was telling me that they had
greenhouses everything ready to go and
[SPEAKER_00]: their concern was that the county would
allow big business to come in and put them
[SPEAKER_00]: out not even realizing that the county is
not allowing big business or small
[SPEAKER_00]: business on ag land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're I'm getting more and more
reports of people that are setting up have
[SPEAKER_00]: this ready to go however they have no
realization that the county has said sorry
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not going to allow this here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So money is being put into it and they're
hoping to feed their families and whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: goes from there and yet they don't realize
that they're not going to get to legally
[SPEAKER_00]: participate in this new market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
