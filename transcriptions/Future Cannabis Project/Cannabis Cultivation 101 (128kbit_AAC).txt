[SPEAKER_00]: We manage a 30,000 square foot facility in
Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a second 35,000 square foot
facility coming online at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a 20,000 square foot facility
coming online in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We develop strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a proprietary cannabis
specific fertilizer, which we call clay
[SPEAKER_00]: nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the industry for 17,
18 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for everyone giving me a chance
to speak about my favorite topic,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, this is more geared towards the
beginning cultivation rookie, I would like
[SPEAKER_00]: to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Lisa asked how many of you are new
to the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This presentation is more geared towards
those of you who are interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: investing into cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you guys ready to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I got a limited time, so I'm just
going to try to rifle through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions I always get is,
how do I invest in cannabis cultivation?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three options to invest in
cannabis cultivation, indoor, greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: or straight outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most popular is probably indoor just
because of the state of the plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been illegal for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been so many indoor cultivations
trying to evade law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go through some of the pros
and cons first of indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go through greenhouse and then
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor cultivation, here's a picture of
one of our rooms in Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the pros is you have very
consistent quality of your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weather doesn't hinder the product,
no rain, you don't have to worry about the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also perpetually harvest the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, because there's no weather
affecting your product, you could do what
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are God, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You control the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might argue also that the indoor
product, the indoor flower, is higher
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know greenhouse and outdoor people will
argue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you might be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the outdoor quality is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greenhouse quality might be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no doubt about it that if
you're producing indoor flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get a higher retail value.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no question about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the pros that people don't think
about is you actually get to recycle a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of water indoors versus outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using water and you're not really
using any high-intensive equipment like
[SPEAKER_00]: HVAC and dehumidification necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the water generated by that
equipment, you can actually recycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The con, of course, is that the same
electricity that generates all that water
[SPEAKER_00]: you could recycle is not environmentally
friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, those are some of the pros of
indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some might argue there's more cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the number one cons of indoor
cultivation is the expense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very expensive to start up an indoor
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone by show of hands, how many people
have an indoor cultivation running right
[SPEAKER_00]: now?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys probably know the expense up
front.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 30,000 square foot facility we built
in Phoenix cost, I think, four million.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know of a facility in Illinois that's
75,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it cost 16 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a big con, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of upfront investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's a lot of expertise required
to pull off indoor cultivations
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively, continuously over time
without problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it's environmentally taxing
because of all the power that you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: use to cultivate indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another con is the cost of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's anywhere from $2 a gram up for indoor
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like boutique, really high-end
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another con, of course, is that there is
really no school of design.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you invest in a space, how do you
design it most efficiently?
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to school for engineering or
architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to teach you maybe efficient
ways to design a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just learning as we go indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, that's a big con because who knows
what the best way to grow is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we haven't got there yet,
but it's always evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, growing in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing in a greenhouse, there's obviously
the pros are the cost upfront are much
[SPEAKER_00]: lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less taxing environmentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product quality is still very good,
especially here in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a long history of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of incredible greenhouse
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, they're going to argue their
product is better than the indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in many cases, but that is definitely
one of the pros.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could still grow really, really good
quality cannabis, really good quality
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, and the cost is less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cost of production in a greenhouse,
if you're really efficient, you could get
[SPEAKER_00]: it down to about a dollar per gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about half the indoor cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Retail sale value, that was probably a lot
less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the cons of a greenhouse,
obviously, are the production quality is
[SPEAKER_00]: not as consistent year round, the lower
retail value, which I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you still are outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's bugs, there's fungus, there's
molds, things that are much more difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a chance to visit one of the largest
greenhouse producers in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have, I think, 400,000 square feet of
greenhouse space, and they're surrounded
[SPEAKER_00]: by other greenhouses that grow produce,
and because of the environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're continually battling powder
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being in a greenhouse, the one big con is
that you cannot control the environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the product is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're thinking of investing,
the greenhouse is a very good way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, outdoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor, in the industry, we say it's a
little bit different than greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're strictly outdoor,
there's no cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a friend of mine's picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's probably upset that I'm using his
picture, but I won't tell you where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in Southern California,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has an acre grown in Southern
California outdoor, crazy, but outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation is obviously great because the
cost is very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no structure to build.
[SPEAKER_00]: He put up this screen because of the heat,
so the screen protects from the heat
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, in outdoor cultivation,
some of the pros are the sun is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to pay for the sun,
at least not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if Trump gets elected, he'll try to
charge for the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but the sun is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful to be outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The startup costs are very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of your production is very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of the pros of being
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cons, of course, are security.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor growers are constantly worried
about getting robbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know many, many friends who have been
robbed pre-harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within a week of harvest, all of a sudden
their crop is cut down and it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's robbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors, that's one of the concerns you
always have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have mentioned that indoor,
that's also a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: But outdoor especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors, of course, you have the pest and
disease, the insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing for sure outdoors that you have
that you don't have in a greenhouse or
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor, you have to worry about animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some animals love to eat pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're indoors, you don't have to worry
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some humans that like to eat
pot, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to worry about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality is not as consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors, obviously, that's a big drawback
of outdoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, you get a very nice
traditional crop outdoors, if weather
[SPEAKER_00]: permits, and you're in the right location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you've decided on the facility,
the type of way you're going to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should figure out what strains you're
going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we talked about strains earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain strains that some people
find great for certain ailments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baba Kush, to keep you sedated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baba Kush is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matter of fact, this strain here,
Snake Eyes, is a hybrid of Oji and Baba.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're looking in the industry as
an investment opportunity, there is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely a short list of strains that
are extremely popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, I think if you're in the
industry, you probably know it's Oji Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oji Kush has been probably the bestseller
for 10 years, maybe longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl Scout Cookies, you guys know that
one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl Scout is a very popular strain,
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest, Girl Scout is similar
to, it's like a Baba Oji hybrid,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Oji, Girl Scout, Baba Kush,
and Tangi, which is kind of like an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting hybrid that has this really
strong citrus, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a citrus, kind of like tangerine
smell, is also kind of popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people, I know a lot of people hear
about CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you actually own a dispensary,
there isn't really a demand for CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you would imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although, of course, there are tons of
people in need of CBD strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as a whole, in the recreational
market, it's a small percentage of the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so you know, a lot of people might
assume that if I had a whole board of CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, I'm gonna kill it on the retail
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oji Kush, Baba Kush, Girl Scout,
have some nice sativas, and then have CBDs
[SPEAKER_00]: for the true medicinal patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name game, do you guys know about the
strain name game?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivators probably know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name game is just this idea that
dispensaries will change the name of their
[SPEAKER_00]: strains because they're more popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, one of the things you'll
learn as you get in the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's specific strains that have a
specific effect in look and smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then there's people that just name
everything that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, anyway, genetics are very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so once you've decided to grow,
you've figured out your strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have your facility, where are you
gonna get your genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two sources that you're going to
get your genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is from seed, and the other is from a
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in California, and you can
easily get access to genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're probably gonna go for clones
because seeds have a lot of variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed producing companies haven't
gotten to the level of sophistication that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've gotten to with Big Ag,
with genetic modification, so you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you're growing production,
you want to go from a clone based strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you want to make sure that your source
is very well reputable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say one of the best sources for
clones is probably Elemental Wellness in
[SPEAKER_00]: San Jose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They carry a lot of clones from really
respected farms, like Dark Heart Nursery,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a bunch of others I can't think of,
but if you're going the clone route,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you go to a reputable clone
vendor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the clone vendor that I like is
Elemental Wellness in San Jose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very reputable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you decide to grow from seeds,
which you may if you're out of state,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're in California, you probably want
to go from clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of disadvantages and
advantages either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds, the one beauty is that you could
store them for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had seeds that I've stored for over a
decade, and they still sprout with a
[SPEAKER_00]: really high germination rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growth is really vigorous from seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a lot of variation, and that might
not be good if you're a producer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you're a breeder, that's great
because you could find something really
[SPEAKER_00]: unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the advantage is if you're growing
from a seed, they're free from pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get something that's
infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're buying a clone on the other
hand, you never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be carrying powder mildew,
could have broad mites, something really
[SPEAKER_00]: nasty that could ruin your entire garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, whatever way you decide to
go, you have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But clones, I would say you have more
advantages than disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost for seeds is about five to 10
retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: For clones, it's about five to 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 is really high end if you're buying
something from a vendor that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually it's about, I would say $12 is
the average retail price of a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now when you get your clones,
you don't have to worry about this with
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, but there's a lot of common
cannabis pests that re-carnage on
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what keeps me up at night?
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the pests, probably broad
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They attack the plant in a similar way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me go to the list and I'll tell
you a little bit about the broad and
[SPEAKER_00]: russets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two spotted spider mite, which is that
guy there on the left there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the two spotted spider mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably the most common pest in
cannabis gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get it, you really got to
isolate your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say if you want to take care
of it in the safe way, azadirachtin is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably your best bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the products on the market are
azomax, azotrol, and it's a good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't kill it completely unless you're
really, really anal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would do is I would actually
isolate my plants, spray them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then look through them with my naked
eye and literally pop each mite by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would do that for weeks until
they're all completely gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could also use bug bombs and
stuff that's a lot more harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're trying to be organic,
use something like azadirachtin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now russet and broad mites are on a whole
other level because they do this insane
[SPEAKER_00]: damage to the plant and you can't see
them, which makes it very difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the two spotted spider mite,
at least you could see it with the naked
[SPEAKER_00]: eye if you look close enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I'm almost blind, basically,
I could still see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Broad and russet mites, you have to use a
microscope and they attack the buds where
[SPEAKER_00]: the two spotted spider mite attacks the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the structure of a
flower, a cannabis flower, it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: convoluted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But russet and broad mites, the picture
here in the middle, that picture in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle there is russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they attack the buds and they spread
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could also use azadirachtin on broad
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did an experiment where I sprayed,
actually sprayed with azadirachtin,
[SPEAKER_00]: counted the number of broad mites before
and after, and it killed about 80% of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problem is, if you don't kill them all,
they're going to replicate really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also, I've never done this, but I've
heard sulfur, it works really well with
[SPEAKER_00]: broad and russets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another common cannabis pest is thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I don't have a picture of
the thrips, but what they do is they kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of attack the leaf and etch it out and it
makes this weird silvery kind of pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're easy to take care of for the
most part with something called spinosad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus gnats are those guys there on the
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones won't kill your crop and
they're very difficult to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers that I know, at least on the
commercial scale, have just decided that
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, we could just live with the fungus
gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do our best to keep them at bay,
but they're going to be part of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, what they do is they burrow into
the roots and they like to suck on the,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, they burrow into the soil and they
like to eat the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whiteflies are another insect that like to
eat cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had much problems with
whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know regionally it's different in
Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know whiteflies are worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest using like lacewings or lady
beetles and unleash them in your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll do a pretty decent job of
eating the whiteflies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, last is the tobacco budworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow outdoors, I know for sure you
know caterpillars, budworms will wreak
[SPEAKER_00]: havoc on your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the ways to destroy budworms is
with BT or bacillus thuringiensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's basically a beneficial
bacteria that you could put into the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: or spray on the plant that will just kill
the budworms and kill their larvae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, those are the common cannabis
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mildews, molds, and mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my, ew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew by far is the worst.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the bane of all cannabis
cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spreads quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to contain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will develop resistance to
fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very difficult thing to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as state regulations come down the
road, the states are now testing for
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus counts and mold counts and spore
counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't just live with PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't sell bud with PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least not in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can get away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are the types of things you have
to look out if you're getting into
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdery mildew, mycotoxins, which are like
a secondary metabolite of certain fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: like aspergillus, and botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Botrytis is a, I think they call it bud
rot basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when your bud just starts to decay
from the inside out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's horrible, horrible plague.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good thing, excuse me, the good thing
about botrytis is that botrytis is very
[SPEAKER_00]: strain specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are growing OG kusher baba because
of the buds structure, it's unlikely
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing blue dream or something
really airy and big, then botrytis is much
[SPEAKER_00]: more likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's ways to combat those too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, those are some things you have
to look out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so now we've got to the point we
have seeds or we have clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing them with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could germinate and paper towels.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to do is take my seeds,
put them in water and then wait about 24
[SPEAKER_00]: hours and then put them in paper towels
and then at some point you'll have a
[SPEAKER_00]: taproot that forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the taproot is that little white thing
sticking out of the seed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could see over a couple of days
the roots will develop and they'll grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think technically they're called a
radical root.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the radical root gets to a certain
size, you want to transplant it to your
[SPEAKER_00]: medium, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that guy down there is a
little bit too, you let it go a little too
[SPEAKER_00]: long here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll still work, you could still
transplant it, but I would suggest going
[SPEAKER_00]: for something about there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy's perfect right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transplant it when it gets to about that
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know most of you are probably going
to go from clone if you're cultivating
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me shuffle through the seeds real
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just really quickly, here's a seed that's
sprouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably three days after the
picture we just saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the growth that you're looking at in
this picture probably happens over the
[SPEAKER_00]: course of a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice that in the last picture the seed
is kind of stuck on top of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: These leaves are called cotyledons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice that they don't look like normal
pot leaves, the ones that are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: rounded.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the plant gets all of its
initial nutrition to start the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now this is just an interesting
example of how seeds are viable for so
[SPEAKER_00]: long.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of four skunk number one
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are actually the original skunk
number one straight from Dave Watson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anyone know who Dave Watson is?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are from his collection and these
have been frozen for 15 years and they
[SPEAKER_00]: still sprouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the beauty of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have this great long-term storage
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've gotten our seeds or our clones
ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're to the point where we could
transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you got to choose your grow medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a grow medium is basically what your
plant goes into once it has roots and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could start what's called the vegetative
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say the most popular grow mediums
are cocoa, rockwort, and soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydroton is also used in water culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water culture is very difficult to master
and on a commercial scale I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend it because there's lots of
problems that could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But water culture is basically where
you're putting your plant's roots into
[SPEAKER_00]: water with aeration and there is no
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a completely medium-less
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we're at the veg period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a lot of time to get here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the veg period.
[SPEAKER_00]: The veg period is where you're focusing on
your leaves and your root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to think about philosophically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a plant, it has leaves,
it has roots, it has buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buds aren't growing yet so I like to focus
on growing roots and leaves at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point I should probably
introduce something that's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys know about photo period?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never grown pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the photo period for cannabis,
basically you control when the plant grows
[SPEAKER_00]: buds or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a pop plant in 18 hours of
light or more, it'll grow vegetatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll grow leaves forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never have buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you switch the lighting period to
12 hours a day, it'll initiate bud
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now once you go into that flowering
period, it's about three weeks before you
[SPEAKER_00]: start to see flowers grow in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you guys a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what a female flower looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it takes about two to three
weeks to initiate once you've triggered
[SPEAKER_00]: the photo period to 12 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have your plant, you're growing
them, you change your photo period to 12
[SPEAKER_00]: hours a day and you start to develop
female flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now trichomes really are where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole point of growing cannabis is to
get trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes are the glands that contain
the cannabinoids, the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the things we love.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like Bubba Kush?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, actually you like Bubba Kush's
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoke, we vaporize, we consume
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we grow, you can think of yourself
as a trichome farmer to some extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of the underside of a
leaf during flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a strained garlic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a strain developed by Mel Frank,
who's a really good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matter of fact, a lot of these pictures I
took from Mel from his huge database of 40
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see the trichome production,
it gets really dense with about the fourth
[SPEAKER_00]: week of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a strain that we developed,
which we call Snake Eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hybrid of Bubba and OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the trichome production here
on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really quick here, let me run through the
bud development.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've never seen a cannabis plant
grow, it usually takes about 60 to 70 days
[SPEAKER_00]: from the beginning of flower to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a 70 day period where you're
growing buds, growing trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to quickly run through what
that looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about two to three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about four weeks, four and a half,
and eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a plant that's about ready to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our Bubba Skywalker.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very, very heavy duty pre-98
Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Garland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now one of the questions I get often
is, how do you know when to harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one way is to look at the actual
trichomes with a microscope, and you start
[SPEAKER_00]: to see the color changing from clear to
opaque, and then it gets like a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of literature was written in
the 70s and 80s about amber trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: being the point at which you harvest,
but a study that Mel Frank did in the 90s
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of put that to rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, indoors, what you're looking for
is about 50% opaque and just five to 10%
[SPEAKER_00]: amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once most of the trichomes have gotten
amber, in terms of potency, you've already
[SPEAKER_00]: passed that period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of how you know when to
harvest, you want to look at the color of
[SPEAKER_00]: the trichomes, or you just also look at
the plant itself, and it looks like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: ready, it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so now I'm just going to give
you guys some Nug Porn.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just pictures of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the very famous Girl Scout
cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk number one again from Dave Watson.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right, we have Mendocino Purple
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a Bubba Kush hybrid from
Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was actually bred by CSI Humboldt,
if you guys know them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a very good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left, we have the Donna Oji,
which is a strain we developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Maui, which is a famous Hawaiian
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Phoenix Oji.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 75% Oji Kush, 25% Bubba hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so we've got through flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're at harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, we can harvest our flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, harvest time is about 60 to 70
days in flowering, and at the end of that
[SPEAKER_00]: period, you could harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, you're chopping the plants
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang drying is a very popular method,
especially if you're a boutique grower and
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a limited number of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hang drying, I think, in my opinion,
produces a superior product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Machines trim very fast, but they don't do
as good of a job as humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're looking at investing in
cultivation, this is an interesting step.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trim labor, if you're hand trimming,
could count up to about 10% of the cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might be something to think about
when you're deciding whether to go
[SPEAKER_00]: boutique versus mass production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trimming is very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, curing and drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've dried your flowers,
you've harvested them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got to cure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Curing is really the process of getting
the chlorophyll levels down in your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not so harsh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically, I like to cure for three to
four weeks, and usually the edge is taken
[SPEAKER_00]: off, and your plants are nice and smooth
when you smoke them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing to notice about curing and
drying that it's a very difficult thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of expertise and labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're getting into cultivation,
make sure you spend money or effort
[SPEAKER_00]: finding someone who's very passionate
about curing and drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so today extraction is very,
very, very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have a harvest, you have a
lot of flowers that are buds that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to sell, but you have also a good
percentage of trim, and you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: wondering to do with the trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the options for processing nowadays are
hydrocarbon extraction, CO2 extraction,
[SPEAKER_00]: and water extraction, and rosin,
which is a relatively new type of
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction involving hydraulic press.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today in California, I would argue the
most popular type of extraction is still
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrocarbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know about BHO, wax and shatter,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason it's popular, one, it's very
cheap, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's tons of 21-year-old young people
going to liquor stores, buying butane,
[SPEAKER_00]: and pressing it through PVC and extracting
their flowers and trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cheap, so it's hard to compete with
this really cheap product.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 extraction is much cleaner and safer,
but it's more difficult to do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water extraction is more of a lost art,
but there are a lot of good water
[SPEAKER_00]: extractors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rosin is another way to extract,
which is basically taking your bud and
[SPEAKER_00]: squishing it like a grape and letting the
resin squirt out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all this extraction that people have
been doing, they could have just been
[SPEAKER_00]: squishing the bud, and how a product just
is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, looking at rosin, it's
something that's a little newer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a very, very clean, solvent-less
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had about eight hours to talk
about it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is very important for
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a grower in California,
and you really haven't been out of Cali,
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I operate in Arizona also and
Nevada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arizona is unregulated for the most part,
but Nevada is very strict.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're testing for heavy metals,
the microbiologicals, mycotoxins,
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides, fungicides, cannabinoids,
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the things you're doing right now
in your grow room will not suffice in two,
[SPEAKER_00]: three years' time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my advice is, to start looking into the
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about fungicides, pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it still be a viable process in two
years?
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So state regulations, very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I figured the organization Women Grow
was a great time to introduce some very
[SPEAKER_00]: vintage picks of women growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is once again from my friend Mel
Frank's collection of 40 years of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to show you guys some
really interesting old school vintage
[SPEAKER_00]: picks of women in action growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 1977 El Dorado County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a friend of Mel's growing this
massive sativa, outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Grandma's Hayes, 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: City of LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: A beautiful woman growing in the city of
LA, 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love urban outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghan Nigerian backcross.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was in New York City in 1982.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took some serious cojones to grow in
New York in 1982.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a critter barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in Northern California,
1981.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the strain here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like an indica though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a harvest going down upstate
New York, 1982.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was 500 pounds produced from this
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So women have been growing for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to give you guys proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I make it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry if I took too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to rush a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thank you very much for listening to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it was a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have no idea what I was talking
about, buy me a drink and I'll talk for a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lisa, you need to say anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to stick around or do a Q&A
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, Q&A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually use cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, personally, I created a synthetic
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have an organic line that I use
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started running organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I created a fertilizer line,
which I call Clay 9.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a grow, then you probably know
a lot more about fertilizer than the
[SPEAKER_00]: average person.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, our line was created
specifically for commercial scale growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the products on the market
nowadays are geared towards boutique
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're really complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see companies that have like 25
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're a boutique grower that
really understands, it's fun because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're adding a million different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the commercial scale, it doesn't make a
lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took that boutique idea and
condensed it down to a commercial line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we sell directly to growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our product isn't available on HydroStore
shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're interested in picking up our
fertilizer, you can just talk to me at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the show and I can give you some
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious about a spring grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: To prepare ourselves, when would be a good
time to Germany?
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps a new moon in June, July?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how many harvests can we get?
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to do spring, a spring grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: When should we start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, you can start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can start vegging as early as
like January, February indoors and then
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it out in March, April, March.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might need supplemental lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to track the amount of
daylight hours of light you're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some strains are real specific and picky.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a strain from indoors,
it's getting 18 hours of light and you
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it outdoors and it's only getting 16
hours of light, it might start to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might want to use supplemental
lighting, even outdoors, until you get to
[SPEAKER_00]: a point where you want to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is, you could start to veg
indoors and bring it out when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: ready, when it's big enough.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to ask a question on just
growing a variety of strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing a variety of strains and
you have a couple of tens to work with,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you recommend sticking to one strain,
one particular tent as opposed to multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: strains on one tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how much you want to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I do a lot of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll grow 200 different varieties in
one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just depends on your workload and
how much you want to dedicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing production and you're just
trying to sell the crop, do all the same
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're looking for phenotypes,
if you're doing a selection, you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: run more strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we done?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, David.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
