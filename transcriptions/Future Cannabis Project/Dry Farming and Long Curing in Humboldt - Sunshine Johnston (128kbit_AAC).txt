[SPEAKER_00]: Here we are at Hall of Flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking to the famous Sunshine
Johnson from Southern Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_00]: famous dry farm cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us about yourself and tell us
about what you're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're here at Hall of Flowers and you
have new packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk to us about the process of getting
your new packaging together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm currently very busy getting
ready for my harvest preparations on the
[SPEAKER_01]: farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is I don't really have a lot of
shots to just leave the farm right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot a lot going on getting ready
for harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I came down here to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I came down here to show my
packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is new.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is new.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is new.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working on this for about nine
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this is Sunshine Johnson Sunbolt
grown loopy fruit and her new packaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is new.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something unique about the
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't you walk us through it?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a mason jar, canning jar,
lots of different uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also probably well, not for long,
but currently the biggest jar on the
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably even got the biggest buds
and can I hold this and you can open it
[SPEAKER_00]: up?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it took till legalization to finally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vacuum seal my jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very excited about this when you open it,
it pops, makes a nice pop sound,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is now I don't know what the
shelf stability is, but it definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: helps create shelf stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is got big buds of loopy fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, but inside of what?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a package.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, there's a package in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what the big bud of loopy fruit
looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from the 2018 harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question that people ask when they
look at the loopy fruit is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that last year's?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because my herb is properly dried and
cured.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually gets better with age and I
would not want to be releasing it too
[SPEAKER_01]: soon, because the one thing that I do on
my farm, which is pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty common in agriculture to cut
early and rush to market, and that is
[SPEAKER_01]: something that I do not do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let things hang and get ripe and cure
the proper amount of time and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: release it until it's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an ideal sort of waiting or shelf
time for your flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're saying it actually gets
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean the early and this is also
vacuum sealed, so it's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: degrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and you want to wait till it's done
curing before you seal it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a mistake that a lot of people
make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how long is your curing process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the soonest I will package will be
early February, late January.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be the earliest I would start and
then I would continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd continue packaging all the way up
until May.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're harvesting when I'm harvesting
in October and getting about a six month
[SPEAKER_01]: cure on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty rare, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Six month cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it could even go longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: This actually went a bit longer than I
intended, but in the creation of the
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging took a long time to get this
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even now people are loving it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all they say is is this is last
year's and then they're like, wow,
[SPEAKER_01]: wow, this is really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no question about the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your process, your curing process alone,
is the complete opposite of
[SPEAKER_00]: commodification of mass production at the
lowest cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the difference between
craft and commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a lot of the commodity market is
currently being driven by simply for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No terpenes, not even any plant matter,
just strictly cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a real drive to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a bulk product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the flower market is a bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even so, you still find commodity in
the flower market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, the commodity market is just a
it's a real drive to the bottom and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: also driven on a grading system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as opposed to craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what criteria is brought to bear?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that graded?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you don't really I mean,
you you can grade it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really what you're looking for is
you're looking for the quality standards
[SPEAKER_01]: that produced it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because the quality standards along
the way are very important because you can
[SPEAKER_01]: choose to cut corners or not cut corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really depends on what it is that
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with with mine, I my resin for
instance, I will if you let the plant get
[SPEAKER_01]: ripe, you will lose color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants won't be as bright green when
you cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your resin is going to turn a slight I
don't want to say brown, but golden color.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not white.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not it's not doesn't have that bright
white look to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and the buds are not as bright green
because you're letting it the plant age a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit longer while it's still in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you don't know, you might look
at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're just doing a commodity style
grading, you're like, oh, the color is not
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the resin is not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and so that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also just being an outdoor
grower, my stuff is just hanging out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only comes once a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not under a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take a lot of risks growing in this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes out different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get windburn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite windy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the wind burn can cause the buds to be
a slight can turn even a bit of an off
[SPEAKER_01]: color when in the wind directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a little bit too toned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just from the wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's there's nothing wrong with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know about wind burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we should also say that you grow a
portion of your harvest for you said to
[SPEAKER_00]: make with nausea to make hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is is the curing process or the process
different for that when you're curing for
[SPEAKER_00]: hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, does that so because the resin?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if if you're curing for flour,
you still want to produce a lot of resin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: For my flower crop, I will cut it before
the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will let the hash crop go as long as I
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will harvest the flower crop a bit
just a little bit earlier than the hash
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one thing that's important with
the hash crop and one of the things that's
[SPEAKER_01]: also unique to Masha is that one of the
things that I like is I like a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of plant matter in my hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why is because it added it
adds complexity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It adds texture to the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's well cured, if it's well
dried, if it's properly dried and well
[SPEAKER_01]: cured, when you go to smoke the hash made
from and there's some of that plant matter
[SPEAKER_01]: in there, it will show itself very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it adds that complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This really is craftsmanship.
[SPEAKER_00]: At its purest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the idea is to transfer that into
the marketplace.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and to receive the appreciation that
you're deserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's the appreciation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just be true to myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be some appreciation here and
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may take time, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just I'm just going to live my
life to the fullest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very, very chill of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very zen of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did you get into the making the
hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us that very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that important to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to continue doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ice water hash is it's it's a whole
plant medicine and it's very powerful
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really it's just I can't even tell
you how many levels it works with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I just I just really want to grow
the best herb that I possibly can to make
[SPEAKER_01]: the best hash, because I feel that it's
such an important medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also one of the most decadent
products you can get out of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can literally take the ripest resin
heads and hold it in your hand from that
[SPEAKER_01]: crop, like the literal cream, which is
which is the the full melt that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: get, which is very good medicine to
especially for people who have health
[SPEAKER_01]: issues because it's a vapor.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, the plant matter in the
hash may not be appropriate for people who
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't necessarily in the best of health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the way you describe it,
you know, I'm a hash lover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to taste some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your process is so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to probably be like curing
your hash product through next May.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the Nasher product will probably
come out next July or all.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends really on the hash maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he can decide that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can decide that he has some other
parameters that he likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're getting me all mouthwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how are we going to when will we
be able to experience this?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the shelf now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look for the Rebel Moon or the
NorCal diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the best value buys out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is I grew the crop just for hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all over the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's it's just one strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just did a name change halfway in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Rebel Moon is out there and it's
very it's it's very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew that just just for a hash crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let it hang a bit longer and I hope to
let it go even longer this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as a part of your you're really busy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, you're not even here right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your brain is somewhere else, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting rid of the real actually
the real truth out of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is like a truth serum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you also do a lot of educating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you do seminars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to continue doing that to
get your unique message of craftsmanship
[SPEAKER_00]: and artistry out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to to stay as I would like to
keep doing education and even expand on
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you describe what you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, is it educating or you just
getting the message out?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the herb has its own message,
so that's a part of it and just along for
[SPEAKER_01]: the ride in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yes, there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is an important time to have a message
and.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even no matter how good my herb is,
the message can be even more important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me ask you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have specific messages for specific
groups like, say, if I said, do you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: message for retailers that they need to
understand about cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, the retailers are not the
direction that the retail market is taking
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just downright evil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a good place to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of it is that I really value my
my relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I work with someone, we work
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's happening with retailers is
that we I mean, I knew this was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen as a farmer, that I was going to
carry the entire tax burden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you go to a retailer, they want to
take half of the half of the profit plus a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what's that little more?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's that excise tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: The retailers for taking half of the
profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feel that they're lousy partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are they going to work for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they going to work for that that half?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just kind of wonder at times now
they're talking about wanting shelf space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm going to be marketing
everything, doing all the packaging,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the marketing, I might as well be
going with a delivery service,
[SPEAKER_01]: really, and trying to pass some savings on
to the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've spoken before about how you feel
like direct to consumer is an important
[SPEAKER_00]: part of your future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you still believe so?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to return back to the
retail aspect because I do have good
[SPEAKER_01]: retail partners out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are independent shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really important that we maintain
these independent shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I definitely want to be there to
support those retailers that we share
[SPEAKER_01]: similar values and a similar message.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just talking about a general trend
that I see happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many ways, it's a segmented industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some people, their values are
predominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're finding those people to work
with who share their values and ethics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be a theme for certain types
of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cutthroat industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's cutthroat out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's going to be cutthroat,
you might as well work with people who
[SPEAKER_00]: share your values so they don't cut
through your throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's been a bit challenging to be a
farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, just to quote an Anthony B
song, everyone wants to raid the barn and
[SPEAKER_01]: no one wants to grow the corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just what it feels like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're sticking to your guns and
nothing's going to deter you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been doing this a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're generational, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You come from a family of growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your mother grew?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my brother is also a permanent
licensed farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has our original family farm out on the
Mattole.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you told me earlier, you have it all
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have all the pieces that you need
to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are those pieces?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it does take, I mean, to be to be
not just premium, but to be ultra premium.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only like four things that you
really need.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a good backstory, which I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to show pioneering and early
leadership, which I am doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also need quality and consistency,
which I spent the past few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've been growing my whole life,
but I really had to work on this quality
[SPEAKER_01]: and consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to very quickly, sophisticated my
growing and my drying and curing and take
[SPEAKER_01]: all these years of knowledge that I have
and apply it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got to have quality and
consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other, and then the other part that
you need is you need premium packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the tricky part about packaging is
getting packaging that equally matches
[SPEAKER_01]: your story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did this myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I worked, I worked with people,
a number of people to help me bring this
[SPEAKER_01]: to reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was my, my vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have, yeah, so I'm just very
grateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was a big part.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was very, probably one of the more
difficult parts is, is to get that story
[SPEAKER_01]: and put it into a package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your story isn't just you,
but it also involves your community,
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank you for asking that
because when it does make a difference,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked to other multi-generational
growers from other parts of the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not the same as when you grow up
in a community of growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I grew up in the sharing of
information and the community that we
[SPEAKER_01]: created around our outlaw culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our growing was very formative for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're not just a member of the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're an activist member of the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a radio show on K-MUD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're really in touch with the people
in your community, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, somewhat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, yeah, I mean, I try to be,
yeah, I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to the extent that you are,
I can't let you go without you talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about what's the state of Southern
Humboldt right now of your brothers and
[SPEAKER_00]: sister cultivating others in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you speak to that a little bit about,
you know, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's an exciting time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been just just with perseverance
and our community values of just doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very exciting to see to see us
get through this and to see where this is
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also been a struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been abatements going out to
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also been, you know,
I'm there's parts of the county government
[SPEAKER_01]: that have been very good to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also still just a little bit
of discrimination left over from just all
[SPEAKER_01]: of these years of us being growers and
other people work in their office jobs and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe them being envious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're jealous, but like whatever it is,
we still there's still a tiny bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: discrimination among for us,
multigenerational growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that will change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt County is working on an equity
program and we're opening up this
[SPEAKER_01]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope to see some good changes around
that and some healing in our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also we were we just have such a great
rebellious spirit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really looking forward to seeing
us all just we're going to push back at
[SPEAKER_01]: these market forces and we're just going
to be ourselves and true to ourselves and
[SPEAKER_01]: true to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really, really incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Appalachian still alive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that still a plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that still something that is important
to the region?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marketing by region is is one of the best
ways to do marketing because it creates
[SPEAKER_01]: this informal collective and it challenges
all of us to compete in a healthy way of
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting to grow the best, because anyone
who's growing something terrible,
[SPEAKER_01]: it hurts all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this collect as a collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to all be growing the best and the
highest quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the one thing that we have in
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our strongest marketing aspects is
that we have consistency from a region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just very.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely it's one of our biggest
marketing strengths, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I asked kind Bill this and
I'm going to ask you, is there is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, will it be that like like the twenty
twenty two harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great year that it's like like
a like a wine harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, yeah, there are some
things about the way that growers like
[SPEAKER_01]: myself who just grow in the full sun
without greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am going to protect some of my more
delicate flowers with a with a row crop
[SPEAKER_01]: cover, because these rains coming in the
fall are coming down so hard that they can
[SPEAKER_01]: just beat down your bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that you will see
different vintages if you want to call
[SPEAKER_01]: them that, where if we have some hard
rains, those outdoor growers, their buds
[SPEAKER_01]: might not be looking as good and that ripe
resin can get kicked off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's a concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things, too, is we've been
having these cool nights and the sugars
[SPEAKER_01]: that develop from cool nights are just
some of the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there will be vintages for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel that the that the hash will
capture quite a bit of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it is it will it like like with wine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it be able to be used marketing wise
in the market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, there will possibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But especially with the hash, which can be
library and aged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that actually, I mean, and Frenchy
always talked about this, about how the
[SPEAKER_00]: temple balls really get better with age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best one he ever had was 15 years
old.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is some amazing medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one could see like with with cognacs
and with things where you have a 25 year
[SPEAKER_00]: old, you know, temple ball that goes for
an extraordinary amount of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if I wasn't such a poor farmer,
I'd be a librarian and all that hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is just what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to you just got to sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, it really kind of bodes well
for a glorious future if it can unfold the
[SPEAKER_00]: way it should unfold, you know,
with the right products being appreciated
[SPEAKER_00]: by the right people at the right price
point in the marketplace, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, that's that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also this this commercialization
of of this industry is one of the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that I feel very hopeful about is is the
home grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: The home grower is going to keep this
culture of giving and sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really important that everyone
grows their six plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because that's it's I mean,
going back to to education, I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: special connection or I have a connection
with with this herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't express enough how much how
much growth I have gone through growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: growing this medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I would hope that everyone out
there can also experience that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a wonderful talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the more we get into it,
you know, the more we can talk because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's all about the details of
getting into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the essence of craft,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how you do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the process, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and that's what makes that's I mean,
my my sense of what makes craftspeople
[SPEAKER_00]: special and what they care about is is
every step of what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just having curiosity and always
being changing and always having something
[SPEAKER_01]: going on, just always exploring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, there's such a strong
craft history in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can only hope that it thrives and
survives.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I absolutely do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're done.
Thank you.
