[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Don Newman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm currently the Director of Cultivations
for Highlight Farms in Chesning,
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Previously resided in Denver, Colorado
where I was the head grower for the herbal
[SPEAKER_01]: care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was brought here to help get the grow
going and online and also just help with
[SPEAKER_01]: expansion and moving forward with the
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you kind of talk about the
execution of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how big is the grow operation?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the build out process like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get to put input into like what
lights we use, what grow media we use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, as the Director of Cultivation
those are things that you all have to
[SPEAKER_01]: design.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we do is like a yearly schedule
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything is very detailed and
specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing is just kind of on a whim,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to big investments and
big companies, all this stuff needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: planned out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very important to plan it out and
have a good team in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as the build out goes,
it was an old auction facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had like old tractors and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was an old building that we kind of
revamped, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: 80,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And inside that building we have a
production facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an extraction facility,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have two companies as well that are
associated with Highlight Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a 10,000 square foot
indoor grow right now that currently has
[SPEAKER_01]: four Class C 1500 plant licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's 6,000 plants total.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just finished a 17,000 square foot
greenhouse that'll house 7,500 plants as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have plans for expansion to another
7,500 indoor plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for that facility alone, when we're
said and done, we're looking at 22,000
[SPEAKER_01]: plants we'll be maintaining there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do is when we design those
facilities, we look at how we operate,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a very kind of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're more of a sea of green, kind of
maximize our canopy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use more plants for light and we do
a shorter veg time, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But for our method, that's how we've
always been successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's worked for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grow biosynthetically, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a good mix of organic and
synthetic, all biological IPMs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once we go to flower, we don't spray
and we use, you know, predatory bugs to
[SPEAKER_01]: help combat any kind of issues that,
you know, we are always prevented,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're always, excuse me, what's the word
I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're proactive, not reactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a big part of growing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And another big part that I think people
don't understand is getting a team of
[SPEAKER_01]: passionate people, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because anybody can grow cannabis,
but in order to get the true quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: that homegrown quality that people love
and know, you really have to put your
[SPEAKER_01]: heart and soul into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to find passionate people and
that takes some time to do as well on a
[SPEAKER_01]: large scale, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been thankful that we've been
able to find a very good team of
[SPEAKER_01]: dedicated, passionate employees and we've
been very successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you bring a bunch of people from
Denver with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, we did not bring a bunch of people
from Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've just been hiring locally,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have on the cultivation side,
it's seven people just for the,
[SPEAKER_01]: to manage the indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, a manager and then a team lead
and then five employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have, I want to say a harvest
manager, two leads and about 10 trimmers,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they kind of help with the harvest and
the tear down of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many turns are you doing the indoor
and the greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_01]: We run a nine week cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we run anywhere from 63 to 68 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'll do 21 harvests a year and
then between that and the greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll total 42, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'll each be getting 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and what we've been seeing,
we have 48 light rooms and we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: averaging around three and a half pounds
of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're pulling usually anywhere from 150
to 170, 170 pounds of room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been very successful with the way
we've been set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what kind of lights are you using?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using right now, phantom double
ended to flower under, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we do, uh, LEC light emitting
ceramic, 315 Watts for veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're also trialing a lot of led
products as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we have some Gavita, some thrive
agri-tech, um, through this, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: little convention here, we got hooked up
with spider.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to be sampling some of
theirs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a lot of great success with
their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think there's a lot of
opportunities out there and that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful thing about this industry is it
keeps evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's always something more to
learn, something new that you can gain
[SPEAKER_01]: from this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about, what you've noticed
with, cause you have a, you've worked with
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of different types of lights,
like specifically ceramic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what do you like about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's what I like about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's place and what's its role.
[SPEAKER_01]: If my plants are happy, I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I like is I like that the color
rendering index is 95, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of a hundred, that's the closest
that they can mimic to indoor sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very high rating on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants seem to respond very well to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very natural light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get great resin production from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and the plants seem to stack
very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bush out very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, same with LEDs, LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally think you get a little better
internotal spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you know, just through all these
different kinds of mediums and being able
[SPEAKER_01]: to play, like I'm not somebody who's
smarter than anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just am willing to try different things
and I'm not afraid to look stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as lighting is concerned,
you know, there was a lot in the beginning
[SPEAKER_01]: with LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of those, uh, Spider-Man
lights, if you will, the blue,
[SPEAKER_01]: the red spectrum, they're kind of very
harsh on the eyes and they were very like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, cheap, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of like turned people off to
the idea that LED could be competing in
[SPEAKER_01]: this market, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or be efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you know, since the last couple of
years, they've kind of, you really seen
[SPEAKER_01]: the progression of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other beautiful thing too,
is energy companies will work with you
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're able to give back to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not take such a demand on the grid
that they'll pay for half the costs,
[SPEAKER_01]: nine times out of 10 on upgrading these
lights, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a huge savings right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to mention your electric bills and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you know, just the evolution of
the resin production, the terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles, and just really trying to get
the full potential of the plant to be
[SPEAKER_01]: brought out indoors, just like it is
outdoors, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And trying to mimic that sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we'll ever fully get there,
but, um, you know, we still got a ways to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as, um, you know, the future
and what really excites me is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is greenhouse production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's kind of the way of,
uh, to be efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as like, you know, once we get
bigger and bigger and bigger, right,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all going to be about efficiency and
who can provide the best product at the
[SPEAKER_01]: cheapest cost, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: At the cheapest cost per pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think always- What is your cost per
pound in the indoor right now and in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we have not had a harvest in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our first in, uh, outdoor, uh,
our first greenhouse harvest will be
[SPEAKER_01]: August 6th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're actually going to be
transplanting our first production around
[SPEAKER_01]: July 1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we're quite excited for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our indoor cost per pound is,
uh, it's a little proprietary,
[SPEAKER_01]: honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's something that just due to,
you know, market demand pricing,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just things that I guess like,
uh, you know, it's something that we
[SPEAKER_01]: always work towards getting cheaper,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that no matter what,
when you care about creating a good
[SPEAKER_01]: quality product, you're not necessarily
worried about the cost, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's always important to be efficient,
but at the same time, it's important to
[SPEAKER_01]: create a good quality product because at
the end of the day, good cannabis is
[SPEAKER_01]: always going to sell itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a market that it's a kind of sewer
market, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are your returning customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, you know, the larger companies who
shoot for kind of that middleman
[SPEAKER_01]: mentality, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The, Hey, let's just try to pump out
biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a market for that, but those
people are going to come and go,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those connoisseur customers who loyally
return to the dispensaries, they want a
[SPEAKER_01]: product that they can rely on,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are who we try to appeal to is,
is the growers who want to go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm a grower myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I didn't want to smoke my own
product, then I wouldn't be able to sit
[SPEAKER_01]: down and talk to you eye to eye or man to
man, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I believe in what I do and I
believe in what I produce, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So your market is kind of that connoisseur
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what cultivars are you cultivating and
are you like chasing hype strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you like, this is what I love to smoke
and I'm going to grow that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and honestly, it's, it's a combination
of everything, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one thing that I'm thankful,
you know, at Highlife Farms, we're always
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We usually pop about a hundred seeds a
month, if not more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're always hunting new genetics and
we're always pushing the limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and we reach out to, we have a good
relationship with a lot of breeders,
[SPEAKER_01]: like relentless genetics, raw genetics,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are guys we test for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're able to, to get our hands on
genetics before other people do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to create the hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to chase the hype,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And now while there is quality out there,
we want strains that last the test of
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you a great example,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple punch is a phenomenal strain,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know and love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it's the most potent strain
of all time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're growing it as the most
insane smells of all time, you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh my God, this is the Mecca of weed,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, once you smoke it, you find that it's
those long stock trichomes that give it
[SPEAKER_01]: that crazy coated appearance, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But the, all the oil and the potency is up
in the, in the head of the trichome,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not that it's more potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It usually tests anywhere from 19 to 25%,
at least in my experience growing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's one of those very deceiving
pictures and in this Instagram kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: generation that we're in, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's about visuals and not so much
about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, a lot of that old school bud,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like ChemDOG, Lemon G, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are strains from back in the day,
Northern Lights, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They are not the most visually appealing,
but when you smell them, your mouth
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely salivates because they're
overloaded with terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of like a lost thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we try to have a lot of classics like
Triangle Kush, OG Kush, ChemDOG,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the actual ChemDOG, GDP, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also, again, we'll go for newer
stuff like Dosey Dose, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is a classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do grow Purple Punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like Purple Punch is great beginner
weed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We also grow the classic Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a nice Santa Cruz cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know that's one that everybody
likes to hate on, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's also the number one selling strain in
the industry just because people coming
[SPEAKER_01]: into it, that's what they hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, I guess, what they're going to
gravitate towards, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to play the market as well,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so while we're able to have fun,
we still want to appeal to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't just want to, we grow a lot of
heavy indicas because that's what we like
[SPEAKER_01]: to smoke, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Rockafield, Junior Mints,
a lot of Archive gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so Pucker OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of view you and a lot of other
cultivators as the equivalent of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: very accomplished musician who's told to
go play a bar mitzvah and like play some
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, top 40 music.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, but I could play amazing
jazz music.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, yeah, they don't want
jazz.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want high THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want the popular strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want the Instagram strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to balance kind of what the
market wants and what you truly love to be
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish you all appreciated this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while, and that's another problem I
have, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is people want to blame this industry or
blame the market, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we take responsibility?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my responsibility to educate
people, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: As a grower, as someone in this industry
to educate them on, hey, it's not just
[SPEAKER_01]: about looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about effect, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All that matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't get to corner those people in
the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're relying on the budtender.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but again, this is where technology is
a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can reach out to me through
Instagram, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm able to educate that way or,
and I, and I try to stay very open to
[SPEAKER_01]: people and always very educational because
I'm never here to hide anything I do
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm always evolving, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I teach you something this year,
next year, it's going to be different
[SPEAKER_01]: because I figured out a new technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured out a new strain, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not scared to share kind of
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain things like business wise,
you're not really able to say that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: one thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a business aspect, but as far as a
growth, you can come tour our facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll show you what we got going on,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're very open and honest about it
because we have nothing to hide and we
[SPEAKER_01]: believe in what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk about, you said you're Fino
hunting right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you, what are you popping and
what are you exploring?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's making your eyes light up?
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got done running a lot of the
archive gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just dropped a lot of new moon bow
crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what moon bow is, is it's a do-si-do-si
this time Skittles male that he took,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he crossed it to a lot of his classic
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like Hollywood pure Kush, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's called a flavor pack,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we just ran through, we normally
pop around 50 seeds of each strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: just that they say around a 5% margin and
you can find the specific Fino,
[SPEAKER_01]: the breeder wants you to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they say about 50 seeds is a minimum
you can pop for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least that's kind of some people's
schools of thought, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the theory we fall
under.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we usually go for about four packs per
strain is what we pop, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of there, we'll usually end up a 50
50 is on average of what you'll find
[SPEAKER_01]: between male female, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking at around 25 females.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a good selection, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And just really, really unique terpene
profiles that are kind of pushing the
[SPEAKER_01]: boundaries of something different,
you know, like just like rosy,
[SPEAKER_01]: gassy kind of just almost the full
spectrum, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's very interesting in a pallet,
if you will, like it, it paints like a
[SPEAKER_01]: rainbow of your senses when you smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very unique and interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, another one we're about to
finish up and take down from him is a
[SPEAKER_01]: rainbow driver.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's Sunday driver from Canorado
genetics times Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get a lot of, again, like rainbow
fruits, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's melon, it's oranges, it's limes,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's not just one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's a whole kind of wave of flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just very it's different on the
senses, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're used to smelling like, OK,
this strain smells like lemons.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when you get like a it's kind of
like it brushes by you almost like you're
[SPEAKER_01]: like driving by it like a like a fruit
stand, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and you just get all the flavors
at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Relentless just sent us a lot of his new
rosé crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're popping some gelato stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we brought back a classic head
banger from Karma Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We popped right and that's biker Kush and
sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's one thing that has kind
of been lost is like a really good sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like Karma is doing a very good
job of bringing that back in seed form.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I grew AJ's cut a sour diesel
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you take it any shorter than 11,
12 weeks, I mean, the terpene profile is
[SPEAKER_01]: not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a lot of these commercial gardens,
that's just not feasible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so we're lucky to run on a nine
week schedule, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the majority of everything we
grow finishes in that time and fades out
[SPEAKER_01]: nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those kind of longer running phenos
seem to take a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's managed to shorten that flowering
time, but still get those great sours and
[SPEAKER_01]: cush is brought out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so those are some of the
genetics we're really looking forward to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then, you know, classics
like Dosey Dose is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canorado Pucker, which is Lemon G Times
Triangle Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like very bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bright lemons and then like a dark diesel
that finishes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost acidic, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very devastating, but great for daytime
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some tweaks you've kind of done
to your methodology over, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: the past five years that you've noticed
allow kind of the plant to express itself
[SPEAKER_00]: from a terpene perspective to its fullest?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing is every time you,
you know, every time I grow these strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: I learn something new, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's always very humbling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the term master growers always
very hard for me to comprehend because I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't believe we'll ever master it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we learn is, is the one thing I
notice is when you bring in new genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: not necessarily popping seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you bring in new genetics from
someone else, there's a rule of three,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have to cycle through that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to flower it three different times
for it to acclimate to me, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me to see its potential,
like just like when you get a new house,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have your routine set up,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It usually takes you about six months
before you kind of in your brew,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, same with these genetics,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are living, breathing things like,
so they operate the same way and they can
[SPEAKER_01]: get stressed and they have to learn your
feed schedule, your style of growing and
[SPEAKER_01]: acclimate to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I believe it's about a rule
of three for that to dial in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, like a great example,
right, is we're starting to experiment
[SPEAKER_01]: with different pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we always ran Royal Gold with three
gallon pots, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're like, okay, why don't we
try two gallon pots and then we can get
[SPEAKER_01]: away with less water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found we got bigger plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, this is mind blowing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're like, why don't we try one
gallon pot?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we tried the charcoals, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And no transplanting and saving a crazy
amount of time, you know, in labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So huge cost savings right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found we're getting just as big a
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we see though in these different
mediums is we see different phenotypic
[SPEAKER_01]: expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorilla glue, for example, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'll get a great mix of sourdough and
chem sis and chocolate diesel when I grow
[SPEAKER_01]: it in the Royal Gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm noticing now in my first trial of
flora flex pots with cocoa, I'm getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot more of the chem sis kind of
phenotypic expressions, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so it's just very unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: It almost looks like a different cut of
gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So but it's the exact same cut and it's
just very interesting how in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms, but just changing the home for the
roots, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Changes the plant, you know, so just these
little tweaks, I'm noticing all this stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: adds up, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think Adam Dunn put it
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looks at growing as kind of like a
report card, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you start everybody starts in school
with an A and then you miss one homework
[SPEAKER_01]: assignment, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You miss one water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now you're in an A minus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You
[SPEAKER_01]: know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these little stresses start to add
up and then you lose the true genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: potential of these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the less we stress them, and the
better we get them, we get them from clone
[SPEAKER_01]: to harvest, we see the true potential,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all that stress, while we may not
think, oh, it came back, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple days later, that couple days was
huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're losing a lot when you're trying
to time these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like to intentionally stress your
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's good stress and there's
bad stress, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like pruning is an example of good
stress or topping is an example of good
[SPEAKER_01]: stress, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But like letting your plants wilt till
they almost die or light stressing your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants or wind stressing your plants,
I don't think necessarily is the best
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think like, you know,
manipulations like pinching, pruning,
[SPEAKER_01]: low stress training, things like that,
right, are beneficial and low wind stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, there's beneficial stress and
then there's unbeneficial stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's knowing the difference between the
two and when to apply them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think part of the reason why I'm
asking is because like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the outdoors, you're, as a plant,
you're experiencing all sorts of stresses
[SPEAKER_00]: and pressures and terpenes are kind of how
the cannabis plant protects itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it can sense what's coming and it
will exude terpenes to deal with whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: the issue is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're looking for terpene
expression, it's almost, you want that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to endure different stresses and not
kind of just be like a host plant where
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's perfect and it never has to
suffer in any way.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's just going back to those
good stress versus the bad stress,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And knowing when to implement it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think if you're trying to snap
a bunch of tops at week six, that's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably not the right kind of stress you
want to apply to plants or things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess like, what are your theories that
sense on this subject, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's why I kind of love outdoor
cultivation because I feel like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, even though you can play God in
a totally controlled environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that really allowing the plant to be
kind of like, you never think a coddled
[SPEAKER_00]: kid is going to turn out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best people, you know, have had a
fucked up life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are your favorite people because
they've been tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have character.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as an example, like your greenhouse is
probably a little less controlled than
[SPEAKER_00]: you're totally indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're in the middle of growing in the
greenhouse, but you could probably take
[SPEAKER_00]: the example to some stuff you've done in
the past, like same strains in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse versus indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you noticing differences?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're like, these are the same
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing them right next door to each
other, but I'm noticing a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice, you know, they'll reverse
back to seed vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take a dotted plant from indoor
and put it out into the sun and
[SPEAKER_01]: reinvigorate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, why can we do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That says something right there that,
yes, like you were saying, indoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: you are not getting the true potential of
these genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something about the power of the
sun that we're not able to mimic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, I don't know if it's all the UVs
or exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not very educated as far as that goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I couldn't explain that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do see that these plants do perform
differently and they perform better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is their home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's got me excited about
greenhouse production is because I'm able
[SPEAKER_01]: to dial in the environment, but harness
the power of the sun so that we can get
[SPEAKER_01]: the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one I truly believe we'll be
able to see the full potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, from a variety of standpoints,
I'm not a big fan of indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think from starting with like
the environment, like in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have all these desert roads.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have all these, it's 110 degrees
outside and you're building an indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: facility with a ton of, you know,
HPS lights.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meanwhile, like LA County is a good
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: LA County is 40% ag land and grows
amazingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing fruits and vegetables,
yet the ordinance is that you can't grow
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors in LA County.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to grow indoor in a very small
commercial area in the entire county.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the policy is pushing towards
indoor, but I think long, like long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: when you can sell cross border,
and I'm not just saying from Michigan to
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois, but like from anywhere to
anywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to see as many indoor
growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, it goes back to that,
chasing that cost per pound and getting
[SPEAKER_01]: that down always, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And being as efficient as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you can harness the energy of the
sun without having to pay these enormous
[SPEAKER_01]: electric bills, how could you compete
against that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's just, you know,
it's just an ignorance on a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people's parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of misunderstanding as far as
what this plant can provide for us and for
[SPEAKER_01]: the economy as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the more people get educated
and the more they understand, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: those laws that people will be more
open-minded to, okay, we can have
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a big deal if a school bus drives
by a cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's not the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some lessons you've learned along
the way about like combating pests and
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like as you scale indoor, right,
like powdery mildew mold, you get thrips,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what have been lessons you've learned
over years of doing this that have allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: you to reduce, you know, this is your
proactive versus reactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: To kind of reduce the possibility of mold,
powdery mildew mites?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it comes down to a good IPM,
you know, and have a good understanding of
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I taper my environment like
people will taper a feed schedule as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every week it's going to vary a little
bit, you know, till the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having an understanding of that,
having an understanding of your grow style
[SPEAKER_01]: and how to properly prune your plants so
you don't get microclimates, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are huge factors, especially in a
large scale facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having the proper sprayers to know that
when your guys are spraying, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually covering every inch of the leaf
surface because once you leave one spot
[SPEAKER_01]: open, that's how pests build, you know,
what's the word I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Resistance, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just having a good understanding and
the proper setup, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people want to try to do it
cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot grow cannabis cheaply,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's profitable, but to grow good cannabis
is not cheap, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So while it is profitable, it does take a
large upfront cost, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You need heavy amounts of air
conditioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need HVAC as far as, excuse me,
humidification and dehumidification,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You need wind movement, rolling tables,
irrigation, things like this, and how
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And understanding all that plays a big
part in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were implying before that you do
foliar spraying, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you putting into the spray?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do a biological spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anything, it'll be like a serinate
product, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, again, because we use
biologicals to combat any kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: pest pressure, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's how we're able to stay
without spider mites, without hemp russet
[SPEAKER_01]: mites, without thrips, without root
aphids, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our plants are able to stay happy and
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how frequently are you spraying?
[SPEAKER_01]: In veg, we'll spray every three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll spray with a biological or we'll
spray a beneficial, like a nutrient spray,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we'll mix seaweed and silica,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just to kind of help strengthen
up cell walls of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, if some reason my pests don't
catch it, the silica is so thick on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that the bugs can't even bite into
it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and just kind of understanding
that balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, also understanding how to prune
properly, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and making sure like you remove as
many families as possible to not have
[SPEAKER_01]: those microclimates, but without
overstressing your plants, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So just having that balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, having a good sprayer and
having a good IPM schedule and
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding how to rotate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you use like an atomizer, kind of like
find this sprayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a dram or like?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like a car paint sprayer,
you know, and it's like a handgun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a big reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the beautiful backpack.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you imagine trying to walk
down an aisle with a backpack with trellis
[SPEAKER_01]: up and then turn around, you're going to
get caught up in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can't ask my guys to be a shim
in that kind of environment, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's also creating success for your
people to implement what you ask them to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, are you making do you do
compost to use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use a lot of beneficials, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll do like OG bio warm mix with
earthworm castings and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a little bit of kelp and
molasses, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll brew those up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll use like the Apeleo bio,
the Tribus or recharge, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are great products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so once we move over to flower,
though, we stop spraying, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's where we kind of differentiate
ourselves as far as commercial growers as
[SPEAKER_01]: we try not to to spray the plants just to
allow them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I feel like, you know,
trichomes are so sensitive and any kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: damage you apply to them, it has a long
term effect, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've seen great product that's
been sprayed, but, you know, the less you
[SPEAKER_01]: can spray it, the better it is,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like the less you stress,
the better it comes out, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, that's what we always aim for is
trying for the highest quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once we move over to flower our
environments, you know, we just believe in
[SPEAKER_01]: our environmental control and then we let
the beneficial bugs take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever personally made like bubble
hash out of your flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an extraction department that
does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you personally?
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of like home flower, but never like
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What home flower have you grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that lends itself to making
the best hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: For home use?
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of yield or flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you looking for when you make
your own hash for personal use?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you looking for in the trichomes
and which one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think like, you know, there's
different textures of oils, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like an OG Kush is going to give you a
very like sappy, oily kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a KEMD is going to be a little
bit grittier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a strawberry guava like has a
more sandy trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to get like a drier kind
of a sift, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and, and so it just really
depends on what kind of mood I'm in
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's always changing, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, one cycle I'll, I'll grow
some OGs, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be very into that wet oil,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next round I'm like,
I'm a little bit of fruit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll switch it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I usually find you get this,
this kind of sandier, not always,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, the sandier kind of trichome
heads from that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now it's, it's very much into
the like, just like that wet live resin,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and just like with the,
the turps and everything, it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very beautiful, almost like that
applesauce texture, you know, and you got
[SPEAKER_01]: to like stir it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in your old market of Colorado,
who's who do you just respect as a
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator or an extractor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, there's in Colorado, quite a few
people, the herbal cure always,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they gave me my first
opportunity and they gave me a place to
[SPEAKER_01]: call home, you know, so I'm always
thankful for them because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: without that opportunity, I wouldn't be
able to be here today talking to you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and I wouldn't have met,
you know, my good friend, Ben,
[SPEAKER_01]: who gave me the opportunity to come here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, first and foremost,
them, I believe seven to ten labs as far
[SPEAKER_01]: as commercial hash is pushing boundaries,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Dot Labs is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is seven ten labs doing that you
think is boundary pushing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what are you noticing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, man, they run like no till
beds in their flower, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really just about cultivating the
best oils and they don't even go for at
[SPEAKER_01]: least the way I heard it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to be misspoken because I
have a lot of respect for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I heard they kind of have some kind of
system where they go for like oil per
[SPEAKER_01]: light, not necessarily like pounds per
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just kind of they're changing the
game and that kind of mindset and the way
[SPEAKER_01]: people think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always appreciate that because
that's breaking the mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're always trying to educate and
push boundaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when I look at people like
that, it makes me feel like I suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's the best feeling because
then I get fired up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm motivated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, Green Dots, another
great example, he always has new genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always breeding something new and his
hash is phenomenal, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's pushing a lot of boundaries,
you know, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are these guys is seven ten and are
they growing indoor, outdoor greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I believe seven ten is doing
indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also are in California as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if they're doing any outdoor
and I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Green Dot has indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if they're doing any outdoor
for them, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do know like they also, I believe,
like if you're products good enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll like process for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure they they might process for
some outdoor people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are my favorite kind of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like I think you should be
judgmental when it comes to your weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be concerned about what you put
in your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you don't have something to filter
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting directly into your
bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you should be a little more mindful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like and it's helped me be mindful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like my health in general.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then it's like, OK, well,
now I need to eat better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, for the longest time,
I was more concerned about making sure my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants got all the nutrition while I was
like eating Cheetos, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, now it's like it's helped educate
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like this back and forth
relationship of like, how can I get the
[SPEAKER_01]: best out of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then through that, it gets the best
out of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know.
You know.
You know.
You know.
