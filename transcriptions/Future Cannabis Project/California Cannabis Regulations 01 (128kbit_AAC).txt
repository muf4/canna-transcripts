[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about the end of the
world and the birth of a new world.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Julie Crockett.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the director of compliance for MMLG.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a board member of the California
Cannabis Industry Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about compliance a lot and talk
about it a lot with my fellow panelists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, you go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Brett Hartman Payon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the compliance leader for the company
Dosist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also am the owner of a company called My
Cannabis Trainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do consulting work for dispensaries,
brands, distributors on helping to
[SPEAKER_01]: navigate through regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend and co-chair of the newly
created events committee at CCIA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pamela.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everybody, and welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Pamela Epstein.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the owner and founder of GreenWise
Company, which is a consulting company and
[SPEAKER_02]: a law firm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We help all of these wonderful operators
try to navigate the heavily complex,
[SPEAKER_02]: ever-changing, open to quite
interpretation by the regulatory agencies
[SPEAKER_02]: of the new permanent regulations that we
have that seem to be not so permanent as
[SPEAKER_02]: just today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know what I love?
[SPEAKER_02]: A nice little, as we like to call it,
profanity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cover your ears if you're not old enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you, Friday is something that is
perpetually happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I'm sure we will talk about,
last Friday, we got an interpretation of
[SPEAKER_02]: where that universal symbol is going to
have to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this Friday, we were alerted to the
fact that there is a lawsuit that is
[SPEAKER_02]: imminently coming for statewide delivery.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nothing is settled.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll go through it all the best that
we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I invite you to sit down, buckle up,
and be excited to learn a little bit about
[SPEAKER_02]: where we are in the regulations right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: As many of you know, then, or may know,
that in January, the state, the Office of
[SPEAKER_00]: Administrative Law, adopted the permanent
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put permanent in air quotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as Pamela was alluding to,
they're just starting to change already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those regulations unveiled a new
reality that many of us saw coming,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was pretty similar to the last draft
submitted before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were some major implications for
businesses and operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess first, if you guys want to talk
about a couple off the top of your head of
[SPEAKER_00]: what you felt were the biggest
implications or impacts of the adopted
[SPEAKER_00]: permanent regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I personally feel like,
I mean, we knew what was going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: coming down the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could read them and strategize on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm used to just, as soon as the
regulations come out, it's always a fuck
[SPEAKER_01]: you, Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking about that, I am not speaking on
behalf of doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm speaking on behalf of Breton Hartman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just wanted to go ahead and put
that out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was getting used to seeing a lot of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like seeing goals and marketing
goals and personal dreams just kind of go
[SPEAKER_01]: down the crapper real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where it was like, OK, you're not
going to be able to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And did you be able to explain to clients
that why you can't get free product,
[SPEAKER_01]: and why you can't get free swag,
and why you can't just label anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just think that the BCC is going to
pass it for branded merchandise when I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't even think they're even getting back
to people right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, it was just telling everybody,
you need to focus on your core values as a
[SPEAKER_01]: company, your team, and weather this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because things are going to get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to go through some pretty
dark times right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the regulations have put the
squash on a lot of flexibility for
[SPEAKER_01]: everything from marketing to production to
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And seeing conflicting information through
them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I went through and completely
reformatted the regulations and added a
[SPEAKER_01]: table of contents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Bible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think for me, it was really difficult
to see the amount of effort us in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry are putting into a regulated
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way that the regulations were
submitted to us, the way that we could
[SPEAKER_01]: read them, made them near impossible to
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was difficult to understand if you
don't have a strong English grammar
[SPEAKER_01]: background.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a technical writing background
to where I had to go through there and
[SPEAKER_01]: make them to where they were usable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because none of this made sense to me
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, I've been able to read
through how many generations of regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was able to go through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I see conflicting information all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the most important things
to remember is as clunky as these
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations are, as difficult as they are,
I remind my clients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time I send out an email and I
say, this is why we have to do something,
[SPEAKER_02]: I repurposefully put that regulation in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it should be a dialogue that
you're having.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you hire somebody as amazing as Julie
or Brett or myself and my team,
[SPEAKER_02]: Samantha is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to be able to have a conversation
with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all reading them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to frame your lens about what you
want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: As Brett said, what is your core culture
that you want to have?
[SPEAKER_02]: And to have a culture of compliance,
you need to own that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I say it almost ad nauseum to
my clients.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that you employ from your
employee and even the janitor that may,
[SPEAKER_02]: because the city says has to clean up
twice a day, their act, omission,
[SPEAKER_02]: or failure is your act, omission,
or failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can see it when we saw the issue with
Sequoia Labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That lab technician had an issue,
but that could cost Sequoia Labs,
[SPEAKER_02]: ultimately, their license.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to be familiar with these
regulations as daunting as they are,
[SPEAKER_02]: as difficult as they are to wade through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Read them and then have that conversation
with your internal team, have that
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation with your external team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's been the most difficult
lift when these regulations went active
[SPEAKER_02]: and permitted.
[SPEAKER_02]: People didn't really understand what that
meant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew that we had been dealing with
emergency regulations and changes,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we had, as we affectionately call,
regulatory whiplash, where on July 1,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was fire sale, and you had to get
rid of and make sure you had CRP on the
[SPEAKER_02]: package, and now we're back to CRP in the
exit bags or CRP at the product level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what does that mean for your company?
[SPEAKER_02]: Understand that if you have a deadline on
January 1 of 2020 and all of the product
[SPEAKER_02]: must be at CRP at the level of 2020,
that doesn't mean in December you can
[SPEAKER_02]: change your packaging regime.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't mean that the retailer will
sell out of your product by then.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will have to be destroyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you think about that, you've got
to think about timelines and backdating
[SPEAKER_02]: what these dates and these regulations
actually mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the flip side of that,
understanding that once we have final
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations and the regulators are no
longer going back to these regulations
[SPEAKER_02]: whole hog trying to get us to a point
where we have permanent regulations,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to start looking to enforce
upon the regulations, and that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: different ball game.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means when the regulators come out,
they're no longer fact-finding
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've collected that data point.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know what you're doing at these
facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: You invited them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had great conversations with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought they were great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were making friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're coming now for enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure we'll get there and we'll
talk about the enforcement guidelines,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are not part of the regulations that
I don't think most people have read.
[SPEAKER_02]: One missing manifest can have no less than
I think six other violations that are
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with it that affect not only
your license, but the licensee that was
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in that transaction, which could
be more than one licensee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have fines that are based off of
how much revenue you make divided by 50%
[SPEAKER_02]: times the amount of days that you've been
in business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, they could shut you down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're looking at fines that could be
in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're looking at fines that could be in
the hundreds of thousands of dollars for
[SPEAKER_02]: one manifest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So invest in training and a culture of
compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just talking to my friend Rick
before this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulations he was saying is it's sort
of like having car insurance where car
[SPEAKER_00]: insurance sucks and you spend all this
money on car insurance and most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time you're like, why am I spending all
this money on car insurance?
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when something goes wrong,
you're super happy you have car insurance
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're super happy you have a low
deductible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what that culture of
compliance does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I frequently call a record keeping audit
by the agencies when penalties and fines
[SPEAKER_00]: are in effect is the new smash and grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could shut down any company right now
with hundreds of thousands of dollars,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not millions of dollars in penalties
and fines just for asking for their
[SPEAKER_00]: records.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the business and professions
code, a single failure to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide a record can carry a penalty of
$30,000 per instance, per piece of paper
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're unable to immediately produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not just you, but your staff who's
working at the moment that they happen to
[SPEAKER_00]: come in and ask for that piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are not adequately trained to do
what they need to do to immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: provide the thing that was requested,
you can be looking at incurring some
[SPEAKER_00]: serious fines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't seen the full muscle of
penalties and fines being exerted,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we also have a situation where the
regulatory agencies have up to five years
[SPEAKER_00]: to levy those penalties and fines for
things you did in year one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can go back years later and go,
hey, let's do a full audit of what you
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing between 2007, 18 to 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many companies are not gonna be in a
position to be able to stand up to that
[SPEAKER_00]: audit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's very difficult, I mean,
in our position it's very difficult at
[SPEAKER_00]: this moment to really cry the credo of the
importance of compliance when most people
[SPEAKER_00]: are like, eh, Track and Trace isn't
active, nobody knows, there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement, nobody's checking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from our incredibly cautionary side of
it, it's like, these people are not your
[SPEAKER_00]: friends, they're not super stoked about
this, and it's a huge funnel of money for
[SPEAKER_00]: the bureaucratic government.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you think they're not gonna come
around and collect fines when they can?
[SPEAKER_00]: When the licensing craze dries up,
when it becomes more difficult for people
[SPEAKER_00]: to onboard, I think they're gonna be
coming and finding things to penalize on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's keep in mind as well that every
company that's functioning is also
[SPEAKER_00]: videotaping everything that they're doing
and keeping those videos for 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the new urban legend that I just heard
is the operation operator who the BCC
[SPEAKER_00]: comes in and caught somebody consuming,
and then they requested their tapes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they reviewed the tapes,
and then they dinged them for every time
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody was consuming on video,
and then it's $300,000 in fines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can happen, but you know,
there's also preventative measures.
[SPEAKER_02]: One big thing I wanna say, because we're
talking a lot of like, you must do this
[SPEAKER_02]: and comply.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of your biggest assets that you
control are your standard operating
[SPEAKER_02]: procedures, your SOPs.
[SPEAKER_02]: These can save you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think of them as like a salvation,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything that you do when there's an
ambiguity in the regulations, you do an
[SPEAKER_02]: SOP for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You base it off of your understanding of
the regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, if there is an enforcement
action, you can show this is what I have
[SPEAKER_02]: on file.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my SOP.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why I did it this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Agencies, let's discuss this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not how we read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not how we did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: More so to the point, when I have a point
of clarification that I wanted to make,
[SPEAKER_02]: my operator wanted to have the packaging
date and the manufacture date the same
[SPEAKER_02]: date, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, this is how we do it at
our facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: We manufacture the pens.
[SPEAKER_02]: We fill the pens on the same date,
manufacture date, package date,
[SPEAKER_02]: same date.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's nothing to say that you can't
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was nothing to say that you could do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the response that I got back from DPH
when we had drafted an email that said if
[SPEAKER_02]: our package date and our manufacture date
are the same date and we have that in our
[SPEAKER_02]: SOP and I put DOM slash P or I put the MFG
and PKG, is that enough on the label?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put it in there and they said,
hmm, I think this should be fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I take that email that says,
you're fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put it in with my SOP.
[SPEAKER_02]: I date it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sits in my record keeping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Therefore, if a retail purchasing manager
when my manufacturer distributor takes
[SPEAKER_02]: this product with them says, I don't know
if I'm allowed to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see anybody else doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You say, well, I understand that,
but I have a letter from DPH that I can
[SPEAKER_02]: show you that says that this is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing happened where we wanted to do
a foil seal on the jar of cannabis instead
[SPEAKER_02]: of doing a tamper evidence seal on the
outer package.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what is every retail purchasing
manager used to seeing?
[SPEAKER_02]: A tamper evidence seal on the side of the
bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they gonna do if they don't see a
tamper evidence seal on the side of the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottle?
[SPEAKER_02]: Reject it and send it back to be properly
labeled with a tamper evidence seal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is properly labeled with a tamper
evidence seal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we put it in our SOP or I had the
client put it in their SOP.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sent the images to DPH.
[SPEAKER_02]: DPH said you could have multi-layer tamper
evidence as long as the consumer can tell
[SPEAKER_02]: if it was tampered with before they get to
the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We package it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single time that shipment goes out
in a distribution vehicle, it is affixed
[SPEAKER_02]: with the letter and the image so that any
time it's threatened to be refused,
[SPEAKER_02]: which will and does happen, we have
evidence to support that so that
[SPEAKER_02]: transaction moves through the supply chain
smoothly.
[SPEAKER_02]: These SOPs can prevent you from hundreds
of thousands of dollars of fines,
[SPEAKER_02]: taking it all the way down to a few
hundred dollars or even, oh, you're right,
[SPEAKER_02]: that was confusing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's make a change or a clarification to
the regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a former dispensary manager and
director, especially during all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: transition, it was really difficult to
know what you were supposed to be looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for on the packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to go through and make a checklist
of these are the things you should look
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not there, don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's sometimes things fell through the
cracks as far as we rejected product that
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't in the store, so they're telling
me it's not on the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, then send it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure enough, it was somewhere on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel for these distributors right now
because they're dealing with dispensaries
[SPEAKER_01]: at all different levels of understanding
of the regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, my heart really goes out for some
of these longtime operators that are more
[SPEAKER_01]: of artisanal craft cannabis because SOPs
are not part of their SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't do this because it's part of
their art.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order for them to translate from our
former unregulated market into this new
[SPEAKER_01]: market, they have to have something that
you can replicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have something that you can
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Standard operating procedures usually
freak people out because they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I don't know how to write these.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as simple as it's just a how-to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how you want it to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just click on bullet points when you're
writing it in something and just make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just going step-by-step on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making sure that you're doing it in a time
where you can walk somebody through it
[SPEAKER_01]: that's never done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can follow the rules and it makes
sense so that you're not missing any
[SPEAKER_01]: places on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's where right now is a lot of
companies did not understand what it was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to take to weather this storm of
regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been hemorrhaging money
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have these new companies that are
starting that have learned the lessons
[SPEAKER_01]: from everybody around them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just start off right off the bat
because they're bringing in executives now
[SPEAKER_01]: with other industry experience that they
know what it takes to run a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to come in here and pass up
all of these companies right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when I got into this industry
five years ago and where we were at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then whenever we passed Prop 64,
they said immediately 90% of the companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that you see today are not going to be
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sadly, I know that it's more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just not being able to handle this
regulated market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't blame them, but a lot of it has to
go down to the culture of the business
[SPEAKER_01]: that you built before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a compliant culture?
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts from the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're the owner of these businesses,
you have to want to do this to have your
[SPEAKER_02]: employees want to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trainings, I can't tell you how important
they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: You may think that your bartenders know
what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what the single scariest thing
in the world is?
[SPEAKER_02]: When the auditors come.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the BCC comes, what are they supposed
to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they know who their first point of
contact is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they know that they're not allowed to
not give them access to information?
[SPEAKER_02]: The longer a regulator sits and waits for
them to figure out who to call and what to
[SPEAKER_02]: do, they're looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're looking for problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're just sitting around looking,
they're going to find the non-compliant
[SPEAKER_02]: product on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does everybody know that they got to check
in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is everything leaving in an opaque bag?
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter how small the product
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to leave your retail store in an
opaque bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prepare them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do unannounced audits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hire outside companies to come in and
audit your business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not that you are doing something
wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: If Julie or Brett or I or somebody else
shows up to help you, we're not there to
[SPEAKER_02]: highlight what you're doing wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're there to highlight what you could be
doing better and to provide you with a
[SPEAKER_02]: mechanism to get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Brett said, these are how-to things.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're an artisanal cannabis company,
you know how to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do the same thing every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just write it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to be pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to look like these
wonderful, beautiful SOPs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to be usable and workable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they're using them and you're
training people to do them, then you're
[SPEAKER_02]: ensuring that that same thing we talked
about earlier, that act of omission or
[SPEAKER_02]: failure, isn't happening to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marketing, I think, is the single biggest
thing that may take people out besides
[SPEAKER_02]: CEQA that they're not paying attention to.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you advertise on social media,
your license number should be synonymous
[SPEAKER_02]: with your logo.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to put your logo on
something, you're going to put your
[SPEAKER_02]: license number on something.
[SPEAKER_02]: One without the other doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we can take a good learning
lesson from some of the biggest dispensary
[SPEAKER_02]: arguable operators in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have six dispensaries and you do a
leaflet that you put out in the newspaper,
[SPEAKER_02]: you do not put one license number on
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put all five or six license numbers if
you are saying, I have stores in six
[SPEAKER_02]: different locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can leave you guys with one piece of
advice, it's don't be cute with the
[SPEAKER_02]: agencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't think it's cute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be ahead of your compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make it a part of your living,
breathing organization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you are the manager, if you are the
owner, if you are somebody who is in
[SPEAKER_02]: charge, make it a priority for you because
people learn by what they see.
[SPEAKER_02]: See one, do one, teach one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same applies here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say, and this is
another point, that if you sell a product,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you sell products in your store,
your business is not selling product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your business is not making a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your business is supporting a team of
people and inspiring them to stay so
[SPEAKER_01]: motivated that they are not going to put
your license at risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you let people know,
this is the boundaries that you must
[SPEAKER_01]: reside in, and letting them know that
their mistakes reflect on the company,
[SPEAKER_01]: not them, and that they are putting your
license, and you take care of your team,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you support them, and you provide them
with better than what other companies are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing with, you are not going to deal with
the turnover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because right now, turnover is happening
everywhere in the industry because you are
[SPEAKER_01]: taking these people that have been bud
tenders for years, and now they are worth
[SPEAKER_01]: so much from their knowledge in the
industry and applicable experience and
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance, and if they are motivated
enough to do it, they can move up from
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have seen people from other
industries come into this industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: and yes, they bring valuable skills and
experience that we need to help polish us,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if they don't, if they don't
understand what it's like to work in a
[SPEAKER_01]: highly regulated market, they're going to
feel their dreams and their aspirations
[SPEAKER_01]: for their job just die because all you do
is tell people all day, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I... It is such an incredibly
strange and amazing evolutionary
[SPEAKER_00]: historical moment that we're in in terms
of some of the things that are happening
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cannabis industry from my
perspective is you took a culture of
[SPEAKER_00]: underground activists, and now you've put
them in business casual clothing and
[SPEAKER_00]: turned them into ninjas who have to play
an insane high stakes Tetris match with
[SPEAKER_00]: the government and state and local
ordinances to preserve the soul of what
[SPEAKER_00]: they were trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part I like to make clear of
we're in this weird running match with
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking Target to decide who gets to have
this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of us are like, I got to get more
hair gel and be corporate and let's
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the biggest philosophical
quandary I have day by day of how do we
[SPEAKER_00]: create the world we want to create with
this industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how do we get to sit at the table?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get to navigate the process?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get to participate in informed
policy, which is still being written?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for God's sakes, please let it be
written by us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, please let it be written by the
people who suffered and built the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, not by the yahoos coming from
pharma who are like, I've got this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for warming my seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it's ethically insane and
questionable that so many people are
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about making money in cannabis
while people are still in jail for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis crimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's insane that John Bonner and the
Republicans and Mitch, whatever the hell
[SPEAKER_00]: his name is, and all the excited people
about him for like, let's put CBD in
[SPEAKER_00]: malls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that is insane to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we are still struggling to get our
social equity applicants operational in
[SPEAKER_00]: Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's completely insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as boring as it sounds to some people
about compliance in these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: like we are your ninja team that is here
to like sleep dart the agencies and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: them off your ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is our job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Julie, I love you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that already.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to your point, do not just take money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to make the I have to because don't
do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting into bed with people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't express it enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the feeling, the urgency,
like when it was twenty two thousand and
[SPEAKER_02]: twenty seventeen and you wanted to get
licenses and like hardly any jurisdictions
[SPEAKER_02]: were issuing licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like finding the unicorn or the
needle in the haystack.
[SPEAKER_02]: More and more people are coming online.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not I implore you, do not collect these
licenses and not be able to operate them.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got seven licenses and none of
them are like 50 percent compliant,
[SPEAKER_02]: then stop getting more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to help you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think that the more licenses you
have that are non-operational or not
[SPEAKER_02]: functional to survive a compliance audit,
because I promise you that big money that
[SPEAKER_02]: Julie's talking about, they're hiring us
to do a due diligence of your business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brett's not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Julie's not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to do a disservice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't just go picking up licenses
thinking like, oh, pharma company,
[SPEAKER_02]: come buy all of my licenses that don't
mean anything because I haven't taken them
[SPEAKER_02]: through the second step of the process and
transferable.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was I was getting to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you haven't gotten them activated
because the end of the beginning is
[SPEAKER_02]: getting your business license.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get through planning and
building.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, let me tell you, is not a two week
ordeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: If a contractor tells you, don't worry,
we're going to get through this CUP in
[SPEAKER_02]: like two months, you're going to be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be operating.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have them sign their name in
blood and be able to pay for all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: fines that you will incur for that not
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also read your regulations where you
are getting these licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they say they are non-transferable
licenses, just like if you got one from
[SPEAKER_02]: the BCC, it says it right on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Non-transferable.
[SPEAKER_02]: That word means, and I feel like it needs
to be said, it means it's
[SPEAKER_02]: non-transferable.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't mean that you make a press
release because you're oh, so excited that
[SPEAKER_02]: you got millions of dollars that you're
then putting a flag in the ground to tell
[SPEAKER_02]: both your local jurisdiction if they say
that you can't transfer a license.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by non-transferable, sometimes they
mean no change of control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what exactly is the big pharmaceutical
company doing if there are not buying
[SPEAKER_02]: equity in your business to change control?
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the state level, you're telling the
state regulators, oh, this person's now an
[SPEAKER_02]: owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 14 days from now, if I haven't updated
you and they're not added and they have
[SPEAKER_02]: equity, now I've just transferred a permit
and now in a public record, I'm letting
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these people, by the way, are owners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as an owner, anything that they do,
anything, they have a felony DUI.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden, that could jeopardize
your license.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I implore you, I get that there is more
money than God currently circling the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis space, being like, just jump at
all of the money that I want to give you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understand how that plan is going to be
effectuated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do not think it is that easy to bring
people in to your business, to your baby
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have slaved over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am sure that you spent all of your
hard-earned capital and your dollars and
[SPEAKER_02]: your time getting it to this place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't all of a sudden let that be
squandered or let somebody come in and
[SPEAKER_02]: take your business on pennies on the
dollar, because I'm promising you good
[SPEAKER_02]: corporate governance has not been the
mainstay of this business.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have good corporate actions,
if you don't have a minute book,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you don't have properly filed
statements of information and somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: else goes in and files one for you and all
of a sudden takes over your company,
[SPEAKER_02]: these are real world things that are
happening when there's assets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And be forewarned, the BCC is starting to
crack down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had this issue happen where if you
improperly add an owner, if you improperly
[SPEAKER_02]: try to remove an owner or transfer around
outside of the regulations, they will
[SPEAKER_02]: revoke your license.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not just one license.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your license is revoked, therefore forever
you are going to have to write that your
[SPEAKER_02]: license was revoked and it could
jeopardize your other existing licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just think very long and hard and
strategically and talk to your compliance
[SPEAKER_02]: people, talk to your lawyers, talk to your
tax professionals, because there's tax
[SPEAKER_02]: implications about what selling,
in air quotes, that means or taking in
[SPEAKER_02]: capital, how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: But we can go back to the regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just felt like dovetailing off of what
was your speech could not be better was
[SPEAKER_02]: just reminding people what that
transferability is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like we said, it's a living process
and the permanent regulations are
[SPEAKER_00]: permanent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's hopeful things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hopeful things on the horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the flurry of all of the bills at
the legislative level being introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Senator Scott Weiner has reintroduced the
compassionate care bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hope that this governor actually
signs it because it did pass last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the governor didn't sign it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would relieve the excise taxes from
donated products from compassionate care.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have, you know, on another,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, the excise tax bill is getting
reintroduced to lower the excise tax from
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 to 11 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, every little bit helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of localities starting to
lower their local taxes because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the symbol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're getting the idea that
maybe the really high local taxes on top
[SPEAKER_00]: of the high state taxes on top of a high,
you know, all of it doesn't really work
[SPEAKER_00]: that well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're seeing the tax money.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tax revenue is not staying locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going straight to the state level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where a lot of this stuff is
very frustrating to me is seeing what the
[SPEAKER_01]: fines are and what the application fees
are and what communities can make off of
[SPEAKER_01]: these application fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 1.7 million in Pasadena.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hot damn, they better have some
better looking sidewalks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not even once you get your
license.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just made off of people applying 1.7
million.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least it's staying at the local
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate that because that's money
that's being pumped in from all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: world is going in for these Pasadena
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dispensaries are not seeing the growth
that they had had projected.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that has grown is their
cost for everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we're going back to the
packaging, the CRP packaging, this whole
[SPEAKER_01]: whiplash back and forth situation here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time the government makes a decision
like this that they think is so small and
[SPEAKER_01]: so insignificant ends up costing millions
of dollars, costing companies their jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're costing people their
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how are we going to survive through a
lot of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of this stuff here is you have to be
willing and ready to pivot at every turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I worked emergency veterinary medicine
before I got into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we dealt with federally controlled
drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We regularly have ketamine out and
hydromorphone and Valium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are things that have to be
tracked every single month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to provide that to stay in
federal agencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are also organizations,
specifically vet clinics in Texas don't
[SPEAKER_01]: usually hire veterinary technicians that
are licensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since there's Texas A&M there,
which is the largest vet school in the
[SPEAKER_01]: country, and Texas is all about,
you know, low wages and bust your ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I live in California now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't have to be credentialed in
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have people that are literally
your veterinary license is at risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just your business license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your career is at risk because you have an
employee who's skimming Valium off the top
[SPEAKER_01]: or ketamine off the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen this come back on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, so I know what it's like to
work in a highly regulated market with
[SPEAKER_01]: compliant products that you have to track
and trace every bit of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're leaving that trust in some of
your employees that are, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: unexperienced, uneducated, and not caring
really what makes a difference in your
[SPEAKER_01]: life, you know, this or that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not taking care of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is where it's like truly
it has to be, we're not in the business of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the compliance business,
which I mean, I know I personally am,
[SPEAKER_01]: but everybody should be doing this right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be part of your culture and you
need to bring people in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not pitching any of us here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's plenty of great companies out
there, great people out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and people that have just been in the
industry long enough that they know how to
[SPEAKER_01]: go with these changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need to bring them in and you need
to listen to them because like I had a
[SPEAKER_01]: discussion earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like if you're dropping off samples,
samples in a store and you, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there has to be a manifest and
all these things, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not, well, they can go back for 90
days where the footage and then they see
[SPEAKER_01]: you and then like, oh, they didn't also
check in as a visitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not on the visitor log.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they may never find out who the sales
rep was.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will because of the harassing the
store for saying who was this and all
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll go back to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your company is at risk because
you had a sales rep that was just trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to win that account because now you've
switched them all from from commission
[SPEAKER_01]: based to now they're over because you
don't want to file them as a financial
[SPEAKER_01]: interest party on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's have to take care of your people,
take some time off from selling and train.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to pick up on that, like I was
just having this conversation with
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody where there's so many micro
things in the companies where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, this isn't a big deal and this isn't
a big deal and this isn't a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not even be something that you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your dispensary, your business could be
robbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the police are going to ask for the
tapes and they're going to review the
[SPEAKER_00]: tapes and then they see stuff happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this has happened where then they see
something else happening and go,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, by the way, sorry about your robbery,
but look at all this things that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing wrong in your tapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's incredibly different and difficult
to be under this level of scrutiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can master being comfortable
under this level of scrutiny, reporting
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, having those relationships
with the agencies, just be in an open
[SPEAKER_00]: book.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for what they ask to see,
it's like going through a tax audit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You show them what they ask you to answer
the questions they ask and on you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great, it's a great situation to
be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great muscle to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also what Brett was saying,
any company who hires a single compliance
[SPEAKER_00]: officer and is like, we're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have a consultant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are not okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to dovetail on what you were saying,
everybody's job in a company, in a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis company is now compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are no longer a bud tender.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your job is sales compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are no longer a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your job is growing compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you, your growers have like a
ridiculous amount of record keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to build systems that work for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make sure they have the right
scales and the right kind of points of
[SPEAKER_00]: entry to enter the information so that
it's not too hard and it's not too
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult and you're not giving them so
much pressure that they're in too much of
[SPEAKER_00]: a hurry that they can't write down the wet
weight for every individual plant that has
[SPEAKER_00]: to be written down now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to help them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to build in redundancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big, so that's the thing about it is,
is like, not only do you have to do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you gotta do that like three fucking times
because you don't want any of this to go
[SPEAKER_01]: missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have to keep a visitor's log,
like a lot of people don't understand that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to keep employee records separate
from other records and all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: different thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll have them all locked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and our spaces right now,
like, I mean, compliance also means it
[SPEAKER_01]: takes up a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to have cabinets that are
locked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have this, you know, um, limited
access and this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, well, let's have digital.
[SPEAKER_01]: Digital is great until shit goes down and
then you don't have electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they just so happen to show up in
that moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing about all of this is,
and with regulators, and I don't mean this
[SPEAKER_01]: in a bad way, is like learn how to be,
this is funny coming from me, from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn how to be a likable person because
all of this stuff is all, it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so if they come in and they don't
like your attitude, those other two things
[SPEAKER_01]: that they didn't, that they saw,
but they didn't see, they saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you need to learn how to also come
at this because they're coming at you nice
[SPEAKER_01]: as can be because they know that it takes
your guard down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to come at them nice as can be
as well and have like, like it was already
[SPEAKER_01]: discussed here is like I do just like a
fire drill, not that any businesses do
[SPEAKER_01]: that, but do a fire drill because trust
me, that fire will burn you down worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not, not to pitch the business,
but we do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Julie does it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other people do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go and do an audit of our clients'
businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: We give them anywhere from 48 hours to two
hours to zero notice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we show up and I show up and I'm like,
okay, so today I'm your BCC auditor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show me what your books are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check me in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they don't check me in,
I said, why aren't you asking for my ID?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is your visitor log?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tell you it's those sorts of
unannounced audits that prepare you and
[SPEAKER_02]: your staff the best because what Brett is
saying, what Julie is saying is you got
[SPEAKER_02]: to, these are usually enforcement officers
or former police officers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know how to ask leading questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know how to be nice as pie so that
all of a sudden your employee's talking
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're like, oh yeah, well,
you know, sometimes I put it in and
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes they don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we're really busy, then I'll wait
till do it until later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're not in real time and
they're just talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they need to understand how to answer
questions, how to give the correct
[SPEAKER_02]: information without giving more
information than they have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, practice makes perfect,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody is ever a hundred percent
compliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to look at this industry the same
as a banking industry, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Banks are heavily regulated industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the federal reserve comes in,
no bank is ever a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_02]: compliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are some banks that work with
third party certification companies and
[SPEAKER_02]: they have a certification that says we
were last audited on X date.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the issues that they found.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the corrective actions we
already have in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tell you, when the federal reserve
comes in to do an audit, they may not give
[SPEAKER_02]: you, they may not give those banks
additional fines because what is a fine?
[SPEAKER_02]: A fine is to identify a problem and to
ensure that there's a corrective action
[SPEAKER_02]: and remediation so that it doesn't happen
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've already done those three things,
there's not much for the agency to do and
[SPEAKER_02]: they'd rather let you continue on and say,
okay, well, then I'm going to come back
[SPEAKER_02]: and make sure these things have been done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they may impose a date by which they
have to be done versus the corrective
[SPEAKER_02]: action that you had that allowed you a
longer bandwidth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that you had more financial security in
making those changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they may instead just escalate your
timetable versus giving you an enforcement
[SPEAKER_02]: action.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nobody up here is saying that we want
to go in and tell you what you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said before, we want to highlight
what you can do better so that when those
[SPEAKER_02]: agencies come, it's not a surprise to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I think that a lot of this
compliance also, I know this sounds
[SPEAKER_01]: completely not true at all, but a lot of
this can age and efficiency and cost
[SPEAKER_01]: savings because you're streamlining what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what large companies do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where the pharmaceutical
companies can come in here and they can
[SPEAKER_01]: read our regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tobacco industry can come in here and
read our regulations and be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they already know what it's like
to reside in that and they know the areas
[SPEAKER_01]: that they can strategize on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of these things are,
it's just like, oh, it says I can't do
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did not say you couldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It said you couldn't do it the way you did
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can figure out ways to go around
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's nothing more than I love to
see as a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't want to do what your mom or dad
told you to do, so did you figure a way
[SPEAKER_01]: around it to get what you wanted?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is kind of what regulations are
to me as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank God, I'm coming from a place of
ethics versus some people are coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: a place of greed and selfishness and
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, I'm sure my husband would say I
do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do that every so often too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you need to go through there and just
strategize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Allow yourself to wipe out what you used
to think that it meant and try to go from
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of these things,
they just help you streamline your
[SPEAKER_01]: business, streamline your finances.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a huge believer in that the green tax
is 90% of the time the green tax is you're
[SPEAKER_01]: late and you should have got this shit in
three weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you're paying the extra fee
on all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm also noticing more and more now
like security companies are really wanting
[SPEAKER_01]: to get involved in us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that things are legal on a state
level, we've been able to actually have
[SPEAKER_01]: access to better companies to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to be so worried to divulge that,
oh, this is a retailer.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's so much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are less judgmental about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also still remember how dispensaries
act when fire and safety show up before
[SPEAKER_01]: all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to just come in and do their yearly
inspection, they just have to walk through
[SPEAKER_01]: the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would stop them at the front and
you would be like, no, no, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't come in until, no, I literally
have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's how they acted with fire and
safety, these guys were like, I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll come through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: These inspectors and auditors are not
going to sit there and wait because that
[SPEAKER_01]: adds to their day anyways because they're
going to still do what they got to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a $5,000 fine to not let them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what regs do you guys like the best?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the most?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was going to say, does anybody
have any questions out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody want to ask a question or
just continue?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
OK.
