[SPEAKER_01]: Frenchy is the Anthony Bourdain of weed
over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody needs to fight that fight and
make people understand what he's
[SPEAKER_01]: preaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes around and he teaches classes and
it's so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know what a freeze dryer was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frenchy told me on the sidewalk of Oakland
at NCIA in 2000 something, we were making
[SPEAKER_01]: hash and chopping it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sieving it on cardboard boxes and
all this crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, for me, Frenchy is the one who
told me about the freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, I started really thinking like
before it was just like farmers were like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get this trim out of my garage
because I don't want to be held
[SPEAKER_01]: accountable for 200 pounds of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we used to process it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would see the gold bags the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would only keep the gold bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only do one run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the ideas about the ripeness that
Frenchy has, he's really pioneering a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole generation of hash makers to make
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, it's always about making
quality, but it's crazy on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see my quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to beg people to buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to be like, look, when I tell them
there's three grades of hash, they look at
[SPEAKER_01]: me like I'm crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could, I would have 10 grades of
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: But already with three because it comes
out in the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back in the day, we would do one run,
collect the crema and go home laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trim was free.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have to make sure to wash every
single bit of THC we can off that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: with that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then comes, we always have this grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what I realized is a lot of the
times people wanted more plant material
[SPEAKER_01]: because in America, I feel like it's like
flower culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people want a little bit of plant
material in their smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't keep that skew from going out of
stock constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to be selling that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't want to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When he started doing it, I told him that
he shouldn't because it confuses people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you have two quality or three
quality, the guy is going to take the
[SPEAKER_00]: cheapest and he's going to expect the
best, mandatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really totally confuse them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried for a little bit to have two
grades and it was no, no, no, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're stuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're stuck because sleeve resin was
reintroduced into the awareness of the
[SPEAKER_00]: smoker through BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: BHO was killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were smoking only flower before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before that, they would smoke ash,
but in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when they had their crackdown federal
and they were actually even not receiving
[SPEAKER_00]: weed from abroad that they started to
grow, they smoke flower for two
[SPEAKER_00]: generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then BHO killed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ash that was the sieved resin that
was reintroduced that wasn't an extract
[SPEAKER_00]: went through them like solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were trying to get food in a door by
mimicking the appearance of the extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could pack almost as much
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They definitely were packing a lot more
terpenes, especially in the good old days,
[SPEAKER_00]: not anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the product was leaving very little
residue in their nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody smoked their extract in a nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that defined the ash market in
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is only America.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of the world do not smoke
unpressed resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not put the resin in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you see new school hash makers now who
are making rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cooking their rosin now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where Frenchy's been cooking his hash with
his water bottle and I'm cooking my hash
[SPEAKER_01]: with my press.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always decarbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that knowledge of wanting to decarb
stuff is spreading to the mainstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: What ancient cultures have been doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Moroccans were making little plastic
balls and throwing it in boiling water to
[SPEAKER_01]: decarb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it's nice to see like
everyone's exploration kind of leading
[SPEAKER_01]: back to that ancient knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the science now to check the
science because if a methodology is done
[SPEAKER_00]: in every producing ash producing country
for millennium, there is something solid
[SPEAKER_00]: behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, it would have disappeared a
long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no methodology that can stand 25
years and not be put aside if it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: really on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have stuff that stands so much
time, you cannot really think that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: do better if you don't understand the
traditional methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like there is no glass maker that
didn't go in Europe and study the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional glass making.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're blowing up the masters
that teach them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they had to try to reinvent this
technique, there is no point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go, learn everything you need to learn
about your trade, and then you can carry
[SPEAKER_00]: that further.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the ash industry, they don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They reinvent the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're going to face the rest of
the world, we're going to need to speak
[SPEAKER_00]: the same language.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use ash for every other extract,
it's like using the word football for a
[SPEAKER_00]: game where you hardly touch the ball with
your feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to put American before so that we
all understand that it's not football that
[SPEAKER_00]: we play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we talk to you, you have to even
invent a name so that we don't use the
[SPEAKER_00]: word football so that we get you confused
when we talk about football.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's only one game.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have this in the world, the cannabis
industry, and you're supposed to set the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard for that industry, we need to
find terminologies that define everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so diversified.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty important for everybody to
understand the complexity of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
