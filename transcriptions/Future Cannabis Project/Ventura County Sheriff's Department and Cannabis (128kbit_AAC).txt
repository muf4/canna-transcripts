[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm Jim Fryoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a captain with the Ventura County
Sheriff's Office.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently the chief of police of the
contract city of Ojai.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now we're in the city of Ojai.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at a hotel called Casa Ojai Inn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the host for the first ever weed
convention, the Weed Con 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having never had one in our county before,
we didn't know what to expect,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I brought additional staffing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were expecting anywhere from two to
three hundred attendees, so I had four
[SPEAKER_00]: extra offices that were here.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we had our briefing ahead of time,
I made it clear that our goal is to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: successful, mellow event, where we're
going to walk through and be seen,
[SPEAKER_00]: hold people to what the conditions are,
where there's no usage at the event,
[SPEAKER_00]: make ourselves seen, be friendly,
say hi to everybody, let them know we're
[SPEAKER_00]: here, but also because I don't want people
to be afraid to call us if something goes
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not here to make enemies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here to hold people accountable and
enforce the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Weed Con 2018, I was contacted by
one of my dispensaries who let me know
[SPEAKER_00]: about the event that was going to happen,
and the promoter sought out a temporary
[SPEAKER_00]: use permit from the city of Ojai to have
the event with the necessary restrictions
[SPEAKER_00]: that the city needed to place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the promoter had to submit to get a
temporary use permit to have the event,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when the promoter came forward and
said, hey, I want to have an event where I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to bring different industry
stakeholders together for a convention.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked, you know, this is where I want
to hold it at.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knew that we had three dispensaries,
three licensed dispensaries in the city of
[SPEAKER_00]: Ojai, and he went through the permitting
process and was insecure to permit from
[SPEAKER_00]: the city to have the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, there's a substantial amount of
conditions on the event itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most notable is that no cannabis
consumption can take place at the event
[SPEAKER_00]: location, and that's not just specific to
this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a city ordinance prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a city ordinance that states no
consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for in private, you see your home,
you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is 2019 going to be different than 2018?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the state keeps changing the
regulations pretty much monthly,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as a result, the cities are trying to
play catch up on what the state's trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to accomplish, and the cities are either
trying to be more restrictive than what
[SPEAKER_00]: the state has or at least on par with what
the state is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as of right now, I think our conditions
are pretty consistent with what the state
[SPEAKER_00]: is doing as far as events like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my understanding that a state event,
you could have it at like a fairgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, this is not a fairgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a hotel that has been rented out
for this purpose, and because this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: brand new industry that we're all involved
in now, people are trying to sort their
[SPEAKER_00]: way through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I've been in law enforcement
for 28 years, and for a majority of that
[SPEAKER_00]: time, marijuana has been illegal,
and now it's legal with certain
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That keeps changing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the way it is,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll find some homeostasis at some
point of where those laws need to be to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep people safe and still allow access
with what the voters wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in the city, I think that we had
Ojai had the highest percentage of voters
[SPEAKER_00]: that voted for Prop 64, and as a result,
their constituents, the council members
[SPEAKER_00]: who are working for the voters,
decided to move forward with initially
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal dispensaries, and then several
months later, opened them up to
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational or adult use dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all three of our dispensaries in the
city of Ojai are licensed for adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to comment that that is
sensible, because there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: municipalities that have overwhelming
voter support for Prop 64, and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: ban everything, and that's not really the
will of the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that there's a balance to be
drawn, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you certainly have the will of the
people of what they want, and then at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time, when the city's looking at the
overall well-being of their community,
[SPEAKER_00]: are they going to jump too fast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they open up too wide?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I think was when the city said,
okay, we're going to start with medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: and see what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably a shorter period of time
than I envisioned, but seven months later,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've gone adult use or recreational,
and the transition has not seemed to be an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue for the city yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still a very new industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know yet what the impact is going
to be, positive or negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, from an industry standpoint and
business standpoint, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: employers now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certainly more employees that are
working up here at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a value in that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Finding good work for people to be in
that's legal is always good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's been sort of your experience
interacting with people you're meeting in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry, people who work at the
dispensaries, people who come into the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries to get their medicine or
their recreational?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as of right now, I have met with all
three of my dispensary owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a great relationship with all three
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also want to make sure the community
is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've given me great access to all
their facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have access to all the cameras
within their facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've actually given that access to our
dispatch center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they ever dial 911, our dispatchers
can log into their cameras and see what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening live and let the officers know
they're responding in what's happening at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a safety standpoint, it's valuable
to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've asked all the dispensaries to hand
out flyers saying cannabis and driving
[SPEAKER_00]: don't mix, and they have handed out those
flyers with every purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have stickers they put on all their
exit bags that say that this is still a
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled substance to keep away from
people who are pregnant or minors and pets
[SPEAKER_00]: for obvious reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they've been more than willing to
help control it in a way that makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: safe, the safest it's possible for our
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, and I mentioned to this earlier
to you that I'm not pro marijuana in any
[SPEAKER_00]: regard, but I am pro-law.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the law says it's legal, and I'm going
to enforce what is legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's legal, it's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like this event, the expectation is
that nobody's going to consume any
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana product here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do, they'll have to answer to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now are you under any pretense that zero
marijuana will be consumed here?
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recognize that there's a good chance
that that can happen, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the effort here is to make
sure that the event holder knows what the
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions are and that he does his best
to control it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they want to have a second event,
he'll control it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the expectation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, can you mention the billboard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that I have a
relation to one of the dispensaries here
[SPEAKER_00]: locally, it's Ojai Greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I talked to Matt, one of the
owners, I noticed that he had put a
[SPEAKER_00]: billboard up when they first went into
business along Highway 33, the main
[SPEAKER_00]: corridor into the Ojai Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it said Ojai Greens is a cannabis
dispensary, approved cannabis dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: for medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he was going to change the sign
because now that they've gone true
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational or adult use, he wanted to
change the sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had asked him, I said, hey,
are you willing to include a public safety
[SPEAKER_00]: message on your billboard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you include the statement cannabis
and driving don't mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two days ago, the billboard went up
with a message that says cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: driving don't mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually three days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems like the majority of your
interactions with this community,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's day to day or here at this
event, have been positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not contentious and they're
reasonable people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So has that kind of like how have you
processed that experience of like these
[SPEAKER_01]: are actually pretty reasonable people?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that the experience has
definitely gone better than I expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there was a lot of perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we see with the takeover robberies
that happen at other dispensaries in other
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that going to do here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to be subject to additionally
violent crimes in our area because we have
[SPEAKER_00]: a target now that people want to hit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's my biggest concern is they
are a potential target.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by the security conditions that
they've imposed, that they've willingly
[SPEAKER_00]: done on themselves, that's helped reduce
their chance of being harmed or their
[SPEAKER_00]: employees being harmed as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always want to want more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my idea of security is different
than their idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just tell them, you know,
this is my position.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I think you should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's their choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've met the minimum requirements of
what the city has imposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just tell them, I go, hey,
my expectation is you're going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you can to keep everybody in
the community safe and not be a target.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want any victims here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens is in California,
there's incorporated cities and they can
[SPEAKER_00]: have their own police departments if they
choose to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the unincorporated areas are
all patrolled by the sheriff's office,
[SPEAKER_00]: but incorporated cities can have their own
police department or they can choose to
[SPEAKER_00]: contract their services out to the
sheriff's office.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, there's a lot of overheating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Redundancy within law enforcement from
personnel, dispatching SWAT teams,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these other things that by contracting
with a larger agency, they can they can
[SPEAKER_00]: save money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be more efficient in how they do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they don't have their own police
department.
[SPEAKER_00]: They contract with us so that,
you know, but we do a pretty good job of
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to represent it as we are their
police department.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm the chief of police for the city of
Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the cars that we drive in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we let the councils decide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the it's the council's town.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work for the city manager on one of his
department heads, just like the many other
[SPEAKER_00]: department heads, to make sure we're
delivering the service that the city
[SPEAKER_00]: wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are all these different
constituents, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your stakeholder, law enforcement,
the PTA moms, the cannabis consumers,
[SPEAKER_01]: the whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you attending those city council
meetings?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, kind of what are the things
that you're trying to push forward and
[SPEAKER_01]: what are things that other stakeholders
are pushing forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we come up with how is Ohio
come out with sort of compromises on all
[SPEAKER_01]: sides?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so the question's on or venture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the cities have there are at a
different stage of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think city of Ohio is definitely more
advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question was, how does the city
fare with how do we make these decisions,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with all the different
stakeholders that are involved?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have police, you have parents,
you have schools, you have all these other
[SPEAKER_00]: constituents who are involved in trying to
make up what's right for the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of those redresses are handled at
a city council meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I attend city council meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can't, one of my my assistant
chief will attend where those items are
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed about this is what they want to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for me to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can always ask what my concerns are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I share with them what my concerns
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are my concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm concerned about increase of people
that are using illicit substances and
[SPEAKER_00]: driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm worried about the security from people
coming and doing robberies because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: cash business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm worried about at least now,
as of July, at least they're not coming
[SPEAKER_00]: with 55 gallon drums full of weed because
it's all prepackaged from the mansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's less of a target for for the
theft of the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's just the cash item.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, all these businesses know
that that's a target.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have vaults to hide the cash in,
to store it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they know when they have a
certain amount to take it into deposit at
[SPEAKER_00]: the banks that they can still do banking
with or they break it apart so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: banks are not wise to whatever their
decisions are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones that have to find out
what they're doing with it until there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: greater resolution on the banking system
for the cannabis dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have any perspective on delivery?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all three of our dispensaries were also
given the permit for delivery as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the city first stepped into it,
they said they would give three delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses and three dispensary licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just worked out that the people that
qualified for the licenses were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide both or applied for and receive
both the delivery and the dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I have a concern about them
being robbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a concern about the Domino's guy
getting robbed, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, any time you have products and
money and you have people that you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: potential for a crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that the dispensaries
know is to make sure they're sending out
[SPEAKER_00]: their drivers on designated routes with
not a ton of product or a ton of cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go out and make their round and they
come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, our delivery drivers in the
city can deliver anywhere in the city,
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere in the unincorporated area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the other cities outside the
jurisdiction, they can apply to get
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery licenses in those cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're granted licenses,
they can deliver there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the city of Ojai, the only ones that
can deliver in the city of Ojai are our
[SPEAKER_00]: three dispensaries that we have here,
nobody from outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know that the state is looking at
changing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state's looking at changing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once again, that's one of those
changes that's still kind of unfolding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, it's these three dispensaries
and they know what my concerns are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as of right now, have been abiding by
those concerns.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how long have they been delivering?
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had for medicinal, they've had the
delivery license.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had one one shop that's been open for
a year or pretty close to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other two have been open for about
nine months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And have there been any issues related to
delivery in that year?
[SPEAKER_00]: None.
None.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about things like people
getting into fights, people getting into
[SPEAKER_01]: fatal accidents, just bad stuff happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you compare alcohol and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a fair comparison,
but I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the comparison between alcohol
and marijuana and the drama that it causes
[SPEAKER_00]: within the public?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the issues are because marijuana has
been illegal up until just very recently,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not been as mainstream as alcohol,
which has been legal for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so certainly, I would say that the
marijuana, the alcohol issues are far more
[SPEAKER_00]: likely than with the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you were to compare how many
occurred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was 1000 incidents compared to
one incident of this because one was legal
[SPEAKER_00]: and one's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge will be now that it's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we see that number increase based
on, like you said, the fights,
[SPEAKER_00]: domestic violence or vehicle crashes and
whatnot, because the access is different
[SPEAKER_00]: for people that maybe had access before,
but were more cautious about using it
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were afraid of getting
arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they don't have that fear anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the what's going to be the new
normal that we're faced with?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm curious to see how that how that
plays out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my homework assignment for you is to
when consumption events are finally legal
[SPEAKER_01]: in whether Ventura County or Ohio
specifically, I want you to watch how one
[SPEAKER_01]: of those events plays out and sort of in
your mind, just note the number of fights
[SPEAKER_01]: you would see at an alcohol, sort of like
a concert with alcohol versus an event
[SPEAKER_01]: like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I guarantee you, you'll see all
sorts of people just like being nice to
[SPEAKER_01]: each other and having like deep
discussions and conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas like, then you go next door to
like the alcohol party and it's like you
[SPEAKER_01]: stepped on my toe and they like start
punching each other and getting all aggro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that'll be my homework assignment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So same conversation this time next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll know within, you know,
as things become more normalized,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, you know, for this event,
it's the first one of its kind in Ohio and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the first one of its kind in
Ventura County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not knowing what to expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is this is a very relaxed event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not seen had any issues at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see part of the conditions is that we
get to walk in, you know, as often as we
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've walked through, talked to the
different the vendor booths.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also I'm not coming in with a
heavy handed mind either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming in trying to make sure that
that they know they can still call us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, I'm trying to
provide a public service and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep everybody safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what the restrictions are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect that they abide by those
restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always going to be bad apples that
don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're sought out, enforcement
action may be taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as everybody knows what the
expectation is, if they can model that
[SPEAKER_00]: expectation, we're going to get along just
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
