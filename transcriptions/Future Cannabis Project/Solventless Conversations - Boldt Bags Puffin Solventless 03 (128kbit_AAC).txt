[SPEAKER_01]: Well, should we wash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us what we're about to wash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's do a quick little wash here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should have told me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have brought some trim,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have been fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it would have been a big old wash
party.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, puppy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come here, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually would be fun just to have a
bunch of people hanging out and washing in
[SPEAKER_01]: someone's backyard, talking and drinking
beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, then you could also like,
I think that's too much ice or,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, I think that's like, yeah,
that's about how I would run it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I'm doing is I'm putting ice in
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then can you give me that trim,
please?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll open it up for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this is some sick indoor weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Humboldt, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this was grown, this was grown down
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a this amazing purple dragon scale
weed that my friend Joe grows,
[SPEAKER_04]: and he's licensed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just amazing what this is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It used to squirt out purple rosin,
these buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go ahead and put some in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put some ice down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we have in here is we've got our
45, our 160, and our 190.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just got these little short bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we're going to do is not put too
much in, maybe just like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was going to say that's about
enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially once you start adding water,
it's going to swell up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you don't mind, can you hand
me that other bag of ice there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my hands are so sticky, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally sticky.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's some sticky shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just tasty.
Amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let that hang out for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put some water on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a lot of love.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nice if you use pure water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pure water is always the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not like LA tap water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not use LA tap water.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a lot of places, they have a lot of
fluoride in the water and minerals and
[SPEAKER_04]: copper and too many metallic things.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, not to mention lithium.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just kind of mix this around a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should put some more water in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I have that water, please?
[SPEAKER_04]: That one or you want this one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just take one last sip before I
give it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we'll get some more from inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, give me your water, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, actually, here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some R.O.
[SPEAKER_03]: water.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fortunately, I have my Pellegrino.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, now you got tangy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pour the Pelle in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no additives necessary.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is so... Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smell that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuckin' A.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smell that.
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very fragrant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny, I was buying beer in the
grocery store yesterday and it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's either super hoppy or like
mango or tangerine flavored.
Oh, yeah, that's all it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like... Or pumpkin spice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, or yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I don't want the Thanksgiving
seasonal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll do like vanilla, like for
Christmas, like vanilla cinnamon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's let that hang out for a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should put more water in it,
really, but... Go grab a couple bottles of
water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm gonna go grab some more water.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let Peter try this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that the blowtorch isn't on and the
lawnmower isn't running.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this bag's gonna save all that organic
material.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're already pulling it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought we were gonna take a TV timeout
to... Oh, yeah, we'll do TV timeout.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I like TV timeout.
[SPEAKER_01]: To go... Yeah, for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can keep talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like producing a cooking show
where like... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta think about, okay, this meal
takes an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we can't... We show it in the oven
and they pull it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't talk early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or yeah, and then they were like,
the breakthrough was like, let's make it
[SPEAKER_01]: before we even start the show and have a
fully cooked one in the oven.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we put one in, we just pull one out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need like the other bag that he did
before we got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like fast forward 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is that camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna take pictures of each of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep forgetting.
[SPEAKER_03]: How gnarly that Mac one is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love the different consistencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or just how different they all are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you have different colored labels.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes it easier to sort them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It all started with the red, but... Yeah,
so we just mix it like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very frosty.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our new thing we're offering,
the new mixing stations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you make the stainless steel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all stainless now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have big, huge ones we sell too.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're setting up a lot of hash labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now all over and they want to go as big as
possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about size.
[SPEAKER_04]: Red scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I ask what this whole like setup would
go for retail?
[SPEAKER_04]: With the three bags and the... I just
maybe like, I don't know exactly to tell
[SPEAKER_04]: you the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to work there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't work there either.
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't priced it yet, but you can go
on our website, boldbags.com and check it
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, so people want to, most labs
want to do at least like 10 and 10,000
[SPEAKER_04]: grams a month, get production up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people are scaling right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I see this being used really well
for test runs, you know, of certain
[SPEAKER_03]: strains that you're going to go into.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just grab, you know, a quick
couple plants or like a quick couple
[SPEAKER_03]: branches, put it in there, mix it up and
go, okay, it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put this in, this is what came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's cut that whole fricking crop down.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what the big companies do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that would be very useful.
[SPEAKER_04]: They buy our little five sets and they do
a test run or they'll run even like one
[SPEAKER_04]: gallons before they run the big 200 gallon
systems, just as like the little Barbie
[SPEAKER_04]: batch, just to make sure they dialed it
in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also it's a good way of saving your
product too, before you go into a freeze
[SPEAKER_04]: dry, because you have to have a full
freeze dryer full, because it costs money
[SPEAKER_04]: to run that freeze dryer and you don't
want to run it half full.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are great to save your product in
between runs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's another way of bags, holding bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you actually leave it in the bag and
just set it aside in like a freezer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the bucket too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just leave it in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you just put it on your trays
when you're ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then come in here and check this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like almost orange.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be yummy, really yummy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you smell it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's pretty tangeriney.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm going to kind of give it a
squeeze, let it melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then sometimes you just hang it above,
just give it a hang.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm just going to put this aside for
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could let it drain and melt for maximum
yield, but for TV purposes, we're just
[SPEAKER_04]: going to put it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're going to waste a lot of great
hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is going to be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So obviously being in a really cold
environment is the best and best
[SPEAKER_04]: situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So most of the labs that we set up are all
like walk-in freezers, basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need full on cold gear in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I run it like 46 degrees, roughly,
with a cool box.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the people doing stuff at scale,
I mean, they're having massive walk-in
[SPEAKER_01]: freezers, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Massive walk-in freezers, just lines and
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what temperature do they usually keep
it at?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like 40, 46.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I run it 46.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can have it colder,
but it's not really necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you really actually, it's in a
freezer, it'll literally freeze while
[SPEAKER_03]: you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want it about 46 to 50.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've noticed that even at 55, your ice
isn't going to melt as long as it's
[SPEAKER_03]: moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anything above that, it's definitely
going to start melting off really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to get a lot more
condensation on the side of whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: you're using.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if they're jacketed, they'll start to
really condensate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the colder the better.
[SPEAKER_03]: The colder the better is the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then it sucks being uncomfortable and
working with a jacket on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in a lab the other day, and you have
to have your full on beard cover,
[SPEAKER_04]: your beard net, your tat net, your walk-in
suit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just like too cold, too cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need like, next time you got a bundle
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be surprised, though, how quick you
get warm once you start really paddling
[SPEAKER_03]: down the river.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got a little waste material here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no big deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: No big deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a little, you know, we just,
we did like double sifting, basically,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: A handful of trim wasn't much,
but nothing much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyways, we're going to put that aside
and then we're going to pull out of our 45
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the goods.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the goodies right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like you wanted, if you can
see over there, yeah, you kind of want the
[SPEAKER_04]: ball to kind of congeal together,
kind of get together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously a little water action would
be nice, but see that beautiful little
[SPEAKER_04]: healthy little ball there?
[SPEAKER_04]: That is gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's going to be yum, yum,
yum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what I would consider full
spectrum because he basically did 40 to
[SPEAKER_03]: 159.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just with a couple of little strokes of
the paddle.
[SPEAKER_04]: You barely even beat that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was maybe like three minutes of
washing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot more than I was expecting
from that, from that trim, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks good in the light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, not bad, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how we do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little freeze dryer, put that with a lot
more and freeze dry it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you used to like, if this table like 20
years ago, you would lay it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this table or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: This table's been in our family a long
time, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen a lot of hillbilly hash bashes
right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's hash, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a 45 micron.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good bubble hash right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to be really fun to smoke
later.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also check out the hue of this
water in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is delicious product here,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you can do with this,
all of my hash water, all of my hash water
[SPEAKER_03]: is used to water my plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is you can actually boil this down and
distill all the water out, all the water
[SPEAKER_04]: out, and you can get more solid material
out of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's great about this new mixing
bucket is that you can actually really
[SPEAKER_04]: maximize your product and then turn this
into something useful instead of throwing
[SPEAKER_04]: it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is stuff that only made it through
all three bags, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the final smoke product.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go down to a 25 micron to 45 is
your favorite.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my point is that's super filtered,
which is amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: After you boil this down and you get solid
material, this will be really smokable or
[SPEAKER_04]: edible, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great for edibles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it'll also be activated with heat,
which will make it really psychoactive
[SPEAKER_04]: when you eat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like I said, I use all of my hash
water with my mixes and my teas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It stinks a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you said you feed it to your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: All my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're like, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for hooking me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Compared to just the regular mix,
as soon as it gets those, they're so
[SPEAKER_03]: happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They immediately just go crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the color of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks great.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like almost orange.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun to play with different kinds of
trims, indoor exotics and things,
[SPEAKER_04]: because you get some amazing results.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you get purple water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, purple water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get red water.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get blue water.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had all kinds of colored waters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pinkish sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always different.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many amazing strains that have
been not even tested yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even as you wash, as you go through
your washes, the color of the water will
[SPEAKER_03]: change.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll start purple and then move to this
greenish, tannish, orange colors.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that smells delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll be far out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you left it out drying,
I guess it's climate dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like how long, because you weren't
humble, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how long would that take to sun dry it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a week, maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Depends on the, you know, if it's the
summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so this is wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we made some hash, you guys,
with some of these 45 mesh, full mesh
[SPEAKER_04]: bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's amazing is this on a large
scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in kind of the biggest size that's on
the market now that are being used by
[SPEAKER_01]: these larger facilities, what's kind of
the yield per watt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what are you seeing yield wise?
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends on the strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how many grams is this, would you
guess?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say like two.
[SPEAKER_04]: After it dries, maybe two grams,
lucky.
[SPEAKER_04]: One and a half, two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, at least.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'll make one nice little table ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we weren't doing it as fast as we
were doing it, you would have gotten more,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just threw in a couple of handfuls.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also it's really a hot day today,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like 90 degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's fucking hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't want to do hash on a hot day
because your yield will be really shitty.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's nice is if you crank up the AC in
the house or do it on a cold night,
[SPEAKER_04]: or if you're in the snow, go out and get
some snow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And make it at night time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now it's, I mean, everybody's
wearing their full on like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like cold suits.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I work, it's so cold in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wearing, like, I have snowboard
jackets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my beanie on and it's cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to come out with new like,
cold gear now because we're in the cold
[SPEAKER_04]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only that, but it's weird because
you get both, you're working in that cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to get warm, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you kind of have to like be able to
take your jacket off sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I mean, it's 50 degrees in
there, but I'm not cold sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I usually, I'm in shorts,
but I'll usually wear a jacket.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my feet usually get freezing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my air conditioner's pumping and it's
freezing in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm always adding ice, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really anal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very picky, I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess it comes out in the end
product, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just keep it cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: I once had to work as a butcher and I'd
spend days in the freezer room.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it reminds me of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But making hash is so much funner than
chopping up meat.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be a little worried about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking love carving out.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not into that at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I've noticed that people are
doing different temperatures at their
[SPEAKER_03]: presses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've noticed also... Like what?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not pressing in a warm room,
but they're also not pressing in a
[SPEAKER_03]: freezing cold room.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing it about like 65,
60 to 65 degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've noticed a lot of people are
upping their temperature where it used to
[SPEAKER_03]: be like, oh, 190, 200 max.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now people are pressing like 230,
240.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the 230, 240 just allows a direct
press.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can kind of squirt directly into a
jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's all for visual
purposes or whatever the case may be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of other big name companies like
Monopoly Extracts, Dankzar Ice Wax,
[SPEAKER_03]: that guy, they just pump directly onto
parchment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they just ball it up,
throw it in a jar and let it cure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there's also a lot of different
curing techniques where people say,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, put it in a jar with the lid closed
for 200 degrees for 45 minutes and let it
[SPEAKER_03]: do its thing in the jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then other people are like,
that ruins all the turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to ruin everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then other people say, oh,
just leave it in the jar at 75 degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've noticed that I kind of play
with the best of both worlds where I go a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit warmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a closet in my house, luckily,
that has a water heater in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it stays like about 85 degrees all the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I let my hash sit in there in a dark
room at about 85 for about five days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where my separation occurs and
does everything, does this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in all honesty, you can have it any
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can fresh press it and freeze it and
it'll look bomb and it'll look like
[SPEAKER_03]: shatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you have to keep it cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: 710 Labs has started to talk about how
they're finally starting to explain,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, this is what our hash looks like at
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what our hash looks like after
it's been sitting out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to store your hash in a
refrigerator in a nice little Tupperware
[SPEAKER_04]: jar with a anti-moisture pack inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep the moisture out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I prefer and recommend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not freeze it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Freezing, it's bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Freezing is very bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like to freeze my hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I'll freeze is my flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: I freeze my flour when it's fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cut down because it doesn't seem to expand
much because it's already full of water
[SPEAKER_03]: and doing its thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even then, I've seen fresh frozen
last, like if it's sealed good in a good
[SPEAKER_03]: freezer, like six months to a year,
no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still produced exactly the same as it
did the day it was cut down.
[SPEAKER_03]: But after it's pressed and made,
like you said, it should stay cold and it
[SPEAKER_03]: should stay at least humid as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have those like whatever those
are.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a great shelf life.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll last a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember the big bricks back a long
time ago?
[SPEAKER_04]: With the stamp on it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: They lasted.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just put it in your closet or in your
dryer or wherever and they had no issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trailer park boy status.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got hash blocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that Cam walks around with his
igloo cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: His little mini cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: He takes his hash very seriously.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is very serious, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he also has full.
[SPEAKER_03]: Melt he separates them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to keep your full melt cold or
else it'll turn black or not black,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it oxidized and turn brown,
which is still good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It still tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over how long a period like the next
day or next day?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: From from from literally like white is
this, you know, why does this lid it'll
[SPEAKER_03]: it'll turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's basically like carrying a heart
transplant from like L.A.
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you got to keep it cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to keep it cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you how I figured it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we learned was before I even started
doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You approve of his wash?
[SPEAKER_01]: You like his work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what attracted you to him?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's she makes better hash than me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, at a spa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: At a spa like a spa date?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was with the women and she met me
and he was in the men's part and then mom
[SPEAKER_04]: introduced us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you were both already.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the spa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought she was like, you need to meet
my daughter and you're going to go on a
[SPEAKER_04]: date to a spa.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're smart, you always listen to your
mom.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one thing I always learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom agrees with that advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so who are you seeing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you like as you see people post
stuff on Instagram or wherever,
[SPEAKER_01]: like who's doing cool stuff that you're
that you like that that you like to smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: their hash or that you've recently smoked?
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, smoking others hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: What have I what have I tried that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, of course, like I said,
Superior Michigan Made Melts makes amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: 710 Labs is always good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really the hard thing to find
is somebody that makes a consistent
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a company called Bloomfields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, they're close to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've they've given me a lot of
information and helped me out with a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those guys are really solid.
[SPEAKER_03]: They make great hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: They grow great weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's like I said, it's consistency
and finding people that have good strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cameron, I'll buy his hash all day long.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He does a great job and I know where it's
coming from.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing better than knowing where
your product is coming from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Start to finish and having that peace of
mind and also having the peace of mind to
[SPEAKER_03]: give your your your customers and your
friends and family product that you know
[SPEAKER_03]: is healthy and good and quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to have a bunch of like,
you know, like avid and people spraying
[SPEAKER_03]: their plants and, you know, I just I don't
want that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't I don't I make sure to stay
away from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm always like in the room right
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the one cutting the weed down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm in there a couple of days before
their harvest, cutting their weed down,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a test batch for other people's
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, I have my own harvest, but there's no
way to sustain that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like as a one person, you'd have to have
all sorts of rooms to have the consistency
[SPEAKER_03]: to have different flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: My point is that they're letting you come
in and cut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, these are my good friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: We we also kind of have like a
conglomerate that we we consider
[SPEAKER_03]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call ourselves the Shoop Family Farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all kind of in the same area in West
Hills, California.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the guys used to live on Shoop and
he kind of like had like a Wi-Fi password,
[SPEAKER_03]: like Shoop Gang.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just a bunch of dorky white guys
that go surfing and grow pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, and skin board, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, you know, so you get first right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that's that's all it's been is
I've been very lucky, lucky and fortunate
[SPEAKER_03]: to have the the the connections to the
good material and knowing that it's good
[SPEAKER_03]: and watching and learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these guys have taught me so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to work for the bank for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was I used to I was in foreclosure as
default for B of A for 12 years,
[SPEAKER_03]: man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked my way up to middle management.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a sucker.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your own slaughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're slaughtering animals, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They laid me off, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they laid me off, they gave me
enough money to start a nice grow and and
[SPEAKER_03]: to, you know, and do what I do now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to ruin people's lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I that same question,
I got to tell you, I'm amazed by a couple
[SPEAKER_04]: of hash makers I work on the front lines
with up in Humboldt are making insane hash
[SPEAKER_04]: right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like you wouldn't believe this kind
of like white like like talking trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: I made them some bags and Jeremy and those
guys, they're making from talking trees
[SPEAKER_04]: and wicked, wicked hash, like insane and
Baron up in Nash's making some great,
[SPEAKER_04]: great product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very proud of him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like the all time awesome man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, Frenchy, you know,
Frenchy makes great hash all time.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just got the touch.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he's he's still he's old school
as a kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's still the fucking master,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easier to get a lot of the craftsmen
that are out there because it's so it's so
[SPEAKER_03]: nerve wracking.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you don't know who you're
dealing with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's these people out here
that are making some amazing hash,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's no way to acquire it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even available in a store.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you see these guys short run.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, man, I wish I could get them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a guy that's called his name is
for my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has like a Grateful Dead logo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't I think he's in Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know where he's at.
[SPEAKER_03]: But men, some of the best hash I've seen
is coming out of that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know these people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wish I could I could sample all the
different stuff that's around the country
[SPEAKER_03]: and find out what's going on everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've I've had limited selection
with, you know, with what's available just
[SPEAKER_03]: due to people's, you know, safety concerns
of not wanting to get in trouble,
[SPEAKER_01]: not wanting to not wanting to brain to
random not wanting not wanting to get not
[SPEAKER_03]: wanting to have silver bracelets,
you know, just things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like I feel like we're doing
something that's so harmless.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're literally growing a plant,
chopping it down, washing it with water
[SPEAKER_03]: and sifting it with bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, how harmless are we?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, are you serious right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not doing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, you are pretty harmless
looking like I'm not intimidated by you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love I love how people are learning how
to make hash and they're turning it into
[SPEAKER_04]: a, you know, ritual and then a lifestyle
and also a way to support themselves,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like people are like all my neighbors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also they're becoming
celebrities.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people that are able to make
these glass bongs that people can actually
[SPEAKER_03]: afford to have a life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all fuels, fuels itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a giant community.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, when you see like glass blower after
glass blower with like a hundred and
[SPEAKER_01]: something thousand followers and a Tesla.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, dude, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, you get to sell people stuff all day
long.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they appreciate this,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They give these people love, the people
that are that are, you know, supporting
[SPEAKER_03]: the fact that people need these pieces and
people need this medicine, more
[SPEAKER_04]: importantly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: People need this so that they can eat and
not be nauseous and not be sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something that makes people so
that they can breathe and not have
[SPEAKER_04]: seizures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's amazing what this product does.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a from outer space cure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, seeds, when they come up,
they come out counterclockwise.
[SPEAKER_04]: The opposite marijuana seeds are the only
seed that comes out opposite of every
[SPEAKER_04]: other seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every day you learn something new,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if it's left or right,
but it's opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a seed of pretty much every plant,
they all all cannabis seeds and then all
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis go the opposite direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a toilet in the southern
hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great analogy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a galactic product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very galactic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure the aliens come for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why they always land up and humble.
[SPEAKER_04]: They come in there for that great product.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more sightings of aliens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Up and humble than anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because everybody's baked as hell,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they come for the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm convinced.
[SPEAKER_03]: You up for another one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we at now?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to let you try the Mac one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the one that's extremely gassy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's not much of a marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should come up and do the hash bar at
the concert this weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I told you, man, I would if I didn't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up, it's just eight to 10 hours
away and a extremely short notice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be off the hook.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's harvest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's what I want to do down here is
basically create a venue where people can
[SPEAKER_01]: bring their stuff and share it with other
people who appreciate the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I would really like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only that, but you just find out
like what people are doing and have like
[SPEAKER_03]: minds coming up with good ideas because
cameras.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cameras help me out with so many things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the salons in Paris and like the
1700s, like idea exchange.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's what the shows have always
been about, you know, like the high times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cups in the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were small, intimate.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was an idea exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Small and intimate are no longer words
that are associated with high times.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, when it was in Amsterdam, it was
really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very small.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the days.
[SPEAKER_03]: You met Arjan.
[SPEAKER_03]: You met Franco.
[SPEAKER_03]: You met DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: You met they were there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything was was growing and they were
figuring all of these things out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You met all those people, all those
strains that were getting built.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Chocolope, the L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: Confidential, all those strains were new
and never even around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: So were you in Amsterdam for a while?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I wasn't there, but I was going
every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, this is what I want to do
with my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know what the pulse is around
the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was funny how many Americans you
found going to Amsterdam trying to also
[SPEAKER_03]: figure out what I was like.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we were just like the Canadians,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the Canadians were wearing their red
and white shirts and rolling around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody was having so much fun in the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like so refreshing where you don't
have to like feel like outcasts and black
[SPEAKER_03]: sheep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're running around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's like, oh, man, here,
go to this head shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to like this this flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: If this is what you're interested in,
try this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God, the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I first got real hash, like real hash from
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's nothing like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like nobody's.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anybody is making anything like
this, they ain't giving it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was only like 18, 19, 20 maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I certainly wasn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got some good chronic.
[SPEAKER_03]: The weakest hyena.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the chronic in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you found it and it was all like
you said, coming from Nepal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was coming from Morocco and it would be
blonde or even even the dark stuff was so
[SPEAKER_03]: good and you would barely get any and it
would last you so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, just trying to figure
out seeing the bubble man and then seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: people with the washing machines and
seeing people with the straighteners and
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing people smash everything and then
people coming up with all sorts of cool
[SPEAKER_03]: ideas on ways to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's changed, you know, people using the
ember.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the first time I saw someone with
like a hot rod, you know, a hot stick
[SPEAKER_03]: connected to a, you know, a plug and
you're smoking weed without a flame.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and the volcano came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like, oh, this is like there
were so many different things changing
[SPEAKER_03]: around that time, right, around 2000,
2000.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really cool and really awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just glad that it's still progressing
and we're not being stagnant.
[SPEAKER_04]: All these new oils, all the new oils
stimulate new smoking products and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: just a full circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was just talking to Ben from
Rosensek because I was asking,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, is there any reason why you'd
make THCA besides just kind of to show
[SPEAKER_01]: either I want to get really fucked up or
just to show people that you can do
[SPEAKER_01]: something that I don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that the process is insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never even attempted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you seen the little white rocks,
the little THCA rocks?
[SPEAKER_03]: You basically are going to take this again
and you're going to repress this at a
[SPEAKER_03]: higher temperature and you actually have
to cut the bag open, scoop shit out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I ain't got time for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to take my red wine and turn
it into something any better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm really, I'm really happy with my
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need to go that far down the
rabbit hole, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it done and I've looked into the
research on it and I've seen some other
[SPEAKER_01]: people do it, but I've also seen- I feel
like people do it just to get super fucked
[SPEAKER_01]: up, not because it's like- How much more
fucked up can you get?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just smoke two dabs of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's my point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm wondering why people do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just to show other people that they
can do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see any benefit to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see any- It's technology,
it's a fun topper for your smokeable
[SPEAKER_04]: product.
[SPEAKER_04]: People like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nice, pure, pure product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's the yurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yurt's back there, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's my baby's yurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you mentioned the yurt, I was like,
sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a yurt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen, yeah, I've seen really
interesting new derivatives of hash now
[SPEAKER_04]: from the whitest white powder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the black to white.
[SPEAKER_04]: In every form and every grade.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm making this, before I turned it
into this color or this consistency,
[SPEAKER_03]: I could probably cut the top part off,
all of the turps and save all the white
[SPEAKER_03]: underneath and it would be a completely
different smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, I like it all together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know what I'm trying to say?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that mixture of everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like even with THC diamonds or
anything- Do you know how to turn these
[SPEAKER_03]: into diamonds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, you're going to put it back
in another bag into about a 15 micron bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd give it a go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 15 micron bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're going to repress it
hotter.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've heard that actually you start at
a super low temp first or something like
[SPEAKER_03]: that, like a hundred degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you press and then you gradually
increase it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys keep talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go visit the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to do a dab please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please feel free.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this rig.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is fucking very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me clean that actually real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to grab that butane real
quick?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mind hot, hot, you know,
dabs too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really get a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Extra chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you certainly are.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are our vape tool products that I've
been making for like 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I designed these or stamp them out of
steel and they're great for packing bowls,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, for, they're just great for
packing bowls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just come up with ideas and I'm
like, that's our next product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just go for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: No worries, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about necessity, you know,
I never would have thought I'd be making
[SPEAKER_04]: these bags ever in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, never in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I'd be making hash bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not since you were a small boy,
you had this dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but it's a wonderful, like,
you know, people depend on me for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people get pissed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'd say I'd stop making them because
I don't make a lot of money doing them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I tell people and they get mad.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we just try to keep it
alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great, you know, thing that people
need still.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I enjoy being in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've literally been in the cannabis world
for over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big part of the community I do
not like.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a community I do like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, luckily I've got, you know,
I know the best people and really good
[SPEAKER_04]: people in this business.
[SPEAKER_04]: But after 20 years, you know, you learn a
few things, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes not the easy way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it costs you a friendship or a
couple of bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, you just try to remain
positive is the main thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've found people get greedy in this
business.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's sort of one thing that sort of
kills it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, people get a little too greedy
sometimes when they should just sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: like just sit back and try to be part of
the big picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, when you're building
something like Pepsi Cola, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like, you can be part of,
you know, like when you're building
[SPEAKER_04]: something big.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cannabis business is full of a lot of
different stories, something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear a lot of stories, especially with
the legalization now too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I've had people burn me
like.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still a gangster business basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe the robberies go on like
they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people just like breaking and
smashing and grabbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're so tight knit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually you're going to get caught anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of desperate people out
there still.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they always get caught.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would you, you'd basically dry
that next?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be dried or you just let it sit in
the sun or just got to get the water
[SPEAKER_04]: content.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wait, this gets by.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember if I asked the question,
but if you let this sit out in the sun
[SPEAKER_01]: here in LA, how long would you like it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one day?
[SPEAKER_04]: A week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like give it a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd say it's pretty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's a hundred degrees out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not even a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could smoke it tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can smoke it right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I put it like.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably smoke it tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll make a nice ball.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you ever straight press that?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because it's going to be water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you squish that and there's water
left in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The steam comes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it'll literally squirt out the
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just got to dehydrate the water out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't do a hyper fast drying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_04]: The freeze dryer is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you can't press fresh flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to wait for flour to dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before you can actually do flour rosin.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to dry it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That definitely looks delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be good tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smells good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love making ash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely love discuss getting a big
bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Made a custom one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can do that for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We we just did these 180 gallon bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's huge.
Huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like did we talk about what the biggest
size 180 gallons.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just did 180.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like trying to think of what that
would even look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's just a big tank.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like the size of that couch
cushion right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, it's a big tank.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not too big.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they have an agitator in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: An agitator goes up on top.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did this for a good friend up in the
hills.
[SPEAKER_04]: So humble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's got a company.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's still massive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We love we love doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but so did I ask the question where
it's like we yielded like oh the
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Traditionally like when you're going for
for on volume depends on the strains of
[SPEAKER_04]: course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had strains that pump flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like two percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like why does a strawberry banana
just squirt out so much rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that because of the GMO GMO eight
percent seven percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like what every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really hard to find oh geez that
produce at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thankfully my Wi-Fi does like a five
percent which is is still really good for
[SPEAKER_03]: an OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually you're happy with four but you're
not going to be making much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's my question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there diminishing returns the larger
you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he says I don't believe so.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Traditionally making hash like you got a
pound of hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean a pound of weed or trim.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get about 30 percent yield
sometimes 20 to 30 percent dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's dry you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get that much hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need that exact return.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then this more refined product.
[SPEAKER_04]: It all depends on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to weigh out potency versus
flavor and and just work your way through.
[SPEAKER_04]: And work your way into the best quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like 20 percent average I'd say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 20 percent average.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on dry flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you cut down and it's wet we
do five times ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like a pound of flour is forty four
hundred fifty grams roughly or fifty four
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I do a pound of fresh frozen
it's twenty two fifty.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's five times that amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why we that's how we roll that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you get a four percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you do four times five that's 20
percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're hoping for those 20 percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything more is a lot of icing on the
cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for some reason like he said those
strawberry bananas those those GMOs
[SPEAKER_03]: there's some strange the cookies and
cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're pumping six to eight percent
repetitively over and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what people are making the most
hash out of obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only problem is just keeping a
consistent supply.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finding trim again is a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is definitely a consistency problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you just got to.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wash in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to wash in a forty four.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing it a thirty two.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my bag is a fifty because I can't
actually find a bag that'll fit a thirty
[SPEAKER_03]: forty four.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not six feet long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said go on our website.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to find them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go on bull bags dot com.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I'll send you some later.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so I wash I wash roughly and I wash in
a big bag with no light like my big bag is
[SPEAKER_03]: my work back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just washing directly in that I tie
it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put a slipknot on it and I have a hoist
and I pull it straight out of the trash
[SPEAKER_03]: can and let it hang like you did.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The hoist is a great way just to wrap it
in the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just hoist it straight up pull my bucket
of water out and then I dump into 10
[SPEAKER_03]: gallons.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do 10 gallons and I use ice extracts
bags right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I use the same exact what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use 40 and then I go from 40 to 179.
[SPEAKER_03]: My I have I wash in a 220 then I dump into
another 220 to clean that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my 180 to 219 I throw that like
just to the side too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just like you know hash for bong
loads or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I my my full spec that I press is 40 to
179.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like the best heads are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah it's all about the precious heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the precious heads are there you're
going to get them if it's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean I look at trim every day and it's
amazing under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's either there or it's not there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just fucking fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact also is our eyes are getting
any better as we get older.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen even the other technique where
people are just putting a couple of nugs
[SPEAKER_03]: in a mason jar with ice and water shaking
it up and just holding it you know to the
[SPEAKER_03]: sunlight scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there enough sand down in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it worth running this crop test.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are also you know be innovative.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know be be.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also a little frugal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know so you're not you're not wasting
a bunch of product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what end consistency do you guys
speculate that's going to look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to look like one of these two
because it's a trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all full fresh nugs and this is
only even dark because it's been in here
[SPEAKER_03]: for two months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah it'll be in this color range.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah after it's pressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in all honesty it's funny how it might
look darker here but once you dry it and
[SPEAKER_03]: you put it in a freeze dryer it comes way
lighter.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you press it then it turns
yellow and you're like oh crap cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah everything's darker when it's wet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll be honest when I press these they
came out super dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were almost like like black.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then after a week of curing and
whipping they start to look very nice and
[SPEAKER_03]: they start to look like this consistency.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're extremely delicious to smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's unanimous agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well thank you for having us come over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pleasure to meet you man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks Peter.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Josh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you should do a yurt tour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might as well do the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for having me.
Thank you for having me.
