[SPEAKER_01]: In California, we're about to launch upon
a very regulated market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've had medical cannabis for the last
over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've been cultivating cannabis in
the state of California, hopefully you've
[SPEAKER_01]: been operating as a nonprofit collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a particular business
corporate organizational structure and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of financial model that one needs to
follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing that I always recommend
to folks who are growers, people are
[SPEAKER_01]: operating under this nonprofit collective
model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why that matters is because none of this
is fully regulated today.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of these businesses are not fully
legalized commercial cannabis activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't really launch until January
1st, 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even on that day, we're still under a
transitionary period.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I sort of think about it like
businesses are operating, growers are
[SPEAKER_01]: operating in a quasi legal environment
where your legality is hinged upon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you this not for profit collective
cooperative sort of business or entity
[SPEAKER_01]: structure, which creates a solid sort of
step one foundation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So step one, get compliant now,
make sure that you're operating and that
[SPEAKER_01]: your operations are in order now so that
one can comfortably interface with their
[SPEAKER_01]: local county and various other agencies
and departments, both on a local and state
[SPEAKER_01]: level to pursue what is ultimately a state
license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So visually, it's sort of like we're going
on where you're going down a road.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're taking a path.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, you're not on any sort of,
you know, it's as if you're out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: desert and you're just we've been just
sort of driving around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once in a while you see like you see
dirt roads and that's today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you want to be is if you're a grower
envisioning what type of cultivation state
[SPEAKER_01]: license do I want?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so maybe going on the California
Department of Food and Ag website and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's Cal Cannabis Licensing,
which is that agency and looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm an outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: My canopy size, I would like it to be this
amount or is some amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I want that type of state license at
the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I want to land at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this collective tomorrow model that
I've been operating under today,
[SPEAKER_01]: this nonprofit collective model sunsets,
meaning you need to have your nonprofit
[SPEAKER_01]: collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to actually be on the commercial
cannabis regulated market with that state
[SPEAKER_01]: license and local permit and everything
that involves that, you know, we'll speak
[SPEAKER_01]: about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I need to land because a year
after the state issues notice of the first
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis license, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The state says, yep, we've issued our
first official license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe somewhere around 2019,
2020, you can no longer operate as just a
[SPEAKER_01]: nonprofit collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have both a local permit and a
state license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for anyone who is cultivating cannabis
today in California, it really is about
[SPEAKER_01]: getting very clear on what are the steps
that take takes you to that state license
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to operate in the regulated
legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it really, you know, while it's not
always fun to sit down and have very
[SPEAKER_01]: involved conversations with lawyers and
accountants and your business partners or
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself about the the this type of kind
of strategic thinking in a very
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging, you know, still being firmed
up set of rules and regulations from
[SPEAKER_01]: different agencies type of an environment,
but those sorts of very intentional like
[SPEAKER_01]: meetings amongst partners or as a grower
oneself, making sure, okay, I know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: need.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an idea of where I want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then taking the steps to get you there
is really critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, when I see people who
are really kind of confused about what
[SPEAKER_01]: those next steps are, the you know,
it's it's getting clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a yeah, I guess it's trying to help
get them organized and getting clear on
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just try to think about like
really practical advice because you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: laws that are in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have shifting laws that are still kind
of being figured out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, how does one organize?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does one plan in in, you know,
these really next six months, year and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half, two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best way of doing that is sitting
down and figuring out what's knowable,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's not knowable and almost
backtracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, if I want that state license,
then I know that I'll need to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that involves something with the State
Water Board and with the Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish and Wildlife and these various
agencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, geez, here's here's what's required to
the CDFA that I prove in order to even
[SPEAKER_01]: apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh, it says I need to have this
particular type of corporate entity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me read these regulations that say
how I need to operate my facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: what this new track and trace system is,
what the state taxes are, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, gosh, what are all the taxes that are
involved?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a large majority of people who are
cultivating cannabis in California and
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly people that, you know,
we've worked with over the years are are
[SPEAKER_01]: are not familiar with all of those state
regulatory agencies and are not,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, certainly not familiar because
we've not had such a thing with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what does track and trace mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: What will it mean to function in a very
regulated environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead of turning your head away from
I just don't want to look at that because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's all new and confusing and not what
I'm used to for the last 20 years or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, turning and looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, it takes a level of courage,
you know, to look at, OK, this is what I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to take that leap and get some good
information and then take a move and take
[SPEAKER_01]: those steps forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it really is kind of like
crystallizing those steps as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, once you think in the
world of the state regulators,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, you know, you've got federal
law, state law and then local,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cities, counties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where is my where is my facility
located if it's an indoor grow facility or
[SPEAKER_01]: an outdoor in what city or county in
California?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are five hundred and forty total
separate local jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do I need in my area?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there are five hundred and forty
total municipalities in the state of
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll need to have a permit from that
city or county.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in order to get that type of a
permit, there are a number of items that
[SPEAKER_01]: will almost surely be required.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you in the right zone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it does the city or county require that
your outdoor facility be in a particular
[SPEAKER_01]: type of ag land?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you're an indoor grower,
is it allowable in a certain manufacturing
[SPEAKER_01]: area or not at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a challenge that many,
many operators are facing and many
[SPEAKER_01]: interested operators or entrepreneurs are
facing, which is still a vast majority of
[SPEAKER_01]: these cities and counties have no pathway
to permitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have their zoning rules figured
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have the business permitting
process figured out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the nature of being
involved in an emerging industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on that front, what percentage of the
cultivators that you work with are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: everything right as it pertains to state
regulations, but are kind of going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: screwed by their local.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is most cities and counties
are still in their local political
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of you know, it just is honestly by
virtue of the nature of regulating a
[SPEAKER_01]: really bohemoth of an industry and having
a very thriving industry for the last 20
[SPEAKER_01]: plus years and most cities and counties,
they're little political kingdoms
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of those 540 cities and counties has
their own local politics and their own
[SPEAKER_01]: issues and their own ways of looking at
this industry and other, other things to
[SPEAKER_01]: factor in that make it more challenging or
very easy, like a desert hot springs and
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these desert cities that very much
need the revenue from this industry or
[SPEAKER_01]: established counties like Mendocino or
Humvee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got cities and counties
who are saying, we've had a very
[SPEAKER_01]: contentious relationship with this
industry or we don't know what any of this
[SPEAKER_01]: means.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then, you know, you're seeing a lot
of local advocacy, um, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: at city, at city council meetings,
at council meetings, and so forth.
And then you've got cities and counties
who are saying, we've had a very
contentious relationship with this
industry or we don't know what any of this
means.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got cities and counties
who are saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, this is not scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state has passed a sense comprehensive
set of laws with the medical and adult use
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis regulation and safety act.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't freak out municipalities.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are all these state
agencies that will deal with the really
[SPEAKER_01]: meat of these issues and your role,
which cities and counties, this is their
[SPEAKER_01]: role is really just to deal with zoning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where in the city or county do you want
what particular types of categories of
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, that manufacturing,
cultivation, distribution in what areas?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's, we're really in a process of
education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of our clients don't have local
permits.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are trying to figure out,
or they are in the process of applying
[SPEAKER_01]: for, or through various strategies,
depending on the municipalities are,
[SPEAKER_01]: are moving in that direction or are in
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's, it's a, it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the challenges of what we are
facing right now.
Okay.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
