[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Dr. Cole Marta.
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to medical school in Chicago and I
did a residency at UCLA VA program,
[SPEAKER_05]: did a lot of work with people with PTSD,
knew about MAPS from actually a really
[SPEAKER_05]: long time ago and sort of caught back up
with them when I was in medical school and
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of been sort of making my big life
choices based on trying to align my
[SPEAKER_05]: direction of my ship with the direction of
MAPS' ship and we collided.
[SPEAKER_05]: It worked.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I graduated from residency 2015.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been in private practice doing
actually primarily ketamine for depression
[SPEAKER_05]: and the opportunity to be involved in the
MAPS MDMA for PTSD research has been sort
[SPEAKER_05]: of the dream since 2010 I've been actively
pursuing trying to get a site here in Los
[SPEAKER_05]: Angeles and my goal is for to get as many
people involved and to make Los Angeles
[SPEAKER_05]: specifically like an epicenter for the
psychedelic movement in medicine and
[SPEAKER_05]: anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Ashley Booth.
Hi.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll do a quick little recap like you did.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I used to be an oceanographer for nine
years.
[SPEAKER_13]: I worked in marine science and
environmental work and about five or six
[SPEAKER_13]: years ago I had some pretty big
experiences with some of the things that
[SPEAKER_13]: we've been talking about here and really
shifted my perspective and got me
[SPEAKER_13]: interested in advocacy and educational
work around psychedelics and drug policy.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I started a psychedelic society called
the AWARE Project Rethinking Psychedelics
[SPEAKER_13]: and we have been running monthly events
for the last three years here in Los
[SPEAKER_13]: Angeles.
[SPEAKER_13]: We also have a sister organization called
the Inner Space Integration which is a
[SPEAKER_13]: integration support program for people who
have had big psychedelic experiences and
[SPEAKER_13]: need help coming and organizing their
thoughts around what kind of came up for
[SPEAKER_13]: them during their experience.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have monthly integration circles all
around the city for that.
[SPEAKER_13]: And through my work with the AWARE Project
I got connected to COLE and MAPS and we
[SPEAKER_13]: did a couple of friend registers for MAPS
and then I got invited to come be the
[SPEAKER_13]: study coordinator for the clinical trial
of MDMA psychotherapy for the treatment of
[SPEAKER_13]: PTSD.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm thrilled to be part of the team and
we just opened enrollment for our phase
[SPEAKER_13]: three clinical trials last week.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we finally opened phase three.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is huge.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's huge and I'm also switching careers
and getting a master's in social work now
[SPEAKER_13]: just like Natalie to become a therapist
and eventually get on the team.
[SPEAKER_13]: She is on the team.
[SPEAKER_13]: I am on the team but be a therapist on the
team.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a job waiting for her to get her
credential.
[SPEAKER_13]: So waiting for me to come graduate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And phase three, does everybody know the
significance of phase three as opposed to
[SPEAKER_05]: phase seven or one?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you tell us the phases?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in psychiatry in particular phase one,
two, three.
[SPEAKER_05]: Phase one, this is FDA research
specifically.
[SPEAKER_05]: How a drug goes from an idea to on the
market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Phase one is that you first have to
demonstrate that the drug is safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's given to healthy volunteers.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where a lot of the research was
done sort of for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: For people interested in researching MDMA
and cannabis because there was so much
[SPEAKER_05]: money spent exploring the dangers that a
lot of that data was already there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then phase two is the first time you
apply your actual theory.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we think it's gonna be helpful for
this particular condition.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to take people with this
condition and who have typically run out
[SPEAKER_05]: of other options and give them this
potential new treatment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So usually it's double blind, placebo
controlled.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's the first time you get to see
whether this idea holds any water.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were a handful of phase two trials
actually done all sponsored by MAPS for
[SPEAKER_05]: MDMA.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is psychotherapy for PTSD.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then phase three is when you try to
show that that wasn't just like a lucky
[SPEAKER_05]: occurrence in one place or something
unique to in this case like South Carolina
[SPEAKER_05]: where the first study was done.
[SPEAKER_05]: That it's something you can expand that
you also part of phase three is having a
[SPEAKER_05]: plan in place to actually provide all of
that drug to the market should it come to
[SPEAKER_05]: market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we don't wanna go through all this
trouble and then nobody will manufacture
[SPEAKER_05]: MDMA and everybody's waiting around.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where we're at.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in the very last step.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like phase three is we're showing that it
can be done not just in one place.
[SPEAKER_05]: The results are amazing in the phase two
data.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then yeah, so phase three is I think
we have 14 locations, 12 or 14 locations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Los Angeles is one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, we're gonna see I think like 200
people in total.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna do actually two phase three
studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: But essentially if we can reproduce the
data even close to what we did with phase
[SPEAKER_05]: two, it's gonna be an available drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like it's right at the finish line.
[SPEAKER_10]: And following up on what you said.
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_10]: But following up on what you said that
somebody's gotta build it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You said there's already an infrastructure
in place for the production of MDMA.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you tell us more about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: What you're allowed to disclose?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a contract between MAPS and a
particular drug manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure the name of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something druggy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like MAPS says everything on our website.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has to be made by something called
good manufacturing practices.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the place manufacturing the drug,
if it's gonna be available to a broad
[SPEAKER_05]: market, it has to meet all of these
standards of the FDA.
[SPEAKER_05]: So up until phase three, because you don't
know if it's really gonna work out or not,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not as important.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for phase three, you have to have a
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to be made in the same way it's
going to be made and has to be
[SPEAKER_05]: manufactured in a place that's up to FDA
standards.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was actually a big adventure
itself.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'll jump in and just say a little bit
more about phase three, which was that
[SPEAKER_13]: it's kind of unique in MAPS applying to do
phase three because they went to the FDA
[SPEAKER_13]: and they said, okay, we wanna do one
study.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're gonna do one with around 200 people
to show efficacy for this drug.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the FDA was like, we've never seen a
phase three trial that just has one study
[SPEAKER_13]: with so few people.
[SPEAKER_13]: But because the effect size, meaning most
drugs, it's a very small effect size in
[SPEAKER_13]: terms of seeing if it makes a difference
or not.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so they have to have a very large
number of people, thousands of people
[SPEAKER_13]: typically, to see if that is a significant
effect size.
[SPEAKER_13]: But because our effect size is so big,
we need such a smaller number of people.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, for the phase two clinical trials,
it's between 60 to 80% of people after
[SPEAKER_13]: three rounds of MDMA-sensitive
psychotherapy did not qualify for PTSD
[SPEAKER_13]: afterwards, after three sessions.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's huge.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so anyway, MAPS went back to the FDA
and said, okay, well, we're not gonna do
[SPEAKER_13]: one study then.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're gonna do two studies, but with 100
each.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's basically the same number of
people, but they made it into two studies
[SPEAKER_13]: and they were like, okay, we'll approve
that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a little funny that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm wondering if one of you guys can maybe
talk about what the MDMA therapy looks
[SPEAKER_11]: like, because we're seeing these three
sessions and stuff, but walking people
[SPEAKER_11]: through the whole process of MDMA therapy.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a specific protocol that we go
through, that we take all of our
[SPEAKER_13]: participants through.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's several screening criteria
that everyone has to meet for them to be
[SPEAKER_13]: safe, to be able to enter into the trial.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they take lots of different kinds of
tests.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so then they have three preparation
meetings with a co-therapy team.
[SPEAKER_13]: So each participant is paired up with two
a male and female co-therapy teams.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's not your typical individual
therapy, but you're actually working with
[SPEAKER_13]: a pair.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we recently changed, so it's not only
male and female to be more inclusive of
[SPEAKER_11]: all the genders, but it traditionally has
been male, female.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's like a new.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that official?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a change?
[SPEAKER_05]: We can have female, female therapy teams?
[SPEAKER_11]: We have female, female teams.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, we'll have to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So the participants go through three
preparation sessions, which is about an
[SPEAKER_13]: hour and a half sessions.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then one month apart, they have an
all-day MDMA experience with their
[SPEAKER_13]: co-therapy team.
[SPEAKER_13]: And these are spaced one month apart with
three integration sessions between them.
[SPEAKER_13]: So in all, they're getting three
preparation, then an MDMA, then three
[SPEAKER_13]: integration, then an MDMA, three
integration.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the whole protocol takes about
four months.
[SPEAKER_13]: Screening time can vary a little bit,
but it's a very efficient therapy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it's a big time investment.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's important to communicate that
it's a therapy model.
[SPEAKER_05]: The MDMA certainly is a powerful part of
the whole picture, but the therapy model
[SPEAKER_05]: is the reason for all of those visits.
[SPEAKER_05]: The MDMA sort of supercharges the therapy
in a way.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a trusting and a bonding between
the therapists and the participants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm guessing that that's what happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is just much, much harder to achieve
without that particular aid.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for people who are talking about the
worst thing that's ever happened to them,
[SPEAKER_05]: it takes a lot of trust and a lot of
bonding and a lot of trust primarily.
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of the things that makes this so
effective is that therapy.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because in the integration work that I do
through interspace integration,
[SPEAKER_13]: we see that people that have experimented
either recreational with these things or
[SPEAKER_13]: maybe done underground therapy,
that they're not getting either any
[SPEAKER_13]: integration, any preparation, or not
enough.
[SPEAKER_13]: And people either are just not prepared
for what can come up for them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so having it in this context creates
such a level of safety, especially with
[SPEAKER_13]: people that have severe trauma,
really makes this very effective.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to ask you to elaborate on the
preparation and the integration.
[SPEAKER_10]: What does it look like if you're a
patient?
[SPEAKER_10]: What does it feel like?
[SPEAKER_05]: The preparation and integration visits are
going to look very similar, but obviously
[SPEAKER_05]: at different points in the process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our particular study room,
it doesn't look like a hospital room.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cozy, it's inviting.
[SPEAKER_05]: The therapist pairs usually dress pretty
casual like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first three sessions are getting
to know each other, building a rapport,
[SPEAKER_05]: building a relationship.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talking about boundaries and talking
about, at some point, talking about the
[SPEAKER_05]: trauma itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the integration can be,
and those are about 90 minute visits.
[SPEAKER_05]: After the MDMA sessions, the integration
can really vary as far as what comes up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be about what came up in the
medicine session itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be about what's continuing to
unfold.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the days afterward or in an attempt to
apply insights into their real life.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can really be all over the place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the therapy model is very
non-directive or participant directed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not telling people what to do or
what's the right way to think about what
[SPEAKER_05]: happened to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, that would be the exact opposite
of what we're supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not interpreting for them or
steering it in any particular direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times what comes up for people is
not what they expected to come up.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of times what may be a very healing
experience to have isn't what they thought
[SPEAKER_05]: it was going to be when they went in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's just supporting what's,
the therapists are trying to support
[SPEAKER_05]: what's happening naturally for the
participant in whatever way that requires.
[SPEAKER_10]: And can you tell us about the all day
therapy session with the medicine?
[SPEAKER_10]: What is the dosage?
[SPEAKER_10]: What is it like for participants?
[SPEAKER_10]: My experience is limited to, I guess,
the night club ecstasy context with people
[SPEAKER_10]: rolling.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody's rolling at these things,
are they?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not sure what the typical night
club dose is supposed to be, but I'd guess
[SPEAKER_05]: around 100 milligrams or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: More than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: More than that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: So somebody pays like 20 bucks for a pill
at a party.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're expecting.
[SPEAKER_13]: Up to 300.
[SPEAKER_13]: 300 milligrams?
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a lot.
Wow.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to answer the question, yeah,
don't do 300 milligrams of empty
[SPEAKER_13]: maintenance.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's too much.
Anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when they first come in, there's just
general orientation to the room and review
[SPEAKER_05]: of what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they take 120 milligrams in the study
that we most recently did and a potential
[SPEAKER_05]: booster of 60 milligrams after 90 minutes
or 90 minutes to two hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: We check in with them and there's a
potential booster of 50% more has been
[SPEAKER_05]: consistent through all of the studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's varied from 100 to start with a
50 booster.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were some dose finding studies
specifically, but yeah, that's pretty much
[SPEAKER_05]: where it's.
[SPEAKER_11]: People almost always take the extra,
right, in your experience?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's the default.
[SPEAKER_05]: The default is that people take the bonus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, there's.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've had a participant that
didn't take it one time, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the time they do.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say something that's really unique
about the therapy is, as Dr. Mardo was
[SPEAKER_11]: describing, it's really not directed by
the therapist.
[SPEAKER_11]: So therapists often invite the participant
to go inside and put on a blindfold and
[SPEAKER_11]: listen to music.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's often how this process starts.
[SPEAKER_11]: And sometimes the session is like four to
six hours long.
[SPEAKER_11]: And sometimes hours of that session,
people are just listening to music,
[SPEAKER_11]: lying down with the blindfold on.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I've had the privilege of watching
videos of people like Dr. Mardo doing the
[SPEAKER_11]: therapy.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's amazing to watch people
literally, they'll be lying there,
[SPEAKER_11]: moving their bodies, releasing stuff,
crying, laughing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes they'll sit up all of a sudden
and take it off and want to start
[SPEAKER_11]: speaking.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's just really such varied ways that
they're processing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then after that is over, spending the
night sleeping over is a really nice piece
[SPEAKER_11]: of a way to close it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I know people always say to me,
after doing MDMA, I have the worst down
[SPEAKER_11]: the next day.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel terrible, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: And in our studies, we really haven't seen
that happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do suspect when people are telling
that to me, they're also drinking and
[SPEAKER_11]: partying all night and then go back to
work on Monday.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's some other things in play.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I do think in our studies,
when people have a really nourishing
[SPEAKER_11]: dinner, spend the night in this space,
have another session in the morning with
[SPEAKER_11]: the therapist, it kind of closes it out
and creates a container that I don't know
[SPEAKER_11]: if you guys have seen it, but I certainly
don't hear of people having those down
[SPEAKER_11]: after MDMA experiences in our studies.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's maybe a little hard to tell if
they're having a down or not because
[SPEAKER_13]: they're going through a really emotional
process.
[SPEAKER_13]: So even if there wasn't a down from the
MDMA, it would be kind of hard to tell
[SPEAKER_13]: because they're processing, as Cole said,
the worst thing that's happened in their
[SPEAKER_13]: lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's hard work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's not easy to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I applaud the people that have the
courage to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they really are addressing the worst
thing that's ever happened to them in a
[SPEAKER_05]: very face-to-face kind of way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's very common for there to be a lot
of ups and downs, especially after the
[SPEAKER_05]: first experience, the first of the three.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or actually, the first where there's a big
confrontation of the trauma.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes I've seen, I've watched a lot of
videos, too, as part of our training.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes the first session, people are a
little more reluctant to open up still.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes, again, a lot of trust and a lot
of safety, a feeling of safety.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's hard to judge whether that
day after thing is something that we're
[SPEAKER_05]: actually seeing clinically because there
are so many things that could explain any
[SPEAKER_05]: state after any session.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really is a continuingly unfolding
process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once they're engaged in the treatment,
they need a lot of support both when
[SPEAKER_05]: they're at their visits and when they're
not at their visits because, again,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're confronting something that,
by definition, I mean, it's part of the
[SPEAKER_05]: description of PTSD as a syndrome that
it's something they avoid dealing with.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it can be kind of erratic,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess I have so many questions.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is very fascinating for me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you thought about doing longer-term
studies?
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you considered that?
[SPEAKER_05]: For the first, there's been efforts to get
longer-term data as far as how the
[SPEAKER_05]: effects, good or bad, maintain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe the first study that was
done, there was a follow-up a long-term
[SPEAKER_05]: follow-up and it varied based on when
people had entered the study.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the most part, the changes are
sustained long after.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the average duration or the
average time period after the last session
[SPEAKER_05]: in the particular study I'm thinking of
was like two and a half years was the
[SPEAKER_05]: average amount of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people like eight years since they
stopped their sessions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the majority of people, I don't
remember the exact numbers, but the
[SPEAKER_05]: majority of people having maintained the
benefits that they had.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some people are actually having
better.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I was gonna say, which I think
is really important about our work.
[SPEAKER_11]: As you were saying before, it's like this
process and framework.
[SPEAKER_11]: So because of that, the results are often
better further out from the study.
[SPEAKER_11]: Immediately after, people also don't call
five for PTSD, but then months later,
[SPEAKER_11]: their PTSD score decreases and then the
long-term follow-up study that Dr. Marta
[SPEAKER_11]: is referring to also bore that out,
which is just unheard of and other kinds
[SPEAKER_11]: of psychiatric interventions.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and in a way, what we're doing and
how different this is from typical
[SPEAKER_13]: pharmaceuticals is that instead of masking
symptoms, we're really getting to the core
[SPEAKER_13]: of what people are feeling and the pain
that they're feeling and the suffering and
[SPEAKER_13]: addressing that directly.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you're also kind of teaching people
how to heal themselves.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I think that may be kind of what's
contributing to the sustained and even
[SPEAKER_13]: long-term continued improvement because
you've started to teach people how to
[SPEAKER_13]: address all the feelings that have come
that they've been kind of suppressing and
[SPEAKER_13]: allowing them to teach them how to bring
them up in a healthy way and to be able to
[SPEAKER_13]: process them in a manageable way.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this part you bring about kind
of self-healing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to bring this concept of inner
healing intelligence or inner healer,
[SPEAKER_11]: which is something that the MAPS framework
speaks about a lot and introduces to the
[SPEAKER_11]: people we're working with to kind of have
that concept of listening to your inner
[SPEAKER_11]: healer and what that means for you to lead
the healing process yourself and not to
[SPEAKER_11]: come from somewhere external.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_10]: So set and setting are very important for
the psychedelic experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm thinking back to my experiences
with ecstasy back in law school.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like we would always take vitamin C
because I don't know if it was actually
[SPEAKER_10]: the real deal, but it's supposed to
heighten the experience and maybe reduce
[SPEAKER_10]: the crash effect.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you do anything like that to prepare
people for the experience?
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have anything specific.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want people to take care of themselves
prior to coming in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have refreshments and snacks
available on hand, general self-care
[SPEAKER_05]: items.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we don't have any particular regimens,
I think, for a number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the context of a study like this,
you don't want to add any possible sort
[SPEAKER_05]: of...
[SPEAKER_10]: Introduce variables?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly, variables.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the word, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to add any additional
variables that somebody could point to and
[SPEAKER_05]: say, oh, well, maybe it's the vitamin C
that makes everybody better.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to control as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: We try to take people off of all of their
psychiatric medications.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are a couple things on hand in
case of emergencies.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, we don't have any particular
regimens we recommend before or after.
[SPEAKER_13]: And just to step back a little bit for
people who don't know what set and setting
[SPEAKER_13]: is.
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a phrase that was coined in the 60s
as these things were coming into a public
[SPEAKER_13]: forefront.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the idea is that your set is your
mindset.
[SPEAKER_13]: So whatever you're kind of coming in with,
whether it's trauma or how your day was,
[SPEAKER_13]: that's what you're bringing into the
space.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then setting is your context that
you're doing the experience in.
[SPEAKER_13]: So psychedelics seem to kind of make you a
little bit more permeable to whatever is
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of going on underneath in your
internal system, but also what's going on
[SPEAKER_13]: externally.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so the idea is that we're trying to,
at least in the studies, make sure that
[SPEAKER_13]: we're helping support people in both from
that psychological perspective,
[SPEAKER_13]: but also creating a comfortable and safe
container for them to experience whatever
[SPEAKER_13]: they're experiencing.
[SPEAKER_13]: And MAPS has another program called the
Zendo Project, which Cole and I have,
[SPEAKER_13]: and you've volunteered, too, where I've
all been volunteers for the Zendo Project,
[SPEAKER_13]: which is a psychedelic harm reduction.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can, too.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can, too.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a psychedelic harm reduction
nonprofit that, is it its own nonprofit?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, okay.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like having you here for my fact
checking.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they provide services at festivals for
people that have had a big experience or
[SPEAKER_13]: in midst of a big experience, and they
create a safe container for people to calm
[SPEAKER_13]: down a little bit, get some nourishment,
stay warm, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so they have volunteers that are
medical professionals, mental health
[SPEAKER_13]: professionals, and just anyone
volunteering that can help support people
[SPEAKER_13]: in these spaces so that we're making sure
that these people are getting help and
[SPEAKER_13]: then that they don't necessarily have to
go to the med tent or get picked up by the
[SPEAKER_13]: police just because they're tripping too
hard.
[SPEAKER_13]: And their friends bailed on them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And their friends bailed on them.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they end up having a really traumatic
experience.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and then you're creating more
traumatic experiences.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so many things that I've experienced
sitting and doing the Zendo Project and
[SPEAKER_13]: also heard so many more experiences that
having that container with a person that
[SPEAKER_13]: can compassionately listen to you really
can change a very challenging experience
[SPEAKER_13]: into something that they find actually
that it was very insight and influential.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a really great project.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I highly recommend checking it out.
[SPEAKER_11]: And a lot of psychedelic therapists
definitely have experience.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a really interesting opportunity
for people to sit in a legal context with
[SPEAKER_11]: people and learn how to then be legal
psychedelic therapists.
[SPEAKER_05]: I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really awesome experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody interested and who has that kind
of, if you're oriented that way towards
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to help people in crisis like that,
it's a really great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And meet really awesome people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a peer support service.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's access to medical if things were
more difficult or complicated.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's a peer support service.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it changes a lot of people's
lives, really.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people who end up in there
instead of being arrested.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or getting tranquilized.
[SPEAKER_05]: One less person who's in a PTSD study.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of them, a lot of people who
have come in as guests of the Zendo have
[SPEAKER_05]: come back as volunteers there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just a really cool community.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just want to prep everybody out here.
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to make this a little bit
participatory.
[SPEAKER_18]: So if anybody has any questions or
comments, we got the back.
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you guys come maybe up?
[SPEAKER_12]: So my understanding is that MDMA was
originally concocted to help therapists
[SPEAKER_12]: connect more with their patients.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was wondering if you can speak to that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if there's any studies coming up that
kind of integrates the therapist into the
[SPEAKER_12]: experience as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a cool idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as I know, there isn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe you know something I don't.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know MDMA was actually developed by
Merck, a pharmaceutical company,
[SPEAKER_11]: in 1912.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was developed to be like a blood
coagulant or something.
[SPEAKER_11]: It had nothing to do with therapy.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it kind of reemerged with Sasha
Shulgin.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's still unclear to me how he knew that
chemical of all the chemicals that he's
[SPEAKER_11]: worked on might be helpful to therapists.
[SPEAKER_11]: But then I think that's maybe what you're
thinking of.
[SPEAKER_11]: That it was first introduced.
[SPEAKER_11]: Among therapists, it wasn't first a party
drug.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was first given literally by this
chemist to therapists across the country
[SPEAKER_11]: saying, why don't you try this with your
clients?
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's how it kind of spread.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't go through the process we're
going through now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it wasn't illegal yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was just sort of like Shulgin was a
respected, brilliant person who had doctor
[SPEAKER_05]: friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I could imagine that it could have
been used in that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually a lot of the therapists that
received MDMA and used it in those early
[SPEAKER_05]: days I think primarily did couples
therapy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of that is sort of seeped into
the way that we are trained now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the male-female therapy team
came from a model that was for married
[SPEAKER_05]: couples from the MDMA.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they advised a lot of like a lot
of the therapy model and the technique,
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of those psychiatrists helped to
sort of develop the process that we're
[SPEAKER_05]: using now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they're still around.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're pretty bummed when that tool got
taken away from them.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like the premise of the question.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wish therapists were allowed to use
MDMA with their patients.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that they might be able to bond
even more quickly.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and I'll say one more thing is that
MAPS did make a way for therapists to
[SPEAKER_13]: experience what MDMA is like so that they
can have a greater level of understanding
[SPEAKER_13]: of what their patients are going through.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they have a study going on right now.
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are plans to be more studies
where the therapists get taken through
[SPEAKER_13]: sort of an abbreviated version of the
protocol that our participants are going
[SPEAKER_13]: through.
[SPEAKER_13]: But they're the participant.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they get to do the MDMA with two
therapy.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's something that's really unheard of
also for FDA to approve giving healthy
[SPEAKER_11]: volunteers MDMA just so they can
understand how to be a therapist.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's a very different model.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what I'm pretty proud of.
[SPEAKER_11]: That MAPS also, not other groups have
valued that in the same way.
[SPEAKER_05]: More safety data.
[SPEAKER_16]: So I was going to ask about the Zendo
project that you guys were just talking
[SPEAKER_16]: about.
[SPEAKER_16]: I've actually signed up online to be
notified, I guess, when there's volunteer
[SPEAKER_16]: opportunities.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't see a lot of stuff come through
there.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have seen the downloadable training
manual.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I wasn't sure if there was
face-to-face training locally or if there
[SPEAKER_16]: was kind of a more immediate way to get
involved.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think that there are local
trainings.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was just one in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm kind of connected to the organizers.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a really great question.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they basically have been responding to
people like you.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, wanting to have more access to
the training.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they've actually done one, I think,
in Portland and one in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're going to be developing more.
[SPEAKER_11]: But you're based in LA?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think also they work in Burning Man,
actually no longer at Africa Burn,
[SPEAKER_11]: because they supported the groups there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're trying to kind of go to more
training, actually, and less outreach.
[SPEAKER_11]: So hopefully you could do an LA training
soon.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think Erica was talking about doing
something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The home bases that I believe they're
going to continue to do sort of in
[SPEAKER_05]: perpetuity, at least right now,
are Lightning in a Bottle and Vision and
[SPEAKER_05]: Burning Man.
OK.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Lightning in a Bottle would be a
good way locally to dip your toes in.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a Zendo coordinator based in
LA.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll connect you to a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, several.
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you spell that?
[SPEAKER_13]: Z-E-N-D-O, project.org.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much for everything you're
doing for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Omar, thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, I've got a question for you on the
criteria of research facilities.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll put in a hypothetical scenario.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like let's say you have a retreat center,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to say like Esalen or maybe
some of our Northern California farms that
[SPEAKER_08]: are transitioning from cannabis farms into
retreats and spaces where we're sort of
[SPEAKER_08]: licensing certain things.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we register to work with MAPS and or
other research organizations to do set
[SPEAKER_08]: setting, guided meditations, and long term
retreats, and PTSD healing, not just for
[SPEAKER_08]: weeks, but for months, residency,
things of that nature?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, would that be a viable business
model for us to sort of strive for in the
[SPEAKER_08]: future?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or do you see that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the dream for a lot of people,
myself included, is that we would have
[SPEAKER_05]: places like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, we're still in the getting it
legalized part, or at least the treatment
[SPEAKER_05]: part.
[SPEAKER_05]: But once it is an available treatment,
then yeah, you can be able to create a
[SPEAKER_05]: specialized retreat place that would
almost be like short term living.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's several months long.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it would be great for people
to be immersed and have other healthy
[SPEAKER_05]: activities to fill their day with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because yeah, it's hard to, especially
people who are coming out of just
[SPEAKER_05]: traumatic environments.
[SPEAKER_05]: An eight hour session sounds like a long
time of therapy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the other 100 some odd hours of the
week, they're listening to gunshots and
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to make it safely to the bus or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the research is kind of as we're kind
of set for phase three research spaces.
[SPEAKER_11]: But before we have full approval,
we're actually expecting approval for
[SPEAKER_11]: something called expanded access.
[SPEAKER_11]: So technically, if you were to get a team
together of people that would have to be
[SPEAKER_11]: trained to go through the MDMA therapy
training and have a schedule one license
[SPEAKER_11]: and have the appropriate team,
but if you collected a team and had a
[SPEAKER_11]: space as soon as 2019, we could have
expanded access MDMA therapy happening
[SPEAKER_11]: there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's actually we're really,
really close.
[SPEAKER_11]: But right now, maps can't, you know,
we've invested in developing our different
[SPEAKER_11]: like phase three research sites,
but we're not going to be sponsoring this
[SPEAKER_11]: expanded access.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's kind of like an add on before
approval.
[SPEAKER_11]: Basically, we are granted like this comes
because there's such huge potential for
[SPEAKER_11]: treatment that they want people to have
access, you know, as soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so there is that caveat that could
allow you if you gathered your team
[SPEAKER_08]: together, where would we learn about this?
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything's on our website.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can also email and we can like we'll
send we can send you all the info.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I could add like right now,
ketamine is a schedule three control
[SPEAKER_10]: substance and there's ketamine therapy and
actually you conduct some ketamine therapy
[SPEAKER_10]: for depression.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you tell us a little bit more about
that?
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was always curious, like,
you know, I associate ketamine with a K
[SPEAKER_10]: hole and falling down the K hole.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, is that a paradoxical
effect of ketamine?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a potential effect of ketamine for
sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, in the in the doses that are
that have been shown to be helpful,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's been a lot of studies with
ketamine for depression.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not something that's likely to get go
through the phase three process,
[SPEAKER_05]: because I think even if something like
MDMA for PTSD, where we're it's all donor
[SPEAKER_05]: funded, and it's like a shoestring budget,
it's still in the 10s of millions of
[SPEAKER_05]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: So ketamine not having any like,
reason to invest 10s of millions of
[SPEAKER_05]: dollars, there's nobody who's going to
unless anybody in here has like $40
[SPEAKER_05]: million, I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll do the study for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's like $40 million or
something like that to run a phase three
[SPEAKER_05]: study all the way through.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I forgot I was going with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But you don't need a whole study,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's already scheduled through.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So so the the studies that have been done,
there's plenty of evidence that it's
[SPEAKER_05]: effective at a dose that also can provide
what they call a dissociative or
[SPEAKER_05]: psychotomimetic effect in studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's most people who've had the
experience and are familiar with
[SPEAKER_05]: psychedelics would describe it as a
psychedelic experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those of us trained in working with
psychedelic states and the potential
[SPEAKER_05]: healing, it's I see it as a as like a sort
of wasted opportunity not to just set up a
[SPEAKER_05]: treatment plan where we administer the
medicine that's been shown to be safe and
[SPEAKER_05]: effective and also add some psychotherapy
that's been shown to be safe and
[SPEAKER_05]: effective.
[SPEAKER_05]: And psychedelic experience which
psilocybin and MDMA are starting to show
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe safe and effective too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we see very, very difficult cases in my
clinic.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have as good or better outcomes than
the research that's done without those
[SPEAKER_05]: considerations in mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that that's one of the reasons
why.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going, guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had a quick question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've heard a lot of talk about MDMA LSD
psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really haven't heard a lot of talk or I
guess maybe research maybe I'm wrong about
[SPEAKER_03]: DMT.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's crazy to me is that it's the
most of like crazy of the psychedelics and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's naturally occurring in the brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys have any insight on that or
like research or anything that you have to
[SPEAKER_13]: say on that?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: DMT, I mean, besides the research that
Rick Strassman has done, I mean,
[SPEAKER_13]: it's hard to know what the therapeutic
value is, but it's a little bit hard to
[SPEAKER_13]: contain.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas with something like psilocybin
where it's milder and you've got a longer
[SPEAKER_13]: working time, whereas as opposed to the
DMT experiences that people may have
[SPEAKER_13]: recreationally, it was a five minute
inhaled experience and you're thrown to
[SPEAKER_13]: another dimension and then you come back
and it's like, okay, what just happened?
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I think it's gonna, but also DMT is
also in the ayahuasca brew, which is shown
[SPEAKER_13]: to show lots of effects, beneficial
effects for various mental health
[SPEAKER_13]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there is considerable amount of
research happening, especially in places
[SPEAKER_13]: where ayahuasca is legal.
[SPEAKER_13]: So using it in that context, there is some
not more retrospective and sort of survey
[SPEAKER_13]: research around the effects or the
benefits of 5-MeO DMT.
[SPEAKER_13]: Some research, quite a bit of studies that
came out of Crossroads Treatment Center in
[SPEAKER_13]: Mexico that was working with that medicine
and has shown several different things
[SPEAKER_13]: about that.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just both of them, it's very hard to
fit those into a medical model because
[SPEAKER_13]: it's blasting into another space and to be
able to create as medicalized that is very
[SPEAKER_13]: hard.
[SPEAKER_13]: There are people that are maybe not so
much with DMT in its pure form.
[SPEAKER_13]: But 5-MeO, there are people that are
interested in trying to figure out either
[SPEAKER_13]: moving that through some sort of religious
freedom movement or through a medical
[SPEAKER_13]: context.
[SPEAKER_13]: There is a group out of Boulder,
Colorado called Medicinal Mindfulness and
[SPEAKER_13]: they're working with Rick Strossman to do
some really interesting research with
[SPEAKER_13]: extended state DMT, but it's more for
exploration in a way than it is for
[SPEAKER_13]: medical usage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really the only way that you can
research these substances is if it's
[SPEAKER_03]: medical.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even if it's naturally occurring in the
brain and we just want to figure out what
[SPEAKER_03]: the hell it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're doing neuroimaging studies with
DMT at Imperial College in London.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're actually doing a really cool
study seeing what part of your brain
[SPEAKER_11]: lights up when you see entities or
something, what that could mean.
[SPEAKER_11]: So as Ashley was saying, because there
isn't a therapeutic context that we've
[SPEAKER_11]: created except the ayahuasca, which I
really appreciate you saying, and I think
[SPEAKER_11]: we can't ignore that the way indigenous
cultures have used this DMT medicine is in
[SPEAKER_11]: ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how it really does.
[SPEAKER_11]: So DMT, but it is being examined
academically in neuroimaging and other
[SPEAKER_11]: contexts, just not in, like MAPS is very
focused on therapeutic research.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the difference.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just so stigmatized.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's very little research money out
there, even for something like the study
[SPEAKER_13]: that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not going to get research money
from the government to do research on
[SPEAKER_13]: schedule one substances.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's going to be one of the really
interesting things that happens when we
[SPEAKER_13]: get MDMA rescheduled.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's going to open up all of this
federal funding to be able to do more
[SPEAKER_13]: research on the MDMA.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we won't have to be asking people
for money to do MDMA research and doing it
[SPEAKER_13]: through a nonprofit model.
[SPEAKER_13]: So then we're going to see this explosion
of research around the first ones that are
[SPEAKER_13]: coming through the system is MDMA and
psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_13]: So our collective hope is that through
that, just rescheduling it will open up so
[SPEAKER_13]: much more money to do so much more
research and then that will open people's
[SPEAKER_13]: interests and minds about these things to
be able to open up more research in the
[SPEAKER_13]: future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just not necessarily medical research,
but just to figure out what the hell it
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just stigmatized, I think.
[SPEAKER_11]: Check out Imperial College.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're doing a lot of research with DMT.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Turingham Initiative.
[SPEAKER_11]: They just had a whole DMT conference in
New York called Turingham Initiative at
[SPEAKER_11]: Imperial College of London.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_19]: You guys, you folks talked a little bit
about stage 3 trial and needing to line up
[SPEAKER_19]: a partner to manufacture the MDMA and also
the shortness of how a few therapies
[SPEAKER_19]: actually can have a big impact.
[SPEAKER_19]: Has there been an impediment to finding a
manufacturing partner?
[SPEAKER_19]: Someone that's not looking to make another
Prozac or something you're going to take
[SPEAKER_19]: for the rest of your life?
[SPEAKER_19]: And can you speak on that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know the total details,
so I don't want to gossip or anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I know that it makes sense that a
small order would go a long way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there were delays in getting the
medicine that we needed to do the phase 3
[SPEAKER_05]: studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think it was a conspiracy or
anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just math on the side of people who
make their living doing math.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think there are higher priority
things, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a concern.
[SPEAKER_11]: The small dose thing you're saying means
that the quantity we're asking for was so
[SPEAKER_11]: small that they first agreed to do it with
us because they were really interested.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then something chipped.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, as you said, it wasn't because of
the MDMA.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we haven't actually had it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have far more difficulty doing research
with marijuana than with MDMA based on
[SPEAKER_11]: where we can.
[SPEAKER_11]: With cannabis, we can only get it from the
University of Mississippi grown by the
[SPEAKER_11]: National Institute on Drug Abuse.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a government space.
[SPEAKER_11]: But with MDMA, we can contract with any
pharma company that's creating the
[SPEAKER_11]: chemicals, not the kind that's necessarily
developing those chemicals.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're kind of two kinds of pharma when
you say pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we haven't had issues with that.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess I have a thank you for being here
and sharing all this information.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a question where the studies that
you're participating in, are there
[SPEAKER_15]: considerations to the endogenous parts of
the human body?
[SPEAKER_15]: So the variance between someone who has a
really clean digestive system,
[SPEAKER_15]: enteric nervous system, liver,
all these things that are going to be part
[SPEAKER_15]: of the endogenous activity, right?
[SPEAKER_15]: So are there considerations to the
individual difference between
[SPEAKER_15]: administering that dose to someone and how
much dopamine and serotonin they kick out?
[SPEAKER_15]: And then post use, are they looking at
cortisol levels?
[SPEAKER_15]: And then how do you address that kind of
stuff, I guess?
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the delivery system, does that
change is it always orally administered?
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there any variance in any of these
substances?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like is there a sinus spray with MDMA?
[SPEAKER_15]: Would that change metabolism?
[SPEAKER_15]: Would that change the individualized
dopamine, serotonin, and then potential
[SPEAKER_15]: kickback of cortisol on the post side?
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that was like a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an invitation out to kind of
academia to throw add on studies.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like, in my experience in academic
research, this kind of study is sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: like a mothership study that people can
get grants for 10,000, 20,000 to like,
[SPEAKER_05]: like we have an add on study happening
with ours where we're going to do
[SPEAKER_05]: epigenetic.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to look at some epigenetic
data, getting some like DNA swabs from
[SPEAKER_05]: people or you know what swabs are spit,
but you know, very easy to add on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's been invitation and that's
pretty standard in academic research.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in the earlier studies,
there probably wasn't as much of that cool
[SPEAKER_05]: like secondary data basically being
collected because everybody was hesitant
[SPEAKER_05]: to just touch it at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now there is, there's a pile of
secondary data that's just like still
[SPEAKER_05]: waiting to be, you know, to be searched
through.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know to the level of exact detail,
but there have been cortisol levels looked
[SPEAKER_05]: at, oxytocin levels looked at,
vasopressin, lots of different hormones
[SPEAKER_05]: that people have different theories about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we always collect as much like
demographic data as we possibly can.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there's a gold mine of data to
look at.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the focus has been on the of our
research in particular has been on,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, does it work?
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't, we're not as concerned in our
specific study designs with why it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's showing that it does because that's
what's most important and that it's safe
[SPEAKER_05]: and then we can figure all the rest out as
we go.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I guess just real quick for MDMA
and ketamine, is it just Orally
[SPEAKER_15]: Administrator?
[SPEAKER_15]: Are there any other delivery systems that
you guys know about?
[SPEAKER_05]: For MDMA, I believe Orally is all that's
been utilized so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: For ketamine, it's been studied in a lot
of different routes of administration.
[SPEAKER_05]: Majority of the larger studies used
intravenous, primarily because the first
[SPEAKER_05]: studies had to have anesthesiologist,
the sort of internal ethics boards that
[SPEAKER_05]: oversee all studies on human subjects.
[SPEAKER_05]: They required anesthesiologists to
administer the ketamine because they had
[SPEAKER_05]: more experience with it because it comes
from anesthesiologists.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was delivered IV sort of
historically, but then lots of different
[SPEAKER_05]: routes of administration have been looked
at.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as safety goes, it seems like
Orally has the least amount of side
[SPEAKER_05]: effects, like the gentilis side effect
profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's lozenges.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you work with it intermuscularly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I primarily work with it
intermuscularly because it is delivered
[SPEAKER_05]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's not as much monitoring.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not as invasive as IV.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has the second most amount of data.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Orally, intranasally, yeah,
I think there's even some cases of
[SPEAKER_05]: suppositories.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I guess as a complement to the
scientific and research ways of getting
[SPEAKER_17]: MDMA or psilocybin to be rescheduled,
or at least MDMA, at least in the United
[SPEAKER_17]: States, would it be a compromise or a
complement to the research if there was
[SPEAKER_17]: something like a normal for psychedelics
that was advocating on behalf of
[SPEAKER_17]: consumers, like trying to push forth
decriminalization policies on local
[SPEAKER_17]: levels, whether it's municipality or state
law or that kind of thing?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I guess would that be a good or bad
for the movement overall?
[SPEAKER_05]: Normal like NORML?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, to advocate for consumers who are
taking it outside the research context.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Madison.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think overall, it definitely would be a
helpful thing to have more people engaged
[SPEAKER_11]: and learning and advocating and to not
have these substances be criminalized or
[SPEAKER_11]: for anyone to be not having access to them
in the safest way as possible.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm definitely not against something
like that happening.
[SPEAKER_11]: But what I was kind of speaking about was
how I would think that the priority for me
[SPEAKER_11]: strategically would lie with those
activists and groups connecting more
[SPEAKER_11]: broadly with people working to end the war
on drugs and not just take out
[SPEAKER_11]: psychedelics, but to say, how can we as
psychedelic advocates help support people
[SPEAKER_11]: who are trying to legalize opiates,
legalize these substances that are so
[SPEAKER_11]: stigmatized, no one is going to want to
talk about.
[SPEAKER_11]: And instead of when they are speaking
about it, they have to focus on reducing
[SPEAKER_11]: the harms of things.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like it's so dangerous, we need to make
this legal.
[SPEAKER_11]: But how can psychedelic advocates be like,
well, actually, there are so many
[SPEAKER_11]: substances that are really, you know,
for the betterment of well people that are
[SPEAKER_11]: safe, that are kind of full out this
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's where like my strategic
priorities would lie.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I know that it's certainly like having
more support and awareness and just like
[SPEAKER_11]: there's so many people so excited about
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I feel like there's something missing
by not like taking advantage of everyone
[SPEAKER_11]: being like, we want to legalize
psychedelics and move this forward.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it would be cool for that group
to really think about how to organize this
[SPEAKER_11]: community of people that really want to
make change and like to think what are the
[SPEAKER_11]: biggest pain points right now and what to
focus on.
[SPEAKER_11]: And right now, for those of you who don't
know, there are a network of psychedelic
[SPEAKER_11]: societies across the US.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Marisa's audience is helping or
does a lot of coordination and working
[SPEAKER_11]: with a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're like groups that are kind of
built in, there's kind of like normal
[SPEAKER_11]: equivalent that are chapters literally
over 90 around the whole world.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they would probably be built in,
they're the ones reaching out and starting
[SPEAKER_11]: these psilocybin initiatives.
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're kind of already are those
frameworks.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would like connect in with that.
[SPEAKER_13]: The Drug Policy Alliance is a really great
organization because they're really
[SPEAKER_13]: fighting for the the the decriminalization
of all drugs.
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would like to offer, I guess a
concurring perspective, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's good to have change on all
levels at all times.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not a serial thing, it's a parallel
thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it would be good for there to be
activists pushing actively to repeal
[SPEAKER_10]: psychedelic prohibition in addition to
repealing all prohibition.
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know, it's not going to happen if
people aren't pushing for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it needs to be part of the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you want to take the lead on that,
then you will be my hero.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: My question is very similar to the last
question, actually.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess I'll just go a little further
with that, because I was just wondering,
[SPEAKER_07]: since there has been a lot of information
about a lot of psychedelics for a long
[SPEAKER_07]: time, like LSD, for example, people saying
that it's not harmful, like Timothy Leary,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then the way the US government like,
made this guy into a criminal and it was
[SPEAKER_07]: ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, is there still a lot of the other
side of people trying to make them illegal
[SPEAKER_07]: and pushing for that?
[SPEAKER_07]: And is that a big hurdle?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or do you feel that psychedelics will be
more legal soon?
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you guys feel about this situation
currently?
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_11]: And something that I think is part of MAPS
strategy from, you know, over 30 years was
[SPEAKER_11]: how do we use this like scientific
research to kind of prevent anyone from
[SPEAKER_11]: saying this is crazy and dismissing
Timothy Leary.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, there was tons of research
before, but it wasn't in the FDA framework
[SPEAKER_11]: that it is now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's getting a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_11]: And even in the five years I've worked at
MAPS, I've seen a lot less resistance.
[SPEAKER_11]: And also MAPS is we work a lot with
veterans and PTSD.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I feel like that's also a particularly
a population that when they're speaking
[SPEAKER_11]: about their experience, it's really hard
for people to just you know, dismiss what
[SPEAKER_11]: they're saying.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're having people like Michael
Pollan and all these kind of more
[SPEAKER_11]: mainstream sources talking about,
you know, we're in LA, how many more TV
[SPEAKER_11]: shows now do you see?
[SPEAKER_11]: Ayahuasca mentioned in MDMA therapy
session or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's really shifting it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And right now, I think the people that
don't want psychedelics to be medicine and
[SPEAKER_11]: be legal are probably those who are making
pharmaceuticals that you have to take
[SPEAKER_11]: every single day for the rest of your
life.
[SPEAKER_11]: And something's coming along that could
totally change that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And those are already the groups trying to
prevent cannabis from moving forward.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's more along those lines,
even though, of course, people still have,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, don't not everyone knows about
this new psychedelic renaissance.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's probably a lot of that left
over.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm not I'm not seeing it like in DC,
even so many Republican legislators I meet
[SPEAKER_11]: with know all about the MDMA for PTSD
research.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, just my my feeling of it,
and may just be my opinion, nothing more,
[SPEAKER_05]: is that the whatever the source was of all
of that fear and, you know, fear tactics
[SPEAKER_05]: of it, like the whoever was benefiting
from that initial like, I think Nixon
[SPEAKER_05]: basically, you know, whoever like the the
source of that paranoia and fear is kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of aid edged out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and there are a lot of consequences
that are leading to bigger problems,
[SPEAKER_05]: like with, you know, prison overpopulation
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of like sensible things
now that I think can relate to most
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't, at this point, felt any like
true conspiratorial hand somewhere just
[SPEAKER_05]: more like laziness of like not,
you know, it takes a lot of work to like
[SPEAKER_05]: pass a law to unpass one takes like 10
more, 10 times more energy is like
[SPEAKER_05]: ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_05]: bureaucracies are crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think psychedelics are becoming
increasingly more accepted in society,
[SPEAKER_10]: and especially with the advent of
microdosing, they're going to become
[SPEAKER_10]: infinitely more accepted, especially with
all the boomers who are now nearing
[SPEAKER_10]: retirement, and they're looking for a way
to spruce up their retirement and brighten
[SPEAKER_10]: their day, I think, and also with minimal
enforcement of the LSD prohibition by the
[SPEAKER_10]: DA, I think we're gonna see widespread use
of microdosing and even more acceptance.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can only bury the truth for so long.
[SPEAKER_04]: My question is about legalization as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a person who used to be like super
anti drug war, and thought all drugs
[SPEAKER_04]: should be legalized.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you hear anecdotes, I was talking
to a woman who's rural town, because of
[SPEAKER_04]: the opioid epidemic, this is her citation,
it's like people, you know, steal
[SPEAKER_04]: everything like you can't have a store
with like lawn furniture out front because
[SPEAKER_04]: it gets taken.
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously, it's like tough to be an
addict like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's like social consequences.
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you respond to comments about,
you know, widespread drug legalization,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, affording more opportunity for
people to get addicted in like really bad
[SPEAKER_04]: ways, and then social impacts that come
from that?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm glad you asked because I realized
I didn't maybe speak enough about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually, in country like Portugal was
one country that decriminalized drugs when
[SPEAKER_11]: they were experiencing a really bad opiate
crisis.
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually what they found it might
sound counterintuitive, but actually
[SPEAKER_11]: decriminalizing substances doesn't
increase use, it actually decreases use,
[SPEAKER_11]: and also decreases rates of contracting
different illnesses, decreases rates of
[SPEAKER_11]: overdoses.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the theory is basically that instead
of people having to like shoot up on the
[SPEAKER_11]: street or in a bathroom and overdose alone
and have a dirty needle and not know
[SPEAKER_11]: what's in their substances, when they can
go and feel safe to seek treatment or seek
[SPEAKER_11]: any kind of support, even if it's not to
stop using, even if it's to go to a safe
[SPEAKER_11]: injection space where you can have a clean
needle, you can have a nurse there,
[SPEAKER_11]: and you can have access to resources,
maybe you need help getting a job,
[SPEAKER_11]: you're not ready to stop using yet,
but you want help with one thing or
[SPEAKER_11]: another.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the research really makes abundantly
clear that that is the way to actually
[SPEAKER_11]: decrease use and to make use more safe.
[SPEAKER_11]: And in all the countries where opiates
remain illegal and have more punitive
[SPEAKER_11]: laws, there are actually higher rates of
overdoses and dangerous interactions.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, I guess I would look at both.
[SPEAKER_11]: In Portugal, the Czech Republic has been
decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_11]: Spain, countries that have that going on
and how their opiate context is different
[SPEAKER_11]: than ours.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're kind of shifting, instead of
treating drug use as a criminal justice
[SPEAKER_13]: issue, it's treating it as a health issue.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when you destimidized it, people that
do actually want help can get help,
[SPEAKER_13]: and you're gonna be giving them to a
social worker rather than a prison guard,
[SPEAKER_13]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's exactly 100% right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would just add that it is important
not to overlook, they're not harmless,
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of them are extremely dangerous.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think drugs in general are just like any
other tool that we've discovered as a
[SPEAKER_05]: species.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can use this mic stand as a mic stand,
or we could use it to bludgeon somebody
[SPEAKER_05]: with, depending on our intention with it,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So drugs have effects, I think,
I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's exactly right that these are
healthcare issues, like addiction,
[SPEAKER_05]: the health consequences, psychedelics,
psychosis induced by cocaine, meth,
[SPEAKER_05]: those are all medical issues, let the
medical community work with it,
[SPEAKER_05]: support the medical community in dealing
with it, treat addicts as patients.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think when you make it a criminal
justice thing, you just add one more of
[SPEAKER_05]: those bad consequences.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they're disenfranchised citizens,
now they can't vote, now they can't get
[SPEAKER_05]: jobs.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like much faster to steal and do all
those bad things when you have no
[SPEAKER_05]: prospects, too.
[SPEAKER_13]: When you look at some of the work by Gabor
Mate who looks at addiction and what the
[SPEAKER_13]: root causes of addiction are, you see it's
often trauma, and so if people can get
[SPEAKER_13]: help with their trauma, and you can give
them better coping skills, then maybe they
[SPEAKER_13]: don't need to use drugs to cope.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was gonna say, early childhood trauma is
by far the leading indicator for
[SPEAKER_11]: developing problematic substances,
so yeah, it's not, we like to,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's a lot easier for us to vilify the
drug, but it's really not, the drug is a
[SPEAKER_11]: way of treating the trauma.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think stigmatizing a substance kind of
makes it more appealing, it becomes a
[SPEAKER_10]: forbidden fruit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Once these substances are no longer
forbidden, once they're seen for what they
[SPEAKER_10]: are, something that is usually harmful to
the user, then they don't have that appeal
[SPEAKER_10]: of doing something that is outlaw.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, that's really awesome
information.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: In terms of microdosing, I wanted you guys
to maybe address it from the everyday life
[SPEAKER_09]: of sort of like, I don't know,
like professionals, or people,
[SPEAKER_09]: just everyday, the everyday person,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: But also microdosing in terms of LSD
versus MDMA, and how those two,
[SPEAKER_13]: they're very different drugs, but you
know, I mean, we can't encourage people to
[SPEAKER_13]: do illegal substances, so, you know,
but there are good resources online,
[SPEAKER_13]: there's a website called The Third Wave
that helps people be safe in their use
[SPEAKER_13]: from, I would say, a little bit more of a
harm reduction perspective, so I think
[SPEAKER_13]: they would be a great resource for
learning more about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm not as familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think James Fadiman, who's been around
for a long time and did a pretty serious
[SPEAKER_05]: dissection of the topic, though,
James Fadiman would be somebody to look
[SPEAKER_05]: for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he recently published a book,
and a lot of like the, I started hearing
[SPEAKER_05]: about it a whole lot more after that book
came out, so I think that was important.
[SPEAKER_11]: He did a lot of survey research of people,
he just would encourage people in
[SPEAKER_11]: microdosing to fill out a survey,
and that's what he talks a lot about,
[SPEAKER_11]: but I'm curious, as you mentioned,
MDMA microdosing, and I'm curious,
[SPEAKER_11]: like, from you guys, if you've heard of
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, not good.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not something I've really heard of.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, speaking of the, you know,
negative, you know, that's not all fun and
[SPEAKER_05]: games, the MDMA, there's an effect called
chronic tolerance that some people or
[SPEAKER_05]: potentially everyone would get after
enough doses of MDMA where it no longer
[SPEAKER_05]: works.
[SPEAKER_05]: So microdosing regularly, I think,
would just expedite that, and if it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: tool that would be really beneficial and
helpful in a, you know, down the line
[SPEAKER_05]: after a traumatic event, I mean,
life's full of traumas and nobody can be
[SPEAKER_05]: guaranteed not to have one, it'd be good
to have that tool still in your toolbox.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not, oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also, I mean, MDMA's a little bit
different than some of the other
[SPEAKER_13]: psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't, I mean, LSD and psilocybin
have shown to have kind of neurological
[SPEAKER_13]: benefits or creativity benefits,
whereas when we did our dose responsive
[SPEAKER_13]: studies for maps, they were showing that
actually lower doses of MDMA, they were
[SPEAKER_13]: still not microdosed, but actually made
people more anxious and they had worse
[SPEAKER_13]: outcomes at lower doses of MDMA because
what you're doing is MDMA is, it's related
[SPEAKER_13]: to amphetamines.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're getting all of the jittery
amphetamine part of the MDMA without
[SPEAKER_13]: getting the serotonin and dopamine and
oxytocin flood with it, so you're not
[SPEAKER_13]: getting the benefits, you're just getting
the anxiety part.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the health, MDMA's not, again,
a good one to do very often because it
[SPEAKER_13]: does tax your system.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not like the other ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: A bias plug.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maps, though, has been carrying the torch
like they have been around for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Earlier, there was the comment about DMT,
that what I was hearing was some
[SPEAKER_05]: frustration that we will only study things
if there's maybe a medical benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of maps, we even only have that.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one was funding this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maps raised the money by donations from
rooms like this of awesome people and the
[SPEAKER_05]: effort of more and a snowballing process
of funding and research, and we're right
[SPEAKER_05]: at the finish line.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are lots of groups and organizations
out there, but maps really deserves,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, that recognition and credit.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're just trying to get past the
finish line here, you know, because once
[SPEAKER_13]: we reschedule, then we're gonna get so
much more ability to get research money,
[SPEAKER_13]: and then all of these studies that people
are interested in, we can start doing them
[SPEAKER_13]: because there's gonna be money.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's like focusing all the money on to
get this across this finish line,
[SPEAKER_13]: and then it's gonna really open up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, like I can't, I couldn't try to get
a grant for a federal loan, which is where
[SPEAKER_05]: the majority of research comes from,
unless you are a drug company or being
[SPEAKER_05]: funded by a drug company to do their
research.
[SPEAKER_05]: The National Institute of Mental Health
and the National Institute of Drug Abuse
[SPEAKER_05]: combined, I think, is over almost three
billion dollars in funding.
[SPEAKER_05]: This study is 30 to 40 million something,
last ballpark estimate I heard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that kind of grant, you know,
is not very hard to get.
[SPEAKER_05]: For something this groundbreaking,
like there would be plenty of funding,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you can't propose a study of something
that's directly against the policy of,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the neighboring department,
or sometimes the same department in the
[SPEAKER_05]: government agency.
[SPEAKER_05]: So once it's rescheduled, those proposals
can be taken seriously.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I mean.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the renaissance will really
begin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know if this is a question
that might be better for like after the
[SPEAKER_01]: panel or something I could do online,
but I work at a place that's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: called the Psychedelic Healing Shack,
and it's in Detroit, Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just wondering if there were any
like chapters or representatives of MAPs
[SPEAKER_01]: in Michigan or in Detroit, because we
would love to like have an event or like a
[SPEAKER_01]: discussion at our venue.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there is a Detroit Psychedelic
Society, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: There's Mind Manifest Midwest,
but that's not quite in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not in Detroit, yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: You should start your own psychedelic
society.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I like get more involved?
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to Marisa.
[SPEAKER_14]: Where do you see the, or is there a
relationship between the work that you're
[SPEAKER_14]: doing currently and the unregulated,
guided, psychedelic, I don't know what
[SPEAKER_14]: exactly to call that right now,
that is.
[SPEAKER_06]: The ceremonies and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I guess that's what like Michael
Pollan was speaking to a lot in his book.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I mean, I see that right now is like,
oh man, would I love my parents to have
[SPEAKER_14]: some sort of guided experience to help
them transition in an appropriate way.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it makes me a little bit nervous just
to look up someone out of the blue or even
[SPEAKER_14]: on a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it's dealing with 65 and 67 year
olds is maybe different than I would
[SPEAKER_14]: experiment on myself or surely the 20 year
old version of myself would have done.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say that we really feel that
people that are doing this work like
[SPEAKER_11]: bravely at risk of incarceration are
really important to what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it started before it was illegal in
the 70s.
[SPEAKER_11]: There were these therapists and these
frameworks.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then when it went, got made illegal,
a lot of these therapists kept working in
[SPEAKER_11]: different contexts and they've kind of
maintained this protocol and modality and
[SPEAKER_11]: way of doing therapy.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're very careful and our work is all
very separate because we have to be to do
[SPEAKER_11]: this FDA research.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we're definitely, I'm really grateful
to work at MAPS because we're not one to
[SPEAKER_11]: be like, we're nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: We really appreciate the work that they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And right now we can't give access to
people the way we want to.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so if people can get something that's
gonna literally save their life or ease
[SPEAKER_11]: their transition, I think that's
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's also a lot happening legally
outside of the US.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's something really worth
investigating.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then there's ketamine that's legal in
the US.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's really lots of levels.
[SPEAKER_11]: I recently moved to LA and there's
definitely lots of communities around
[SPEAKER_11]: here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that's really, for me,
that's really important because that's
[SPEAKER_11]: part of what's giving people access and
experience and learning about how these
[SPEAKER_11]: laws are messed up and also experiencing
these healing changes that hopefully are
[SPEAKER_11]: gonna impact our whole world.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that we have to just,
I guess our focus, I'll just end with this
[SPEAKER_11]: as talking about reducing harms,
right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So we know this stuff is happening whether
or not we like it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we really believe in making sure people
have as much information as possible to do
[SPEAKER_11]: it as safely as possible.
[SPEAKER_11]: So like, MAPS puts all of our protocols
for how we do our studies online.
[SPEAKER_11]: We make everything really available so
that people can learn and read up and do
[SPEAKER_11]: these things with intention because it
does really matter how you do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we don't think we can control
everything.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would add that it's a tricky time
right now because this is getting more
[SPEAKER_13]: attention.
[SPEAKER_13]: There are many more people jumping into
this field.
[SPEAKER_13]: With maybe not the best training or the
best container.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you, the people that are working
in the underground don't have supervision.
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't have people that they're
figuring out if they're doing their best
[SPEAKER_13]: work.
[SPEAKER_13]: So peer review, it's a tricky space.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right to be cautious.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it is the wild west.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'll do a little bit of a shameless
plug.
[SPEAKER_13]: But we've been talking about this at the
AWARE Project a lot.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we recently put together a multi-part
guide that we're helping people make good
[SPEAKER_13]: choices when they start, if they go down
that road and are looking for someone to
[SPEAKER_13]: work with in the underground.
[SPEAKER_13]: Because from a harm reduction approach,
we need to make sure that people are
[SPEAKER_13]: asking the right questions of themselves.
[SPEAKER_13]: Making sure they're asking the right
questions to the people they may be
[SPEAKER_13]: sitting with.
[SPEAKER_13]: And also making sure that those people are
asking you the right questions.
[SPEAKER_13]: So that they're not giving you anything
that could harm you.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have a really extensive guide on our
site.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I recommend checking that out.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and then the integration,
our integration maps has its own
[SPEAKER_13]: integration program where they have people
from all over the world or the US that
[SPEAKER_13]: offer psychedelic integration support.
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's not underground therapy.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just integration, inner space
integration.
[SPEAKER_13]: We also do the same to help people prepare
for an experience.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then also the integration afterwards.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can get really good advice from
people there on how to kind of figure out
[SPEAKER_13]: how to navigate those kinds of questions.
[SPEAKER_13]: But obviously not to help you find them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and sorry.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like, integration doesn't mean that
they do the work.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just that some people might take
psychedelics on their own and then come to
[SPEAKER_11]: this therapist that can help them kind of
integrate and make sense of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Or some people might have had a bad
psychedelic experience and need a
[SPEAKER_11]: therapist that understands.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's just a list that MAPS has on our
website of therapists throughout the
[SPEAKER_11]: country and the world that are kind of
familiar with these states and experiences
[SPEAKER_11]: so they can support you through that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess I'll also say, because I
definitely forgot about the caution,
[SPEAKER_11]: which is really important.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all up here.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also, unfortunately, a lot of
instances of sexual assault in ayahuasca
[SPEAKER_11]: communities.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like where people who call
themselves shamans are sleeping with
[SPEAKER_11]: people in ceremony and telling them it's
part of healing.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're under the influence.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that can be deeply traumatic,
especially when people are healing their
[SPEAKER_11]: sexual traumas.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there is a lot, when things are
illegal and unregulated, then there's a
[SPEAKER_11]: lot of danger.
[SPEAKER_13]: We had someone in the underground
ayahuasca community recently arrested and
[SPEAKER_13]: put in jail for sexual assault during an
ayahuasca ceremony.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it happens up here, too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many, yes, it's an underground
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a critical time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet there's hundreds of Facebook
groups that are all being monitored by the
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are every practitioner of this
underground working at Signal or Telegram
[SPEAKER_00]: or Hidden Messengers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really no place safe to find out
how to access a therapist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet there's 100 million people doing
different forms of MDMA without any
[SPEAKER_00]: guidance and who do not understand the
difference between ceremonial,
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal, and recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to me that if we can start to
transform the way people think about MDMA
[SPEAKER_00]: or Mao or your ecstasy en masse,
that it's possible we can bring this
[SPEAKER_00]: revolution, transformation, faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's possible from a communication
medium to allow this information to
[SPEAKER_00]: propagate and to find the right
practitioner and to make it safe for
[SPEAKER_00]: people to jump in the water and truly
start healing?
[SPEAKER_13]: Until we have a legal process,
until it's legalized, there's not going to
[SPEAKER_13]: be a way for people to do that safely for
the practitioner.
[SPEAKER_13]: There are people that put themselves out
there quite boldly in what they do,
[SPEAKER_13]: and I think a little too recklessly.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the practitioners need to be
responsible, too, because if they're not
[SPEAKER_13]: watching their practice, that could really
jeopardize what we're trying to do in the
[SPEAKER_13]: above ground work.
[SPEAKER_13]: If people want this to become a medicine,
we need to support the legalization
[SPEAKER_13]: movements.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're getting to a point where we're
getting some faster turning points,
[SPEAKER_13]: but this is a long game.
[SPEAKER_13]: The best we can do right now is help
people teach them about harm reduction
[SPEAKER_13]: from above ground way.
[SPEAKER_13]: But underground communities and people
that are participating in those kinds of
[SPEAKER_13]: communities need to watch out for one
another.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when they do bring people into their
communities, to do it in a responsible way
[SPEAKER_13]: so that there's sort of a buddy system and
that you're supporting people in their
[SPEAKER_13]: integration process.
[SPEAKER_13]: So more and more of the underground
communities are connecting more and more
[SPEAKER_13]: so that they can watch out for their own.
Talk to five people before you do
anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a lot of good recommendations
for those.
[SPEAKER_13]: The more people get connected,
especially people at psychedelic
[SPEAKER_13]: societies, just talking to each other
about smart ways of going about these
[SPEAKER_13]: things I think is helping a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these problems also come up in the
above ground world.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are people who violate their role in
relationships.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the difference is that there's a
system for qualifying those people.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a system for reprimanding those
people, taking away that right to play
[SPEAKER_05]: that role anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the whole licensing process.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I mean, if the underground can
create a similar sort of board
[SPEAKER_05]: certification process, or in my opinion,
we bring these modalities into the system
[SPEAKER_05]: that has those kinds of checks and
balances and reporting systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how we reach the most people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because a lot of people who need this help
don't live in Venice, California.
[SPEAKER_05]: They live in fucking Idaho and the Midwest
and wouldn't think about going to somebody
[SPEAKER_05]: underground.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would never even be in their world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they need help, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_11]: She's saying ayahuasca circles are
spreading everywhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't discount the Midwest, please.
[SPEAKER_06]: Venice is poor, definitely.
[SPEAKER_18]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.
[SPEAKER_18]: Any last words?
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we've got to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would add that these underground
practitioners need to self-regulate,
[SPEAKER_10]: because we're in an era of very tolerant
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they don't want to bring down the heat
on everybody and ruin it for everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so if you're an underground
practitioner and you see somebody who is
[SPEAKER_10]: in that same space and is not being
ethical and is not following the best
[SPEAKER_10]: practices, I think it's incumbent upon
you, as a matter of enlightened
[SPEAKER_10]: self-interest, to set that person aside
and to really encourage best practices so
[SPEAKER_10]: that you can self-regulate as opposed to
being regulated from without.
[SPEAKER_10]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_18]: And on that, can we all thank our speakers
for that marathon session, psychedelics
[SPEAKER_18]: pathway to legalization.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Thank you.
