[SPEAKER_01]: What about the prospects of breeding
cannabis plants for resistance or
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerance to, say, some of the common
pests like thrips and mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I told you earlier, cannabis is
really bridging now a gap of 30 years of,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, illegal research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a huge gap in technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're jumping directly into
breeding and into gapping those 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the things that are so-called
low-hanging fruits in other crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: like resistances, are just not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there needs to be people like you in
the pest management world coming up with
[SPEAKER_00]: germplasm that's tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need more phenotyping systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to isolate the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do the part where we find a gene,
but we need germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we talked about earlier, we need the
germplasm, and we need a scoring system.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, I talk to companies that
do breeding, and they say, OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we score our resistance?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need collaboration with the pest
management people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be a good tie-in,
because there's been studies in entomology
[SPEAKER_01]: for many years that we call host plant
resistance or tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And biocontrol can work hand-in-hand or
conjunction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having plants that are resistant,
that could be used in combination with the
[SPEAKER_01]: biologicals, like predators and
parasitoids, to enhance the reduction or
[SPEAKER_01]: suppression of pests on a plant like
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These could be physical stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: These could be a better performance of the
plant in a very mixed system, where you
[SPEAKER_00]: have total pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be hairs on the leaves that
prevent the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be hairy varieties like you have
in tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need those sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need people who have collected
germplasm, exotic germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's a problem, we need to breed
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it calls for collaborations of
institutions, companies like myself and
[SPEAKER_00]: like yourself, to work together and
generate new germplasm that's resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There won't be that much need for
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's going to be happy with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, the crop in question is
strictly 100% biological, because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: no need to spray when you're worried about
residue issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have the biocontrol agents for each
of those given pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there's an idea or a methodology
where we can have plants that are more
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerant of the pest, whether it be
through chemical nature, physical nature,
[SPEAKER_01]: that might enhance the efficacy of the
biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were the key take-home messages from
your presentation earlier today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the key points that I wanted to get
across was for identifying the insect that
[SPEAKER_01]: might pest you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will allow you to select the
appropriate biologic control agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other part was the quality
control aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get material from your supplier,
be sure it's alive and functional before
[SPEAKER_01]: you make your releases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's going to ensure the success
of the biocontrol agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: on the specific pests in your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a major concern coming up is the
root aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: The root aphids, I've been getting calls,
inquiries regarding that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my suggestions is the use of
Delocia coriara, which is the row beetle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a generous predator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be something, if you're
trying to deal with root aphids,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have root aphids in your operation,
then I would contact the suppliers and try
[SPEAKER_01]: to start using the row beetle Delocia
coriara and see how it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think overall that the key pests are
thrips, mites, and that includes aerified
[SPEAKER_01]: mites and broad mites and russet mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are pretty, those are pretty
consistent across the country because
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's growing the same crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really hard for me to say that in
Washington, they're having an outbreak of
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Maine, they're having an outbreak
of something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually can comment on that because I
have a broader perspective, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the industry because we're working with
companies in Europe and in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Canada has a lot of fungal diseases,
but there is also reports now of viral
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases being propagated or dispersed
through insect agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not truly identified yet,
but there's talk of three viruses that are
[SPEAKER_00]: probably spread by aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard it's a rumor right now of
crops grown outdoors in the hemp space in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon, where a mysterious disease,
they don't even know what it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: wipes out entire crops and spreading from
south to north Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be just rumors now,
but these things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as breeders and cultivators,
we must be prepared, we must have a germ
[SPEAKER_00]: plasm collection and means to characterize
and to breed fast for, to fight back with
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever strikes or crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think an important message also is that,
you know, in the greenhouse, you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain types of multiple complex,
but when you grow outdoors, then you're
[SPEAKER_01]: susceptible to other types of insects that
includes vectors like leaf hoppers and
[SPEAKER_01]: psyllids and caterpillars and actually
beetles more so in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you grow outdoors, you're getting
a, I would say, a plethora of different
[SPEAKER_01]: types of insects where your complex is
different than it might be in a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Okay.
Okay.
