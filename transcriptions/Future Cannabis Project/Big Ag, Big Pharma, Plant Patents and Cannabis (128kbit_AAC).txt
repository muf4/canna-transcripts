[SPEAKER_00]: Also in, you know, dealing with solutions
in cannabis, the two bigs are in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: us, the bigs, the big ag and big pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's something as small
farmers, as small production people,
[SPEAKER_00]: as educators about regenerative farming,
we're really looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dale, we wanted you to talk a little
bit about standing up to counterbalance
[SPEAKER_00]: big ag and just, you know, how can we help
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one thing we have to realize is we
can't make big ag go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there, it's going to get bigger,
and it'll enter into this industry even
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at what big ag,
the threats it poses, first of all,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's always going to have superior
efficiencies in terms of commodity
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in something that looks like
it's evolving toward a commodity market,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to emphasize ways of
differentiating yourself from the typical
[SPEAKER_01]: commodities, because it's very unlikely
that you could ever have the economies of
[SPEAKER_01]: scale that big ag can have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so either stay out of commodity
markets if you can, and if you can't,
[SPEAKER_01]: then focus on differentiators so that
you're not stuck selling the very same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that big ag is selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not very satisfying to hear,
but it's reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that big ag has is just
massive money and firepower, and that
[SPEAKER_01]: results in two kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will accumulate a lot of patents in
this space, and I'm a patent attorney,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I can talk about that a little bit,
and I have some ideas for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing is they will have
a lot of research firepower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their research is likely to be in
things like marker-assisted breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: to identify genotypes that are going to be
resistant to pests or diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have to be prepared for a day
that will come that big ag has some patent
[SPEAKER_01]: rights in something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have to be aware that big ag
is accumulating patents in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the industry right now, there's a
fundamental problem with patents,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that is that when you apply for a
patent, it's the patent examiner's job to
[SPEAKER_01]: do a search, look for the closest thing
they can find that's out there in the
[SPEAKER_01]: literature, and use that to reject your
application.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll tell you it's either new or it's
not obvious, and so I'm going to reject
[SPEAKER_01]: the application.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the beginning of a process,
and this is the same thing that happens
[SPEAKER_01]: with big ag when they apply for a patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the beginning, though, of a process
of arguing with the patent office about
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it really is what they see in the
literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big problem, though, in the cannabis
industry is there's almost no literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when a patent examiner is looking to
the literature, either prior commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: activity that's been published,
and we know that our prior commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: activity has been emphatically not
published, or prior academic papers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's not very many of those,
the problem that that has turned into,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we've seen some really egregious
examples of that, is that patent examiners
[SPEAKER_01]: are flying blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not bad people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not even necessarily favoring a
particular applicant, but if they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know that a certain chemotype has been
around for a long time in the unregulated
[SPEAKER_01]: market, and that it has this particular
profile, they can't find that in
[SPEAKER_01]: literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll grant a patent on it, and they
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've granted some chemotype patents
that put a lot of existing cultivars at
[SPEAKER_01]: risk of at least technical patent
infringement, and so as the patenting
[SPEAKER_01]: activity ramps up, we're going to see more
and more really invalid patents,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it costs a lot of money to prove that
a patent is invalid, and unless you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting involved during the process of
either pre-grant or post-grant,
[SPEAKER_01]: some things that you can do proactively,
you just have to wait to be sued,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then when you're sued, you get a
chance to prove in court that the patent
[SPEAKER_01]: is invalid and never should have been
granted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay, those are the problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some solutions, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: An example that I draw from is the
electronics industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some huge players in the
electronics industry, massive numbers of
[SPEAKER_01]: patents, but there aren't, and we hear
about the ones that do happen,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there aren't that many lawsuits for
patent infringement, because what these
[SPEAKER_01]: players do is they cross-license each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know that they have equal firepower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be mutually assured destruction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of suing each other,
they give each other licenses to their
[SPEAKER_01]: essential technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay, now how do we apply that to
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: For any individual farm, any individual
small company to stand up to Big Ag is an
[SPEAKER_01]: impossibility, but we can form a coalition
that will have enough aggregate effect to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a chance at least of counterbalancing
Big Ag's patent portfolios or at least
[SPEAKER_01]: having a defense pool so that when
somebody does get sued for infringing a
[SPEAKER_01]: Big Ag patent, we have the firepower to go
to court with them and say, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: here's why this patent never should have
been granted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prove it, aggregate evidence from the
community, and win in court.
[SPEAKER_01]: And see, what's really important is when a
patent is invalidated in court,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can't be used to assert against anyone
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's a little bit of shorthand
because it's really claim by claim,
[SPEAKER_01]: but once a patent claim is invalidated,
that claim is gone forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be asserted against anyone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if one defendant wins in a patent
validity contest, everyone wins because no
[SPEAKER_01]: one's at risk of that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm trying to organize is a couple
of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is I want to have a pool of ethical
cannabis companies that promise to
[SPEAKER_01]: cooperate with each other in litigation
defense that if they have patents,
[SPEAKER_01]: they put them into that pool so that if,
let's say, someone sues a member of that
[SPEAKER_01]: coalition for patent infringement,
we look to the entire patent pool to see
[SPEAKER_01]: if there's anything in the pool that that
plaintiff is infringing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can make a lawsuit go away
by filing a counterclaim for infringement
[SPEAKER_01]: of your patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, shit, we didn't think about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to sue us for infringing your
patent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll just make this whole thing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's make this whole thing go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as simple as it sounds,
but it's the best chance, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: that a lot of small businesses have to
stand up to big ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that I'm working on to the
point of actually pricing this is a group
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance policy that would provide a
certain significant war chest to spend on
[SPEAKER_01]: litigation defense if a member of the
coalition got sued.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not free.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty pricey.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's spread across enough
companies, it would be a relatively cheap
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance for each company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hesitate to say the numbers because
nothing's final, but it looks like,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this could be completely wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just talked with one insurance
company so far, but it looks like we could
[SPEAKER_01]: have several million dollars worth of
litigation insurance for any member of the
[SPEAKER_01]: coalition for probably maybe $200,000,
which would mean, okay, if we have 200
[SPEAKER_01]: members, it's $1,000 a member.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have 500 members, it's even less.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be prohibitively expensive if we
only have 10 members.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if we can find a way,
and those prices could be completely
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping they'll come lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have to find a way for enough
members to join that it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, this has to be run as a
non-profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody can use this as a way to build
their own business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess somebody could, but that won't be
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we find a way to actually make that
work, it would be nice that people could
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep at night and know that among all the
other problems they're gonna face,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not going to get sued to death by
Big Ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one other thing to say about that is
if that coalition has all of this power as
[SPEAKER_01]: a group, they could also have some
collective bargaining power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's suppose that Big Ag with its
research funding really does come up with
[SPEAKER_01]: something that everybody needs in order to
stay viable in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have the power to negotiate with
them for a group license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to assert all kinds of pressure on
them if they don't grant the license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Public pressure, public perception
pressure, PR pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So none of these solutions is easy,
none of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there are some viable
solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that I'm really
committed to and working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not just by myself, there are some
really good people involved in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's just maybe a statement of the
problems and a ray of hope that this won't
[SPEAKER_01]: be an obstacle that we can't surmount.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much.
