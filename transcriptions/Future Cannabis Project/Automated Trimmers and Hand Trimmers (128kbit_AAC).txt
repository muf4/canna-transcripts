[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use automatic trimming?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because that kind of goes back to a
balanced system, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if we have like a 20,000 square
feet of canopy, you know, we're harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: about a little over 2,000 plants every 18
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that kind of, and even there's
still a degree of seasonality in our
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the sun's really weak right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we need we need staff up and
staff down throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we were to hand trim everything,
we would need 70 full time trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens if I'm two days,
you know, ahead of schedule and I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 trimmers like, hey, I'm like,
sorry, gonna take the next couple days
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would piss them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use a light a little bit of
automation when it comes to our trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: to have about a full time workforce of
about 20 full time guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, they get better at their job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to cross train them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they also know a little bit about
trimming, about processing the packaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation, and they like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of my entry level guys and
some of the guys were kind of new.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get to see every part of the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we can move them around because we
are using some of that automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're more bought in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we get to see who's going to be
a good performer instead of just having a
[SPEAKER_00]: head count of like 50, 70 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we are able to reduce our turnover
rate because of that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just by implementing some of those
automations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's important if you're not
if and I think a lot of our peers in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry are still kind of stuck in that
mindset of, well, this is how it's done
[SPEAKER_00]: for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to hand trim it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna do this, gonna hand water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, yeah, that works great at a
craft level.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they want to stay small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Works great when it's illegal also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you don't have to pay payroll
tackers, workers, all this other great
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's in it definitely has to be a part
of the new world that we the new regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: world that we live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those are just sacrifices you have
to make to not get your door kicked down
[SPEAKER_00]: or guys drop in from blackout helicopters
on your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these are just things that we're all
going to have to accept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and we've embraced a lot of that stuff
because we're not trying to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to make the jobs we have
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to pay the one guy who's
running those systems a lot more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give him more opportunities
because we can expand the company that way
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of having, you know, dozens of
minimum wage employees like let's have a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of salaried guys are actually making
money, good benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's for my company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's only two things in my
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's people and plants.
