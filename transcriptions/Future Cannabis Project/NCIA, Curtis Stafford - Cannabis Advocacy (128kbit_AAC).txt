[SPEAKER_00]: The next person I'm going to invite up is
one of our sponsors tonight, National
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Industry Association,
otherwise known as NCIA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to invite Curtis Stafford up
here, BizDev for NCIA, and he's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to you a little bit about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Curtis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Jackie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my name is Curtis Stafford.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the head of business development for
the National Cannabis Industry
[SPEAKER_01]: Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you who are not familiar with
NCIA, we are the national trade
[SPEAKER_01]: organization as well as the national
lobbying group in D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sum it up kind of very easily in two
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two main offices.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a Denver office and a D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: office.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Denver office handles our member
benefits, our associations, affiliations,
[SPEAKER_01]: state organizations, so it's just CCIA,
the California Cannabis Industry
[SPEAKER_01]: Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys should be very familiar with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a conference coming up in
Anaheim in September.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, let's get to the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who here thinks they're a good person?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you heard me say this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so our Attorney General Jeff
Sessions says that good people don't smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who here still thinks they're a good
person?
[SPEAKER_01]: What have you all been smoking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who here thinks our industry should have
access to banking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who here thinks that our industry should
have the same rights for tax deductions in
[SPEAKER_01]: the federal level as any other industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who here thinks that patients and
nonviolent offenders should not spend
[SPEAKER_01]: years in prison?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys all apparently think the work
that we're doing in D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: is good work because you're good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta always say that NCIA, we're kind
of the bridge between some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: nonprofits, the local level, and the
businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an awkward place to be sometimes,
but it's really the ability to build a
[SPEAKER_01]: bridge to that gap and to make sure that
we're part of the community and to hold
[SPEAKER_01]: our businesses accountable as well as
everyone else in the community accountable
[SPEAKER_01]: on the same level.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys have any questions about our
membership or anything else, please come
[SPEAKER_01]: find me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big shout out to Jackie and everyone else
who put on this event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And support all of your nonprofits from
the local level all the way up to the D.C.
Thank you.
