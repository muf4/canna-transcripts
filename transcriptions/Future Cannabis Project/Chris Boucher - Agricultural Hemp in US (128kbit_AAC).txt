[SPEAKER_02]: I had a company back in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I opened one of the first hemp companies
in 1990, and we started making hats,
[SPEAKER_02]: wallets, and bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I might have told you that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I started the HIA Hemp Industries
Association in 1992.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw a bunch of hemp companies open up
that were making hemp clothing,
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp foods.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we decided to have an industry
organization that we can lobby and
[SPEAKER_02]: further, you know, open up, you know,
the hemp industry for America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in 1994, I grew a field of hemp
at the USDA research facility in Imperial
[SPEAKER_02]: Valley, California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was an historic moment in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1994, you know, on federal property
growing, you know, half a million plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, over an acre of hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was quite a milestone.
[SPEAKER_01]: This field you see behind me here is a
hemp field.
[SPEAKER_01]: The location you're looking at is Baralea,
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an historical moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first hemp field to be grown
legally in America in over 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're doing here is an experiment to
enhance the fiber agricultural industry
[SPEAKER_01]: and also the seed oil industry and create
jobs at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: These fields are strictly for data
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was convinced within two or three years
hemp would be legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't until 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our goal was to research hemp farming here
in California and determine how much a
[SPEAKER_02]: farmer could make per acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what would the yields be of the
fiber?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many pounds of seed per acre they
would be able to get?
[SPEAKER_02]: What the prices were and what the
distribution model.
[SPEAKER_02]: But more importantly, what it would cost
the farmer to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We found out that the average farmer could
make three times more than he was making
[SPEAKER_02]: for corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make more than he was growing for cotton.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when people started looking at the
data from this research project,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, it's taken, you know,
20 years of lobbying, legislation,
[SPEAKER_02]: and education of the people to grow hemp
again in this country.
[SPEAKER_02]: The world has a monopoly on United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: United States is the only country probably
in the free world that doesn't grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the English grow it, the French
grow it, the Chinese grow it, the Russians
[SPEAKER_02]: grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can go on and on.
[SPEAKER_02]: In America, we just started growing it
last year at research.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a DEA license, so it's really
restrictive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, the Canadians control most of
the food market, and the Europeans control
[SPEAKER_02]: most of the CBD market, and the Chinese
control most of the textile market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have these dynamics set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think in the next three to five
years, if we can, you know, re-kickstart
[SPEAKER_02]: this American hemp, you know, economic
model, I think we'll see America become a
[SPEAKER_02]: global leader in hemp products,
and cannabis will be leading the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to revitalize rural
communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here in America, you know, we have a lot
of rural farming communities, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: them have been hit really hard,
especially your family farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this country was, you know,
founded on agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, we were a
carbohydrate-based economy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've switched over now to a
petroleum-based economy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we can go back to that original,
you know, eco-economical business model of
[SPEAKER_02]: being able to build infrastructure in
these rural communities, build these hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: processing factories for seed oil,
for fiber, for CBD, for CBG, and we can
[SPEAKER_02]: pay the farmer 10 times more than he's
getting for cotton, 10 times more than
[SPEAKER_02]: he's getting for corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matter of fact, in Kentucky this year,
a couple of the farmers from the research
[SPEAKER_02]: there determined that they made three
times more than they did for tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 10 times more than they did for corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: So taking those numbers, I mean,
economically speaking, what would it do
[SPEAKER_02]: for these communities that would really
enhance them and create jobs and build
[SPEAKER_02]: factories, and I think that's what we need
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kickstart the, you know, hemp industry,
which would revitalize family farms and
[SPEAKER_02]: American agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's considered legalized in Kentucky,
and the reason being is the Department of
[SPEAKER_02]: Agriculture has contracted with local
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Kentucky Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the Kentucky Department of
Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so part of the research, not just in
yields and, you know, tonnage per acre,
[SPEAKER_02]: the research in sales and marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, can you make a finished product
from your farm and sell it in the American
[SPEAKER_02]: economy?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's research and development.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so research of the sales and
marketing, shipping, how much did it cost
[SPEAKER_02]: you to ship it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what was your customer base?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the legislation in Kentucky,
even in the United States, basically makes
[SPEAKER_02]: it legal in that sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're allowed to receive money in
profits for your research and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kentucky is still in the research
phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the next stage for Kentucky,
and are they going there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the next stage would be for
full-scale commercial operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably next year, the year after.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, technically next year,
if you had the money, you could grow
[SPEAKER_02]: 10,000 acres in Kentucky, as long as you
checked out okay with the Department of
[SPEAKER_02]: Agriculture, and they would issue you a
MOU.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you had that MOU, you would
basically be doing your research for
[SPEAKER_02]: sales, marketing, growing, the whole deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hypothetically, a year from now,
a Kentucky farmer can legally grow
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial or agricultural hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can he then sell the finished good,
whether it's seeds or hemp oil or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever?
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, right now, they can sell
anything the plant produces.
[SPEAKER_02]: So within the federal law, if you read the
definition of what's legal, there's the
[SPEAKER_02]: word ANY, any part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, my interpretation of any
means everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything on the plant, as long as a THC
level is 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD level could be 10%, it could be 2%.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so, and you're getting so much
investment moving into Kentucky right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what happens this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: In order for it to be research and
development of the sales and marketing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd have to be able to ship to all 50
states.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're allowed, if you grow it in
Kentucky, you could ship to Alaska,
[SPEAKER_02]: Florida, Maine, Nebraska, 100% legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see sort of a race among states
that realize the economic impact this crop
[SPEAKER_00]: could have to legalize, like Kentucky,
you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kentucky is a different situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the political willpower there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have politicians that are willing to
fight the DEA.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're willing to fight the federal
government in order to let their farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't scare very easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most politicians, in my 25 years in the
business, once they started moving forward
[SPEAKER_02]: with, you know, hemp legislation or hemp
legalization, you had law enforcement,
[SPEAKER_02]: you had DEA come and visit them,
and they completely shut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the only people in the last 25
years that I've seen that didn't back down
[SPEAKER_02]: from law enforcement, DEA, and the federal
government.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, we have a right to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do not scare us, and we will not,
you know, accept your threats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the universities, when it was legal,
the DEA threatened to pull all their
[SPEAKER_02]: federal funding for the entire school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the politicians, McConnell,
Rand Paul, Representative Massey,
[SPEAKER_02]: they stepped in and said, you can't do
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a threat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I don't want to get
political, but, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes, because they had politicians that
wouldn't back down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I was trying to say was,
in my 25 years, every politician I've ever
[SPEAKER_02]: dealt with has always backed down when the
DEA threatens them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was just the way it had to be
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Farmers don't have to go through the DEA
to get their seeds, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should be able to buy their seeds,
like you buy corn seeds, soybean seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that changes as we move
forward, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Kentucky, Colorado is doing the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have Tennessee that's growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, you know, the momentum in
Kentucky is like nothing I've seen in 25
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so those would be like the three
leading states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kentucky, Colorado, then Tennessee for Ag
Camp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you look at Kentucky,
it's a unique situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have all the coal mines shut down,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, mountaintop removal is not
happening anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the economy was based upon coal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got unemployment rates somewhere
in the 20 percent in some counties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you take in the factor of
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are all the tobacco growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all those subsidies are gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, all these factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have really high unemployment
rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Farming is down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this would supplement these
communities that would really help the
[SPEAKER_02]: state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of other states that are
in the same position, but specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
