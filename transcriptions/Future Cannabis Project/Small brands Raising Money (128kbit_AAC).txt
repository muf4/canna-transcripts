[SPEAKER_01]: Navigating the regulations, trying to
figure out how to get into the market,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to get into the market legally,
how to build partnerships that are
[SPEAKER_01]: scalable has been, you know, a big part of
what we've been trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the fundraising side,
there's obviously like a lot of interest
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, finding those partners that can
bring value as well as those partners that
[SPEAKER_01]: are strategically aligned to the type of
growth that you want to have and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping those, especially as I guess
outsiders to the industry is not those
[SPEAKER_01]: that have been in the gray market.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that's been important to
us, though, has been actually working with
[SPEAKER_01]: small farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have an established relationship
with a licensed farm in Medicino.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of the pushback we've actually
gotten from some investors as well as as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as some manufacturers that we've
talked about partnering with has been,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, like, you don't need to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we've got this stuff that's grown in
this warehouse and you should just roll
[SPEAKER_01]: forward with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much cheaper and it's much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like we can make that happen much
quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So finding those partners that have that
value alignment has been a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult for us, but something that we're
working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's your product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the product, Drew Martin, is a line of
botanically infused pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis with specific blends of
botanicals that have been formulated by
[SPEAKER_01]: Drew Martin himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Herbalist.
That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one.
