[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk sunlight and light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so what people sort of forget is
that when the sunlight hits that plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 to 60 percent of the photosynthetic
energy is used not to produce the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: flower, not to produce the leaves or the
stem, but to produce carbon exudase that
[SPEAKER_01]: drip out into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the quality of light has everything to
do with the quality of the exudase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the efficiency of the plant being able
to produce those exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those exudates are what attract the
bacteria and the fungi to feed the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, blah, blah, blah, teeming with
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have bad light, then you are not
impacting the plant properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: A.
[SPEAKER_01]: B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these microbes are sensitive to
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these microbes are photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these, you know, so that light has
an impact on them as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other members of the soil food web
are impacted by the light in similar ways,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they in turn have impacts on the
microbes which end up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the whole thing cascades as a result of
the sun hitting that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you use an LED that's missing
green wavelength, because most of them
[SPEAKER_01]: are, they don't need any green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the reason why they say that is
because they can't produce it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's missing the green wavelength.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then, you know, that means that deep
down in that leaf, there are chloroplasts
[SPEAKER_01]: that aren't operating the way they're
supposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the ones on the top are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that green stuff, that's a wave,
and it goes into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does stuff way down deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and so if you're missing that,
you got a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I like the plasma lamp,
because it was invented specifically to
[SPEAKER_01]: mimic the sun's spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you say it sounds like a process of
sitting there for thousands of years on
[SPEAKER_00]: those Aptani Hills?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not just, yeah, for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not just the plants, but us as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, we react to sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I always think about people that
are out there under the indoor grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, working under the LEDs and et
cetera, et cetera, et cetera, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: By plasma, you mean HID light?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, these are called a plasma light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like a plasma lamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a special gas in the
ends.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are really unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little teeny light.
[SPEAKER_01]: One light replaces five or six of these,
you know, big, you know, gravita type
[SPEAKER_01]: lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I like about this plasma light is
talk about to war.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's assume you want to grow Durban
poison in Portland, Oregon, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: or Anchorage, Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now we can dial in the exact
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get the exact wavelength from
Durban, Africa, latitude, longitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dial it in on this plasma lamp and give it
that, and then get the soil from Durban.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the seeds from Durban.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bingo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plasma lights have been around for a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you used to have to have a,
you know, a one for flowering,
[SPEAKER_01]: one for, no, not with this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, the guy who's a Swiss guy invented,
I just met him this weekend and he,
[SPEAKER_01]: his goal was to match the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now when you test a solar panel,
you use this light to test the solar
panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to use the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can test it in the factory.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing else I know that does
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you know, these are not cheap lights,
but the efficiency is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They last two, three, 400,000 hours and
they use no wattage.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as I know, like in Massachusetts,
there's a, oh my God, and no heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, well, they mimic the sun,
but I mean, you know, you'd have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: inside it to get the heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing about it is that the form
factor can be changed so that you can,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you can make it, you can,
depending, the box is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: little, but you can make it long,
or you can make it fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's patented.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's patented and it's being used and it's
being tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being used for the film industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just as a light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being used growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers are using them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hospitals are testing them because of the
mental, it has, and hotels and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, venues because you feel good
under sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all, not headlights yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I can't get them to do yet,
but they're working on it, is to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: little teeny marble size one for my,
you know, six by four grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we really want.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only light I know that,
that I would ever use in Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has a wattage, you know,
restriction.
It's the only light I know that,
that I would ever use in Massachusetts.
