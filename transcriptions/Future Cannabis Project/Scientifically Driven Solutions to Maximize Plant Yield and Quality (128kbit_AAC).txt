[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get the clip notes version for
all of us who missed your presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you want people to take?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the title of your presentation?
[SPEAKER_00]: A scientifically driven solution to
enhance cannabis production and I say with
[SPEAKER_00]: confidence and precision and what I think
about how I structured this was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: holistically conceiving the whole grow
operation, the whole grow environment in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of an ecological ecosystem,
you know, and in nature which is my
[SPEAKER_00]: training and I didn't think I'd ever do
anything besides natural ecology as a
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial ecologist learning about plant
interactions and I did a lot of climate
[SPEAKER_00]: change studies where we look at the
environment, you know, this is traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I love taking that concept and
putting it into the grow room and I tell
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody, you know, there's only one
thing you have to control in precision
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture and it's everything,
you know, it starts with plant genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: it starts and stops with plant genetics
and then I give this 11 parameters for
[SPEAKER_00]: success, you know, and the very last one I
talk about, the very bottom is soil
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have energy and you have temperature
and you have airflow and you have humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have CO2 and you have oxygen in
the rhizosphere below ground and hydrology
[SPEAKER_00]: and root temperature and nutrients and
then there's microbes and the fascinating
[SPEAKER_00]: thing about it is treating that as an
interaction of ecology and you better
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what all of them do and if you
tweak anything you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: change everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to appreciate this,
you know, the typical phenotype formula,
[SPEAKER_00]: P equals genetics plus environment plus
the interaction of genetics times
[SPEAKER_00]: environment plus the standard error
variability over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I present that in my talks in terms of
precision agriculture because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: basically the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start with genetics and then the E is
everything else, everything including
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient inputs and you have to dial in
all those things so this is a huge bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: and then dialing in that interaction and
making sure those right genetics are right
[SPEAKER_00]: for your environment because not all
genetics are meant to grow up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's the photosynthetic
equation too that comes into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so conceptually the growers that are
newer are like, oh, it's beautiful and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of daunting because you're like,
oh, I have all this stuff but once you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the picture, you know the buckets
that you can start working on and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of transition that to talk about the
importance of microbes playing that very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very small part in that ecosystem which is
a huge part and I talk about some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges in nature and nutrient use
efficiencies and how you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize the success of plants and I kind
of talk about how, you know, as a matter
[SPEAKER_00]: of fact, no plant in nature exists without
plant microbe interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they support the success of life
and I talk about the human microbiome,
[SPEAKER_00]: how we know now microbes support all our
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing for plants in every other
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you put microbes in the concept of
that bigger picture of cultivation and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you understand how we can start
formulating microbes with precision and
[SPEAKER_00]: confidence so growers can use these in
precision agriculture settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about targeted function.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about things like shelf life
also, all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can do that and then you can
show the results not only from a
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific point of view, from a microbial
ecologist point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I started like realizing my purpose and
impact of bringing nature and natural
[SPEAKER_00]: processes to agriculture but we're doing
it sustainably, not only because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nature of bringing nature to agriculture
but because we're doing it profitably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't do a lot of things with
success in the market unless you bring
[SPEAKER_00]: profit to your end user.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can align profit with
sustainability, you really have a true
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable technology and so that's kind
of the big picture of the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we go into a lot of details about end
data and you know our publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's about fitting that one soil
microbial piece into the puzzle that's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably everything else in that ecosystem
is not necessarily well understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more and more understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk about the living soil concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just went up to the lift show in Canada
and you know who doesn't have a million
[SPEAKER_00]: square feet up there now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean literally almost every grow I went
to it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those facilities are turning
the whole million into a living soil grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's changed very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're an organic grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You understand that until you understand
it's not like plugging synthetics in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of a process and a
learning curve and you can reap the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits and rewards on the back end if
you can go through that learning stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, yeah and get to know what you're
working with and how to put it all
[SPEAKER_02]: together like you were saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the little factors I feel like
everyone assumes, oh yeah it's just soil
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just put it in there and it's like
well what does each one of those microbes
[SPEAKER_02]: do specifically in your soil biosphere?
[SPEAKER_02]: What other microbes or bacteria is that
interacting with that's causing this to
[SPEAKER_02]: happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gets very intricate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's harder to measure because they're
microscopic and so you're looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: responses when you're adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you really have to have confidence
with manufacturers and make sure they've
[SPEAKER_00]: done their diligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you still have to be diligent and do
your own diligence as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I put it in context of things that you
can measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like think about if you turn your grow
room temperature down 10 degrees or up 10
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees, do your plants respond to that?
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you change your light, does that
change everything from a low intensity to
[SPEAKER_00]: high intensity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what if you double the CO2 in a room?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to change everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the microbial component is the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little more finesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And microbes don't help any of those
macroenvironmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to get that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it allows younger growers to fix a lot
of problems if there's some nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: lockout and really add that component
which isn't as measurable except for on
[SPEAKER_00]: the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see significant increases in
quality and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can maximize what I think the
phenotypic potential of the plant because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're maximizing the overall plant's
potential to be healthy through those
[SPEAKER_00]: right healthy rhizosphere interactions and
nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've also talked to many growers
who are completely maxed out they've
[SPEAKER_00]: dialed in the room perfectly and there's
that one missing component and all of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden it's that catalyst just to up it to
the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not seeing the same delta or
increase in yield as the newer growers but
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting that extra 5% that they
never thought they could achieve.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting that little bit extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that top 5% is a hugely difficult
percent to get because they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing the plant and being precision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I love thinking about using nature
and natural processes and microbes in
[SPEAKER_00]: general with precision because that's a
new concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: To bring them together to create something
that is far superior than anything you
[SPEAKER_02]: could create before that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I geek out on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell I'm pretty passionate about
it.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Microbes rule the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Microbes and bacteria rule the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever done any research or has
anybody on like light and microbes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think of like sunlight and then
indoor lights and then I also think of
[SPEAKER_01]: light affects the plant which exudes you
know to it sends out sugars to attract the
[SPEAKER_01]: right microbes but then also certain
microbes react to sunlight.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think about that latter part as
much as I think about that first part and
[SPEAKER_00]: you think about the response.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't measure anything directly and
it's very challenging because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with microscopic life but if you
can improve the energy and the resources,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to improve the photosynthate
and if you improve that food source,
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the food source, squirt it into
the rhizostate priming, basically sugars,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to maximize or improve and
increase the microbial diversity,
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbial activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to measure that over a
period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote some papers early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called it VPMI for the study and it was
called Visualizing Plant Microbe
[SPEAKER_00]: Interactions where I had four different
grasses and an invasive grass,
[SPEAKER_00]: cheatgrass, and I did an infield
experiment and a greenhouse experiment and
[SPEAKER_00]: over time we would look at how different
grasses, as an example in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, the same climate,
might differentially influence the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizostate microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hypothesis was that maybe
cheatgrass, which is an invasive grass
[SPEAKER_00]: that's taken over the U.S., it was planted
naturally because it was a fast-growing
[SPEAKER_00]: grass and it turns out like every other
biological transplant that it wasn't that
[SPEAKER_00]: great of an idea because it's too
aggressive, it dies quick, you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: story, but I thought maybe cheatgrass as a
hypothesis is even more successful because
[SPEAKER_00]: they can nurture specific rhizosphere
microbiome to enhance nutrient cycling to
[SPEAKER_00]: make them more competitive and so that was
the basis of that study and it turns out
[SPEAKER_00]: the study supported that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's published in Soul, Biology,
and Biogeochemistry and that's an example
[SPEAKER_00]: where we just start thinking about the
plant by itself and these different
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars or species being able to
influence that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very difficult to measure that
because you have to measure it over time
[SPEAKER_00]: and it takes a lot of finesse,
a lot of methodology, and we're equipped
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that, but it takes a lot of
destructive harvesting also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes a real experimental design to
get to that resolution and a lot of it's
[SPEAKER_00]: correlative and so the questions actually
initiate tons of hypotheses and the
[SPEAKER_00]: research isn't very well established yet
on those exact mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like any other ecology system,
we used to do plant microbe interactions
[SPEAKER_00]: in a whole series of global climate change
experiments where we would have rain out
[SPEAKER_00]: and we would have extra rain and we would
have heating pads and CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this space study in Wyoming it was
awesome, super geeked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of money went into that trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, figuring out all the different
variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to measure all these
variables separately and put them together
[SPEAKER_00]: in modeling and then modeling is flowing
this together and there's a level of error
[SPEAKER_00]: and so there's such a huge road ahead of
us and really understanding how those
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions and that's the biggest
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of network analysis is a new tool
that comes up to allow us to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: more real-time what those responses that
you're talking about, Peter, are,
[SPEAKER_00]: but tying those together is a very
challenging thing for scientists right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well how about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have an R&D capability.
[SPEAKER_01]: What in the past let's say four years are
some of the things you've researched and
[SPEAKER_01]: what were the results?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a great question and here's
where it distinguishes at some point a
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamental research program and applied
research program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had to bridge the gap and it's a
very painful thing to do for any
[SPEAKER_00]: scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you want to ask questions from
the very beginning and follow it through
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way and you're never going to get
to the end of what really matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make these assumptions that oh I saw
this little mechanism early on in planting
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you make this bold statement in
academia and so that of course is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: lead to increased plant health quality and
yield but you're not measuring often plant
[SPEAKER_00]: health quality and yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We realize at the very end when you talk
to farmers and farmers want to see plant
[SPEAKER_00]: health quality and yield data that if
you're going to turn your science program
[SPEAKER_00]: into an applied science program,
you better provide that data for the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer and you do that by completely
flipping your train of thought and you
[SPEAKER_00]: take a leap of faith that what you're
doing is interacting with the plant the
[SPEAKER_00]: way you think you know it is from your
expertise and years of study but you
[SPEAKER_00]: measure plant health quality and yield and
then you start reverse engineering what
[SPEAKER_00]: those mechanisms are and you measure a
couple along the way but the details are
[SPEAKER_00]: very involved and it takes a lot of time
and a ton of resources and so we poor
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on early on and now on our early
research programs the needle that moves
[SPEAKER_00]: the influencer hurdle from farmers if we
have a rooting agent for an example or a
[SPEAKER_00]: microbe that we think is going to instate
rooting there's a lot of mechanisms into
[SPEAKER_00]: that but what I want to know for sure is
this rooting increase and you know I can
[SPEAKER_00]: measure mechanisms in a thousand different
samples and never get to that but if you
[SPEAKER_00]: measure a thousand samples for increased
root growth and then you find that
[SPEAKER_00]: increased root growth and then you say
okay what's happening here and you start
[SPEAKER_00]: making hypothesis there and measure
certain things in the next study and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know we've just had this this huge r&d
team for the last 18 months and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking years five-year study well you
just start spider webbing off in all these
[SPEAKER_02]: new directions and it's like well this is
happening over here and this is going on
[SPEAKER_02]: at the same time over here we should
probably both look at both of these and
[SPEAKER_00]: see what happens and then it takes that
then the fundamental aspects of the
[SPEAKER_00]: science kick in and and then then as a
co-founder of a company and for some be
[SPEAKER_00]: like wait a minute we have our metric for
success we can't understand all the
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms right now we have a company we
have a scientific company and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring repeatable end results and we
have to do that and we have to measure and
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes them hypothesis to make sure we
know some modes of action but to know the
[SPEAKER_00]: complete sequence of interactions and and
in chemical synthesis or chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions and signaling that make that
happen it's not economically feasible at
[SPEAKER_00]: the company price private company level
and that's what you do all day long in
[SPEAKER_00]: academia you never get to that end game
but you geek out on the details yeah and
[SPEAKER_02]: that yeah all what he was saying tied
right back into how effectively the
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients can make their way into the
plant and how effectively you know the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment is allowing for photosynthesis
to take place between chlorophyll and a
[SPEAKER_02]: and b production and yeah carbohydrates
and all that there's a hundred parameters
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to measure to get a kid to get a
chance at a snapshot of what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: and you got to remember if you collect
data at day five of a plant growth and day
[SPEAKER_00]: ten and day fifteen and day twenty you
know you have one snapshot at one time of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day and then things happen on a daily
cycle not a weekly cycle and so there's
[SPEAKER_00]: all these assumptions you have to make
even when you're collecting this
[SPEAKER_01]: ecological data at that level yeah so
another random question if you took a
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon of super happy microbes and put
half in a living soil environment and half
[SPEAKER_01]: you put into like synthetic fertilizer
what what's going on with like are those
[SPEAKER_00]: ones just totally unhappy so I would say a
general statement absolutely and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you why because they haven't evolved
in that environment you know if you take
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes directly from soil we could do
this tomorrow I could go show you how to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow microbes and we'll grow a bunch of
them from whatever source you want I'm an
[SPEAKER_00]: expert to grow microbes and we take them
directly from soil and we grow them up
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty quickly that first growing event
you're gonna lose over 50% of the microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: that existed in that soil because you put
them in an environment they haven't been
[SPEAKER_00]: able to evolve into and you have to ease
them into any new environment and so
[SPEAKER_00]: you've knocked out 50% this generally you
know I haven't counted but I've
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced this before and so you're only
capturing the readily culturable microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: that will grow in two or three day period
not that grow over a ten day period or not
[SPEAKER_00]: that can't grow well or just got over
competed so you automatically bias that
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you separate those and we'll grow
them up and we put half in a living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and half in a salt high salt
environment what you're gonna have is a
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil environment that more
naturally mimics a soil condition there
[SPEAKER_00]: they're from and so in general
hypothetically this is hypothesis most of
[SPEAKER_00]: those microbes are much more those
microbes will survive in that soil because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's an environment that mimics their
environment that they evolved into
[SPEAKER_00]: initially the other half they just got put
in a very environmentally stressful
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and you're gonna knock out
probably 90% of them that's one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: findings that we found when we were
culturing microbes and talking to farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: before we started our R&D back at the
University when I heard from a farmer that
[SPEAKER_00]: he loved the idea of using precision
microbes like we were hypothesizing
[SPEAKER_00]: creating and that the only way that he was
going to use them because he couldn't make
[SPEAKER_00]: a special trip over his field to apply to
the field too much fuel too much cost he
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't change a thing so he was gonna
take any microbe that I gave him and dump
[SPEAKER_00]: it in a hot fertilizer tank and spread it
at the same time I had an aha moment I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought whoa I don't think microbes can do
that and the truth is most of them can't
[SPEAKER_00]: so you have to understand and that's why I
love what we've done with mammoth pea we
[SPEAKER_00]: understood that going into the R&D not
after the fact and we understood that we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to evolve microbes to be able to
withstand that environment or weed them
[SPEAKER_00]: out through selection before we took them
to market because then they wouldn't be a
[SPEAKER_00]: viable product and so if that if that kind
of told the story most microbes can't
[SPEAKER_00]: survive any transplant some can and very
very few can bridge that gap yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: okay thank you you you you you you you you
you you you
