[SPEAKER_03]: High THC is not, except for pain,
isn't really needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to have you guys comment on
what you see in terms of CBN, CBG,
[SPEAKER_03]: THCA, the whole host of things which we
know have medical value.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't hear you talk much about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would like to have, you know,
the Swami is talking about spiritual and
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Rader is talking about medical.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think those are two somewhat
different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to hear what you have to say
about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'll jump right in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think that one of the things we
are going to see with regulation is
[SPEAKER_05]: increased availability of some of the
cannabinoids we currently don't have
[SPEAKER_05]: access to.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a huge CBD bubble in the world
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been told there's as much as 50,000
kilos of CBD basically sitting around the
[SPEAKER_05]: world right now going nowhere just because
everybody decided, oh, we're going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: in the CBD business.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I want to see is I want to see
THCV.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see CBDV.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see some of these really weird
breakdown products.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there are only really,
everybody always says, there's 120
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, there aren't.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are four cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there are their breakdown
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK?
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are propyl variants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But some of these breakdown products,
these are metabolites.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have different effects.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've only started to explore them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think that exploring from a
medicinal standpoint, the incredible
[SPEAKER_05]: utility of this plant is amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we're going to be doing it for
decades, which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the coolest parts about
legalization and recreational marijuana or
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational marijuana becoming illegal is
our cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the medical side of things can
concentrate on what's best for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The recreational side of things can
concentrate on what's best for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's somewhere in the middle that's
maybe nutraceutical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take your daily cannabis supplement for
general health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I don't have a specific wellness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't necessarily see them as
having to be completely different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's more of a bell curve than
necessarily a black and white issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is about testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh, you mentioned that somebody asked
you to retest it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the problem that I have with
testing labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the edible business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to be exact by my standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: My standards are very severe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet when I test it, it comes back,
how could that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they test it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And OK, now it's accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just send it back to you to
retest it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you retest it and found out in their
favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can anybody, me, feel comfortable
and secure in paying for a testing lab
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's not accurate?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, well, so there's a lot of issues with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with edibles, it gets to be this whole
kind of conflated issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, with edibles,
I have this presentation I do about
[SPEAKER_02]: stratified sampling and testing multiple
samples through a production run and
[SPEAKER_02]: having some sort of idea of the variance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a number of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, edibles are extremely hard to test.
[SPEAKER_02]: To bring a sample into a testing lab that
sees a cookie, a gummy bear, a piece of
[SPEAKER_02]: beef jerky, and all these things as
edibles, they're all completely different
[SPEAKER_02]: tests and really need their own validated
test for each one of those types of
[SPEAKER_02]: samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're testing completely
different products.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I test a gummy bear versus a brownie,
it's a completely different extraction
[SPEAKER_02]: process, a completely different test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the testing lab needs to have different
procedures for the different types of
[SPEAKER_02]: edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, again, we're really glad to
see people with budgets get into this
[SPEAKER_02]: because a lot of your edible producers
don't want to spend the money they really
[SPEAKER_02]: should be spending to make a proper
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was producing, say, omega-3 infused
gummies, each production run, I'd be doing
[SPEAKER_02]: dozens of tests throughout that production
run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, do I run hot at the very beginning of
the run and then about 10 units in,
[SPEAKER_02]: all of a sudden it starts to level off and
I get homogeneity?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also the issue with edibles is one
side of the cookie, completely different
[SPEAKER_02]: than the other side of the cookie.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many chocolate chips did you put in
the cookie?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are the chocolate chips infused?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think what we get is we get
edible makers that bring in one cookie
[SPEAKER_02]: from one batch and then the next batch,
and these are the ones that are doing a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of testing, and then the next batch
they bring in one cookie and they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, last batch it was 30% higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on here?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, the next cookie off the
line would have been 50% higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have an idea of what your
production process is doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could go on and on about all the
problems with edible standardization.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me jump into one thing on that,
which is the idea is that in every other
[SPEAKER_05]: industry, a winemaker doesn't go down
always to the wine testing lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: The winemaker has a lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that what you're going to see
is that you're going to see a lot more
[SPEAKER_05]: companies take this in and then go to
somebody who's an expert and say,
[SPEAKER_05]: test my testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think that's going to become a
lot more prevalent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you hear a retest, I mean,
that's most often because they didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: believe the value.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't because the lab is trying to
give them what they want to hear.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very important distinction.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, flower testing can be hugely
variable.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the top of the plant can be twice as
much as the bottom.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how do I homogenize my entire batch so
that I can get a good, accurate value
[SPEAKER_06]: across the entire picture?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really the goal of testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll see this whole standardization
effort be forced upon us with regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to be required to do
statistically valid testing, not just one
[SPEAKER_06]: sample, not just a sample, but across your
batch, and make sure that that distributor
[SPEAKER_06]: actually really knows what's on the label
of their product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, when you look at the composition
of, let's say, alcoholic beverages,
[SPEAKER_05]: like wine, you don't go in and pick up a
bottle of wine and go, oh, I wonder what
[SPEAKER_05]: the expression of terpenaline is in this
cabernet.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason is that you're buying the wine.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're buying the totality, the gestalt of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now, I think we're getting a
little too granular sometimes in our look
[SPEAKER_05]: at this product.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may not be as easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may not be as easily sliced and diced
as everybody wants it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just need to have a well-characterized,
safe, pure product.
[SPEAKER_07]: My question was kind of a little obscure
on the future of pot, but how much in the
[SPEAKER_07]: past and the traditions of the past have
had some type of possibly
[SPEAKER_07]: biological-relevant or
pharmacologically-relevant benefits?
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing that's coming to mind is if any
of you have ever tried the Malawi cobs?
[SPEAKER_07]: And my question's kind of to what could
have happened there to where you take a
[SPEAKER_07]: fresh cola and you wrap it in a certain
type of leaf, you bury it in the ground,
[SPEAKER_07]: and there's this decomposing process.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I'm wondering what kind of
degradative terpenes, unique kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: degradative cannabinoids come about,
because it's like this whole legend of
[SPEAKER_07]: this thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: This process, and is there anything
relevant to that?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the hive from aflatoxin?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, honestly, because I remember there
was a whole phase in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll remember this, Swami.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a whole phase for a while where
people were burying their weed and pulling
[SPEAKER_05]: it out of the ground and saying,
man, this mold gets you.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's really interesting, all the guys
who were promoting that died relatively
[SPEAKER_05]: young.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, oh, yeah, Fred, he checked out
at about 47.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that there are indigenous
techniques that we're going to learn from.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that, I mean, I think Malawi
is a great place where there's a whole
[SPEAKER_05]: tradition of these gold lighter strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Colombia, the Colombian golds were
often created by breaking the primary stem
[SPEAKER_05]: on the plant and bleaching it out right
before it was finally harvested.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's a whole tradition of
stressing the plant in many ways.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people used to drive a spike right
through the base of the stalk and so on.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to put a shout out for Panama
Red.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody remember Panama Red?
[SPEAKER_10]: Psychedelic, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: So high kareofling strain, OK?
[SPEAKER_05]: Strains that smell like pepper are
basically high bated kareofling strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's funny is the closest thing out
there are some of the cookies variants now
[SPEAKER_05]: that are super, super high in kareofling
and relatively low in myrcine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want some opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question here that I've been
listening to some of the panels over the
[SPEAKER_04]: last few days, and I've heard a lot of
lawyers speak, tell us about how you can't
[SPEAKER_04]: patent strains and you're not going to be
able to do these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I didn't hear anybody talk about the
future of how a breeder such as ourselves
[SPEAKER_04]: are going to go into the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: And other than the old term hoarding
strains, I'd like to know if anybody up
[SPEAKER_04]: here can give us any practical advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: On how we're going to go into the future
creating this intellectual property and
[SPEAKER_04]: identifying it and owning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking with Andrea Brooks yesterday,
I'm one of the panelists.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spoke to her afterwards about the idea
of patenting these different strains that
[SPEAKER_01]: are cultivars, I should say, that people
are getting just from crossing endlessly
[SPEAKER_01]: crossing these hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you come up with something
unique, once you put it out in the public
[SPEAKER_01]: domain, you sell clones of it or you sell
seeds of it or whatever, it's gone in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of your patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to patent it first before it is
ever commercialized.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that really the patents
besides that, the patents that will really
[SPEAKER_01]: make a big difference are the ones that
are about disease control.
[SPEAKER_01]: About having resistance to botrytis and PM
and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that somebody who finds those
genes and incorporates them into strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really going to be something.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can address a little bit this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So plant variety rights, that's one kind
of plant patent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can't prevent somebody from
breeding with your plant, which is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: That means innovation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can have your version of strawberry
cough.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there's no prior art out there that
precludes that, or if nobody can say,
[SPEAKER_05]: he's actually growing my plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can prove it to the satisfaction of
the patent office that you're novel and
[SPEAKER_05]: meet all the requirements for that
particular kind of plant, as long as it's
[SPEAKER_05]: clonally propagated, or probably tissue
propagated, you're cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seed, you're not cool at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a deposit actually has to be that
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now a utility patent, which I got,
a utility patent on cannabis is that you
[SPEAKER_05]: have a class that is novel.
[SPEAKER_05]: We bred a group of cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And man, I'll tell you, the patent office,
because we were the first application,
[SPEAKER_05]: they are really trying to bust us.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were sending us results from
Analytical 360 in Washington about a CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: crew variety from the south of Spain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had to drive all over the West Coast
getting samples of these varieties and
[SPEAKER_05]: test them with a validated method and
submit them to the patent office.
[SPEAKER_05]: For every rejection letter we got.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that went on for months and months and
months until finally they said,
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, you win.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the patent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have a patent on a very narrow
range of type 2s, CBD and THC together,
[SPEAKER_05]: that don't produce myrcine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the key.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because finding high myrcine plants with
CBD in them, that's super easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Finding CBD plants that don't have myrcine
in them, that's really hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_05]: We spent three years breeding it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can get a patent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two comments.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody said that here is cannabis,
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here is medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the FDA.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: And no one talked about integrating all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem with medicine, as far as I'm
concerned, and I've been in it for my
[SPEAKER_09]: entire life, is that we have so siloed
every specialty, every new thing that's
[SPEAKER_09]: come along, and the worst thing we want is
to be siloed as a different alternative
[SPEAKER_09]: oppositional type of therapy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the real success is going to be if we
follow the biopsychosocial model.
[SPEAKER_09]: All chronic disease involves all those
aspects.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what kind of combination of specific
cannabinoids, of specific cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_09]: plants with other types of traditional and
medical treatments is going to really help
[SPEAKER_09]: that particular patient in front of you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all the rest, I think, is just going
to drive a wedge in us that the AMA and
[SPEAKER_09]: FDA and pharma just are very happy to see
happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can talk to that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just met Dave at lunch the other day,
and we had a wonderful little
[SPEAKER_10]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I thank you for that question,
because I actually don't think there's a
[SPEAKER_10]: difference between what's called
recreational and medicinal use.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really don't think that's the case at
all.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are people who say, well,
I want to just have fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, how many medicines are out there for
mood alteration?
[SPEAKER_10]: How many medicines are out there with
unbelievable side effects?
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that the spiritual aspect of
cannabis is essentially why it heals,
[SPEAKER_10]: and all the different specific ways that
it heals.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're going to have Jeff and various
people pinpoint that for us when you need
[SPEAKER_10]: it for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think they did tests with CBD.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know about the, they repressed CBD,
and these people got suicidal when they
[SPEAKER_10]: had a drug that repressed.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have CBD.
[SPEAKER_10]: We need CBD as our basic health wellness
in our body.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't think there's really a
difference.
[SPEAKER_10]: We use this cannabis to alter our
consciousness and to elevate us,
[SPEAKER_10]: and that's part of the healing process.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, I find it a false dichotomy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also think that we do want to have,
we do want all the muggles to be here.
[SPEAKER_10]: We want it to be mainstream, because it's
really an essential part of really coming
[SPEAKER_10]: alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I write books on efficient cannabis use,
and my specialty is low dose cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless you're a grower like Kyle Cushman
or Swami, these two are brothers from
[SPEAKER_08]: another mother to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Smoking a joint is the least efficient way
to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: For the average user, they're wasting
their money.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the cannabis strains that are
available today, one hit is enough to get
[SPEAKER_08]: you completely high, and then you put your
joint out, and when you light it again,
[SPEAKER_08]: you just get a massive dose of
hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any comments, Swami, Kyle Cushman,
the board?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of the things that I think is
wrong, well, I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on a team that was consulting with a
group from Vegas who wanted to build a
[SPEAKER_01]: grow and so forth, and the investors were
absolutely fascinated by how strong the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars that we had and we had to offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at a certain point, I said,
you're really looking at this the wrong
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, most of your people are not going
to be native Las Vegans.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be tourists coming in
here, and they're going to get their
[SPEAKER_01]: medical thing here, which they thought at
the time that would happen, and then go
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're going to buy something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, you're going to sell them
joints that have 20% THC in them?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have a bad experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're naive, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to smoke that joint,
and they're going to say, oh, I forgot how
[SPEAKER_01]: to breathe.
[SPEAKER_01]: My heart is exploding.
[SPEAKER_01]: This sort of thing, and they're going to
end up in the emergency ward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, you don't want that experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, you could much more easily just
roll up leaves from this stuff and have 5%
[SPEAKER_01]: THC join as their first experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we were smoking stuff back in the
60s and 70s that was like 2% to 3% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a great time with it, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so the idea of having these
massive amounts, to me, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the idea that you're wasting this,
the point is this stuff is not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: that expensive, and especially if you're
growing it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I throw away when I'm finished
with that joint probably what most people
[SPEAKER_01]: start their joints with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me jump in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one thing that we didn't talk about in
the evolution of cannabis is the evolution
[SPEAKER_05]: of dose, OK?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a whole other panel,
and I hope we have it someday because the
[SPEAKER_05]: future of this is understanding that a lot
of the constituents of cannabis exhibit
[SPEAKER_05]: biphasic dose.
[SPEAKER_05]: In other words, it does one thing at one
dose and one thing at another.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's this whole interesting
concept, and there's a bunch of really
[SPEAKER_05]: cool papers by GW Guy, found at GW
Pharmaceuticals, about hormesis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hormesis is this idea of a very,
very, very small dose, actually causing a
[SPEAKER_05]: profound change in an organism.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it works on scientific levels.
[SPEAKER_05]: It works on spiritual levels.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fascinating, fascinating topic,
and there's a scientist in Israel who's
[SPEAKER_05]: been doing research on showing that your
first dose of THC is neurotoxic,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it works almost like an inoculant,
like a vaccine, all right, to adjust how
[SPEAKER_05]: you will respond to a phytocannabinoid
from that point forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy's published like six or seven
really good papers, and he's from a really
[SPEAKER_05]: prestigious university in Israel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what it is is that we don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll tell you one thing that I do know
is we don't have a good conception of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis dose today and that part of the
evolution of our discussion about cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: will take that focus towards dose.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's room in this tent for
somebody who wants to smoke a joint,
[SPEAKER_05]: and there's room in this tent for somebody
who wants to take a hit.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, the microdose, people are
talking about microdosing quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're done.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're done.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't microdose.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't microdose.
