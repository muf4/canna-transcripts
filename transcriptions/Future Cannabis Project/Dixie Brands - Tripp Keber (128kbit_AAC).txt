[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to pay attention what's on
the front of this magazine, but more
[SPEAKER_00]: importantly on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the more important side of this
magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my perspective, but first and
foremost, I want to thank very much the
[SPEAKER_00]: producers of this event, the state of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a privilege to represent what I
believe are thousands, if not tens of
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of entrepreneurs, men and women
that are truly beginning to prosper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd actually like to get a show of hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who here is from California?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that is terrific from my perspective
because I've been reflecting for the last
[SPEAKER_00]: 45 minutes to an hour when the last time I
spoke to the cannabis industry in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest with you, this may be my
official first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you guys will be kind and
gentle to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been here for about a week now
and it is incredibly exciting to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: is taking place in your state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody in this room would agree
that it was a disappointment, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Colorado legalized marijuana for
adult use in advance of California and
[SPEAKER_00]: then to rub salt into the wound,
then Washington State did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody has worked harder to legalize adult
use cannabis in the United States than
[SPEAKER_00]: your home state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm incredibly proud of what you guys
have accomplished.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it really deserves certainly more
than a five second round of applause.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have made tireless effort,
made massive sacrifice, and I can feel it
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've been in the market,
albeit only a week, as a sales
[SPEAKER_00]: professional, literally carrying my wares.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are finally successfully launched
my brand, which is that of Dixie Brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through affiliate manufacturing
partnership with Indus Holdings out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Monterey, California, Monterey County,
we are successfully distributing infused
[SPEAKER_00]: products in the state serving today
medical marijuana patients, what we hope
[SPEAKER_00]: to be adult use consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was honored to speak today here
at the State of Marijuana Conference,
[SPEAKER_00]: they said, we'd like to talk to you,
or we'd like for you to talk to our
[SPEAKER_00]: audience about, you know, so you want to
get into the marijuana business,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm happy to share with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: On certain days, I would encourage you to
run the opposite direction, but that day
[SPEAKER_00]: is not today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling very, very bullish.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, just a quick raise of hands,
who currently is actively in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: space, whether it be direct to the plant,
cultivation, manufacturing, retail
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution, or serving as an ancillary
service?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, a majority, so what I'll call a
target rich environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna go ahead and move to the next
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also gonna get out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I was asked to talk about again
is, you know, trying to either convince
[SPEAKER_00]: positively or suggest otherwise that you
make a move into the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the good news is that we have a
majority of the audience already into the
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, in 2009, I was basically
temporarily retired.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a serial entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've owned many, many businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a frustrated slash retired developer,
which in 2008, 2009, we all knew what that
[SPEAKER_00]: meant, both here in the state of
California, but also around the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've owned night clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done technology, telephony,
voice and data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, I was basically bored.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was in the bar business,
successfully distributing probably a far
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous product than marijuana,
which is alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody would believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right, effing right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed as an astute observer that
people that consume marijuana generally
[SPEAKER_00]: drink less alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're in the alcohol
distribution business and people are
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking marijuana outside of your
restaurant or your nightclub, that poses a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so literally, I asked the law
enforcement officers, that were outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: my club, that were working for us,
I said, we have to get these gentlemen,
[SPEAKER_00]: men and women, back inside the club
because, you know, they're smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that's allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally, in epiphany, he corrected
me and said, no, we had passed medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana in the state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew nothing about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm slightly sheepishly
embarrassed that up to that point,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have a very strong relationship
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each and every day, I try and improve that
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some days, better than ever, better than
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like our own president,
probably every single person in this room,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I understand that marijuana is less
harmful than alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, I went on a journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that journey was really to better
understand about this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I'll sheepishly admit,
and certainly I've been critiqued for it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I got into this business not to help
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, boo hiss, that would be the time
to boo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got into it to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I saw a fascinating opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw low barrier to entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a very chaotic marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not see very sophisticated,
high financed players.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, maybe I could make a move and
get into the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I want to emphasize that I got into
it to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And boy, was I wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because anybody who's been in this
business for five, minutes or five years
[SPEAKER_00]: knows how incredibly challenging it is to
be in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fascinating space.
[SPEAKER_00]: What industry can you all think of?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk a little bit about
it in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you can absolutely, unequivocally
help people achieve a new level of
[SPEAKER_00]: wellness that you might not be able to
achieve through alcohol, opiates,
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cure A to Z when a company comes to
ailments or illnesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I can't make that claim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a medical doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our own very Sanjay Gupta has probably
done as much for marijuana reform in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last three years that even MPP,
which I'm a board member, has done in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's shocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he literally apologized to every
single one of us in this country for 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years of disinformation for sharing that
this plant is a dangerous narcotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we know what that means,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we are absolutely seeing proof
through powerful soldiers, men like
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor, excuse me, women, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Women like Dr. Sue Sisley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't tell her I said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on occasion and frightened of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: What she's doing for men and women,
soldiers, veterans that are coming back
[SPEAKER_00]: from overseas that are suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorder and 14% of
[SPEAKER_00]: these 22 men and women that are taking
their own lives, 22 of them I wear
[SPEAKER_00]: proudly, a dog tag that was given to me by
this organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wear it every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: 14% of them have alcohol and opiates in
their system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm a businessman.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are business people in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we lose money, I promise you I do
everything I can to make it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lose $100,000 today, I'm going to make
$200,000 tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 22 today, Sunday, 44, Monday,
66, 33,000 men and women are no longer on
[SPEAKER_00]: this planet because we cannot treat them
ostensibly with this harmless plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, well, helping people, we can make
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state of California represents the
Glen Gary Glen Ross leads, all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever seen that movie and there's
a salesman or salesperson in you
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere, go out and watch it because
this state, I don't care if it's $1.4
[SPEAKER_00]: billion according to Arcview or $2 billion
according to Marijuana Business Daily or
[SPEAKER_00]: $5 to $7 billion, which is probably closer
to the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're talking about, both the white,
the gray, and the black markets,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a big, big market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not going to be one
individual, one company or one brand that
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to own it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be dozens and dozens of
people, companies, brands that are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to prosper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should be an inspiration to you
because again, if you can help somebody,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can make money and ostensibly every
single one of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking around the room and I see
faces that I met six years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single one of us is truly part of
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of the perfect storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's not an inspiration, then I'm not
going to be of help to you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I embraced that opportunity in 2009
and got on to a journey onto a path that
[SPEAKER_00]: has been very winding and very meandering
and finds me here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selling cannabis legally in the state of
Colorado with a fully licensed facility
[SPEAKER_00]: almost duplicate to what we've built in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which has had a very, very strong
regulatory framework for four plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now Dixie and other brands,
many of which are represented here today,
[SPEAKER_00]: are thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean over the last four or five days,
every time I sit down with a business
[SPEAKER_00]: owner, the order gets bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean your state has a voracious,
voracious appetite for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, I'm fired up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good news.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the journey again has brought me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have said this literally a thousand
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that is consistent or
constant is change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a delusional confidence,
a term that I use and am accused of on a
[SPEAKER_00]: daily basis, sometimes better,
sometimes for worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But literally, your typical consumer
packaged goods company changes their
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging every 36 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: 36 months, three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last 12 months, I've changed my
packaging three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably in the next six months,
I'll change it at least definitively one
[SPEAKER_00]: more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last time I changed my packaging,
my flagship product, which is that of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dixie Elixir, I went from a 12 ounce Flint
bottle, glass bottle, very inefficient,
[SPEAKER_00]: not eco-friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was glass, it was Flint so you could
see through it and felt very, very
[SPEAKER_00]: strongly that you as a medical marijuana
patient or an adult use consumer could see
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called them the dingleberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was oil globules floating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't want RPM, raw plant material on
the bottom, condensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were very, very proud of the
emulsion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vision that we created, gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started a 8.5 ounce brushed aluminum
bottle that we thought would take the
[SPEAKER_00]: market by storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredibly exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fought viciously for this rigid platform,
the container, really to elevate our game
[SPEAKER_00]: as an industry so that of my
contemporaries, my competitors,
[SPEAKER_00]: would do the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant idea until the state of
Colorado's Marijuana Enforcement Division
[SPEAKER_00]: got involved and now, today, we
manufacture in the same 8.5 ounce,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a PET bottle, it's plastic,
but we have now what is a child-proof,
[SPEAKER_00]: tamper-resistant, resealable dosing cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I couldn't even get my hands
around it for weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't understand, but I certainly,
this exists somewhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wrong, six weeks later, I said I must
invent this product, this platform,
[SPEAKER_00]: this innovative product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This innovative delivery system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, $300,000 in expense that
necessarily wasn't planned for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have this on my pro forma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single one of you in this room that
is in a business that is either serving
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry or is direct to the
plant, again, commercial cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, is that gonna become an issue here in
the state of California?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are getting crushed by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two customers, two vendors of mine,
who are also customers, combined 100,000
[SPEAKER_00]: plants quarantined for four months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of the trickle-down effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100,000 plants, two retailers sitting on
dozens of metric tons of cannabis that
[SPEAKER_00]: adult-use consumers and medical marijuana
patients need, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: They need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't get them to the market fast
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That change is what will separate the
ladies from the girls and the men from the
[SPEAKER_00]: boys, because you must have that
delusional confidence that you are gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: break through whatever the state is
throwing at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to learn to embrace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, some days that's easier than
others, but there are dozens and dozens of
[SPEAKER_00]: situations or scenarios that I could
present to you that indicate that the only
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that is constant in this business is
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you go upstairs tonight and
are reflecting on today's discussions,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm sure most of those are far more
interested in what I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: today, really reflect what does that mean
to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm obsessive-compulsive, and I'm a
control freak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a disaster for the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: But my therapist promises me that I'm
gonna be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just use more marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And less tequila.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear from would-be cannabis
entrepreneurs, young men and women,
[SPEAKER_00]: seasoned veterans from other industries,
whether it be technology, whether it be
[SPEAKER_00]: media, whether it be commercial farmers,
and they say, I am going to get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana business.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, it depends on what day of
the week it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly, really focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus your efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus your business plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been here for 30, 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little have been honored to meet a dozen
plus people that have been interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing a business plan with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single day a new idea is being
formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear all the time, Tripp, is it too late
to get into the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are literally in the bottom of the
first of a seven-game series.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this industry is growing leaps and
bounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's doubling on an annual basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put the ceiling at about $50
billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to remind you of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people do not use marijuana in the
United States or, more importantly,
[SPEAKER_00]: around the globe because it is illegal at
the federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that may seem silly to all of us
sitting in the room as we have vape
[SPEAKER_00]: lounges upstairs and we have, you know,
adult use cannabis rampant in the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado to a positive effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people in the state of California
do not use marijuana because it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's illegal at the federal level and
they're not perceived as a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: How silly is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if it's $50 billion today and the
federal government capitulates on it
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow, who knows what that number is?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no telling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a motivating factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I will encourage you that not
every single opportunity is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick a segment of this industry that is so
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no MMJ for Dummies book,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever writes it, it's a free tip,
will be a pot billionaire, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: A marijuana maven, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality is is that today I own 28
companies related to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: About half of those are what we call
direct to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other half are ancillary services
companies, security companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: technology companies, equipment
manufacturing companies, all selling the
[SPEAKER_00]: proverbial pick and shovel, which is such
an overused cliche.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to be very, very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent the first three years making
literally hundreds and hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes on an annual basis trying to
perfect how somebody really wants to get
[SPEAKER_00]: in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they're trying to get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're trying to get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honored, I'm privileged to have access
to all these companies because over those
[SPEAKER_00]: first three years I built a brand and a
product and we got good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still not great, but we got good at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there we were able to diversify
and through management, through powerful
[SPEAKER_00]: women, through powerful men, that work
alongside me that I represent really
[SPEAKER_00]: today, which number is close to 450 to 475
and gone for a month, the company will
[SPEAKER_00]: probably double.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's growing that fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is I focused on one
widget, which was a marijuana-infused
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we have 150 of them, representing
about 14 or 15 delivery systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom was so incredibly generous with this
new story that came out to highlight it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom, you really didn't need to use trip
ink.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a little too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But listen, it's a powerful collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: My company is called Dixie Brands for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not smart enough to figure this out
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that's self-deprecating,
but I am smart enough to find an
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligent woman like you that I can
align myself with and take what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned, both good and bad, and pay it
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dixie Brands is doing exactly that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most recently, Foria, which is a
THC-infused personal lubricant designed to
[SPEAKER_00]: enhance a woman's sexuality, an amazing
product that I think is going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These individuals just needed help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last month, fascinating experiment,
and I still live through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We launched two wellness companies focused
on cannabidiol, CBD, derived from whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We launched a wellness company designed to
serve the human race, and we designed a
[SPEAKER_00]: product to design our four-legged
companions, pets.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one cares about a sesso, which is the
human being company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about therapists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a media tour last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single journalist, all they wanted
to talk about is, is fluffier phyto going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabidiol does not have that aspect to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all they wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, getting back to the
purpose of the point of this slide,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that focus on something that you see is
an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't look for the shiny object over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't look for the next big thing over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get good at what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a product that you can sell to me,
and I'll buy more of it than you likely
[SPEAKER_00]: can produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's hundreds and hundreds of
manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are hundreds and hundreds of
customers, both on the retail,
[SPEAKER_00]: the manufacturing, and the commercial
cultivation side, that are jonesing,
[SPEAKER_00]: jonesing for technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: The irony, I sat down with the CEO of
CNBC, which is where I get all my
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great source, it seems like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, Tom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the irony of six years of
risk, of trials and tribulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: I sit on the board honored to be part of
Mass Roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody familiar with Mass Roots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of Facebook meets Instagram meets
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A powerful, powerful movement,
semi-anonymous community that is allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: people to share their experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of other companies that
come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a company that is likely going to
be uplisted to the NASDAQ in two or four
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the first time in history of
the United States where a cannabis-themed
[SPEAKER_00]: company is on one of the big boy boards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're not talking about OTC pink
sheets, which when I got into this
[SPEAKER_00]: business in nine was zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2012, there was probably a dozen or two
dozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, there's probably an excessive
200-plus publicly traded companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of those companies are incredibly
good companies that are committed to
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance, that are not selling vaporware
that are not pump and dump shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is incredibly exciting to see
what technology is going to be able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: for individuals, men and women,
that potentially can't get into the space
[SPEAKER_00]: but want to participate in that green
rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another satisfied customer leaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: The risk that we all take is, on occasion,
untenable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to ask a tough question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 90% of you are in this industry with
me, how many people have been afraid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing what you do, truly afraid?
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched an interview with a dear,
dear friend of mine, Andy Williams from
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicine Man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a powerful person, just a kind,
gentle man, and he was sharing with a
[SPEAKER_00]: reporter that he was truly distraught in
the early days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, fantasizing, dreaming,
nightmares, what I would call them,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the guys in the black boots were
going to be out in front of his shop the
[SPEAKER_00]: day he pulled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't tell many people, but I used to
sit in my conference room, which was a big
[SPEAKER_00]: glass window.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an office.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sat in the conference room because I
could see the trucks and the people
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling up into my parking lot every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, too, fantasized about the guys in
the black boots that were going to show up
[SPEAKER_00]: and potentially take me off to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was honored to represent the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Croft from 60 Minutes did an
interview, and he asked me very
[SPEAKER_00]: succinctly, he says, Tripp, we want to
understand how you sleep at night because
[SPEAKER_00]: based on our calculations, you've
qualified for about six lifetime sentences
[SPEAKER_00]: for kingpin status.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit hit home at that moment, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm a father.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I provide for not only my own,
but for many others through employment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was heavy duty gossip.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality, as I answered,
I sleep fine at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, I don't even use marijuana
very often because I operate at the
[SPEAKER_00]: pleasure of the state of Colorado just
like today, we will be operating at the
[SPEAKER_00]: pleasure of the state of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those fears, those nightmares,
if you will, should dissipate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, do not mince words that they're
there is still risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know the cliche where risk
equals reward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that applies certainly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the risk that we take each and every
day, you have to what I call check up for
[SPEAKER_00]: the neck up and see where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you willing to work seven days a week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you willing to work 16 to 18 hours a
day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have to, but also because you
want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shit falls through the cracks when you do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the type of commitment that
it's generally going to take to be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful because of the previous three
slides that I talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This looks like my first marijuana
facility that I built in Denver back in
[SPEAKER_00]: about 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably not too far from the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did start in a 400 square foot shed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't even call it a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know where that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like Alabama.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reality is that yes, of course,
I would imagine 90% of you of the 100%
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in this room have had some
previous career.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would imagine that most of your
employers did not hand you an envelope
[SPEAKER_00]: that was stuffed with cash that represents
the last two weeks wages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally have hundreds and hundreds of
friends, contemporaries in this industry
[SPEAKER_00]: that still today pay their employees and
themselves in US currency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spends, but think of the terror that a
young woman probably has when she has that
[SPEAKER_00]: payday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget about woman, man or woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have thousands of dollars in
their pocket and they have to go home and
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out where to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is absolutely untenable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Banking is the single greatest
opportunity, but also the single greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: threat to an industry that is doubling
year after year after year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna do a billion dollars this year
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not darn close to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did $700 million last year in the state
of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generated $76 million to the state coffers
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're forecasting about $100 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, the state has banking.
[SPEAKER_00]: State of Washington uses Bank of America.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state of Colorado uses Wells Fargo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been with both those banks no longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hypocrisy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the infrastructure, the most obvious
is in fact the banking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: CRM, customer relationship management
software.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't get somebody to sell me a box
to put my products in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to go to the craft brewery store and
pay retail pricing because the guy who
[SPEAKER_00]: sold boxes in our region wouldn't sell it
to me because I was one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you now that they're lined up
out the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's not an indication of how our
industry is being perceived, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally every single week we hear from
dozens and dozens of investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me, I just said investors,
I meant vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That have an interest in doing business
with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also hear from investors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But listen, the infrastructure does not
exist in basic terms from previous
[SPEAKER_00]: careers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a not so subtle hint that find
that gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find an area in my company as an example
that has a weakness and exploit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's dozens of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think each one of those represents
an opportunity that any one of you could
[SPEAKER_00]: solve for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are literally hundreds and
hundreds of businesses that are starving
[SPEAKER_00]: for that infrastructure that I think any
one of you potentially could create on
[SPEAKER_00]: your own or more importantly invest in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that infrastructure, albeit a
challenge, is also an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's where that delusional
confidence comes into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you look around the room today,
I mean we are such a diverse group of
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Men, women, Caucasians, African Americans,
Asians, people from all different aspects
[SPEAKER_00]: of socioeconomic levels of society.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most exciting thing when I walk
into a store serving cannabis or when I
[SPEAKER_00]: walk into a conference like this because
it represents opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is so unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is like nothing that I've ever involved
myself with as a serial entrepreneur for
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember vividly sitting in a room at
the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco two
[SPEAKER_00]: years, no, a year and a half ago with
Arcview and we had brought stakeholders
[SPEAKER_00]: from all over the industry into this hotel
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to begin to talk about the
legalization of marijuana at the state
[SPEAKER_00]: level here in California and Rob Campi is
the ED for MPP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Policy Project is a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would really appreciate if you could sit
down and make some comments to the group
[SPEAKER_00]: before we start just because you have an
interesting perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was dressed like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a gentleman sitting next to me
that was equally as passionate as I was
[SPEAKER_00]: about the legalization of marijuana and I
started my spiel and he said, stop right
[SPEAKER_00]: there enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, you're not even from this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I represent ABC Growers and your opinion
does not matter here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at Rob, I said, WTF.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I thought that this was a friendly
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, today I come in peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the words this individual used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not important who or where he came from
but I mean that is an interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction to conceptually launching
adult use marijuana in your state.
[SPEAKER_00]: 34 million plus people, you can't get 34
million people to agree on what day of the
[SPEAKER_00]: week it is let alone this highly,
highly complicated issue and so again as a
[SPEAKER_00]: control freak and somebody who as a serial
entrepreneur most of his adult life for a
[SPEAKER_00]: reason because I don't like to be told
what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my character flaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's former wives.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a flaw.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to collaborate because my
brothers at Bang or my brothers at Kiva or
[SPEAKER_00]: my brothers at Kushy Punch, any brands
that I've met with this week, we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: find a way to collaborate because if we
don't it's never going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to find a way to work together
because again this industry is in
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly unique and unless you were
alive in 1933 which a quick glance of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room doesn't look like anybody qualifies
for that which was the end of alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition which is a lot of James is
raising his arms back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look pretty good sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to find a way to connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connecting is what we are doing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do not know the person that is
sitting to the left of you or the person
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting to the right of you and I know
this is cheesy but please, please,
[SPEAKER_00]: please introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out what this individual is doing
here today and more importantly what they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally host three to five people that
I've never met in my life in my office a
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually through LinkedIn or Facebook or
some random interaction and I connect with
[SPEAKER_00]: them because they have an interest,
a motivation to jump into an industry that
[SPEAKER_00]: is doubling every year that has a diverse
group of individuals like you men and
[SPEAKER_00]: women in this room and I don't care if
they have the same beliefs as me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if they're an activist,
a reformist or a free market capitalist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to connect with them because they
have an idea that I have not thought about
[SPEAKER_00]: and so people like this like the state of
marijuana group create these forums,
[SPEAKER_00]: these environments that are incredibly
efficient because I don't have to go visit
[SPEAKER_00]: every single one of you for the next 60 to
75 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can meet a majority of you people today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I challenge you whether it be
right after this event or upstairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: do not be bashful, do not be abrasive,
do not be arrogant, find a way in which to
[SPEAKER_00]: connect with that man or woman that is
sitting on either side of you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wrap it up and it's a
powerful quote which I think should
[SPEAKER_00]: resonate with every single person here
because you being here in this room
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately means that you're in the arena
because people that are sitting on the
[SPEAKER_00]: sidelines aren't ever going to get in that
game and this is a game.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a game where lots and lots of
people are going to win and the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: chance of losing is if you're never going
to get in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you've made the investment
today whether it be the first investment
[SPEAKER_00]: or one of many, you have to engage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was asked to speak at a conference
next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's startup week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver's startup week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hundreds and hundreds of individuals that
are starting companies, ironically now
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to turn to us as the experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I reflected on a quote that somebody
gave me, some advice somebody gave me
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago and I kind of applied it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, men and women are all about,
who have children here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got one 15 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's still pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might start using marijuana a little bit
more often these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's all about the betterment of
society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I looked at my life and then I
looked at previous generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandfather worked in the steel mills
of Pennsylvania, I joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Villanova University so I can
say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandfather worked in the steel mills
so my father could become a doctor so I
[SPEAKER_00]: could sell marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's not powerful shit, I don't know
what is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I very much appreciate the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alan, I know we're behind schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's because of me or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm certainly available to ask a few
questions if that's conducive to you or
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly I'll be around for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is there any question that somebody
cannot wait and has to get out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to answer tonight in front of
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: What excites me about what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, well, when we met earlier,
I talked about, forget about the fire
[SPEAKER_00]: hoses, the fire hydrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can be, I've certainly been accused
of being quote unquote greedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've got a voracious appetite
myself for opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I can tell you is that nobody,
not even the sages, but just veterans in
[SPEAKER_00]: this room or in the industry, many of whom
I know personally, have a crystal ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so somebody like myself pontificating
up here on stage, and again, I consider it
[SPEAKER_00]: an honor to represent the industry,
no one really knows, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I believe that the federal
government is going to capitulate in the
[SPEAKER_00]: year 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet Rob Campy $1,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do it again next week at the
National Marijuana Business Conference in
[SPEAKER_00]: Las Vegas because I know he'll be foolish
enough to get up on stage with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I believe the federal government is
going to capitulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to defer to states' rights,
just like gay marriage, civil,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be exciting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's 2017 because I have happy
ears or whether it's 2019 like Rob Campy
[SPEAKER_00]: believes, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can tell you it is not OTH over the
horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on my bicycle pedaling so damn hard to
that bright light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know what I'm going to get to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that ultimately is what motivates me,
excites me about our industry that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
