[SPEAKER_04]: Systems that have been adapted from other
industries that are not designed for
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation are like fitting a square peg
into a round hole.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact is, cannabis is a living organism
that has different environmental
[SPEAKER_04]: requirements based on its stage of life.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a static load requirement like
human-centric comfort cooling or an indoor
[SPEAKER_04]: pool facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: The 10 cardinal parameters work
synergistically, and all of them need to
[SPEAKER_04]: be optimized to ensure crucial KPIs are
met, such as grams per square foot and
[SPEAKER_04]: price per pound.
[SPEAKER_04]: HVACD tells the full story of what
environmental control for cannabis should
[SPEAKER_04]: do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, there's heat load from the lights it
needs to be accounted for, but it takes
[SPEAKER_04]: about twice as much work to dehumidify
than it does to remove heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And through the process of transpiration,
plants act as perfect little humidifiers
[SPEAKER_04]: in cultivation rooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And without proper modulating
dehumidification, humidity rates and VPD
[SPEAKER_04]: simply cannot be maintained.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have a huge challenge here.
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you determine what a proper HVACD
system looks like?
[SPEAKER_04]: How much should it cost?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you compare competing systems on a
true apples to apples basis?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to help answer these questions
over the next 30 minutes as Adrian and Rob
[SPEAKER_04]: walk us through the concepts of a
coordinated design process, the
[SPEAKER_04]: performance and cost differences of
conventional non-integrated and integrated
[SPEAKER_04]: HVACD systems, and a crash course on
leveling bids and important KPIs.
[SPEAKER_04]: With that, I'll pass it off to Adrian to
get us started.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Brian.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indoor cannabis and horticulture projects
are extremely complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in a way, we're constructing an entire
campus in nearly every building that's
[SPEAKER_03]: purpose-built or retrofitted for indoor
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And looking at this process map,
courtesy of Anderson Porter Architects,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can see why they're so complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Labor is one of the largest operational
costs, so employee workflow is central to
[SPEAKER_03]: an optimized facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition to that, you have lighting
strategies, canopy area, cultivation
[SPEAKER_03]: methods and technologies, building
envelope design, energy consumption,
[SPEAKER_03]: building management systems for data
collection and control, maybe even on-site
[SPEAKER_03]: renewable energy and microgrid controls,
all of which need to come together in
[SPEAKER_03]: harmony to meet your product output goals
and meet your business metrics and KPIs
[SPEAKER_03]: that we will talk about later on.
[SPEAKER_03]: The use of a coordinated design process
allows you the ability to assign resources
[SPEAKER_03]: according to the limited capital available
to any project.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let us dig in a bit into the two
typical types of project delivery methods,
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as the type of team members that
comprise an indoor horticulture project.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plan, spec, build on the top on the left
is a more traditional approach that
[SPEAKER_03]: typically doesn't allow for as much
collaboration between the design and
[SPEAKER_03]: construction teams, but it doesn't have to
be that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You as the owner get to set the tone and
the expectations for your project.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want collaboration and want to work
through an architect as the quarterback.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is very possible, but it needs to be
set up that way from the start and the
[SPEAKER_03]: architect needs to be selected
appropriately.
[SPEAKER_03]: An alternative method is design build.
[SPEAKER_03]: This method allows for the whole design
and construction team to be brought under
[SPEAKER_03]: one contract and work collaboratively from
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a true one throat to choke
scenario, which works well for complex and
[SPEAKER_03]: fast paced projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Regardless of the path you choose,
it is imperative to ensure that each
[SPEAKER_03]: project team member has the requisite
cannabis and horticulture intimacy to
[SPEAKER_03]: avoid costly and common mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: These professionals are somewhat rare in
the wild, but they do exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Regardless of where the recommendations
come from, be sure to fully vet all
[SPEAKER_03]: project partners to the best of your
ability.
[SPEAKER_03]: By having the right professionals in
place, as shown on the right side of the
[SPEAKER_03]: screen with the owner in the middle,
owner's representative surrounding them or
[SPEAKER_03]: construction manager role, followed by the
architect and the other engineers and sub
[SPEAKER_03]: consultants and ultimately contractors all
coordinated together allows you to lock in
[SPEAKER_03]: a guaranteed maximum price when possible,
allows you to limit your risk,
[SPEAKER_03]: allows you to avoid change orders that can
be very costly, allows you to avoid work
[SPEAKER_03]: that needs to be redone.
[SPEAKER_03]: There can be huge challenges with projects
moving so fast as these do and making sure
[SPEAKER_03]: that all the bases are covered up front so
budgets and timelines don't get inflated
[SPEAKER_03]: is extremely important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your project does not have to cost more
money to execute in a coordinated fashion
[SPEAKER_03]: and have it be sustainable in design if
desired.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get things done right the first time and
it will pay off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now make sure you target the business
metrics and KPIs that will drive your
[SPEAKER_03]: business profitability.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be sure you have selected the best site
that you have sufficient power available.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get the appropriate licensing at
that location, have the right amount
[SPEAKER_03]: budgeted for the project, on and on and on
before you jump in.
[SPEAKER_03]: This process is truly a delicate balance
between risk and reward.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rewards can be massive and the risks
can be crushing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our mission is to bring our experience and
ecosystem to work together to maximize the
[SPEAKER_03]: rewards and minimize the risks.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that I'm going to hand it off to
Robbie to talk you through different HVACD
[SPEAKER_03]: system types and why some systems
outperform others when using KPIs of
[SPEAKER_03]: business profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've spent about a decade walking into
indoor cannabis facilities of all types
[SPEAKER_00]: and like you'd expect no two rooms are
100% identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because we're putting a webinar
together that has to compare different
[SPEAKER_00]: system types we've had to generalize
different systems and we did that based on
[SPEAKER_00]: certain key features.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to suggest that there's
three major system types and that each of
[SPEAKER_00]: them represents an incrementally better
approach as we move through the
[SPEAKER_00]: generations of designs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the conventional
non-integrated design approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just by looking at this picture you can
recognize this system type because it has
[SPEAKER_00]: a pretty glaring feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hanging from the ceilings are
dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The primary HVAC system that you don't see
cleaning the room is most likely a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial system probably designed for
regular commercial or office building type
[SPEAKER_00]: loads.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're used to seeing mini splits or
off-the-shelf package rooftop units
[SPEAKER_00]: serving these rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we call it a conventional
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just can't handle the humidity levels
required for a cultivation space alone and
[SPEAKER_00]: hence we had all these dehumbs installed
in between the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the air coming off those dehumbs is
probably about 110, 120 in that range of
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now how is that now dehumidified hot
air going to flow down to the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it really isn't and that's why when
we take a deep look at the temperatures
[SPEAKER_00]: and humidities in the spaces we see
incredibly inconsistent numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And conditions at the canopy are rarely
where the cultivator would like them to
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact is it's almost impossible to tie
all the systems together to achieve room
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these rooms have separate thermo
units for each of the different equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why we call it non-integrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there we have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conventional air conditioning paired with
disparate dehumidification equipment each
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling separate set points in a
non-integrated category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's other problematic things you
might notice about the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking closely you see these condensate
drains hanging off the side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found that these condensate drains clog
frequently and the result is dirty
[SPEAKER_00]: condensate water dripping into your canopy
causing all sorts of IPM problems that
[SPEAKER_00]: require extra management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting equipment in a room like this is
also a maintenance nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sending maintenance people into a live
room to change filters or fix equipment is
[SPEAKER_00]: a biosecurity nightmare for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cleaning all the surfaces you see is
almost impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just extra hard to keep
cross-contamination happening from one
[SPEAKER_00]: crop to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is all this a problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact is it's a problem because it
costs you money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who grow cannabis in these rooms
and a sharp cultivator can do it very
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: To this day this is probably the most
popular setup for indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have become millionaires doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people did amazing work with
equipment that was commercially available
[SPEAKER_00]: or even just available at the local Home
Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We congratulate them for everything
they've done in pioneering this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now only in hindsight we know that
cultivators could have been so much more
[SPEAKER_00]: profitable if we could have addressed the
items I just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the industry evolved we ended up
seeing dehumidification specific equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: providing temperature and humidity control
for the growing rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know this based on the picture on
the screen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well where are the dehumidifiers?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an indication that another
off-the-shelf piece of equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: most likely a system designed for pool
room dehumidification for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: is serving the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the best thing about this approach is
that the temperature and humidity control
[SPEAKER_00]: are integrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an integrated system.
[SPEAKER_00]: One piece is doing both jobs and that
means the HVAC has a much better chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the things right inside the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact is this is still a
conventional system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's conventional because the equipment
we're using may have been designed for
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidification but it was designed for
human centric dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pool room dehumidifiers are just not
intended for the cultivation industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to take a minute to stress this
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Serving a space with a pool in it versus a
space with plants in it is so very very
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest difference is if I'm swimming
in a pool I want all that water a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: warm 80 degrees plus Fahrenheit
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frankly to keep that pool at that
temperature it takes a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who make pool room
dehumidifiers know this and they take
[SPEAKER_00]: every last bit of energy from the
compression cycle and they put it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: water using special heat extractors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now because the pools need so much heat
they literally have no incentive to make
[SPEAKER_00]: their dehumidification process more
efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more compressor tonnage they use the
more energy they can dump into the pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why fight it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look the HVAC industry has better ways to
dehumidify air but none of those ways make
[SPEAKER_00]: sense to someone building a dehumidifier
for an auditorium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're asking yourself so what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer to that question is these rooms
are still costing you so much money and
[SPEAKER_00]: this isn't just about energy consumption
costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes running all those compressors all the
time leads to huge energy bills and that
[SPEAKER_00]: stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in an industry where cash flow and
time to harvest are so critically
[SPEAKER_00]: important ask yourself this.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much more electricity do you need to
bring to a building where all the HVACD
[SPEAKER_00]: has 30 to 40 percent more compressors than
it needs?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is your project going to get
delayed because the utility has to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge infrastructure upgrade in your part
of the city?
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't just big picture stuff either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about what we see literally in this
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still running propeller fans
inside the room because the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: shoehorn a pool room dehumidifier into
these facilities maybe don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant NVC they should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't focused on getting the air
where it's needed in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a room filled with plants not an
empty room with a small lake at the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another challenge the conditions in
a pool room are about as constant as you
[SPEAKER_00]: can imagine but a proper cultivation HVACD
system needs to perform optimally sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: vast range of conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the change in load when the
lights are on versus when the lights are
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: A flower room or a veg room isn't about
lowering the humidity as much as you can
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about keeping the right level at the
right time to bring out the best in your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom line is both integrated and
non-integrated and conventional systems
[SPEAKER_00]: will lead to compromises.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diseases show up in rooms because of the
interplay of a pathogen a host and the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just trying to pick on pool room
dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see server room HVAC or a hundred
percent outside air units being applied
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have their own whole host of
challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: But philosophically this is why the
starting point of integrated pest
[SPEAKER_00]: management is cultural control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultural control is environmental control
and if your environment is set up
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly you'll spend less time and less
money with physical biological and
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical interventions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to pull more and better
pounds out of your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we land on the not so humbly named
Inspire integrated HVACD system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a system designed from the ground
up with plant-centric environments in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The system is integrated I mean properly
integrated control of the temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: the humidity control the lights the CO2
levels even the room pressure for
[SPEAKER_00]: biosecurity purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: See this is a symphony controlled by a
brain that is married to equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: designed specifically for the purpose of
enabling plant transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I could probably spend 20 minutes
telling you about how the run around loop
[SPEAKER_00]: around our cooling coil and Inspire system
will cut your power bill by 30 or 40
[SPEAKER_00]: percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're someone who's with utility
that's probably a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's important if you're the one
responsible for actually growing plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: a room and what's important if you're
actually the one cutting a check for a
[SPEAKER_00]: project to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well maybe then the important part of the
story is there's a good chance you can
[SPEAKER_00]: install the HVACD without needing that
costly utility upgrade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the important part is that we can
modulate every one of the components
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for dehumidification and
temperature control.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means you can make sure your
temperatures and humidities are at the
[SPEAKER_00]: level you want throughout the growing
cycle and day or night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too hot not too cold not too wet not
too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about if the important part isn't the
box outside the room serving the air into
[SPEAKER_00]: the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if it's the forethought of a CFD
model before construction that makes sure
[SPEAKER_00]: the air you're sending into the room
actually makes it into the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The important part of the story might not
even be that it might be that every minute
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of data points from each room
cultivation to drying are securely making
[SPEAKER_00]: it into the cloud where you the owner or
you the grower can watch your rooms with
[SPEAKER_00]: one eye on real time performance and
another eye on historical trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't about a box moving about a box
moving air.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about intimacy with plant intimacy
with the construction industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about taking the process of
transpiration so seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put in your company name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do all these things right you
end up with a very different tribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up with a facility that actually
lives up to the promise and you end up not
[SPEAKER_00]: using as many swear words when talking
about the air conditioning system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the reason that HVACD as we do it is
obviously not a four-letter word.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the environment around the canopy is
conducive to plant vitality without
[SPEAKER_00]: microclimates or in-room risk factors like
you can condensate drains you end up
[SPEAKER_00]: taking more pounds out of that room than
you otherwise could have and every one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those pounds is consistent enough to keep
a top spot on the shelves at the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary where you've earned the trust
to deliver products you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm not trying to tell you that HVACD
by Inspire is going to naturally earn you
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm saying is that if you have a room
designed by people that have cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: intimacy it's going to give you the
ability to grow a product that people will
[SPEAKER_00]: buy and not just grow a bit of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you're going to be able to fill
that room with healthy high demand plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When was the last time you saw a room with
three tiers of trays layered into a
[SPEAKER_00]: 13-foot high space?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the heart of this intimacy starts with
data and sizing your equipment right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have real data for real rooms
that can help you with the task.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example of some of that data and
the simple formula we use to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: the peak moisture removal capacity we need
for equipment serving a space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite simply we need to figure out the
peak pounds per hour of moisture removal
[SPEAKER_00]: the HVACD system has to provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we sit down with the project team and
get the master grower to give us the total
[SPEAKER_00]: daily watering rate that is gallons of
water that are going to be pumped into a
[SPEAKER_00]: room on a given day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We multiply that by the percentage of
moisture that comes out during the
[SPEAKER_00]: period's highest transpiration which is
when the lights are on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we divide that number by the number
of hours of the photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course because we're looking for a
total because we're giving a total daily
[SPEAKER_00]: watering rate in gallons we multiply
everything by 8.33 to convert from gallons
[SPEAKER_00]: to pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're looking for pounds per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously this number changes for our
international metric loving friends who
[SPEAKER_00]: use liters instead of gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you get the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key to this whole equation is the
percentage of moisture removed during the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to this day we invest a lot of
resources to get the data from live rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a snapshot from one of those
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue bars represent water transpired
during the photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: The red bars represent water transpired or
evaporated during the dark period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add them together and we can see the total
daily plant water consumption for that
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly we see the ratio of
lights on versus 24 hour moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this ratio is the percentage of
moisture removal I referenced in the
[SPEAKER_00]: previous slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the kind of knowledge that is
going to make sure you're not scrambling
[SPEAKER_00]: to buy portable D-hums that you have to
wheel into a room three weeks before
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fair warning, look every room is
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different lighting technologies,
different growing styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have different ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't treat this as gospel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll bite you in the butt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to give us a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about what it means to right
size the equipment for the facility you're
[SPEAKER_00]: picturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay look I've gone into a deep dive and
spent a lot of time highlighting the
[SPEAKER_00]: features you get when you work with
Inspire.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not exactly a sales pitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to hear from Adrian about how
to make sure you've got all your bases
[SPEAKER_00]: covered as you realize that dream of a
successful cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The features I just mentioned bring real
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them are required when you're
going to grow your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to try and compare multiple
vendors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you understand the limitations that
come along with purchasing a veritable
[SPEAKER_00]: truckload of mini splits and dehumidifiers
for a screaming price and how that
[SPEAKER_00]: decision will ultimately prevent you from
optimizing the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You absolutely can compare apples and
oranges and grapes and pears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adrian, why don't you take it from here
and show them how.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you Rob.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope what Robbie just went through
resonated and you can begin to understand
[SPEAKER_03]: why it's not an easy task to compare
multiple HVACD bids against each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems easy to have a plan of calling up
one, three, five different companies that
[SPEAKER_03]: offer environmental control systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask for a bid, review them in a couple
days and make a direct decision around
[SPEAKER_03]: your design.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the indoor cannabis and horticulture
business, since nearly every manufacturer
[SPEAKER_03]: approaches this challenge differently,
this scenario couldn't be further from the
[SPEAKER_03]: truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's dive in and see if we can help
unmask some of the details that it takes
[SPEAKER_03]: to get to a point of a true apples to
apples comparison.
[SPEAKER_03]: Robbie just walked us through the process
to define how to set expectations for your
[SPEAKER_03]: room conditions, temperature and relative
humidity, and how generally size your
[SPEAKER_03]: HVACD systems based on moisture removal
capacity.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a process that needs to be born
from a collaboration between the
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation team and the business team.
[SPEAKER_03]: These decisions have huge impacts on the
type of cultivation setup that you end up
[SPEAKER_03]: using, the lighting type you choose,
strain choices, on and on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is why we call this step one of a
bid leveling process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once these key decisions are made,
you'll be ready to complete a form like
[SPEAKER_03]: the one you see on the screen,
which is used to convey the design
[SPEAKER_03]: criteria along to the manufacturer,
mechanical engineer and other projects
[SPEAKER_03]: stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, as discussed in my opening section,
there are many different ways to go about
[SPEAKER_03]: your project, but hopefully sooner rather
than later, you're going to engage an MEP
[SPEAKER_03]: engineer to design your facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you do so, we come to step number
two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ideally, this is in conjunction with
hiring the other project team members so
[SPEAKER_03]: that a true collaborative design process
can happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: The coordination items can get worked out
early and you can have your best chance at
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing your project in on time,
on budget, and with the right parts and
[SPEAKER_03]: pieces to allow you to be profitable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your MEP engineer who has indoor
horticulture experience does way more than
[SPEAKER_03]: just create the drawing on the far right
for construction permit purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're an integral part of coordinating
the design elements of the HVACD systems
[SPEAKER_03]: between the other design consultants on
the project, such as structural,
[SPEAKER_03]: electrical, plumbing, controls,
fire protection.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys and gals are problematic
solvers, just like us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a team, it is so much more seamless
to get complex decisions made,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the ducting challenge as an example
shown on the screen that's drawn with 3D
[SPEAKER_03]: CAD to detail out all the appropriate duct
work fittings and insulation that were
[SPEAKER_03]: required to get the air to and from the
cultivation room and not lose any or gain
[SPEAKER_03]: any heat from an ambient condition that
can be 100, 110, 120 degrees in different
[SPEAKER_03]: conditions and locations on a design day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since just about every design decision has
a technical fit or function as well as a
[SPEAKER_03]: cost implication, having the rest of the
construction team involved early helps
[SPEAKER_03]: streamline the process significantly and
true value engineering can be done where
[SPEAKER_03]: the overall value of the project to the
owner can be integrated into the design
[SPEAKER_03]: and done so for the minimum amount of
overall cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Slightly different take on the way that
you normally hear value engineering used,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's an important way to approach
these projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I say overall cost because the raw
HVACD equipment or system costs that you
[SPEAKER_03]: get from the manufacturers only tell part
of the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: The installation costs play a huge factor
in determining your total cost of
[SPEAKER_03]: ownership for your project.
[SPEAKER_03]: And without the ability to quickly
determine what the installation cost
[SPEAKER_03]: impact on a design decision will be,
there is no true way to know your total
[SPEAKER_03]: budget going into construction and
confirming that you have enough funds
[SPEAKER_03]: available.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this brings us to step number three,
which while we know that all of these
[SPEAKER_03]: steps are important, this one may be the
most important of the bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you now compare multiple bids that
you've solicited?
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them may be a chilled water,
hot water, four pipe system.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them might be an air-cooled package
unit system.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them might be a water-cooled DX
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them could be a liquid desiccant
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how do you know which bid to select?
[SPEAKER_03]: All the numbers are different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I take the lowest price?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I take the highest price?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I take something in the middle?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you really don't have any idea how
to make that decision until you consider
[SPEAKER_03]: the installation cost impacts of each of
these systems in order to get a total
[SPEAKER_03]: capex budget that's required for your
project.
[SPEAKER_03]: We approach this challenge with what can
be called a bid form.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's hard to read because there's a
lot of detailed information crammed into
[SPEAKER_03]: one spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we need to know a lot of this detail
about the HVCD system, some of which
[SPEAKER_03]: Robbie touched on, but many others,
to be sure that the system serving the
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation and curing rooms have all the
appropriate options required to perform
[SPEAKER_03]: the duty of proper environmental control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this might be the right type of
filtration and air cleaning included.
[SPEAKER_03]: This might be the right type of
redundancies in different parts of the
[SPEAKER_03]: system and units.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's a room control system.
[SPEAKER_03]: That allows the cultivator to focus on
cultivation and not monkeying with a
[SPEAKER_03]: thermostat or feedback loop all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's the right type of startup
processes, commissioning, training,
[SPEAKER_03]: spare parts, SOPs associated with
mechanical part failures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the air-cooled condenser going to run
at negative 40 in the Alberta winter or
[SPEAKER_03]: 120 degrees Fahrenheit in the California
desert summer?
[SPEAKER_03]: The list is long, detailed, and honestly
pretty dull unless you're an HVCD nerd
[SPEAKER_03]: like us.
[SPEAKER_03]: But every one of these items is imperative
for your facility to operate in a way that
[SPEAKER_03]: allows your plants to thrive and your
business to be profitable.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why we're here for you and why we
work together with your design and
[SPEAKER_03]: construction team to be sure that all of
the appropriate items are included in the
[SPEAKER_03]: material bids, the installation bids,
and are coordinated together with the
[SPEAKER_03]: design team.
[SPEAKER_03]: If all three of those plates are not
spinning in the same rhythm, you are sure
[SPEAKER_03]: to encounter unforeseen costs,
schedule delays, or both.
[SPEAKER_03]: And although it is not normally top of
mind when selecting these systems today,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's not forget operating costs and
potential utility incentives available
[SPEAKER_03]: when deploying a more energy efficient
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: These may not be as impactful on
profitability in the short term,
[SPEAKER_03]: but will become much more important as the
market develops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since we know that efficient and
sustainable facilities do not need to cost
[SPEAKER_03]: more than standard facilities,
to build when working together with a
[SPEAKER_03]: collaborative design and construction
team, why not be ready for that when the
[SPEAKER_03]: time comes?
[SPEAKER_03]: This whole process takes intimacy,
acumen, and integrity to perform the
[SPEAKER_03]: comprehensive apples to apples bid
leveling in an ethical manner.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might be surprised that when you
compare a conventional non-integrated
[SPEAKER_03]: system with an Inspire integrated system,
that the project costs are neutral or very
[SPEAKER_03]: close.
[SPEAKER_03]: We look forward to exploring this
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's take a quick recap of where
we're at.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've set our expectations for how the
facility will operate in step one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've brought in the right design and
construction team members, and we've
[SPEAKER_03]: successfully leveled all of those HVACD
bids to determine which partner to choose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's make sure to note that the HVAC
system is not the only part of the puzzle
[SPEAKER_03]: that needs this level of evaluation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Choosing the right lights, fertigation
system, racks or tables, wall materials,
[SPEAKER_03]: epoxy floor coverings, you get the long
list here for your business model,
[SPEAKER_03]: are all equally important.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, nothing takes the place of
investing in the building blocks of your
[SPEAKER_03]: cultural and environmental control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that all those numbers are rolled up
into a total budget, how did we do against
[SPEAKER_03]: the estimated budget that was set at the
outset of the project?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we within the budget?
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's move to step four.
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, let's talk about some financing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see three typical forms of financing
used in the cannabis space currently with
[SPEAKER_03]: a possible fourth as a newcomer.
[SPEAKER_03]: The three that are most widely used are
equity financing, where you offer part of
[SPEAKER_03]: your business in exchange for capital,
traditional financing, which may come
[SPEAKER_03]: directly from a bank or indirectly from a
private source based upon credit
[SPEAKER_03]: worthiness or equipment leasing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lease backs are a model that have been
around a long time in other market
[SPEAKER_03]: segments and are making an engine entry
into the cannabis business space,
[SPEAKER_03]: but are really yet to be seen if they'll
be successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have a horse in this race,
except to say that we can help connect you
[SPEAKER_03]: with some different ecosystem partners who
we know offer a fair exchange of value.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the end, it is up to your team to
evaluate all your options carefully,
[SPEAKER_03]: read the fine print and make sure it is a
sound business decision for you and your
[SPEAKER_03]: partners to enter into.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep in mind that in the cannabis
business, most manufacturers require
[SPEAKER_03]: significant funds upfront and that you
will need your funds to be liquid at the
[SPEAKER_03]: appropriate time to be sure you don't
delay your schedule.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's look at a slightly different
alternative to financing, and that is
[SPEAKER_03]: phasing your project.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of reasons why you might
want to phase your project.
[SPEAKER_03]: It allows for proof of concept.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole measure twice, cut once saying
really offers the ability to gain
[SPEAKER_03]: invaluable experience and reduce your risk
by biting off smaller pieces of the dream
[SPEAKER_03]: while you learn the systems that will
allow you to scale into the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: But most importantly, this measure twice,
cut once approach allows you to preserve
[SPEAKER_03]: more equity and reduce the capital raise
requirements.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultimately, you can maintain more control
over your future by not having to raise
[SPEAKER_03]: $10 million to build out the whole
facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: As an example, when you could start with
$3 million, get operational, become
[SPEAKER_03]: profitable and then scale up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't know what you don't know at the
beginning of the journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this allows for failure, but not
spectacular business crippling failure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could also be said and called start
smart so you can scale fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that you have all of this out of the
way, let's get on with awarding that bid
[SPEAKER_03]: that you chose back on step three.
[SPEAKER_03]: If your project is fast track like many
are, and since you chose a coordinated
[SPEAKER_03]: design and build process with the
appropriate team members already involved,
[SPEAKER_03]: you easily have the ability to release the
long lead HVAC equipment into production,
[SPEAKER_03]: which can range from three to five months
from time of order to the time that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: installed, started up and commissioned
depending on the particular system type
[SPEAKER_03]: chosen.
[SPEAKER_03]: The design team can get you to the point
where enough coordination has been done to
[SPEAKER_03]: minimize any impact that completing the
engineering work quote on the fly might
[SPEAKER_03]: have otherwise negatively influenced.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now all that is left is executing on the
construction, which with the right team
[SPEAKER_03]: involved is some pretty straightforward
blocking and tackling.
[SPEAKER_03]: But don't be so naive to think that issues
won't come up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just prepared to fix them quickly
because the team can look within
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves, brainstorm the best possible
solutions to the problem and make sure it
[SPEAKER_03]: has minimal impact to cost and schedule.
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If only if it was that simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Challenges always come up on complex
projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's how your team approaches and fixes
them that will decide whether you come out
[SPEAKER_03]: on the other side with the ability to be
more profitable or less profitable based
[SPEAKER_03]: on what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: No reason to dwell on negative situations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Use them as opportunities to look within,
lean on the team and come out stronger on
[SPEAKER_03]: the other side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, how do you know whether you have
built a profitable facility for your
[SPEAKER_03]: business to operate?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm glad that you asked.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first step is to harness that data.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take your data and turn it into metrics
that you can use to benchmark your
[SPEAKER_03]: business and processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The most important of these metrics will
become the KPIs or key performance
[SPEAKER_03]: indicators that your leadership team will
be tracking on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Increased plant productivity and
expression equals increased financial
[SPEAKER_03]: metrics in most cases.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's important to focus on the KPIs that
drive business profitability.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things here like grams per square foot,
dollars per gram, active compounds per
[SPEAKER_03]: square foot, harvest cycles per year,
reduced crop loss per room, operating
[SPEAKER_03]: costs per pound are all metrics that will
help shape your business success.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also important are other ways to offset
capex via things like utility incentives
[SPEAKER_03]: and benchmarking your subsystems like HVAC
and lighting, as you see with pounds per
[SPEAKER_03]: hour of moisture removal per KW of energy
or micromoles per joule on the lighting
[SPEAKER_03]: side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as it turns out that these need to be
top of mind from the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_03]: design and construction process so that
all the decisions that are made along the
[SPEAKER_03]: way have these goals in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition to these metrics and KPIs,
pursuing ways to reduce risk throughout
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole process will pay dividends for
years to come.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talk about these metrics every day with
clients because they're so important to
[SPEAKER_03]: focus on.
[SPEAKER_03]: If our HVACD systems can't make you more
money, why spend the money on the right
[SPEAKER_03]: system?
[SPEAKER_03]: We look at things like how does your grams
per square foot and dollar per gram get
[SPEAKER_03]: impacted as a result of better
environmental control, homogeneous airflow
[SPEAKER_03]: and removing unnecessary mechanical
equipment from inside a cultivation room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about reduction in IPM costs as a
result of better cultural and
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental control.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you're operational, the race car has
been built, so to speak, and now we're
[SPEAKER_03]: racing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that point, it's what can be done
to make that car faster, stronger,
[SPEAKER_03]: more agile.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are five or 10 more plants per room
worth over the course of a year if it's
[SPEAKER_03]: determined your HVACD systems and space
planning can allow you to stuff more
[SPEAKER_03]: plants in the room than you originally
planned and still maintain stable room
[SPEAKER_03]: control?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where the fun really starts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to wrap up with a few key
takeaways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Environmental control via HVACD is key to
any IPM or integrated pest management
[SPEAKER_03]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Different HVACD system types provide
varying results.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very important to understand the
limitations and risk of each type of
[SPEAKER_03]: system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Balance revenue and risk with CAPEX and
speed to market phasing and scalability.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this goes back to leveling the bids
using that bid form that we talked about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to mention it's very important to
engage your utility early to evaluate
[SPEAKER_03]: potential incentives.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a step that's often overlooked and
when they're engaged, it's too late to
[SPEAKER_03]: have an impact on your project.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to choose your partners with care
and at the end of the day, know that
[SPEAKER_03]: cultural control is the foundation of
success.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Adrian.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Rob.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's go ahead and jump into the Q&A
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first question I'm seeing here are
what are the common pitfalls you see with
[SPEAKER_04]: inexperienced construction teams?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the pitfalls we see with
inexperienced construction teams?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess from my perspective, it's not
having a good understanding of the peak
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture removal rate that needs to come
out of the rooms, especially in different
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see them often undersized.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well, there isn't much forethought to
the different states of a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a room isn't always full with peak
transpiration happening and you need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to deliver hot air, cold air,
dehumidified and not so dehumidified air
[SPEAKER_00]: at various different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's from my perspective,
it's a very technical engineering
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge that we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's also operational
issues too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of people just dive in and
they're trying to do 40,000 square foot
[SPEAKER_00]: and boom, canopies right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this may be their first time doing it
at scale and I could imagine the
[SPEAKER_00]: construction team may be able to execute
that, but have you thought it through from
[SPEAKER_00]: a people management side?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have enough people to man those
many different rooms and keep them
[SPEAKER_00]: operating at even peak operational
capacity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or anything close to peak, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Age, you probably have other things to
add.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you got a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Having that intimacy and understanding
what it takes to get the systems,
[SPEAKER_03]: the rooms designed properly and then be
able to execute on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Growing cannabis is such a complex,
multidisciplinary challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to bridge those knowledge gaps is
super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the financing perspective,
even if you've got the construction team
[SPEAKER_00]: to execute it and you've got the resources
to design your rooms right, you're really
[SPEAKER_00]: going to want to outlay all that capital
and not be able to turn proper cashflow
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers with rooms that are operating
inefficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not start small and go big?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that phasing question or the phasing
topic you brought up, Age.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we see experienced teams doing this,
they're always phasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never just jump right in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like it'll become more and more
important as the industry grows and more
[SPEAKER_04]: competition comes in and price compression
sets in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very important to make sure your cost
structure is in check and you're able to
[SPEAKER_04]: produce good product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll throw in there just the concept of
trust but verify and the partners and
[SPEAKER_03]: really spending time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked through it quickly in the
presentation but the amount of time and
[SPEAKER_03]: care that should be taken in choosing
these team members should be significant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're pairing yourself with them for six
months, a year, two years, three years and
[SPEAKER_03]: you really want to make sure that you've
got the right team from the beginning to
[SPEAKER_03]: help preserve that capital as best as
possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another question, are there significant
differences in HVACD considerations
[SPEAKER_04]: between a closed greenhouse and indoor
facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the greenhouse space, you have
different things you have to manage,
[SPEAKER_00]: lights especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have blackout curtains and other
technologies that you have to take in
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thermal load from the sun is a huge,
huge challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Managing that, most people don't have the
electrical capacity or want to put in the
[SPEAKER_00]: electrical infrastructure to do that with
closed greenhouse spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a webinar in and of itself and it's
a 40 minute discussion and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: technical nuances.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the interesting things that we saw
at the last conference we were at was,
[SPEAKER_00]: except for certain parts of the United
States where there is a consistent amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of data light every single day throughout
the year, as soon as you start getting
[SPEAKER_00]: into northern climes, greenhouses start to
become more and more of a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a challenge of putting heat into
the rooms because greenhouses are very
[SPEAKER_00]: inefficient insulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all this heat gets radiated out through
the top of the building out into space and
[SPEAKER_00]: so you have a whole different set of
challenges for heating at night than you
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do your systems require humidification in
the beginning of the flower cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen that happen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean plants are beautiful little
humidifiers in and of themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start to apply these brute force
or non-modulating compression or
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifying technologies or even trying
to use the economizer cycle and bring
[SPEAKER_00]: outside air in for that purpose,
you can end up over drying the space and
[SPEAKER_00]: that becomes like a spider mite challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a balance of making sure you're
cooling the air down where it needs to and
[SPEAKER_00]: won't any further so you don't have that
dehumidification problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a balance of airflow and temperature
and humidity control that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a little bit of forethought you can
get around that problem and not have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: back and install the humidifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that happen all the time though.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty cheap to install but it
becomes another thing you have to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've got this system spraying
water into a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the sprays nozzles aren't perfectly
maintained, there's droplets into your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and then you've got a clean
challenge just like condensate training
[SPEAKER_00]: onto your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot of challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily we don't have that with our
systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: The importance of modulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another one here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are both the temp and humidity controlled
by one air handling unit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a meme with one system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we can use one air handling unit per
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do multiple per room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what the tolerance is for
redundancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but that's the point of an integrated
AGACD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is integrated because temperature
and humidity controlled by one piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically we're talking about bringing the
air below the dew point or sorry to the
[SPEAKER_00]: dew point you need to be maintaining room
humidity and then reheating the air back
[SPEAKER_00]: up before it gets back into the room so
that you can maintain the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because often going all the way that low
on the dew point means that you'd over
[SPEAKER_00]: cool the space, especially when the lights
turn off and you go into the dark period
[SPEAKER_00]: because someone flips the switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have all those processes in
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, our units do both temperature and
humidity control from one piece of
equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another question here from David.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you touch briefly on the concept of
reheat coils for dehumidification?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reheat coils come from the HVAC
industry because about 20 or 30 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: most energy codes around the world
mandated you could not use new energy to
[SPEAKER_00]: reheat air after you've brought the
temperature down to get to the dew point
[SPEAKER_00]: you need for dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to get around this, they were using
the energy from the compression cycle and
[SPEAKER_00]: taking hot compressed gas from compressors
and putting it through a coil in the air
[SPEAKER_00]: stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that the hot gas reheat coil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it saved you from using an electric
reheat coil, basically a toaster in the
[SPEAKER_00]: air stream using new energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were going to otherwise take that hot
compressed gas and release that energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what the typical reheat coil is
that we think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes in different forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a chilled water system,
you might have a four-pipe system and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're taking chilled water to get the
dehumidification done and temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: brought down on the air coming through the
air handler.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reheat happens using the condenser
loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got a chiller making chilled
water on one side, you'll be making hot
[SPEAKER_00]: water on the other that you can use as the
reheat energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same philosophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not taking the energy you have to
reject anyways in the compression cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting it back into the air stream
to do reading.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another one here from our friend
Christopher Lacey.
[SPEAKER_04]: How was peak transpiration measured and
how would you account for pruning and
[SPEAKER_04]: canopy training?
[SPEAKER_00]: So many ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a grower with experience,
peak transpiration is measured by watching
[SPEAKER_00]: the level of water in your tanks as you
water from one day to the next and
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out how much water you've had to
refill back into your tanks for
[SPEAKER_00]: prudigation and capturing as well anything
that you've drained and sent out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: sewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can watch that, that's probably
the most accurate way to figure out how
[SPEAKER_00]: much water is going into a room that ends
up in the media and stays in the media and
[SPEAKER_00]: is transpired.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do that for enough days and you can
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more scientific approach, the way that
I think the guys with lab coats do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: is they have a transpiration test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll water a plant, one plant out of
a room or they'll take the samples from
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of the room and they'll weigh the
plant, put water in, watch the run out,
[SPEAKER_00]: watch how much water stays inside the root
media, weigh that and then every hour
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll come back and weigh that plant
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll catch the weight of the plant as
it changes over time and account for the
[SPEAKER_00]: water going in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a very granular and scientific way
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people into and out of
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of measurements to be taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a sensor system inside of our units
to figure out how much condensate is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of our units.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of equivalent that we found
to be very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using our particular setup, we're within
5-10% in our rooms of what the growers
[SPEAKER_00]: tell us they're actually putting in
through the fertigation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a pretty good number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a lot of time to develop it and
it's not exactly intuitive the way that we
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've been able to come up with a
pretty solid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every room that we're in, we know how
much water is being transpired.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was in relation to pre-construction.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the question is more specific to
pre-planning the facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe you can talk a little bit more about
the scientific studies that we've done and
[SPEAKER_04]: the data that we collect from the control
room.
[SPEAKER_04]: The control systems that we have deployed
in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned in my part, I was talking
about maybe one of the important things is
[SPEAKER_00]: sending hundreds of points of data every
minute to the cloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: The data we're collecting gives us back
from every room that we're in with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of lighting and all the
different types of growing styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives us a reference point for whatever
new project we're walking into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say we've got it all 100%
figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure we'll run into a growing system
we don't know or we haven't seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll come up with a good estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll tell us based on a plant
canopy square footage number how much
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration we can expect from that
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny, but it's not about a square
footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually about the volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the volume of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people grow high and wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using lights that penetrate all
the way through using HPS systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are different than the low
penetration we normally see with LED
[SPEAKER_00]: systems where maybe the diodes are all
angled straight down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to trellis out the systems
and spread it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the canopy volume is a lot smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these things add up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we take that into account as we come
up with the peak transpiration rate we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got to maintain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just one more piggyback on that
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: How does pruning or removing leaves affect
transpiration?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're taking stomata out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're taking out those pores,
those wet surfaces, inside the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will typically drop the
transpiration rate significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because we're watching the rooms every
minute, we know when we've got some really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting things on a graph that we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say, oh, they just trimmed today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the room will be completely blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the transpiration rate drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, oh, they must have just
trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll see it climb back up as the
plants redevelop in different ways and
[SPEAKER_00]: start to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really interesting data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need spray events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell by looking at a graph,
oh, they sprayed today in this room
[SPEAKER_00]: because the lights turned off in the
middle of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the HVAC system worked to compensate
and fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's basically pruning leaves
takes out the stomata that are directly
[SPEAKER_00]: tied to the transpiration rate of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the concept of transpiration and
water, maybe there's a question here about
[SPEAKER_04]: what are the best methods to drain
humidity from a dehumidifying unit from
[SPEAKER_04]: your grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe touch a little bit on condensate
capture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Either way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that would be a great segue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's another question about
desiccant-based systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And geothermal was mentioned in the
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, the ability to have the
condensate, we can not only measure the
[SPEAKER_03]: condensate and the water that's flowing
out of the units, but we're able to reuse
[SPEAKER_03]: that and recapture that in the grower can
and reuse for irrigation if they desire.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a benefit of a system that has
a condensate drain and a coil on it such
[SPEAKER_03]: that we can not only measure that amount
of moisture that's being removed through
[SPEAKER_03]: that, but you're also able to reuse it,
which is if we were to want to use that as
[SPEAKER_03]: a point of differentiation against the
desiccant-based systems that are out there
[SPEAKER_03]: for the most part, where you're really,
in effect, blasting out that moisture out
[SPEAKER_03]: of the space back into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: In our opinion, it's one of the potential
negatives of a desiccant-based system.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a lot of great positives.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of positives of
desiccant-based systems from an efficiency
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective and an air cleaning
perspective and things.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're more complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you need to have all of the parts and
pieces appropriately designed and
[SPEAKER_03]: constructed.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot of good players out
there that know this in the way to fully
[SPEAKER_03]: control the rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of sort of spot type units
that are used, particularly in the
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in other locations, and really in some
of the standalone dehumidifiers that you
[SPEAKER_03]: see on the marketplace, you may not even
know that you have a desiccant-based
[SPEAKER_03]: system in your facility currently,
if you have one of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we see pros and cons with the
different types of systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ability to capture condensate and
reuse that water to us is a big,
[SPEAKER_03]: big benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Geothermal was mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think what I mentioned was
water-cooled DX systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's so many different HVAC system
types out there and different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is sort of a detailed question on the
type of heat rejection mechanism that you
[SPEAKER_03]: would be using on the other side of the
equation from the air handling unit
[SPEAKER_03]: serving the space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a water-cooled DX system is typically
going to be connected to a hybrid
[SPEAKER_03]: adiabatic cooler plant with pumping skid
or a cooling tower plant or dry coolers or
[SPEAKER_03]: some sort of system like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas a geothermal system, you're
actually using either water or the earth,
[SPEAKER_03]: the ground to use as the heat exchange
mechanism or heat exchange medium that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're using.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so geothermal in general is a much
longer discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Topic really, and we can go into more
about that together directly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in general, I don't know that I've
seen a geothermal project personally in
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis or horticulture space to
date.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm sure that it can be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to take a lot more
engineering to get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, I don't know if you have others to
add.
[SPEAKER_00]: So geothermal system, when I think about
geothermal, I think about the whole point
[SPEAKER_00]: of geothermal is I'm going to store heat
in the ground in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take it out in the winter and
vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take heat out in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use the cool water on the
ground, the ground effect in the
[SPEAKER_00]: summertime, and it just makes the systems
much more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done the analysis to figure out
if that really makes sense here because
[SPEAKER_00]: the indoor conditions don't change in a
well-sealed, well-prepared room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're always using the ground with our
loops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just don't know if they're the right
answer or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty involved design that we've
got to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But welcome to challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would take a detailed engineering
analysis really to figure out if that's
[SPEAKER_03]: the right way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: But site conditions, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: In some cases, you're able to use
resources around you that could allow for
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another question that came in here is,
I noticed a plastic duct sock running
[SPEAKER_04]: through the tray of one of your pictures.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your opinion on the options
available for in-room airflow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think I said this in the Q&A of
another webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did maybe the first one and the second
one, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you just have to get air into the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oscillating fans on the wall, propeller
fans, they don't do a very good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to cause a lot of stress
wherever that direct blast is hitting the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it becomes really challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the best system out there is
vertical air solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is well thought out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they put a lot of time and effort into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plastic tube that we use,
I mean, we spent some effort and resources
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out the right tube to use because
we needed some way to get that air flow
[SPEAKER_00]: through a room because it is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would just have to come up with the
cheapest way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it as consistent or is it as solid
as a rack-mounted duct?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't done a side-by-side comparison
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do know that our system works pretty
well, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might be more cost effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there isn't a plan to use anything,
then go and find something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really, it's a 1% to 2% cost of
the total project to put those systems in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it makes a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'd say about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see it in the CFD modeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we run those models, you can,
in the model, turn on and off those
[SPEAKER_03]: in-rack fans and just see the path of air
just going, finding its way around the
[SPEAKER_03]: canopy rather than through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I always think about thermostats on
the wall and humidistats on the wall and
[SPEAKER_04]: how the conditions could be drastically
different between the those sensors and
[SPEAKER_04]: what's actually inside of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're huge advocates of having the
sensors right down in the canopy,
[SPEAKER_03]: right next to the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're really going to get, you know,
if that's what we're trying to control to,
[SPEAKER_03]: then that's where those sensors should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes good sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys have a ballpark price per ton
for an Inspire system that you can give
[SPEAKER_04]: us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Age taken away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in general, you know, so first
off, dollar per ton is a really hard thing
[SPEAKER_03]: to baseline around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we didn't hit it quite as hard as we
normally do earlier on in the prepared
[SPEAKER_03]: remarks.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, this is really a moisture
removal challenge, not an air conditioning
[SPEAKER_03]: challenge, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And tons of tons of air conditioning in
the way that it's typically thought of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the funny thing about it,
you know, in a refrigeration world,
[SPEAKER_03]: tons means almost something a bit
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have a connection to horsepower of
compressor and things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it really there's so many different
types of systems that are out there and
[SPEAKER_03]: different types of technologies that are
used to do the moisture removal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It almost really doesn't matter what the
tonnage is that it takes any given
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturer to, you know, require them in
order to do the dehumidification at that
[SPEAKER_03]: given room condition and that dew point,
a combination of temperature and relative
[SPEAKER_03]: humidity that you're trying to maintain
inside your space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we like to assert that we use pounds
per hour, dollar per pounds per hour of
[SPEAKER_03]: moisture removed at that given condition
rather than dollar per ton.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we get the question all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's important to know what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, ours is typically in the five to
six thousand dollars range per ton.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're using the important thing to
note is that we're typically using 40
[SPEAKER_03]: percent of the tons compared to another
brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so our dollar per ton may sound really
expensive, but when you baseline it
[SPEAKER_03]: against what it's really going to cost for
that room on a dollar per pound per hour
[SPEAKER_03]: basis or just at the end of the day,
when you get down to the bottom and look
[SPEAKER_03]: at the total price, we're going to be
right there neck and neck with another
[SPEAKER_03]: system that's twenty five hundred bucks a
ton or three thousand dollars a ton.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're talking about when I say that
we're talking about the entire the cost
[SPEAKER_03]: for the entire system for that room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're not just providing an air
conditioning unit, shipping it out to you
[SPEAKER_03]: and saying good luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, find a controls contractor to
locally to do it or, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: go find go find some in room in airflow
devices and, you know, buy this buy and
[SPEAKER_03]: buy that.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a full, complete system for that
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that's something that's
also overlooked when you just ask for a
[SPEAKER_03]: dollar per ton.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's typically referring to just,
you know, I'm just going to buy that
[SPEAKER_03]: package unit and throw it up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's fifteen hundred bucks
a ton or two, two thousand bucks a ton.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, well, no, at the end of the
day, once you add in all these other
[SPEAKER_03]: things, you didn't have the right air
cleaning and the right filtration
[SPEAKER_03]: available in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You didn't have the right type of reheat
available and all these other things you
[SPEAKER_03]: start to add up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the that's the importance of
that bid form that we talked about.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you start adding all the rest of that
stuff up and you're going to get close to
[SPEAKER_03]: or above what we've just shared.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we like to approach it with our
clients just from an eyes wide open.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what it's going to cost total
full, you know, for the entire system so
[SPEAKER_03]: that your rooms up and running.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got pressure control in your room,
the right type of odor control for the
[SPEAKER_03]: exhaust.
[SPEAKER_03]: The CO2 life safety purge that's required
by code and for life safety purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all of those things are so
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why just like leave those to be to hope
that they're going to get those holes are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get filled in the project when
you can really can scope it all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to do dollars per ton,
go to Home Depot and buy a five ton split
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that is going to be your cheapest
dollar per ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the I mean, it's a difference
between non integrated, conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated, conventional and inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that I made that comparison clear
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that is really the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting a unit that's intended for
cultivation systems and cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: abilities and has all those other features
that are going to make you so much more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient and profitable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seems like sometimes the the cheapest
option up front may be your most expensive
[SPEAKER_04]: in the long run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Iceberg, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The iceberg iceberg analogy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got one coming in from Amy Brown here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any specific state compliance
regulations that you've come across that
[SPEAKER_04]: hinder the operational planning for
cultivation facilities?
[SPEAKER_04]: She's asking from Illinois.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is this is a great, a really great
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's it's a moving target,
really.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, we're just we're in the
last week or so reviewing the California
[SPEAKER_03]: Title 24 draft case report about the
projected 2022 code updates for
[SPEAKER_03]: California, which for anybody involved in
the building and construction world knows
[SPEAKER_03]: that most fairly progressive states will
take California's Title 24 and apply that
[SPEAKER_03]: as their energy code and building standard
as a sort of an easy way to piggyback on
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody that's already gone through and
done it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of what we're very
involved in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in general, there's really almost
no codes and standards save for a handful
[SPEAKER_03]: around the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Massachusetts has a few.
[SPEAKER_03]: Illinois has a few, as Amy's mentioned in
the way that they've written it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But more and more jurisdictions need to
want to get this done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's a bit of a race right now,
I think, going on around industry within
[SPEAKER_03]: industry organizations and other
stakeholders, both on the utility side and
[SPEAKER_03]: the public utility, public utility
commissions of the states, the utilities
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves, the design and construction
professionals, people that are involved
[SPEAKER_03]: from a cultivation perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're getting a lot of input
from all the different stakeholders,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Amy's somewhat specifically referring
to a code that came out in Illinois that
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't even part of their building code,
from my understanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part of their cannabis code that
basically specifies and stipulates that
[SPEAKER_03]: you should be using mini splits for your
system, smaller facilities and VRF systems
[SPEAKER_03]: for your larger facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it says, or kind of as an
afterthought or more efficient
[SPEAKER_03]: alternatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so challenging to see a jurisdiction
take on a particular system type into
[SPEAKER_03]: their code.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be a performance based type
metric, not a here you must use this type
[SPEAKER_03]: of system type of an approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because like we talked about, we didn't
specifically mention VRF variable
[SPEAKER_03]: refrigerant flow systems earlier on in the
different system types, but they're there
[SPEAKER_03]: in that non-integrated conventional type
of scenario where you're needing
[SPEAKER_03]: standalone dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in effect, what Illinois has done with
that scenario is they've said,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I think in general, we all know
that, yeah, there's a lot of legacy
[SPEAKER_03]: growers that have had great success with
that, but that's coupled with really
[SPEAKER_03]: robust strategies around IPM, pest
management control, and the rest of the
[SPEAKER_03]: other ways that they're able to mitigate
their environmental challenges that ended
[SPEAKER_03]: up rearing their heads through those types
of systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just really important,
I think, for jurisdictions to understand
[SPEAKER_03]: as they go through this process that they
need to find real world and performance
[SPEAKER_03]: based things that are practical in the
space.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're involved in some projects in
Illinois right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our system is just going to absolutely
smash the performance of that VRF system
[SPEAKER_03]: that they call for in the code,
yet provide them with a significantly
[SPEAKER_03]: better environment to work with inside of
those spaces.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's a bit of a win-win in that
perspective, and hopefully we'll be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to garner some utility incentives as a
result of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do feel like that's somewhat leading
many cultivators down the wrong path by
[SPEAKER_03]: forcing that on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Adrian.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got a nice controls question here from
Andy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you typically see all wired sensors
inside the canopy, or are wireless options
[SPEAKER_04]: available to provide future flexibility in
sensor location?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of wireless options coming on
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our sensors at this point in time
are wired, but we're talking to people,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can integrate with anyone's sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a sensor array deployed by one
company that can communicate through the
[SPEAKER_00]: Modbus or the BACnet or some sort of
internet protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can pull that data out and use it
effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a bad taste in them all for
wireless sensors, especially wireless
[SPEAKER_00]: sensors in an industrial process-type
setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find that a lot of these rooms are very
busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're noisy electrically.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get hit with spray from time to time,
and there's all sorts of challenges there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've seen them used, and I've seen
them not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to this day, our systems,
we send them out with wired sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to the day when we can just
use a wireless sensor and know it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get all the things it needs to from
just being wireless.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you, one of the challenges is we
put all of our sensors in an aspirated
[SPEAKER_00]: box.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, it is the most reliable way to get
data from the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to power a fan on a box that sucks
air through so I don't expose the sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: to those nasty industrial conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That power has to come from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't have a solar panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robbing lights from the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to run a power line to it anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make wire to power the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just as easy to bring multiple
conductors over and get the sensor data
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if that really answers
your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are options available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't speak to any of them right now
about their efficacy or whether I'd want
[SPEAKER_00]: to use them.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's do one final question and
bring this presentation to a close,
[SPEAKER_04]: guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any chance we can get a copy of
your bid form?
[SPEAKER_00]: All day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you would appreciate some
conversation along with it so that you
[SPEAKER_03]: understand how it really comes together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure that you don't miss anything
through that process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we would be happy to talk you
through that if you get in touch with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I just throw in there too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, it's a bid form that we've built.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're HVAC environment centric.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that there are people in the
lighting industry who have as much
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise and knowledge on their specific
field that could highlight and include
[SPEAKER_00]: more items in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were looking at the conventional
integrated system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see all sorts of things in that
picture that we don't like, like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: wiring hanging out all over the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that adds cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably not captured in our bid form
properly or appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But someone else with a little more
expertise in those areas for wiring the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights will be able to show you how you
can save money up front in your
[SPEAKER_00]: installation costs and end up with a more
robust bid form in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tap us for that network.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Adrian mentioned, we have a network
that's wide and deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we work with some of the best brands
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're happy to share that too along
with that bid form.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.
Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I hope that this last hour was
informative for everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really appreciate everybody joining us
again today.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there are specific questions that you
have or ones that we didn't answer or
[SPEAKER_04]: answer well enough, please feel free to
reach out anytime.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're available to talk and help answer
questions at any point.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on that, unless Adrian and Rob have
anything else, call it closed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wash your hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wear a mask as applicable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we look forward to seeing everybody
soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
