[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us about Restock.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is Restock's mission and how can we
be not burning or throwing away a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: organic material?
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Lucas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a founder of a company called Restock.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do is we take byproducts of the
cannabis and hemp world and convert that
[SPEAKER_00]: into sustainable products, namely
paper-based packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we work with some of the larger scale
cultivators on the planet and we give them
[SPEAKER_00]: the opportunity to buy back their waste in
the form of packaging for their consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you think that's important?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everyone in this room can
understand why it's important,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think from a larger perspective,
the industry is coming out of never being
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming out of the black market and
typically it's been burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hide the evidence kind of mentality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working on these applications
for the last four or five years and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think combined with innovation and
regulation, the industry and the volumes
[SPEAKER_00]: that the industry is putting out now are
finally reaching a level that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually make an impact on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tremendously versatile plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just about packaging,
it's about finding the most appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: applications for it in concert with new
innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that technology is here today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's all this new innovation coming
about with like studying hemp as well as
[SPEAKER_04]: the waste cannabis product.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's all really exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom, how about you introduce yourself and
tell us about Bioproducts Innovation
[SPEAKER_04]: Center.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks, Tom McGrath.
[SPEAKER_01]: We formed Bioproducts Innovation Center
last year, so it's about a year and a few
[SPEAKER_01]: months old.
[SPEAKER_01]: We loosely based this on an initiative
that we were working on with Jason for the
[SPEAKER_01]: last several years on sort of a green
chemistry kind of approach, more from the
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial side out of Ohio Bioproducts
Innovation Center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got some of the inspiration from
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're an academic based nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're a standalone nonprofit based out
of LA Cleantech Incubator and I'm the
[SPEAKER_01]: chief sustainability officer for the
nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really look at the conversations
around the organics circular organics
[SPEAKER_01]: economy and how do we achieve that goal
and how do we help to move that
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation forward looking at affecting
change through the triple bottom line
[SPEAKER_01]: guidelines of benefit corporations or B
Corps or profits people planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the argument is that you're gonna do
better for the planet and better for the
[SPEAKER_01]: people by having profitable business
around sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea that you're gonna make more
money because you're doing the right thing
[SPEAKER_01]: with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we get into this zero waste
mentality, the sooner we get there,
[SPEAKER_01]: the better it will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we also look at it from the perspective
of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we look at sustainable, we look at
through the lens of sustainable energy
[SPEAKER_01]: into the water and soil conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really sustainable energy,
water and soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we're talking mostly about soil,
but you can't talk about one without the
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're all connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we make better soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: The food and the biologicals come from the
soil and they will return to the soil if
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not making plastics that you use
once and go in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some of the main ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to break it down to reality and
who's doing what.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did some interesting work with doing
admin on some composting projects with
[SPEAKER_01]: schools and communities here in LA to help
the city public works go through promoting
[SPEAKER_01]: compost at community scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just fascinating all the
different challenges that you come up with
[SPEAKER_01]: on all these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they growing food at the school?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they using the compost for the
fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're teaching how to get this
circular organics economy evolving at very
[SPEAKER_01]: small scales, but they're significant and
helping to really train the younger
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did that at an old age home too in a
little Tokyo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're doing bukashi, a type of
composting that they can compost their
[SPEAKER_01]: meat in addition to their fruits and
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're waste products, what they don't
consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's interesting, there's so many
different layers of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes to the big picture of our
industrial life has led us, the world's
[SPEAKER_01]: industry has led us to this place where we
take fossil fuels, we take fossil oil and
[SPEAKER_01]: natural gas, coal, oil and natural gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do things with them for industry
and it's a linear, linear conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We extract 400 million year old
hydrocarbons out of the earth and we burn
[SPEAKER_01]: them, turn them into plastic, any number
of things, we destroy them and then we're
[SPEAKER_01]: destroying mother nature and the
extraction part.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then in the use part, we're putting
that carbon in the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what doesn't end up in the ocean as
plastic ends up in the atmosphere as
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's choking us right now and
causing this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can do the hydrocarbon management
without extracting it from the,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can do four month old or four year old
hydrocarbons from bio based, biomethane.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't have to extract from 400
million years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can produce the biocarbons that we need
for our life here for billions of people
[SPEAKER_01]: living on this earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can do that in a way that's
sustainable, more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's move in that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the conversations of recycling and the
conversations of hemp as an important
[SPEAKER_01]: biological source for these hydrocarbons,
these are the answers that get you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain that a little bit more?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you extract four year old
hydrocarbons?
[SPEAKER_01]: Through anaerobic digestion, but you can
also do it through gasification if you
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially you make a soup,
you hire, you put biologicals in there
[SPEAKER_01]: from human waste to any kinds of organic
food trimmings.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a pure source of organics,
then you're gonna get three things out of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna get gases, you're gonna get
liquids, and you're gonna get solids.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gases are hydrocarbon gases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the trick is the hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all love hydrogen, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first element, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we love hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here because of hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hydrogen, you're getting the
hydrogen from the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bugs, the little microbes are
consuming the organics in the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're giving you CH4.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four Hs and one C.
[SPEAKER_01]: One carbon, four hydrogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're lucky that we can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an important element that we need
access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're getting it almost for free from
these microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a waste product, quote unquote,
that we use, things we used to throw away,
[SPEAKER_01]: or things that we can grow, and the
byproducts of some of these we can channel
[SPEAKER_01]: into the bioenergy conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this gets us out of the fossil fuel
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a one-for-one exchange for natural
gas, for fracking for natural gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get that renewable natural gas,
or biomethane, from today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: 400 million years ago, four-year-old,
40-year-old tree, whatever it's gonna be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get biogases from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the same hydrocarbon gases,
you can make plastics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can make the things that we use today
that we find convenient or helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: A heart valve or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some good things if you need to
use plastics, there are reasons to use it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it can be bio-plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bio-based plastics.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have to be from the fossil
fuels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lucas, instead of using this amazing
organic waste and then doing this whole
[SPEAKER_04]: process and turning it into methane,
what have been your challenges in
[SPEAKER_04]: diverting that waste and keeping it away
from different sorts of digestion?
[SPEAKER_04]: How has your work been challenging thus
far with working with waste cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that it's been challenging,
first and foremost, in the lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure and processing here in this
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry is just kind of coming out of
its shell, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to process the organic waste into a
useful, reusable, sustainable material
[SPEAKER_00]: within a reasonable distance has been a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're actually breaking ground on one
of the first biorefineries in the state at
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully the end of this year to create
these regional circular economies that Tom
[SPEAKER_00]: was hinting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: California?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the infrastructure's not really
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you travel more than 100 miles with
it could be the most sustainable material
[SPEAKER_00]: on earth, it immediately degrades that
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think restock was a little bit ahead
of its time in the sense that the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't producing as much material and the
infrastructure wasn't really in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, now the demand is there and
certainly the industry is growing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the last piece of the puzzle is
the infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In place to process all these different
inputs, we're primarily focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by infrastructure, you just mean the
processing, like the biorefinery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Processing with more than one end result,
more than one application, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: textiles, whether it is paper-based
packaging, whether it is bioplastics,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether that is some kind of alternative
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of different ways to do it
and people who are much smarter than me
[SPEAKER_00]: are thankfully in charge of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just really fortunate to have some
partners in that space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who have been the most helpful allies for
you?
[SPEAKER_00]: The state has been very encouraging,
I will say that, despite we were talking
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier about just the background back and
forth between regulators and the
[SPEAKER_00]: bureaucracy, red tape surrounding that has
been wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CalRecycle, the governor's office have
been very encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just, like I was saying earlier,
they have their plates really full with
[SPEAKER_00]: how much they should be taxing,
giving out all these licenses,
[SPEAKER_00]: how are they going to deal with the influx
in cash, all these businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times waste management and
recycling is the basement level of what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're trying to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've been very helpful and partners
like Circular Systems, which are the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing partners that we're building
this biorefinery with, have been
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're focusing on textiles?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're focusing on textiles, yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're developing a couple of cool projects
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just awarded the H&M Global
Agency of Change Award for 2018,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is like the Nobel Peace Prize for
Fashion, which was a very big deal for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just voting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came with some money too?
[SPEAKER_00]: They came with, yeah, some money as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were voted Time Magazine's Top 10
Smartest Sustainable Ideas of 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're honored to be working so closely
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think innovation should be driving
regulation, and that's a very slow
[SPEAKER_00]: slippery slope, especially given the way
that the exchange of information is so
[SPEAKER_00]: fast nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult to stay ahead of
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think California is doing a great
job, and they're doing what they can to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay ahead of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the technology is here, and it's
honestly a race against time, as I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys will agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious if any of you have any dream
allies or dream partners that you have not
[SPEAKER_04]: gotten the chance to work with,
and you feel like, gosh, if I could just
[SPEAKER_04]: work with this organization or this
person, we could really get some stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say a company like Patagonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the first B Corp in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just such a model for change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being radical, but being thoughtful,
and also understanding their consumer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and not alienating one demographic or
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see almost anyone wearing
Patagonia, and they feel good about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a dream for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they could be using some of this
paper for their labels.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or doing the textiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Paper's a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: First beginning, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just before I would answer that
question, I'd just talk about this concept
[SPEAKER_01]: of upcycling, or finding value in what
used to be considered a waste or a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for any kind of business case,
you're just looking at that like,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so you're starting off with a negative
and turning into a positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're already ahead of all the other
businesses that are starting off at zero
[SPEAKER_01]: when going to a positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're working with something that's
just a giving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's so many great businesses
that come out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's inspiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an awesome company at LICI that
recycles bio plastics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to separate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to get it separated in order to
do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's both consumer and ultimately
corporate responsibility for why did you
[SPEAKER_01]: buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a lot of change.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to happen at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard to orchestrate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really interesting to see all
these different people trying to develop
[SPEAKER_01]: the modality for change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different people are feeling that sense of
urgency in different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think everyone senses it,
that we have to adjust.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to make adjustments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how does that work from working
with amazing innovators?
[SPEAKER_01]: Elon Musk doing amazing getting us all
into EVs and do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you look at the life cycle
analysis of a lithium battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, OK, well, there's issues
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the things that we have to work
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing's going to be perfect right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of steps you can take
right away to create businesses and
[SPEAKER_01]: enterprise around sustainability,
around bioproducts, around renewable
[SPEAKER_01]: energy, around clean water.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Tesla would be a great dream ally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, if we could be making a hemp car.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the inside could be hemp textiles,
alternative leathers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think places like Lacey are very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that a cleantech incubator is
something you don't see a lot of.
[SPEAKER_04]: That stands for LA cleantech incubator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're honored to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be working out of there is very
inspirational and motivational.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from a day-to-day perspective and
level, it's kind of a lot of doom and
[SPEAKER_00]: gloom when you look at the current state
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is hard to maybe stay motivated a
lot when you're looking at all this going
[SPEAKER_00]: on in the air quality in Mexico and all of
the burning of trash in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all happening around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think using incubators like Lacey and
having the young minds who are taking some
[SPEAKER_00]: accountability and some responsibility for
what's been done to the planet and what
[SPEAKER_00]: continues to be done is so rad to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to go down one little
channel, and then I'll let go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I spent a lot of cycles working in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've had an illegal Jamaican was
something big in the 80s, I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've been down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are organics to waste 85% to 90%
of what goes into the dump.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a landfill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a dump in Kingston.
[SPEAKER_01]: 80% to 90% of that is organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is an attractive target for doing
a better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You set up a MRF.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90% of your activity that you're going to
be doing, recycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Materials recovery facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: A sorting center.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to focus on the organics,
because that's 90% of what is going in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a two-part program.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was to attack the problem of the
waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a big problem there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was burning things, and things are
happening there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad air quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very dangerous for the people that live
right around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next is they had a sugar
industry that has lost their business to
[SPEAKER_01]: larger companies like Brazil that can
produce sugar less expensively because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the high cost of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can grow grasses, like hemp,
like king grasses or other.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can grow material that can then be
digested and produce the renewable natural
[SPEAKER_01]: gas to replace the diesel that they
currently run their whole island on
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel, electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are island-wide, island
solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And islands are really great because it's
such a metaphor for our little blue
[SPEAKER_01]: marble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything has to be managed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do that circular organics
economy in island nations, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: with a really good, very positive outcomes
and a clear need and desire to have a more
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they have such incredibly high
energy costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that affects everyone, from schools to
hospitals.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a problem with their
electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these hurricanes come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Puerto Rico, all the work that people
have been doing down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll just leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that circular organics model.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel very lucky to be in California,
because it seems like there's so much
[SPEAKER_04]: that's possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people are so interested in finding
new solutions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas I know in a lot of places like
Mexico and other small countries,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's just waste everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: There just are no systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here we have such an opportunity to
actually figure out what to do with all of
[SPEAKER_04]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think you're 100% right about the
island nations actually needing to manage
[SPEAKER_00]: it even more so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their resources are extremely finite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so micromanaging that is of the utmost
importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to pick your brain about that
work you did there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they could do textiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And solving the problem of the waste issue
doesn't just always come down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: biomaterials either.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's systematic change that needs to
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the issues that affect one country are
going to be different than where they come
[SPEAKER_02]: from or how they affect another country.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we have here, when we look at our
waste system, and you're asking who would
[SPEAKER_02]: you like to work with, I don't have a
particular business I want to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make sure everyone's at the
table so that we can have conversations to
[SPEAKER_02]: try to figure out what the solutions are,
particularly to the waste issue that we
[SPEAKER_02]: might be having.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those solutions are not just one off,
trade it for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get rid of plastic and trade it for
a bio plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much more to it than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a complexity there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to get to a point where we are
reducing our consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to get to a point where we're not
allowing corporations to tell us that we
[SPEAKER_02]: have to consume in order to live.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to have a new business with a
business plan these days and actually feel
[SPEAKER_04]: good about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, I don't really want you to
buy this, but I want you to buy this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there's, when we talk about
scalability, if we reduce the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: need and we have enough of these
businesses coming out and saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, to be able to trade this product for
this product or be able to reduce here,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have solutions within there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that it's going to put
people out of business unless they're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to get their product into Walmart
or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you look at other countries,
sometimes their waste issue is not about,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, they have this waste now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to deal with their waste because
they have a lot of poly, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: pet water bottles, number one water
bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to not use terminology,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have number one water bottles and we
have a lot of film plastic and we have a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of chip bags and granola bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are wrappers and they can't do
anything and they never had this stuff 20,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 years ago, but they have it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the problem is the waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the problem is that we're going into
their country.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're colonizing their country.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're taking over their land.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying, you can't grow your own
crop anymore because we're going to take
[SPEAKER_02]: this amount of land here and we're going
to put a palm oil company on it because we
[SPEAKER_02]: need palm oil in the products that we buy
and our soaps and our conditioners and our
[SPEAKER_02]: food, whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need that palm oil, but that palm oil
is going to be wrapped in eco-friendly
[SPEAKER_02]: wrapping, so don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have this, so they take over the
land.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have communities who are living in
that land all throughout who are now
[SPEAKER_02]: having to be forced into one small area.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't grow their own food anymore,
so they don't have, they can't,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, subsist on what they used to
subsist on and they need to go and work
[SPEAKER_02]: the palm oil plantation to be able to make
the money, to be able to go buy the food
[SPEAKER_02]: because they can't grow their food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're saying, don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to set up some markets within
this little neighborhood that you've now
[SPEAKER_02]: been shoved into and at these little
markets, those little markets,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're kiosks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're kiosks with diabetes causing food
options that come in single-use disposable
[SPEAKER_02]: product that they can't do anything with.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have the infrastructure for
landfills.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have the infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff's not really going to get recycled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incineration is, in my opinion,
out of the question and I know there might
[SPEAKER_02]: be people here that disagree with me,
but it's extremely expensive and the
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of toxicity built up goes within
the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: The community pays for that eventually,
besides the fact that it's more expensive
[SPEAKER_02]: and it creates more CO2 than coal and
nuclear.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, and you can look up Gaia.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have any questions, Global Alliance
for Incinerator Alternatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we won't get into a deep dive on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they're told, you have food.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy all this product.
[SPEAKER_02]: They eat that product.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to burn it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to open pit burn it because
you don't like trash on the streets here
[SPEAKER_02]: in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we think that people in countries
in Central America or in Africa want trash
[SPEAKER_02]: on their streets?
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really good point because with the
palm oil, because that was the solution
[SPEAKER_04]: that in America we thought, oh boy,
we're going to have sustainable fuel and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's going to be biodiesel and we're going
to make it from palm oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then this huge, what they call a carbon
bomb, was offset from deforesting so much
[SPEAKER_04]: of the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's still fires burning
underground in their peat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Indonesia, yeah, Indonesia.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just such a good story of warning
before you start running off with a new
[SPEAKER_04]: sustainable idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you go all the way through the
process and look at all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: consequences because now Indonesia has a
lot of problems and we have colonized them
[SPEAKER_04]: and lost so many trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worse than transportation at this
point, just that process she just
[SPEAKER_01]: described.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use the word underdeveloped,
but you use that as a verb.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have underdeveloped that area through
this process she just described.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an active verb.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an adjective.
[SPEAKER_02]: We underdeveloped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an active verb.
It's an active verb.
