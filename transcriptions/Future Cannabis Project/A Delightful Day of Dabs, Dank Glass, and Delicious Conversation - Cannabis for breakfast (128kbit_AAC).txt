[SPEAKER_08]: brother actually you're here Bob Ross
you're my communication point or you let
[SPEAKER_08]: me know if yeah you let me know just
because the audio is all streaming through
[SPEAKER_08]: the device here yeah don't touch any
buttons looking into it and then I met
[SPEAKER_06]: like Jill Carrero online who's the sales
rep and we just started going through all
[SPEAKER_22]: the courses but we're already taking
selfies you got to get the Narcissistic so
[SPEAKER_22]: it holds your phone
[SPEAKER_13]: we're gonna paint some happy little trees
today happy little trees happy happy
[SPEAKER_06]: little trees the LPs are super keen on
this machine so I had the pleasure of
[SPEAKER_06]: working with a few and they do what they
call business intelligence so I R&D on
[SPEAKER_06]: some other schools and stuff and then I
come in and I run some samples for them
[SPEAKER_06]: and then they get all their data and away
they go
[SPEAKER_22]: my friend has one at his hemp farm in
Abbotsburg oh super cool BC hops those
[SPEAKER_22]: guys oh cool Dwayne better for THC than
CBD though they said that CBD it fell a
[SPEAKER_06]: little short way for THC much better it's
off by like point zero four percent right
[SPEAKER_06]: with concentrates it's off by point three
five percent but with CBD I think it's
[SPEAKER_06]: about one percent yeah which is a little
higher especially when they're dealing
[SPEAKER_22]: with like one and two percent well and
that's it right like that doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_06]: Canadian hemp does not have the highest
CBD content right it does do a semi
[SPEAKER_06]: quantitative terpian analysis you hear me
now so like low is from zero to one there
[SPEAKER_06]: anybody else
[SPEAKER_06]: usually when it's up to Wi-Fi you have a
little off of that I'll run it through I
[SPEAKER_06]: like when people stand in front of the
camera like yeah exactly I'm just like
[SPEAKER_16]: Johnny's Kush I finally got to actually
enjoy his Medi Kush here the last couple
[SPEAKER_10]: of days Johnny's got a nice set of hair oh
yeah yeah yeah definitely so you guys how
[SPEAKER_16]: long you guys been up on the back end okay
cool I know Lily was calling me going are
[SPEAKER_21]: you guys starting on time or you guys
gonna be late so you guys hearing anything
[SPEAKER_06]: that's going on through the cameras on
that end Justin you want to see your
[SPEAKER_06]: results buddy okay so what are you doing
Chris if you send Mac one to high north
[SPEAKER_06]: it'll be like 36% it's right in the name
your moisture content was 19.4 so really
[SPEAKER_06]: dry on the outside yours is 22.2 we
haven't we haven't run years yet so I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: just gonna there we go Lana's taking
Johnny be a nice infused beverage very
[SPEAKER_06]: nice can you hear me all right
[SPEAKER_22]: I had someone asked for their money back
recently because their shit got darker
[SPEAKER_22]: than the picture that we originally put up
how long was it from the time you gave it
[SPEAKER_22]: to them well I keep everything at like
minus 40 but the minute it leaves my
[SPEAKER_22]: facility it goes into a truck and then it
goes to a facility then it goes to the
[SPEAKER_22]: province then it goes to a store none of
them call it there's none of them cool it
[SPEAKER_22]: and it's like 30 degrees outside so yeah
this guy was like this is bunk it's all
[SPEAKER_22]: dark and so I took like a macro photograph
[SPEAKER_22]: yeah I'll show you what it looked like
under like he sent me a picture that made
[SPEAKER_22]: it look like some shitty bullshit to black
ash you're not here this is what it looks
[SPEAKER_21]: like under the microscope that's way too
dark full Bob full Mel bubble though dude
[SPEAKER_22]: was like I want my money back I'm like did
it affect the taste the potency anything
[SPEAKER_22]: this is just color I'm like you're gonna
ask for your money back are you you have
[SPEAKER_22]: to he'll go on reddit and start a post
buying a gram from a fucking oh yeah they
[SPEAKER_22]: hit you up and we say we will destroy your
brand on reddit if you do not and I'll be
[SPEAKER_22]: honest like the picture he sent me was
horrific looking he took a shitty blurry
[SPEAKER_22]: picture with his cell phone from a
distance so I was like I'll take a picture
[SPEAKER_22]: of the same hash and send it back to him
[SPEAKER_06]: just now which is what Justin brought with
him there's about 24 percent THC is really
[SPEAKER_06]: nice we ran through the moisture analyzer
and even though it felt really dry the
[SPEAKER_06]: outside it was 19.7 percent so right like
if you're buying weight you kind of want
[SPEAKER_06]: to know what your voice or level is so
that was really good but now we're gonna
[SPEAKER_20]: do Vera this is awesome I'm loving the
conversation this is great because
[SPEAKER_22]: Instagram right when it's like I
inadvertently created most of these morons
[SPEAKER_05]: I've had four of them break in like a
month and a half they're like the cheapest
[SPEAKER_05]: pieces of shit so we need like a cheap
worthy it looks like it looks like a scale
[SPEAKER_10]: like ladies and gentlemen ladies and
gentlemen we're waiting for results for
[SPEAKER_13]: the next yeah I don't think you guys
realize we're live right now dude you
[SPEAKER_10]: might want a fucking conversation was
fucking awesome I just wanted you to know
[SPEAKER_10]: that was
[SPEAKER_21]: really fast is it's how all labs
homogenous does it spiral up or no
[SPEAKER_22]: anytime I've ever been around London
[SPEAKER_13]: a couple things one have London bring the
audio level down a little bit Chris do you
[SPEAKER_13]: agree that the audio level is really loud
okay and that well and then bring the
[SPEAKER_10]: video back I don't know what just happened
and then also tell them to shut the hell
[SPEAKER_10]: up everybody else one conversation at a
time I love the dirty laundry conversation
[SPEAKER_09]: in the back yes tell me more tell me more
please really I was like this is so great
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm loving this oh this is great
[SPEAKER_13]: so Ken if you can hear me tell London that
we have no cameras right now
[SPEAKER_10]: there's a lot of we and we had two cameras
that were the same angle yeah okay we got
[SPEAKER_21]: one angle that's it that's what you get
you get right back into the Instagram
[SPEAKER_22]: post up some big but most people are just
like yeah but how about the country yeah
[SPEAKER_22]: that would be your state you're gonna take
care of your county different story you
[SPEAKER_22]: take care of your block you know like
those are different things and the people
[SPEAKER_22]: that take care of their brother only
they're very critical of the people who
[SPEAKER_29]: are trying to take oh my god 100% of the
wazoo you know what though in my opinion
[SPEAKER_05]: if you're growing your own weed and
smoking it you're going the best week
[SPEAKER_29]: absolutely absolutely totally that guy
yeah oh oh 100% yeah yeah exactly 70 I
[SPEAKER_06]: wrote a scale is completely different like
yeah no not for me I met this kid at good
[SPEAKER_22]: farm for the farm that 48 North owned it
he was young he was like 25 years old or
[SPEAKER_22]: something okay he planted like 277,000
seeds like his first big out they did 77
[SPEAKER_22]: acres and he was like oh you can see like
these ones are okay these ones are a
[SPEAKER_22]: little rough and he's kind of like talking
himself down are you kidding me like bro
[SPEAKER_22]: yeah I'm like what you've learned from
doing this came from a mutual friend of
[SPEAKER_22]: ours who sold them auto flowering ones in
one corner dude I was blown away we were
[SPEAKER_22]: driving through it in a golf cart and it
was like being in Morocco as far as the
[SPEAKER_29]: eye can see 60 and 60 acres of nugget this
big let's see what the fuck
[SPEAKER_09]: oh yeah we hear everything nice
[SPEAKER_10]: really slow those are like $5,000 each
each one of those are like those are the
[SPEAKER_17]: little one on the right here is only five
there's some really reasonably priced ones
[SPEAKER_17]: actually look at it there's a couple
$1,000 pieces remember that's in Canadian
[SPEAKER_11]: dollar oh yeah so it's like five whole
Canadian American yeah oh nice that girl's
[SPEAKER_11]: making me hungry
[SPEAKER_29]: you guys are on Vancouver Island sorry
what was that we're not on the island no
[SPEAKER_11]: where are you we're down it we're on the
mainland of Vancouver it's in Canada it's
[SPEAKER_10]: in Canada it's in Canada it's in Canada
it's in Canada all right I think you
[SPEAKER_10]: remind myself that's in Canada that's not
really beautiful it's only like that for a
[SPEAKER_10]: couple months and then it and it's like
white with snow so you gotta remind
[SPEAKER_06]: yourself I think we got 13.98 grams of
whatever jar you gave me yeah it is a
[SPEAKER_06]: little wet so I'm not expecting the
highest return I'm gonna use a some of
[SPEAKER_06]: it's gonna be a little bit moisture-based
but once we press like we're probably
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna take this parchment and put it into
the fridge to cool it down simply because
[SPEAKER_06]: it's fucking 30 degrees out here not ideal
pressing weather I could save it it's
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna be a 120 micron bag so we'll see
what we get out of it and then we'll just
[SPEAKER_08]: do a fresh tab hell yeah absolutely how
was that stuff that I pressed for you last
[SPEAKER_06]: time beautiful sort of taking toke oh god
it was nice that's nice actually I was
[SPEAKER_06]: really surprised how clean that came out
now for me I always like to pack my bags
[SPEAKER_06]: first so I do bottle textile so I sort of
do it like a coat and I stand it up and
[SPEAKER_06]: then I press my bag a lot of guys do it
flat but I prefer it this way I see a
[SPEAKER_06]: better yield I'm wearing gloves but we're
it's day for dabs doing some 14 grammars
[SPEAKER_22]: there come a long way over the years man
I'll never forget when Phil just sort of
[SPEAKER_22]: like was he was like he was doing the
parchment with 14 grams on the way to the
[SPEAKER_22]: flower and he was making he was just
taking bubble and just turning it into a
[SPEAKER_22]: sheet that he could dab that's it and he
ran out of bubble and he just randomly was
[SPEAKER_22]: like I'm gonna do this to a bud he doesn't
even know why he did it
[SPEAKER_22]: started a whole new scene that's kind of
how you feel like the flower would have
[SPEAKER_06]: been discovered to begin with right
someone rubbing against it working again
[SPEAKER_22]: it was open source if this wasn't open
source if one guy discovered this and
[SPEAKER_22]: never shared it it would none of us would
be doing this because
[SPEAKER_22]: innovators are like the point one percent
and the rest are ninety nine point nine
[SPEAKER_22]: percent yeah which is fine too right
that's how it spreads that's how like if
[SPEAKER_22]: one guy invent something exactly and he
doesn't have the distribution he doesn't
[SPEAKER_22]: have the network to get it out you know
you need to get it to a guy that maybe
[SPEAKER_22]: isn't the innovator but totally has the
distribution network it knows all the
[SPEAKER_22]: people can put it I mean Phil had put it
on his Instagram for I think it had been
[SPEAKER_22]: out there for a couple of weeks and it was
spreading when he came on hash church he
[SPEAKER_22]: showed that process there were machines a
week later there were rosin companies a
[SPEAKER_22]: month later and then it was just like bag
companies like everything was just like
[SPEAKER_22]: exponentially fast because I was like 30
or 40,000 people got exposed to it in like
[SPEAKER_22]: a two hour period
[SPEAKER_22]: the people that are like this is the other
thing
[SPEAKER_22]: this is a study ladies and gentlemen
[SPEAKER_21]: okay can you guys hear me now one point
two percent yes so Mike Mark your Vera
[SPEAKER_28]: results are up brother yeah these are your
numbers for your Vera twenty-one How many
[SPEAKER_08]: years old is that?
[SPEAKER_08]: The Vera is his mother's strain that he's
passed around for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's an old, old plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty cool, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't see a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been wanting to grow something like
that old.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got stuff that's like five,
six, seven years, but nothing in the
[SPEAKER_08]: double digits.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's like an old clone or just old
flowers?
[SPEAKER_22]: It's an old clone.
[SPEAKER_22]: I planted some 25-year-old ones from
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_22]: I had an old hash plant from like back in
the day, and it grew, but it was a mutant,
[SPEAKER_22]: and I could never get it to grow like what
it was.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just let it go.
[SPEAKER_22]: I popped a lamb's bread from Jamaica from
1995.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, that's one of my fucking favorites.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't even believe that.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't wait to get that email.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_28]: If it was quite a bit before the tissue
was turned, it would have been great to
[SPEAKER_28]: get it to a tissue company company.
[SPEAKER_21]: Have them figure out what is wrong.
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so this needs to get to the bridge.
[SPEAKER_21]: It looks so fucked up.
[SPEAKER_21]: I know, but it's just getting tired.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's beyond tired.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it obviously was from seed,
so it was obviously still holding some
[SPEAKER_22]: kind of violence.
[SPEAKER_22]: People are like, just grow it from seed.
[SPEAKER_22]: You won't get any of that.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like, are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_29]: Maybe a little pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_22]: It does look pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what my only bummer of flower
rosin is when you have a $400,
[SPEAKER_22]: $500 banger and you put flower rosin in
it, it's really hard to get.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's really hard to clean.
[SPEAKER_22]: Hash rosin just cleans right out.
[SPEAKER_22]: Flower rosin does not.
[SPEAKER_22]: When you dunk the whole thing into the
alcohol and you pull it out, you can still
[SPEAKER_22]: see this yellow, which is on the clean.
[SPEAKER_22]: Can we throw that in the fridge for a
minute?
[SPEAKER_22]: Taste-wise, potency-wise, I don't mind at
all.
[SPEAKER_22]: I just hate the idea of ruining my banger.
[SPEAKER_29]: It doesn't ruin it.
[SPEAKER_29]: It just takes a fucking shit load of work
to it.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, it does eventually ruin it because
eventually you can't clean it off without
[SPEAKER_22]: torches.
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't do it on top there, do it to the
side.
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't want the ink to run through.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well,
[SPEAKER_20]: that tastes nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It does taste fresh.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to test that too though.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to test that so we can find out
what it came out as.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll do a moisture analysis on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes it as accurate as possible.
[SPEAKER_24]: I've been winging this for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_24]: I know you.
[SPEAKER_24]: I love that we're able to do this,
be able to actually hear it.
[SPEAKER_24]: 100% from here.
[SPEAKER_24]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_24]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_24]: If people don't know when that education
is crucial, because once you get it,
[SPEAKER_24]: then you're like, oh.
[SPEAKER_06]: Knowledge is power.
[SPEAKER_24]: Like I said, squishing has to be at 62
because anything below I get y'all's
[SPEAKER_24]: shields.
[SPEAKER_24]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_24]: And I've seen that over time.
[SPEAKER_24]: And I've squished that at 42.58.
[SPEAKER_24]: We've been at 52.
[SPEAKER_24]: You've seen the squished rates.
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_24]: Squish that.
[SPEAKER_24]: What's your favorite?
[SPEAKER_24]: Me, my favorite is 180.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, moisture level is probably like 62.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, 62.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when I balance it, like I'm usually
getting, I'm doing like 7%, 8% moisture
[SPEAKER_06]: content.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I use my balancer and it's telling
me it's like anywhere between 7 and 10%,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's the best for like actual moisture
weight, like moisture content.
[SPEAKER_06]: For smashing, for squishing.
[SPEAKER_24]: So what's that moisture content in an AW
level?
[SPEAKER_24]: Dry as fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: I use my balancer to tell me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all I know is it tells me like what the
moisture.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I seem to.
[SPEAKER_21]: Where's your stuff?
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see it.
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's give it a try.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's number two.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to squish all of this by the end
of the day.
[SPEAKER_21]: Every night we dirt bike.
[SPEAKER_29]: I ride KTM's.
[SPEAKER_29]: I got the FE 350.
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.
[SPEAKER_21]: I have the EXC-FW and the EXC 450.
[SPEAKER_21]: So I got a low ratio line.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_22]: This low ratio one, EXC-W.
[SPEAKER_22]: What, is this your Medi push?
[SPEAKER_22]: You're like.
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it's actually small.
[SPEAKER_22]: EXC-FW.
[SPEAKER_07]: If my mic is doing better, it's a snowball
zombie directional on mine now.
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_29]: And not turning your mic on.
[SPEAKER_29]: He's like, oh wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I like low on torque.
[SPEAKER_24]: What are you using?
[SPEAKER_24]: That would be the Afena program.
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, I tried this and it was sort of like
a test.
[SPEAKER_28]: You don't have to use my food.
[SPEAKER_29]: You don't have to apologize if you don't
use it.
[SPEAKER_29]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_24]: What's funny is everybody changed certain
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_24]: Everybody goes, where's the flavor?
[SPEAKER_24]: So you go back to your time.
[SPEAKER_24]: You went back and then like, there's the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_24]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_24]: So even going with the last decade,
you change it.
[SPEAKER_24]: You're going to change the flavor.
[SPEAKER_29]: Listen, our new chemist, our old chemist
is amazing.
[SPEAKER_29]: Our new chemist is fucking magic,
dude.
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_24]: So I just want to know if I can use all
the Medi one as something I can add into
[SPEAKER_24]: my business.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_24]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_24]: Absolutely again.
[SPEAKER_06]: John, this is yours here?
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, is it?
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_24]: Did you take it out of this jar?
[SPEAKER_24]: That is yours, but he gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_24]: We were squishing it like this and stuff.
[SPEAKER_24]: He even wanted to grab some fresh stuff
out of here.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, I'll just take this for moisture
balance.
[SPEAKER_24]: I was saying we were going to clean the
shit out of that.
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I was poking it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like rubbing it, making it feel all
lovely.
[SPEAKER_22]: That won't affect rosin.
[SPEAKER_22]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_22]: You finger fuck it to death and I'll still
press all the rosin off of it.
[SPEAKER_22]: Put it in a warm room and let the heads
melt and I'll still get it off.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, he's in prison being forgotten about
now.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's kind of like you had a good run,
dude, but now you're kind of a nobody.
[SPEAKER_22]: The kids get more attention.
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's very small from the front.
[SPEAKER_29]: You can't even tell because it's all
buried underground.
[SPEAKER_29]: This is all this whole side land comes up
over the building on the whole other side.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey John, pink goo, pink goo, pink goo,
pink goo.
[SPEAKER_20]: What's pink?
[SPEAKER_21]: Write your email there please.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, no, because they're just they don't
really want we to succeed.
[SPEAKER_29]: No, they don't.
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, nobody could have shipped the bed
this hard.
[SPEAKER_21]: Like not on purpose.
[SPEAKER_20]: Mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_29]: Mushroom should have been a little harder
than wheat.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_20]: I put a little bit of money into it and I
lost though.
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow, I made 300 grand on 10 grand on
mushroom socks.
[SPEAKER_20]: In three weeks.
[SPEAKER_20]: You got out.
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that's how you make the money.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, you got out.
[SPEAKER_22]: So the only way to make it is when you
sell it and then it's in your in your
[SPEAKER_22]: account.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_20]: So you got out.
[SPEAKER_20]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_29]: Which is the rarity.
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's what mushrooms did.
[SPEAKER_29]: They went from fucking $850 to $250.
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm going to get a phone call.
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_20]: What, like the cost of the meme?
[SPEAKER_21]: Not so much.
Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_20]: Some people are doing OK, but right now,
if you're just doing OK, you're killing
[SPEAKER_20]: it.
[SPEAKER_20]: If you're doing OK.
[SPEAKER_21]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the reality of it right now.
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you can just get through this,
whatever this time is going to be.
[SPEAKER_21]: It's so hot up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so warm out here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you stick it in the fridge?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the freezer?
[SPEAKER_23]: I can stick it in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_23]: Leave that there.
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll put this in the fridge for a little
while.
[SPEAKER_21]: People die.
[SPEAKER_21]: They do.
[SPEAKER_21]: They do.
[SPEAKER_21]: They do every year.
[SPEAKER_21]: India goes to 50 degrees like every April
and May.
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a bunch of fires in London today.
[SPEAKER_21]: A million people just die.
[SPEAKER_21]: And they don't even, it's not even on the
news.
[SPEAKER_21]: They just don't know, right?
[SPEAKER_22]: They're sitting, they're relaxing.
[SPEAKER_22]: COVID's more real.
[SPEAKER_26]: COVID's more real than COVID.
[SPEAKER_22]: What do people do in hot temperature
countries?
[SPEAKER_20]: They don't understand what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_22]: There's shade over there.
[SPEAKER_22]: There's shade over there.
[SPEAKER_28]: You can go in the bathtub.
[SPEAKER_28]: Sit in the bathtub for 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I guarantee you'll survive.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can go sit in the bathtub.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's bizarre.
[SPEAKER_22]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_22]: I was in Thailand and India when it was 40
to 50 degrees.
[SPEAKER_29]: Wet some towels with a fan.
[SPEAKER_29]: You'll get down in your room down 10
degrees.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm telling you, just a shitty fan this
big that was like broken.
[SPEAKER_22]: It was 42 degrees in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just had it right next to my bed.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just put my head here.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it was just blowing on my,
I just needed to keep my brain.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_22]: Just your freaking brain.
[SPEAKER_21]: Your body can take unbelievable
temperature changes.
[SPEAKER_21]: But your brain is really sensitive.
[SPEAKER_21]: Too cold, you go hyperthermic.
[SPEAKER_21]: And you start like taking off all your
clothes and being like insane.
[SPEAKER_21]: And too hot is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_24]: That's Wim Hof.
[SPEAKER_24]: That's who I just said.
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_24]: Iceman.
[SPEAKER_24]: I know who it was, but I forgot his name.
[SPEAKER_22]: He just brought a kid back from losing his
eyesight with gold.
[SPEAKER_22]: Really?
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: The kid's eyesight was just going.
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'm doing a whole seminar with him.
[SPEAKER_22]: With him?
[SPEAKER_22]: Like you're paying to do a seminar with
him.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll just do it in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a whole thing getting into the
backyard.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not like just jumping in cold water.
[SPEAKER_22]: No, but he's got YouTube videos galore.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, you breathe.
[SPEAKER_22]: You can go on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_22]: You start breathing, you start meditating.
[SPEAKER_21]: He's been teaching people how to do it.
[SPEAKER_29]: He worked his way up to it.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's been sitting there for an hour.
[SPEAKER_12]: The first time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might actually, I might actually use,
no, go ahead and use that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I might, I was going to use that as
the test for the concentrate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we were going to test that too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know where the lid?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I steal something to hit?
[SPEAKER_08]: To try out?
[SPEAKER_08]: The grease monkey, the special one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where did the lid for that go bro?
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_05]: What the fuck happened to that?
[SPEAKER_21]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: It shouldn't be any further than right
here.
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, we're calling it pink.
[SPEAKER_29]: Just pink.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want any notes on it, John?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want any notes in it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything that pertains to you.
[SPEAKER_24]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_24]: 780.
[SPEAKER_06]: 780, you just want 780?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to pick your brain for a contact
for that big girl.
[SPEAKER_08]: This adds up on the side tab for the
brandy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_08]: The one in the shirt?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you and me just sit down and chat,
can you pop them up?
[SPEAKER_29]: This is Jeff Burrow.
[SPEAKER_29]: Nice guy, throws them.
[SPEAKER_29]: This was last season.
[SPEAKER_29]: Last season, we're going to air that next
episode.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got some grease monkey here.
[SPEAKER_29]: It's the next episode coming up.
[SPEAKER_29]: I'll do that way faster.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, it's always just one foot in front
of the other.
[SPEAKER_22]: It doesn't take much, I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_22]: It just started with you.
[SPEAKER_22]: You were the first one where I was like,
what the fuck is going on here?
[SPEAKER_26]: And after that, it was just like...
They're not cannabis people.
[SPEAKER_26]: Cannabis people take chances.
[SPEAKER_26]: They take some risks.
[SPEAKER_29]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ken, if you can hear me, you got to tell
London that he has to bring the volume
[SPEAKER_13]: down of the mic that's over by the orange
device and he has to bring his mic levels
[SPEAKER_13]: up because we're hearing this
conversation, not this conversation.
[SPEAKER_23]: I definitely was one of those people that
had screaming hot dabs back in the day.
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, we've all evolved from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_23]: It comes from a time on a titanium nail
where it's like, bro, it's not red
[SPEAKER_23]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's good to go now.
[SPEAKER_23]: And now we have these temperature devices
like dab right and we're hitting quarts
[SPEAKER_23]: because of quarts, you want a good green
dab.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where the lineup starts or
ends.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just having a good time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is Hippo.
[SPEAKER_12]: He grew up in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_12]: He moved to Squamish for a while and...
[SPEAKER_04]: I lost all the sound.
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll be with you in two seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be coming through nicely now.
[SPEAKER_08]: It should be better anyway.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not going to hear anything on your
end.
[SPEAKER_08]: I should be much louder now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you guys hear me a little bit better?
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I coming through a little bit clearer?
[SPEAKER_13]: Too loud.
[SPEAKER_13]: Tell them to bring the volume down a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bring the volume down.
[SPEAKER_13]: Too loud.
[SPEAKER_08]: Too loud.
[SPEAKER_11]: Tell them I can't hear anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: He can't hear you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you just tell him up or down.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can hear me, right?
[SPEAKER_13]: I just hear him on mine.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_13]: How about now?
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I coming through all right?
[SPEAKER_13]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_13]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about now, guys?
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I coming through okay?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, you're still coming through.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a nod from Peter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: How's Jeff coming through?
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably a lot better.
[SPEAKER_08]: We really wanted to give an opportunity to
get into this and try it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've got some Greasemonkey Live Resin
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Trim Tres Impressed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just absolutely gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to see if I give you a good view
of the... Just absolutely gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_08]: Crazy on the color.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel terrible holding it in the sun
right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like it's the worst thing you could
ever do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Drug abuse.
[SPEAKER_08]: Drug abuse.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love this.
[SPEAKER_08]: You position your cup to hide it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really got to have a go on this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to try this Hippo Glass.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm super pumped.
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.
[SPEAKER_23]: Go ahead and scoop your preferred size of
dab.
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm just going to heat this up again
because there's a little bit of wind.
[SPEAKER_23]: So Hippo is a really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_23]: He's got an epic long beard, too.
[SPEAKER_23]: He's one of the coolest glass blowers.
[SPEAKER_23]: He's been doing it for over 25 years now.
[SPEAKER_23]: So really high quality glass coming from
him.
[SPEAKER_23]: He uses a lot of gold and silver.
[SPEAKER_23]: So as you can see, there's quite an
interesting technique used with this
[SPEAKER_23]: piece.
[SPEAKER_23]: Maybe you can get a close up later on.
[SPEAKER_23]: But it's beautiful feathering.
[SPEAKER_23]: And it's all done with gold and silver
infused into clear glass.
[SPEAKER_23]: And then the middle part is gold and
silver over a jet black color.
[SPEAKER_23]: So you can get different color schemes out
of it.
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm just going to cap this really
quick.
[SPEAKER_23]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_23]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_23]: So he was close to Sun Peaks right now.
[SPEAKER_23]: So we actually went and visited him in
April.
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm super jealous that he lives at the
base of Sun Peaks now because a few
[SPEAKER_23]: minutes to get to the mountain and
snowboard.
[SPEAKER_23]: That's the life.
[SPEAKER_23]: But how was that dab?
[SPEAKER_11]: A little bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_23]: Full send.
[SPEAKER_23]: Full send into the stratosphere.
[SPEAKER_13]: London just got KO'd on the first dab.
[SPEAKER_23]: All right.
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I got more.
[SPEAKER_23]: Let me clean that up for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got more in me.
[SPEAKER_23]: Here, why don't you step up next to me?
[SPEAKER_23]: Here, just clear that real quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then perfect.
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll clean that up for him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you guys want to all have a seat down?
[SPEAKER_08]: Get the third mic over and you guys have
some dab.
[SPEAKER_13]: Tell London to move the camera a little
bit closer, Ken.
[SPEAKER_23]: Who's in for a dab?
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm here heating up the banger for people.
[SPEAKER_13]: As much as I have a foot fetish.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need to see their feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those are the wheezes, dude.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have our team of color commentators.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have the snack king, Chris Guerrero.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have the Perk Plus spokesperson,
Chad Westport.
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm having some technical difficulties
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Peter, the man behind the curtain,
the Wizard of Oz himself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter Longpipes.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of bare feet.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of pale Canadians.
[SPEAKER_13]: Barefoot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard you're not allowed to smoke pot if
you're not barefoot.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a hippie thing.
[SPEAKER_13]: There we go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now we can see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_13]: John's mic needs to go up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, ultimately I created the business
completely out of my own self-interest.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just kind of wanted to know about how
good my weed was that I was growing at
[SPEAKER_06]: home.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think John's mic's up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Trimming wasn't an option for me,
so I got some mechanical trimmers and
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to turn on the mic.
[SPEAKER_06]: So then I got myself a nukesmasher.
[SPEAKER_24]: The nukesmasher.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is the press over there,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm more interested in the machine
testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: The potency analyzer is amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Lightlab 3 cannabis analyzer.
[SPEAKER_24]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_24]: A little bit different from the... I had
an SRI 8106C.
[SPEAKER_24]: So that was another testing machine that
we talked about that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_24]: But I mean, this is like... Mine was
not... You needed a full guide.
[SPEAKER_24]: This thing is like a suitcase.
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why I like both of this.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a Pelican suitcase.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually used by a few of the federal
wings in the United States.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like police agencies that go to the hemp
farms to test that there's not a higher
[SPEAKER_06]: THC or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's been vetted, which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's actually... They're using it in
the government facility.
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's giving you some pretty good on
the road.
[SPEAKER_24]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they put it up against 250 brick
and mortar labs down in the States that
[SPEAKER_06]: were using $100,000 HPLC machines.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a pretty serious unit, but not that
price.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it finished in the top 25%.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it blew most of the brick and mortar
labs completely out.
[SPEAKER_24]: Discussing.
[SPEAKER_24]: He's going in for his first dab.
[SPEAKER_24]: I thought I was getting lucky here.
[SPEAKER_24]: No, he's not stealing.
[SPEAKER_24]: No thunder at all.
[SPEAKER_24]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_24]: You know what's great about this is he's
talking about the HPLC.
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's something that I worked on with
Dr. Paul Hornby.
[SPEAKER_24]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_24]: Paul was just an awesome man.
[SPEAKER_24]: He's a gentleman who gracefully passed
away.
[SPEAKER_24]: At his bedside, his wife and family were
around when he actually lost his
[SPEAKER_24]: pneumonia.
[SPEAKER_24]: Like a lot of people do when they're ages
and when they're sick.
[SPEAKER_24]: Very unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_24]: But he's got a great dab going on here.
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's nice to see where we've evolved
because we went from an HPLC, then we went
[SPEAKER_24]: to the mass spec.
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, there's a mass spec.
[SPEAKER_24]: Then I had a GC, which is gas
cartographer.
[SPEAKER_24]: And now you have this beautiful little
piece here that comes in a Pelican case
[SPEAKER_24]: that you can carry around.
[SPEAKER_24]: And instead of hauling around,
we were hauling around gases because we
[SPEAKER_24]: needed gases.
[SPEAKER_24]: I had to have the tanks.
[SPEAKER_24]: All this stuff.
[SPEAKER_24]: So it was kind of hard to actually take
testing on the road.
[SPEAKER_24]: And it was nice to see a gentleman named
Chuck came in the plane.
[SPEAKER_24]: He started driving around and he was doing
some testing back in the days.
[SPEAKER_24]: It was about 2013, 2014.
[SPEAKER_24]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just find that it's bridging the
intuition with knowledge.
[SPEAKER_24]: No, but here's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_24]: We got to keep evolving and showing and
people are able to know.
[SPEAKER_24]: They're looking for those percentages.
[SPEAKER_24]: They want to know more.
[SPEAKER_24]: But back in the days, I think we were just
a little before our time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I opened this business, it was in
January of this year, the end of January.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my primary market was supposed to be
ACNPR.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was supposed to be the smaller
client, the home grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: The home grower wants to know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's sort of why I built the
business.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then it turned out that the LPs and
the micros had a serious interest in it
[SPEAKER_06]: too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now I get to go out and I provide
business intelligence.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there was one LP that was out in the
valley there and they were running eight
[SPEAKER_06]: different new R&D strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got to go in and sort of test them
every other week and sort of give them
[SPEAKER_06]: potency tracking.
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a great way of looking at things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And stacking up against what their actual
mainstay was.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it turns out that they ended up
dropping the majority of the R&D strains
[SPEAKER_06]: because it wasn't coming close to what
their bread and butter was.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they didn't have to put in a bunch of
dollars and cents to find out that it
[SPEAKER_06]: wasn't going to pan out for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: In today's market where they're trying to
sell things for high THC, did they look
[SPEAKER_06]: great?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they smell great?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they smell awesome?
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to get into one thing here
right now.
[SPEAKER_24]: So they did not legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_24]: They legalized, they taxed THC.
[SPEAKER_24]: Because it's what we're seeing and what
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_24]: They're dumping the strains and a lot of
these lower THC strains with the
[SPEAKER_24]: turpinoids and flavonoids that we're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's always about saving the turps when
we're looking at that.
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's really, it's the education that
we've got to get back in because we know
[SPEAKER_24]: the high THC levels.
[SPEAKER_24]: You're seeing this because I saw for the
last decade working with Paul doing
[SPEAKER_24]: exactly what you're doing in a different
scale.
[SPEAKER_24]: I love what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I commend John taking it to the
LPs and doing that.
[SPEAKER_24]: Because when I was around, there was no
LPs.
[SPEAKER_24]: We were doing it.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a beautiful thing to see that we're
getting to these levels that we can do
[SPEAKER_24]: this legally.
[SPEAKER_24]: You've got a job doing this.
[SPEAKER_24]: We can legally test cannabis.
[SPEAKER_24]: You know what, can I be your helper?
[SPEAKER_24]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_24]: One of these places to see and look at
that research because we've done so much
[SPEAKER_24]: over time.
[SPEAKER_24]: And seeing what they're doing,
what they're going today and what you're
[SPEAKER_24]: able to do at home.
[SPEAKER_24]: Because this man here has the ability to
test and track things so you can see how
[SPEAKER_24]: things are developing.
[SPEAKER_24]: And we're looking at soil growth right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh man, we tested some lights the other
day.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's five micros operating on the same
plot of land.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one guy's got double ended bulbs and
another guy's running LEDs, but they have
[SPEAKER_06]: the same strain flipped on the same day
and everything.
[SPEAKER_24]: And you know the results right there now
because you don't know the LEDs are
[SPEAKER_24]: killing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get a result in 12 and a half minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get a printed COA or you get an email
to you, which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But these guys here, their difference
between percentages was 7%.
[SPEAKER_06]: The LED strain was absolutely fucking
killing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, dude, well, maybe the turps
were low.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, the turps were actually higher too.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_24]: I can tell you the difference between
wattages of LEDs and THC levels.
[SPEAKER_24]: I've really gone down the rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why you and me are going to have a
lot of fun because I can have the ability
[SPEAKER_24]: to do some information that I have in this
little brain of mine that you can now look
[SPEAKER_24]: at.
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was David Roberts that was just
speaking there, guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just let you know if you can hear my mic.
[SPEAKER_24]: You need a microphone.
[SPEAKER_24]: This is Justin.
Justin.
[SPEAKER_29]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_29]: What's up, Jeff?
[SPEAKER_29]: Great.
[SPEAKER_24]: I was hoping for a reheat.
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm on a bit of a hiatus and I know that
everybody's going to be like, oh,
no.
[SPEAKER_29]: Lame.
[SPEAKER_29]: Talking to the mic.
[SPEAKER_29]: He knows this too.
[SPEAKER_29]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_29]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_29]: So not my first.
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, that smells nice.
[SPEAKER_29]: That's really, really floral.
[SPEAKER_29]: I've got lavender.
[SPEAKER_29]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_29]: This is the grease monkey.
[SPEAKER_29]: This is really pretty fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_24]: Tasty, tasty.
[SPEAKER_29]: Very turpy.
[SPEAKER_29]: This is like a turp sauce.
[SPEAKER_24]: It is a turp sauce, so it's probably
heated, crushed, probably a low temp.
[SPEAKER_24]: Super nice.
[SPEAKER_29]: Really floral.
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.
[SPEAKER_24]: We just got, well, I did.
[SPEAKER_24]: I got high.
[SPEAKER_24]: It was kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_29]: You got high?
[SPEAKER_24]: I did.
[SPEAKER_24]: I enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, Paul, I was just sitting here.
[SPEAKER_24]: We were talking about the testing.
[SPEAKER_24]: And you work with Dr. Hornby.
[SPEAKER_24]: You were really behind it.
[SPEAKER_24]: We did a lot of stuff with Medi-1.
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, you bet.
[SPEAKER_24]: And we're looking at those terpenes that
were the organic line.
[SPEAKER_24]: We're looking at TC levels back in the
days.
[SPEAKER_24]: When we talk about testing, you've gone
through a lot of these testing to see a
[SPEAKER_24]: lot of these results.
[SPEAKER_24]: And what do you see in the industry today
when we compare it to the old HPS metal
[SPEAKER_24]: highlights going towards LEDs?
[SPEAKER_24]: Like what we were saying two years ago and
what happened in the last six months and
[SPEAKER_24]: where things are changing.
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, 10 years ago, we were testing
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_29]: And it was just this.
[SPEAKER_29]: Dude, I was testing them for you.
[SPEAKER_29]: You were banging your head against the
wall.
[SPEAKER_24]: Dude, you gave me my first Spectrum King
LED.
[SPEAKER_24]: This guy gave me a lot of the lights in
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_24]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_24]: We were looking at LEDs.
[SPEAKER_24]: I remember all the stuff that was coming
in at Green Planet, coming in at PNW,
[SPEAKER_24]: all the different lights that we've seen
over time.
[SPEAKER_24]: Like you've oxygen.
[SPEAKER_24]: The one thing I loved about being able to
be a part of the team and part of the
[SPEAKER_24]: family is being able to see every light
that comes on the market.
[SPEAKER_29]: Everybody gets to see the back of Dave's
head.
[SPEAKER_29]: Back of the head.
[SPEAKER_29]: Back of the head for Dave.
[SPEAKER_29]: Back of the head.
[SPEAKER_29]: So yeah, no, honestly, but like LED has
finally hit its stride.
[SPEAKER_29]: Finally hit it.
[SPEAKER_24]: We pitched about it.
[SPEAKER_24]: 2015, 2016.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's finally coming.
[SPEAKER_24]: Remember some of those lights?
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, can I not?
[SPEAKER_29]: Like the purples.
[SPEAKER_29]: That's what I meant.
[SPEAKER_29]: Microphone.
[SPEAKER_29]: The nonstop.
[SPEAKER_29]: I know.
[SPEAKER_29]: Just nonstop banging your head against the
wall, right?
[SPEAKER_29]: Until we knew the tech was there.
[SPEAKER_29]: We knew one day it would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_29]: And now you can't even give a CMH away or
you can't even give an HPS light away.
[SPEAKER_29]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_29]: The market has completely changed and now
it's growing under LED and learning about
[SPEAKER_29]: more dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a lot of things you need to learn
along the way.
[SPEAKER_24]: So, you know what?
[SPEAKER_24]: You got to understand your vapor pressure
deficit.
[SPEAKER_24]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's most the key thing that we never
really learned about growing with HPS
[SPEAKER_24]: mental highlights.
[SPEAKER_24]: All you old growers out there,
you're fucked.
[SPEAKER_24]: I've seen all you guys change and
everything.
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, you're awesome, Mark.
[SPEAKER_24]: Like doing the, I figured you would.
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, one thing that I really noticed
honestly is like we used to guess.
[SPEAKER_23]: Tell us, sorry to interject here,
but tell us for those that don't know,
[SPEAKER_23]: what is vapor pressure deficit in the
layman's terms?
[SPEAKER_24]: It's the amount of pressure that's put on
the leaf and the amount of pressure that's
[SPEAKER_24]: coming off the leaf that control the
amount of the planet is absorbing
[SPEAKER_24]: nutrients and everything.
[SPEAKER_24]: So there's an amount of pressure that's
hitting the leaf and there's an amount of
[SPEAKER_24]: pressure that's going off for the leaf.
[SPEAKER_24]: And you want to maintain a certain amount
of pressure, the vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's really key important when you take
a look at how much pressure is on that
[SPEAKER_24]: leaf and how it's growing.
[SPEAKER_24]: And we used to take a lot of pressure,
a lot of stress on that leaf by lowering
[SPEAKER_24]: the vapor pressure inside of the room,
by lowering its humidity.
[SPEAKER_24]: That humidity, the plant was not off
because it was starving itself.
[SPEAKER_24]: And we've seen this over time.
[SPEAKER_24]: We cause diseases.
[SPEAKER_24]: We all these problems due to not really
properly controlling the humidity inside
[SPEAKER_24]: the room.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's kind of when we look at ourselves and
everything, like we, we as humans are 75%
[SPEAKER_24]: water.
[SPEAKER_24]: The earth is 71% water.
[SPEAKER_24]: Your plants are water.
[SPEAKER_24]: Why are we trying to pull all the moisture
out of the room?
[SPEAKER_24]: They're not growing.
[SPEAKER_24]: The jungle boys key example, they started
killing it when they started doing
[SPEAKER_24]: everything with high humidity growing and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean with, within reason, within reason,
understanding vapor pressure,
[SPEAKER_29]: understanding VPD is, is, is paramount.
[SPEAKER_29]: The next part is like we never as growers,
we never measured light.
[SPEAKER_24]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_29]: Right.
[SPEAKER_29]: It wasn't until quantum sensors.
[SPEAKER_29]: We had, we had those power meters that I
was using about 2015 from down.
[SPEAKER_24]: We were looking at, I did, we gave me
those lights.
[SPEAKER_24]: I was doing that stuff.
[SPEAKER_29]: But growers for the most part don't
measure light.
[SPEAKER_29]: We never gotten to nanometers.
[SPEAKER_29]: We never got into like that.
[SPEAKER_29]: We never got into PPFD.
[SPEAKER_29]: Now with technology, like troll master,
we can actually measure light.
[SPEAKER_24]: We didn't understand DLI daily light
integrals and how much that plant was
[SPEAKER_24]: willing to take.
[SPEAKER_29]: It's no different than measuring food in
your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_29]: It's food in the air.
[SPEAKER_29]: And the fact that you can actually hone
in, um, VPD and, um, PPFD, DLI,
[SPEAKER_29]: all these things using troll master.
[SPEAKER_29]: That's really been a revolution in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_24]: It has changed it.
[SPEAKER_24]: I've actually seen quite a good thing
because the troll master actually controls
[SPEAKER_24]: your, your, well, it doesn't control your
DLI.
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know if the new light sensor
haven't used them.
[SPEAKER_24]: So let me rephrase that.
[SPEAKER_24]: So, I mean, I look at PPD levels and I'm
able to actually mimic the sunsets on
[SPEAKER_24]: rise.
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm able to mimic in the room that if I'm
actually doing like, if there's clouds
[SPEAKER_24]: like there is outside.
[SPEAKER_24]: So I take a look at where that now I'm
wanting to kind of curious right now is I
[SPEAKER_24]: know the difference between say at 10 AM
in the morning with using my spectrometer
[SPEAKER_24]: and take what it is in the summertime in
the fall.
[SPEAKER_24]: And I see higher levels.
[SPEAKER_24]: So now controlling those levels that I see
outside on the inside with the troll
[SPEAKER_24]: master is going to be my next step of
talking to you about this.
[SPEAKER_29]: We're trying to literally mimic mother
nature.
[SPEAKER_24]: Mother nature had it figured out.
[SPEAKER_24]: They've well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_24]: They've got more than figured out.
[SPEAKER_24]: They've worked on the soils and the root
balance and taking a look at, at that
[SPEAKER_24]: whole thing.
[SPEAKER_24]: What we're looking at is looking at those
organic soils and looking at the microbes
[SPEAKER_24]: and far red is huge.
[SPEAKER_24]: And right now we're actually testing some
stuff right now and be taking a look at
[SPEAKER_24]: far red past the 730.
[SPEAKER_24]: And we started pushing some stuff past 780
was the first lights that I started
[SPEAKER_24]: testing right now.
[SPEAKER_24]: Well now for last little bit.
[SPEAKER_24]: And we started, I started seeing a
difference underneath my grapes because my
[SPEAKER_24]: grapes was all red.
[SPEAKER_24]: So I started seeing the difference with
these light recipes by looking at the
[SPEAKER_24]: light that was going through the leaf and
what was growing underneath the leaf,
[SPEAKER_24]: underneath the plants outside of my yard
and other people's places.
[SPEAKER_24]: And by seeing these spectrums,
you're able to start advancing more in
[SPEAKER_24]: technology.
[SPEAKER_24]: Take a look at what we're seeing because
now we have the technology to measure
[SPEAKER_24]: light everywhere.
[SPEAKER_29]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_24]: And we never looked at it until now as in,
as in growers, as in, I don't even know
[SPEAKER_24]: any farmers that do this.
[SPEAKER_24]: Like I, I know they do in greenhouses,
but why aren't we looking at the outside
[SPEAKER_24]: and how we're able to shade these plants
and stuff like that and where they're
[SPEAKER_24]: getting their best expressions.
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean there's lots of different plants
that do different things.
[SPEAKER_29]: But cannabis, people have to understand.
[SPEAKER_29]: I keep preaching this.
[SPEAKER_29]: Cannabis is not about color or bud
structure.
[SPEAKER_29]: It all comes down to the trichome and the
effect that that has on your own
[SPEAKER_29]: condition.
[SPEAKER_29]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_29]: Specifically, that's what's going to
determine the best nugget.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got to taste good too though.
[SPEAKER_24]: See, you know what?
[SPEAKER_29]: Mark just keeps coming with new.
[SPEAKER_24]: I know why you sit down and come back here
with all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_29]: He's always got it all.
[SPEAKER_29]: One of these.
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, everybody you see running around
with everything is because of that guy.
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_24]: I carry stuff around with him on planes
and everywhere.
[SPEAKER_24]: And it was just like, he took shit
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_24]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_24]: Because we needed to dab.
[SPEAKER_24]: No matter where we were at the airport,
at the hotel.
[SPEAKER_29]: No THC sticker.
[SPEAKER_29]: That's very, for what?
[SPEAKER_24]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_29]: It's very Canadian.
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, we are on the U S channel right now,
which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_24]: You guys got to come up here and take a
look at this beautiful view.
[SPEAKER_29]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_29]: So yeah, you've got, as you got into it,
like Dr. Hornby, you know, we've lost some
[SPEAKER_29]: serious pioneers within the space.
[SPEAKER_29]: French cannoli, Jason Wilcox, Horatio
Delbert, honestly, Randy Kane.
[SPEAKER_24]: These guys are like, there's there's so
many people that have us.
[SPEAKER_24]: There's Bert and there's, yeah,
there's Tracy.
[SPEAKER_24]: There's the whole thing is, is,
is these people left something behind for
[SPEAKER_24]: us to evolve from.
[SPEAKER_24]: So they gave us the knowledge to move
forward and we take that knowledge.
[SPEAKER_24]: We keep pushing it.
[SPEAKER_24]: So we blessed with what they've done in
our lives.
[SPEAKER_24]: And we've taken that knowledge and push it
forward from people like Horatio,
[SPEAKER_24]: from people like Dr. Hornby.
[SPEAKER_29]: And you got to pay homage to all those
pioneers and they literally are pioneers
[SPEAKER_29]: in the space.
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_29]: The last growing expose that we did,
we actually dedicated to Jason Wilcox.
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_24]: I know we got one.
[SPEAKER_24]: I dedicated in my book is adult dedication
to Horatio and Jason Wilcox.
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's in the first opening pages of the
book.
[SPEAKER_24]: And I mean, Jason was a pioneer in the
industry who fought for legalization in
[SPEAKER_24]: the courts for his daughter to be able to
raise the girl his own while he's able to
[SPEAKER_24]: raise his daughter through the court
system.
[SPEAKER_24]: So a lot of people don't know.
[SPEAKER_24]: I sat years and years with Jason.
[SPEAKER_24]: He's a very good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_24]: And I was blessed with his presence and be
a part of his daughter's life and be able
[SPEAKER_24]: to see how we were able to change as a
group and as a community, really evolve
[SPEAKER_24]: and change the plant and how it's being
presented to the world because Canada
[SPEAKER_24]: really was able to change that
demographics.
[SPEAKER_24]: And now people have been looking at Canon.
[SPEAKER_24]: They say we screwed it up, but no,
we didn't.
[SPEAKER_24]: We started it.
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's legal.
[SPEAKER_29]: I think, I think, I think governments
screw it up by getting greedy and thinking
[SPEAKER_29]: there's unlimited funds in it.
[SPEAKER_24]: The whole thing is, is right now it's,
I mean, it comes down to, and I always say
[SPEAKER_24]: this and I'll keep saying until the day
is, I mean, it's around the world.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's the green way to screw on your own.
[SPEAKER_24]: If you can't grow, we can now obtain it
somewhere else, which is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_24]: That's all I fought for.
[SPEAKER_24]: All we ever said, it's what everybody was
involved.
[SPEAKER_24]: Everybody fought for the same thing.
[SPEAKER_24]: Access wasn't important.
[SPEAKER_24]: It was about access or depending on what
access that you want is where the key
[SPEAKER_29]: itself, it's the key.
[SPEAKER_24]: It gets you out of bed.
[SPEAKER_24]: It helps you grow.
[SPEAKER_29]: You see something different.
[SPEAKER_29]: Why aren't they all not growing for
plants?
[SPEAKER_24]: I give plants away like crazy.
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, this year I couldn't cause it just,
I wasn't able to do a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't understand why home growers are
not a bigger segment in the market.
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm dumbfounded.
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm dumbfounded.
[SPEAKER_08]: People are still, I live in like North
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have kind of still a hippie community
and my friends and family are interested.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're still weary.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, a lot of the people that are,
well, here's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: The buyers are ones that are walking into
your muse, that are walking into your
[SPEAKER_08]: local dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those new initial buyers are still running
through stigmatisms in their mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: And growing the plant, but once we can get
there, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: You open so many other avenues.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis is cool because it can pull
people through in that mess.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of a sudden, next thing you know,
you're growing your own food, you're
[SPEAKER_08]: growing your own crops.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is the whole thing we're
getting into.
[SPEAKER_24]: This is what we're talking about right
now.
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm using the 104 gallon bins.
[SPEAKER_24]: I was going to do the next one with
peppers and tomatoes with the organics and
[SPEAKER_29]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_29]: We just did Regina regarding the,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_24]: I probably clicked on it.
[SPEAKER_29]: He's like show called growing exposed.
[SPEAKER_29]: I know.
[SPEAKER_29]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_24]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_29]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_29]: Straight goods like full regenerative
grow.
[SPEAKER_29]: Shades?
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we're pumped.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be doing the live coverage
of the unit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, they're a little bit out in
the boon, so we won't be able to get live.
[SPEAKER_24]: You're going to Unicorn comp?
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a good chance, yes.
[SPEAKER_24]: A good chance you're taking a helicopter?
[SPEAKER_29]: This industry is soft right now,
dude.
[SPEAKER_29]: There's no helicopter money.
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_29]: I might take an RV.
[SPEAKER_24]: RV.
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know if I'm driving this one
because I don't know.
[SPEAKER_24]: I can do seven hours behind the wheel
right now, but I could do seven hours in a
[SPEAKER_24]: passenger seat and pay for gas.
[SPEAKER_24]: I could do that.
[SPEAKER_24]: I could, you know what?
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just saying, throwing out there.
[SPEAKER_24]: I got a lot of good friends here in town.
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm definitely interested in looking at
timeframes and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_24]: But I mean, yeah, it's the vehicle of this
one.
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, we highlighted that cup last year
and it was really good.
[SPEAKER_29]: Honestly, I was blown away by the nature
of Che and his desire.
[SPEAKER_08]: The warmest human being.
[SPEAKER_29]: He's such a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_29]: Like that grow.
[SPEAKER_29]: Honestly, it's going down as my favorite
episode we've done.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not like, I absolutely think it's the
best.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been a fan.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been watching it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I watched your first episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been watching it for a long,
long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I said that was me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the first episode.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that one was, I mean, there was some
great stuff in there, but that like was
[SPEAKER_08]: really something special.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: From where we evolved from showing this
gardening soul, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, and that's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every word of his being the way he
expresses it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't watch that episode.
[SPEAKER_07]: When did this go live?
[SPEAKER_29]: Honestly, I tried to see.
[SPEAKER_29]: I got some of the Sarah's Secret.
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_29]: And his live resin cart is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_29]: Where?
[SPEAKER_29]: It's not here.
[SPEAKER_29]: I was hoping he could come.
[SPEAKER_29]: You know what's nice is Justin's a really
good friend.
[SPEAKER_29]: He's like the one man farm, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So he was going to hop on the bike and
come out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually have got an episode later
tonight on the Dankower with my usual team
[SPEAKER_08]: of people.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to talk about the Unicorn
Cup and push it out there a little bit.
[SPEAKER_29]: It's such a beautiful spot.
[SPEAKER_29]: And it's right on the lake, too,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_29]: It's literally, Gardner Lake is half a
kilometer away, but the main festival is
[SPEAKER_29]: right on the lake.
[SPEAKER_29]: And I mean, the most pristine.
[SPEAKER_29]: It epitomizes the Kootenays through and
through.
[SPEAKER_29]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_24]: Josh and Kelly are just like amazing
people.
[SPEAKER_29]: Honestly, and you know, we need to be
looking at regenerative gardening as a
[SPEAKER_29]: real serious.
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, we're here talking about it.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_24]: And we're pushing it on all these channels
and everything we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_24]: But bring it into the house.
[SPEAKER_24]: You got to bring it into the house.
[SPEAKER_24]: But there's nothing new about it.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's teaching the kids.
[SPEAKER_08]: The tech is new.
[SPEAKER_08]: I grow a cover crop in three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_08]: And after you harvest your flower,
you can pick carrots out of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Three gallon pot, I'm using Green Planet
Nutrients in the process, your dual fuel
[SPEAKER_08]: line.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I use regenerative practice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been using the same cocoa for now
three and a half years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it doesn't break down.
[SPEAKER_08]: I decrease the nutrient intake that comes
into them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do, because they're just staying in
three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_29]: What PPM are you running?
[SPEAKER_29]: I love low PPM.
[SPEAKER_29]: Honestly, people that crush TDS,
in my opinion, or EC, the plant,
[SPEAKER_29]: as it dries out, the EC goes up
regardless.
[SPEAKER_29]: You're stressing the roots.
[SPEAKER_29]: You're damaging the plant potential.
[SPEAKER_08]: People go, oh, you have so much life
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you get the water in?
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like it glides.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just moves directly into the soil with
zero effort or anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: I put down some predator insects.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't sprayed anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't had to put anything down.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do a little indoor grow that's half
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just works.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like I've been able to stop.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you have to go through some pains
in the process.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have to come to an understanding
with yourself.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a lot about what you do with
growing exposed and what you do on your
own.
[SPEAKER_29]: So London, I'll ask you the question.
[SPEAKER_29]: What do we do to break the stigma?
[SPEAKER_29]: What do we do to get that grandma to be
like, I'm doing my own veggies already.
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm going to throw a couple of pot plants
in there.
[SPEAKER_29]: I want a store to buy it anyways.
[SPEAKER_08]: You get into every GardenWorks,
and you tour around the country.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you get every GardenWorks,
and you do a pairing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, their head office is done.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you go, hey, we're going to go around.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to teach people about it
and how to do it properly, and most of
[SPEAKER_08]: all, how to do it safely.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you go, hey, Canada, can I get a
purple?
[SPEAKER_29]: You're already allowed to go four plants
legally, for fuck's sake.
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, but we've got to understand.
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, the whole thing is we keep talking
about.
[SPEAKER_24]: But you can't see the reason.
[SPEAKER_24]: And everybody thinks it's a drug.
[SPEAKER_24]: So you've got to put the medical behind
it.
[SPEAKER_24]: And they're saying, well, we can't talk
about medical.
[SPEAKER_24]: And this is where the health Canada thing
comes into play.
[SPEAKER_24]: So it really is how we present this to the
people and how they need to be growing
[SPEAKER_24]: this.
[SPEAKER_24]: And I know Ken's talking about driving
across Canada, doing these little
[SPEAKER_24]: regenerative little bus tours and trying
to get people those like we did back in
[SPEAKER_24]: the days.
[SPEAKER_29]: We can talk recreational.
[SPEAKER_29]: We can talk medical.
[SPEAKER_29]: We can talk any way we want.
[SPEAKER_29]: You're legally allowed to go four plants.
[SPEAKER_29]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_29]: We can grow.
[SPEAKER_29]: We can talk all about it.
[SPEAKER_29]: Stop.
[SPEAKER_29]: There's no stigma to break.
[SPEAKER_29]: It's legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: The biggest challenge that I see in the
market right now is the lack of genetics
[SPEAKER_08]: that are actually honest.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's not a lot of seed.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's not a lot of good product coming
out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the problem is that there's a lot of
disgenuous people providing things that
[SPEAKER_08]: are bred in an indoor environment and
giving the old ladies that are going to
[SPEAKER_08]: grow outside.
[SPEAKER_08]: These things are like the first time you
ever grow and the first time you ever get
[SPEAKER_08]: that experience, even if you fail,
you get some reward out of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when you get obliterated, when things
go just horrendously bad.
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, there's auto flowers, too,
right?
[SPEAKER_29]: You can get seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's like Ron Harrington that's been
breeding in Alberta outdoor light depth.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, breeding Alberta outdoor light
depth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Difficult.
[SPEAKER_08]: The baffling is he has auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_08]: He has super autos.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're like 110, 115 days.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they're bred to be done out here and
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_08]: Take all these seeded varieties that
people are breeding indoors and then throw
[SPEAKER_08]: them into BC, Alberta, Ontario.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no way you're not going to have
success.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's where people get stopped.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think also the price of the market
is a little bit ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you look at yield per square foot,
when it comes to seed, when it comes to
[SPEAKER_08]: any sort of seed crop, cannabis is a grain
when it comes down to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you look at the volume that you
can get per plant, if you're seeding
[SPEAKER_08]: properly, there shouldn't be five,
$600 packs of seeds for 10.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I get there's these new
hotnesses.
[SPEAKER_29]: But they shouldn't be that expensive.
[SPEAKER_29]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_29]: Seeds are very inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or at least a bigger pack than 10.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give them a 25 pack at least.
[SPEAKER_29]: Listen, I'll do a plug for a friend of
mine's company, Propagation Station.
[SPEAKER_29]: They're based in Salmonarm.
[SPEAKER_29]: These guys are giving very clean genetics.
[SPEAKER_29]: If you've got an MMAR or ACNPR,
you can buy cuts through them.
[SPEAKER_29]: And Jeff's a very dear friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_29]: And access for the legal market and for
end users is quite easy.
[SPEAKER_29]: So if you've got an MMAR or ACNPR,
you can access.
[SPEAKER_29]: And then if you can't and you don't have
that, you're Joe Blow and you want to go
[SPEAKER_29]: four plants, go buy some seeds from most
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_29]: Most dispensaries have seeds.
[SPEAKER_29]: And they don't go to the one that does.
[SPEAKER_29]: And ask for them.
[SPEAKER_29]: And ask for them.
[SPEAKER_08]: And ask for other products.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we did plug Shay earlier.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we should remind people that these got
product coming on legal in OCS.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Ontario market and in BC.
[SPEAKER_29]: That Sarah's Secrets was really,
really nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's not in your dispensary,
ask for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Be there requesting it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because if you want to support
regenerative farming, you two would know
[SPEAKER_08]: better.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know anyone else doing regenerative
farming on a LP?
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, there's True Living Soil guys.
[SPEAKER_29]: And Endorse.
[SPEAKER_29]: Umbrella down.
[SPEAKER_31]: First victim of the day.
[SPEAKER_24]: No one got hurt.
[SPEAKER_24]: No one got hurt.
[SPEAKER_24]: No one got hurt.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe close the umbrella.
[SPEAKER_24]: I know there's a few of them that are
actually doing like, not regenerative,
[SPEAKER_24]: but they're doing the acroponics and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_24]: Acroponics, I mean.
[SPEAKER_24]: And we've seen that.
[SPEAKER_24]: We've seen a few things.
[SPEAKER_24]: But even there, everybody's having some
problems.
[SPEAKER_29]: It's difficult, right?
[SPEAKER_29]: It's difficult.
[SPEAKER_29]: It's even difficult.
[SPEAKER_29]: One of the discussions we had with Shay
was, you know, it's difficult to give the
[SPEAKER_29]: plant exactly what it wants in
regenerative gardening.
[SPEAKER_29]: It's difficult to change your formula.
[SPEAKER_29]: It's also difficult to flush.
[SPEAKER_29]: Like regenerative gardening is fantastic,
in my opinion, for extract.
[SPEAKER_29]: All day long, if you're harvesting
trichomes, regenerative is the only way to
[SPEAKER_29]: go.
[SPEAKER_29]: You get such great flavours.
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm about the hash, though.
[SPEAKER_29]: Honestly, you're about the hash.
[SPEAKER_29]: You're about trichomes.
[SPEAKER_29]: You're harvesting trichomes.
[SPEAKER_29]: You should be growing regeneratively.
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, that's why I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_24]: And actually, it makes it a lot easier
because that's the growing over the last
[SPEAKER_24]: few decades and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_24]: We go back into the late 80s.
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, late 90s, early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_24]: That's how we grow.
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, it's kind of like... But you're
going to diminish yield.
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I'm not concerned about the yield.
[SPEAKER_29]: You're not concerned about yield.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_29]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_29]: If you're not concerned about yield,
you're not commercial, you definitely
[SPEAKER_29]: should be growing regeneratively.
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, the whole thing is, is now we've got
to take a look at those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_29]: And more importantly, it's environmentally
friendly.
[SPEAKER_29]: Your quality is incredible.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can incorporate the practices in,
you know, using a malt, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: just stopping with the sprayings.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, who sprays pesticides these days?
[SPEAKER_29]: A lot of people.
[SPEAKER_29]: They shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_29]: And I don't own many at all, to be honest
with you.
[SPEAKER_29]: Everybody's doing biologics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my neighbor is an old school dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every year I get the smell, bottom of his
teeth.
[SPEAKER_24]: Sephora Lux, you know the product?
[SPEAKER_24]: What do you think of that product?
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't really want to give my opinion on
if I love it or not.
[SPEAKER_29]: Or if I don't love it.
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just curious because I picked it up
and I know it's a Health Canada approved
[SPEAKER_24]: product.
[SPEAKER_24]: And I know it's basically a form of aneme
oil, from what I'm understanding.
[SPEAKER_24]: So I don't have to talk about all the
things, but I mean, it's a product that...
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I give you my theory on this?
[SPEAKER_08]: Every time... Okay, there's a couple of
things.
[SPEAKER_08]: In no other crop production in the world
do we accept powdery mildew in this
[SPEAKER_08]: methodology on commercial scale,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you have powdery mildew genetics,
I mean, there's probably a shit ton of
[SPEAKER_08]: other stuff out there to find something
that doesn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a tree in my backyard right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: A maple tree?
[SPEAKER_08]: Why?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because what you're going to do,
you're going to perpetuate it into this
[SPEAKER_08]: system, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You create an expectation for these
products.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you have to grow them in these
ridiculous places.
[SPEAKER_08]: And every time you hit something... I've
seen you cut down powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you have to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every time you cut something away,
it comes back twofold.
[SPEAKER_24]: I said I cut down bugs.
[SPEAKER_24]: I went for life change.
[SPEAKER_24]: I had to go for surgery.
[SPEAKER_24]: Stuff happens.
[SPEAKER_24]: I try to grow a crop of weed.
[SPEAKER_24]: It wasn't going to happen.
[SPEAKER_24]: And I was like, okay, you know what?
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't have time to deal with this.
[SPEAKER_24]: So it was just easier to cut it down and
get it right down and get rid of it
[SPEAKER_24]: because it creates a headache.
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that video did well for you,
didn't it?
[SPEAKER_29]: It did.
[SPEAKER_24]: It was the two million mark that they took
it down.
[SPEAKER_24]: And it was even like growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_24]: That was a 5.5 million views.
[SPEAKER_24]: And the whole thing is when they're able
to get to that reach and be able to teach
[SPEAKER_24]: people that this is what you should do.
[SPEAKER_24]: They still seem to like that.
[SPEAKER_24]: But I mean, we're here discussing these
same things and what you need to do.
[SPEAKER_24]: Like you're getting these problems.
[SPEAKER_24]: You need to get rid of order.
[SPEAKER_24]: You need to find out where the problem is
coming from and how you can adapt to it
[SPEAKER_24]: and then find the pattern that's causing
it and break that pattern.
[SPEAKER_29]: And if you can find a genetic that doesn't
have the problems to begin with,
[SPEAKER_29]: you've circumvented the issue.
[SPEAKER_29]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_24]: So say you've had a genetic that's had
problems over the last 15 or 20 years.
[SPEAKER_29]: Take it back to petri culture.
[SPEAKER_24]: So you take it back to petri culture.
[SPEAKER_24]: So what I like doing is I like cutting
just going into flower a week or two into
[SPEAKER_24]: flower, taking that cutting when that
root's taking another cutting.
[SPEAKER_24]: So right away.
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'll flip this a couple of times with
the strain in order just to ensure some
[SPEAKER_24]: things.
[SPEAKER_29]: One thing I mean, people have to
understand is viruses, viruses and
[SPEAKER_29]: pathogens can't keep up with the growth of
a plant.
[SPEAKER_29]: So if you grab off the epiglomeric stem,
but if you're, I mean, honestly,
[SPEAKER_29]: that's why you should go to a cellular
level on the very, very top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_24]: And what do cells need?
[SPEAKER_29]: Pardon?
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, I'm on the cell thing.
[SPEAKER_24]: Cells need oxygen and water because
they're just going on the microbiology of
[SPEAKER_24]: the plants and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm talking about our human cells and
cells need oxygen and water to survive and
[SPEAKER_24]: get through.
[SPEAKER_24]: So we've got to serve.
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_29]: But they need more than that.
[SPEAKER_29]: They need laughter.
[SPEAKER_29]: They need humor.
[SPEAKER_29]: They need, they need good food.
[SPEAKER_29]: They need the right environment.
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, we're no different than plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_29]: If you want to thrive and you want a plant
that thrives, you got to thrive.
[SPEAKER_29]: Honestly, we go back to our original roots
of how we lived.
[SPEAKER_29]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_29]: Like we're so disconnected as a people.
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much for that because we
are as in all, as in a whole as we're all
[SPEAKER_29]: going on a different tangent.
[SPEAKER_29]: But here's a question that I have because
you're feeling my energy and we're going
[SPEAKER_24]: to get into this conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe Mark is, can I get you in on
this one too?
[SPEAKER_08]: I got, I got a good question for you guys
that I would, I would like to ask you guys
[SPEAKER_08]: as a group, if you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You kind of have to hold the microphone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here, take my mic.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, here I'll, I'll step out.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are, you guys are cooler than me
anyways.
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to shuffle away.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but any, and make sure I got a bread
thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got like this beautiful giant cinnamon
dough thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to blow your mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I got to chat with Nicole cause we're
going to have some snacks coming up here
[SPEAKER_08]: in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll take a little break and do a little
bit of a giveaway.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we'll get back to you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: But one question that I'd love to ask you
guys before we step away from this is
[SPEAKER_08]: like, how do we support the smaller market
and how do we develop the places like
[SPEAKER_08]: Rosebud Farms as a community and as,
as a way we want to see it move forward.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause that's a lot of what we're touching
on is the health of the planet.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do we do?
[SPEAKER_24]: We, we, we, you have to support these
farmers by supporting them, by getting
[SPEAKER_24]: their information out there and making
sure people know that they're around
[SPEAKER_24]: because we have to get them to the
community and people have to have access
[SPEAKER_24]: and they're not knowing that they're
around.
[SPEAKER_24]: So as in we, as a whole, like we did as
activists, we got to keep pushing these
[SPEAKER_24]: United Farmers.
[SPEAKER_24]: That's where you got to get it from.
[SPEAKER_24]: These are the companies you should be
dealing with.
[SPEAKER_24]: And the more that we do that for that
individual companies in a time.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's the nice thing about the craft
market, right?
[SPEAKER_24]: Like the craft market's got to be pushed
and we got to push these people.
[SPEAKER_24]: What craft is on the market?
[SPEAKER_24]: Where are you buying your craft?
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, this company here goes out to
whoever's doing it, whatever companies,
[SPEAKER_24]: whoever's got that craft, then we got to
push those companies.
[SPEAKER_29]: I like supporting like small boutique
vineyards.
[SPEAKER_29]: I like supporting the small guy.
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, I'd way rather have something
that's unique.
[SPEAKER_29]: It's kind of like any market.
[SPEAKER_22]: See for me, I like supporting whoever's
putting love and creating great products,
[SPEAKER_22]: whether they be big, medium or small.
[SPEAKER_22]: I support them.
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're making great product,
I support you.
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's, that's just the way it's got
to be.
[SPEAKER_22]: And you know, we've already seen the
pattern of the large companies coming in
[SPEAKER_22]: and putting a lot of kind of mediocre,
low quality flour out.
[SPEAKER_22]: And you know, that's, I mean, I noticed
today, I think it was Texo, it was Tilray
[SPEAKER_22]: and it was another big company.
[SPEAKER_22]: Weeds, whoever's the weed ticker.
[SPEAKER_22]: And they were down like 34, 14 and 23%
each of them in sales in market position.
[SPEAKER_22]: And that was noticeably from smaller craft
companies that are coming in.
[SPEAKER_22]: They're not grabbing all of that,
but they're grabbing like 2% and another
[SPEAKER_22]: one's grabbing 1.5 and another one's
grabbing four.
[SPEAKER_22]: Once you add up enough, you know,
people like, I mean, Che, Che is an
[SPEAKER_22]: awesome guy.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, he's actually a really amazing
person.
[SPEAKER_22]: So soft spoken, so honest, so in like high
integrity.
[SPEAKER_22]: He really believes what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_22]: He believes in what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_29]: And I can not to believe that when you
talk to him, when you hang out with him.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_22]: He's definitely not just, you know,
talking shit like he's you feel the
[SPEAKER_22]: authenticity when you talk to him and the
sort of passion in his voice.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's one of the reasons why I'm
excited to go to the Unicorn Cup and you
[SPEAKER_22]: know, I think he's on the right path with,
you know, yes, do, you know, he's in the
[SPEAKER_22]: legal.
[SPEAKER_22]: A lot of people who are regenerative and
in the sustainable side have really stayed
[SPEAKER_22]: in the gray market.
[SPEAKER_22]: They haven't been able to flip,
especially when if you think of Dragonfly
[SPEAKER_22]: Earth Medicine, they have this
certification that you can't even get in
[SPEAKER_22]: the LP market.
[SPEAKER_22]: So as much as you want to be regenerative,
you can only be so regenerative in the LP
[SPEAKER_22]: market.
[SPEAKER_22]: You're not allowed to have goats and cows
and chickens on your on your cannabis farm
[SPEAKER_22]: like interactive.
[SPEAKER_24]: Acting with your, of course, it's going
towards, you know, it's it's you.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's but it could be a man.
[SPEAKER_22]: So would I.
[SPEAKER_22]: And I have bought it in the past.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's it's a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_22]: At the same time, you know, I see people
doing things outside of the box.
[SPEAKER_22]: I see people I've seen people grow
exceptional flour, which makes exceptional
[SPEAKER_22]: hash in almost every way that you can grow
cannabis with salts organically,
[SPEAKER_22]: hydroponically, aquaponically in Earth.
[SPEAKER_22]: In soilless.
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I've just seen six star resin come
out of all of those things.
[SPEAKER_22]: So at that point, it becomes semantics of,
you know, what do you want to support?
[SPEAKER_22]: Which which one of those?
[SPEAKER_22]: Because they'll all produce incredible
product if you have the right people and
[SPEAKER_22]: the right genetics.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's the right people who are knowing that
right.
[SPEAKER_29]: Intention is huge.
[SPEAKER_29]: Intention.
[SPEAKER_29]: And honestly, you know, there's a lot of
guys that just walk into this that kill
[SPEAKER_29]: it.
[SPEAKER_29]: Their first, second, third crop.
[SPEAKER_29]: You normally do one.
[SPEAKER_22]: That can be huge in our industry.
[SPEAKER_29]: A whole bunch of bad information to
they've got a willingness.
[SPEAKER_29]: So I'm really, you know, I get excited to
see the next what's coming up around the
[SPEAKER_29]: corner.
[SPEAKER_29]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_29]: Don't lock yourself in.
[SPEAKER_22]: Keep it open and allow for anything to
move in and surprise you.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, and that's why when you guys are
saying, oh, I would support the little
[SPEAKER_22]: guy, it's like I'll support anyone if
they're doing everything right.
[SPEAKER_22]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, that's who deserves to be
supported.
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_22]: Like craft is amazing.
[SPEAKER_22]: But we are going to need to get to a place
where some groups of people can produce
[SPEAKER_22]: enough for the country, not for the
neighborhood, not for the, you know,
[SPEAKER_22]: the county or the village or for the for
the for the two people.
[SPEAKER_22]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's not there yet, but it's
definitely five, 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think any of us would have been
able to imagine where we are.
[SPEAKER_22]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_22]: No, not thousands of stores across.
[SPEAKER_22]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_24]: This is crazy from where we were a decade
ago to complain about.
[SPEAKER_22]: But I haven't had a gun shoved in my face
this whole time.
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_24]: There's the people are kicking and
everything.
[SPEAKER_22]: Are we even looking over our shoulders
anymore?
[SPEAKER_22]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_22]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't even feel tense when I see cops.
[SPEAKER_29]: Twenty five, twenty six years.
[SPEAKER_29]: More time looking at my rear view mirror
than my telling you.
[SPEAKER_22]: I have countless friends who have served
35, 40 years doing that.
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_24]: I thought you had more.
[SPEAKER_24]: I guess I might have this old.
[SPEAKER_29]: I was selling weed at 16.
[SPEAKER_22]: This guy's forty nine and he's been doing
it for 45 years.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no, I'm I'm I'm 50.
[SPEAKER_22]: Every year.
[SPEAKER_22]: As a 50 years old, he had the best hustle.
[SPEAKER_22]: Dude, he had the full bubble.
[SPEAKER_22]: No, no, no bubbles.
[SPEAKER_29]: So enjoy.
[SPEAKER_29]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_29]: 16 years.
[SPEAKER_29]: Crushing, crushing bubble gum and dabs at
a young age.
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, it's wonderful, man.
[SPEAKER_22]: You got the mist.
[SPEAKER_22]: Slapping us to keeping us cool and you
don't look too wet, though.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just like a mist.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_22]: It doesn't make you wet.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not too much.
[SPEAKER_29]: So one thing I like, we talked about.
[SPEAKER_29]: No, it's a nice 80s is the the way things
are evolving.
[SPEAKER_29]: And we got into it earlier.
[SPEAKER_29]: Fucking moment.
[SPEAKER_29]: Stoner.
[SPEAKER_29]: Hang on.
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, you did eat a lot of that salsa.
[SPEAKER_29]: No.
[SPEAKER_29]: You it's infused.
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why I crushed half of it.
[SPEAKER_29]: First got in.
[SPEAKER_22]: I was like, I know I'm trying to think of
that.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I was kind of talking about the how
everyone wants their hash to be like the
[SPEAKER_22]: lightest color.
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: And sort of it was kind of like this
Instagram thing of like it.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, it reminds me of Los Angeles,
where back in the 90s, you know,
[SPEAKER_22]: Los Angeles just wanted this flower that
was the equivalent of like a blonde haired
[SPEAKER_22]: blue eyed fake boobs.
[SPEAKER_29]: Hash racist, as you put it.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it's just like the color is awesome.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, there's good.
[SPEAKER_22]: There's like some of the best hash I've
ever made in my life has been in
[SPEAKER_22]: Barcelona, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_22]: These countries do not produce white hash.
[SPEAKER_22]: They produce ambers and oranges and really
beautiful colors.
[SPEAKER_29]: Moroccan hash exists because they're aging
it because they want more CBN.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, that's it.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, so I'm not I'm a fan of like
once again, I'll support hash.
[SPEAKER_22]: That is and I see people doing this for
this advantage of like, well, I'm just
[SPEAKER_22]: trying to get it sold.
[SPEAKER_22]: And if it's too dark, it won't sell.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like that's a bullshit concept.
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to how about we educate people
that the color is just showing you that
[SPEAKER_22]: this particular group of volatile organic
compounds along with these cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_22]: and the oxidization.
[SPEAKER_22]: It needs to change a little bit stronger.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, the same way on Instagram,
everything, you know, and I tell my wife
[SPEAKER_22]: this and my daughter like I saw one the
other day.
[SPEAKER_19]: It was like basically it was a woman
showing her body in a bikini and the next
[SPEAKER_19]: to it was her as well.
[SPEAKER_19]: But she was photoshopping it.
[SPEAKER_19]: She was like, this is what everything is
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_19]: And it wasn't her.
[SPEAKER_22]: Her waist was super tight and her breasts
were way bigger and her legs were all like
[SPEAKER_22]: she just did all these key things to make
it.
[SPEAKER_22]: So she was saying, don't believe anything
you see on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think the cannabis community could do
better.
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we could show the truth and show
that there's value in all of these
[SPEAKER_22]: different ages and colors and aspects of
variables of hash.
[SPEAKER_29]: Smell it.
[SPEAKER_29]: Just smell it.
[SPEAKER_29]: Like it's so floral.
[SPEAKER_22]: I need to do a dab.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_29]: Right?
[SPEAKER_22]: That is very floral.
[SPEAKER_29]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_29]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's got color.
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_29]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_29]: It's going to probably give you an effect.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yellow to orange.
[SPEAKER_29]: It's going to give you an effect.
[SPEAKER_29]: Right?
[SPEAKER_29]: And if that effect works with you in the
cannabinoid system and it really,
[SPEAKER_29]: you know, gives you that wow, that's going
to happen.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all that matters.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's this sort of FOMO mentality.
[SPEAKER_19]: Everyone wants to think they can't get
what they're seeing on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_19]: And then when they get it, it's like,
well, was it even, like I'll be honest,
[SPEAKER_19]: I've smoked a lot of Instagram hash from
famous hash makers.
[SPEAKER_27]: Some of it has blown my mind and some of
it just didn't impress me at all.
[SPEAKER_27]: It was just like, well, it was like
styrofoam or something.
[SPEAKER_27]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_27]: This was awesome.
[SPEAKER_27]: We're plastic.
[SPEAKER_27]: And as soon as we admit that we got away
from this bullshit, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_26]: I love natural.
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't want my wife to have abnormally
fake anything.
[SPEAKER_26]: Like I want her to be as natural for her
naturally.
[SPEAKER_26]: The most beautiful human I know because of
that sounds so really beautiful heart and
[SPEAKER_27]: that shines through everything.
[SPEAKER_26]: You can't fake that.
[SPEAKER_29]: You can't fake it.
[SPEAKER_29]: And honestly, she is aesthetically very
pretty and other women can be a bit like,
[SPEAKER_29]: oh, she's, no, the moment they talk to
her, they're like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_29]: She's as real as it gets.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, Breeder Steve said it best.
[SPEAKER_22]: Variety is the spice of life.
[SPEAKER_22]: And that was his company, Spice of Life
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like, let's create things that are
different.
[SPEAKER_22]: There's always going to be that popular,
like, oh, okay, we all want this extremely
[SPEAKER_22]: premature freeze dried white hash.
[SPEAKER_22]: Then there's always a real appreciation
for the actual color that's showing up.
[SPEAKER_22]: I have probably 12 or 15 different hashes
here and they all have different colors
[SPEAKER_22]: and different smells.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, different effects.
[SPEAKER_22]: I love them all, you know, for different
times.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_24]: So I could've been more sitting in my
house.
[SPEAKER_24]: There's like 15 different kinds in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_24]: That's if you get the, the flavors and the
different turpees and the different times
[SPEAKER_24]: when you need it.
[SPEAKER_24]: So each different strains, it's affecting
you in different ways.
[SPEAKER_29]: But you haven't heard one of us say,
I want a 35% THC.
[SPEAKER_24]: No, but it's not about the THC.
[SPEAKER_24]: Sometimes it is because I like a heavy
hit.
[SPEAKER_24]: I like that hot dab because I need that
effect.
[SPEAKER_24]: But it's understanding these profiles and
these strains.
[SPEAKER_29]: How all those cannabinoids work together.
[SPEAKER_22]: And we really have no understanding.
[SPEAKER_22]: We still think all the volatiles are
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, everyone's talking about
terpenes, but no one's talking about all
[SPEAKER_22]: these other organic compounds that are
also volatile that also shift the profile
[SPEAKER_22]: of flavor and taste and modulating.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_22]: And there's a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, I mean, my, my, a good friend of
mine, Nick Ziegler, who worked at Yakima
[SPEAKER_22]: chief hops for years and years developing
different hops.
[SPEAKER_22]: He found 1,440 thials in hops,
like 1,440.
[SPEAKER_22]: They think there's 180 terpenes present in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_22]: He's thinking there's probably at least a
thousand present in cannabis as well of
[SPEAKER_22]: thials.
[SPEAKER_22]: That is an enormous amount.
[SPEAKER_22]: And that, if you think of that as a little
kind of pebble that the, that the profile
[SPEAKER_22]: sits on, like an upside down pyramid,
the point of the pyramid is sitting on
[SPEAKER_22]: these very small, you know, profile of
volatile organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_22]: But depending on how that shifts,
it can shift that triangle to the left or
[SPEAKER_22]: to the right in a very profound way.
[SPEAKER_22]: And we're just, we're just literally
learning about that now.
[SPEAKER_22]: Which is why every single crop of the same
strain is different.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's why trying to create a medicine
with cannabis, that it leads actually
[SPEAKER_22]: beautifully into, you know, a lot of
people from where we come from,
[SPEAKER_22]: the sort of heady aspect of cannabis,
a lot of those people, they'll say it's
[SPEAKER_22]: all about full spectrum, not about
monomolecular isolates.
[SPEAKER_22]: But when you understand what you just said
is an, is a universal truth that you'll
[SPEAKER_22]: never get the same thing twice.
[SPEAKER_22]: Then you understand that when you find
something that works for a group of
[SPEAKER_22]: people, you need to take it apart,
figure out everything that's there,
[SPEAKER_22]: which we haven't been able to do because
we don't test for thials and thioids.
[SPEAKER_22]: But being able to get that broken down to
exactly what it is and then recreate it
[SPEAKER_22]: with monomolecular isolates would be
profound for medical patients.
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, this is what I've always said.
[SPEAKER_29]: That is the future of cannabis,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_22]: For patients, it is.
[SPEAKER_22]: It is because, you know, like how about
Haley?
[SPEAKER_22]: Haley's trying to use the Haley's Comet
and her mom's calling me all the time
[SPEAKER_22]: going, this time it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_22]: It worked last time, it doesn't work this
time.
[SPEAKER_22]: You can't have a catastrophic medically
ill child and be dealing with a medicine
[SPEAKER_22]: that just stops working.
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_22]: You have to figure out exactly what it is,
recreate it, and then have that be that
[SPEAKER_22]: thing.
[SPEAKER_29]: But it's not only the cannabinoids to be
given off in the same... It's everything
[SPEAKER_29]: that's in there.
[SPEAKER_29]: It's everything that's in there.
[SPEAKER_29]: To get all those ratios correct is going
to take... I always thought of this.
[SPEAKER_29]: Picture a box, right?
[SPEAKER_22]: Picture a big box and it's got little
vials in it and you've got all the
[SPEAKER_22]: different cannabinoids and you've got all
sorts of terpenes and thials and thyroids
[SPEAKER_22]: and imagine that they sit upside down like
the same way you could poke in with a
[SPEAKER_22]: syringe and pull out material.
[SPEAKER_22]: They sit in this box and you've got the
box and you're dialing in the profile of
[SPEAKER_22]: the herb you like the best.
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe you've got another box that tests
the herb to give you the readouts that
[SPEAKER_22]: allow you to recreate the readouts with
this box and see how close you can get
[SPEAKER_22]: your dab or your hit to directly the
medicinal components that you require.
[SPEAKER_29]: And then the next part of it is... That is
the future, by the way.
[SPEAKER_29]: The next part of it is being able to dial
in your own endocannabinoid system and
[SPEAKER_29]: say, this is you and this is exactly what
you need.
[SPEAKER_29]: And these are going to be all the triggers
that fire off all those different
[SPEAKER_29]: endocannabinoids in your head.
[SPEAKER_29]: That is the future.
[SPEAKER_29]: We're a long way off, I think.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I think so too.
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_22]: AI could occur tomorrow and if AI occurred
and we were able to ask AI how do we do
[SPEAKER_22]: this, it would be answered very quickly.
[SPEAKER_29]: There's going to come a point where AI
looks at us and goes, you're not relevant
[SPEAKER_29]: anymore, so fuck off.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's possible, but unless we're delusional
of how relevant we are, because we are
[SPEAKER_22]: unique, there's no denying it.
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like we're used to ourselves and we
look at ourselves as parasites and we make
[SPEAKER_22]: all sorts of mistakes, but there's nothing
else on this planet like us that's
[SPEAKER_22]: thinking and sentient and creating and
manufacturing and processing.
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it's so crazy that I can't imagine
AI coming up with, oh, let's just get rid
[SPEAKER_22]: of them over, wow, there's a huge value
here in the human race and this is where
[SPEAKER_22]: it lies.
[SPEAKER_29]: I had a very interesting evening once at a
owner's meeting for PNW in Whistler.
[SPEAKER_29]: Mark, you might want to hear this because
this is what I was thinking here.
[SPEAKER_29]: I ended up watching the Joe Rogan and Elon
Musk podcast and they got into AI and I
[SPEAKER_29]: was already very heightened.
[SPEAKER_29]: I was already very lifted, borderline
mangled and it was profound.
[SPEAKER_29]: It was profound to me and I was like when
a guy like Elon Musk is talking about AI
[SPEAKER_29]: and going, it's tipped, it's tipped and
it's not able to be controlled.
[SPEAKER_29]: I was just, you know, it won't be able to
be controlled.
[SPEAKER_29]: So I hope AI looks at us as relevant and
important.
[SPEAKER_22]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_22]: There's a really great book from 1988
called Engines of Creation and it's by
[SPEAKER_22]: Eric K.
[SPEAKER_22]: Drexler and he coined the term
nanotechnology and so in that book he goes
[SPEAKER_22]: through all sorts of cool concepts of
nanotechnology and he talks about how
[SPEAKER_22]: nanotechnology won't be created by humans,
but it'll be created by AI.
[SPEAKER_22]: He wrote a new book like 25 years later
called Radical Abundance and if you really
[SPEAKER_22]: want to open your mind, like check out
both of those books.
[SPEAKER_22]: Engines of Creation.
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_29]: I just want to run off and lock my gates.
[SPEAKER_29]: Is that the turptimer?
[SPEAKER_29]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, turptimer.
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_21]: Wow, that was a pretty good book.
[SPEAKER_29]: I understand the excitement and the
potential of it because it's the next
[SPEAKER_29]: evolution of humanity.
[SPEAKER_29]: I just hope that the humanity stays part
of it.
[SPEAKER_29]: You got to read The Fourth Coming.
[SPEAKER_24]: So this is The Fourth Turning,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_24]: This is The Fourth Turning.
[SPEAKER_24]: This is what we're in the middle of right
now.
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a pretty good book.
[SPEAKER_24]: This is what we're going through.
[SPEAKER_24]: This is pretty much smack right on what
we've gone through over the last little
[SPEAKER_24]: bit.
[SPEAKER_24]: So this is going to be a really
interesting book.
[SPEAKER_24]: We do a lot of reading and getting
touching bases on these stories and what's
[SPEAKER_24]: happening and how we're evolving.
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's cool.
[SPEAKER_24]: Great books.
[SPEAKER_29]: Marcus is opening the goodie bags.
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, he's bringing, oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_29]: You guys want to take a break?
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, that's a sweet looking rig.
[SPEAKER_29]: Can I do some wine?
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_24]: Mark, who makes that?
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, we'll smoke with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are stuck on camera the whole
day.
[SPEAKER_29]: What part?
[SPEAKER_29]: That little dab rig.
[SPEAKER_24]: What were you saying you were doing down?
[SPEAKER_08]: You can leave the mic there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very, very pretty.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't yell.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't yell at people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I'm going giveaways right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me a minute and I'll give you a hug.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a camera of me?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see if I can rotate this out.
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a terrible photo of me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, guys, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Chad.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Peter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Chris.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, London.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Groovy shindig you got going on,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty cool, eh?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that Ken got out here.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is epic.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been such an awesome man.
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do a couple of giveaways.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you guys think of the show so far?
[SPEAKER_04]: Good start.
Getting there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like a nice day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the mister.
[SPEAKER_04]: The mister is a quality touch.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so fucking hot over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's brutal.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's insanely hot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you can't even step on the tile with
your bare feet.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's that hot.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like so happy you guys are here.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have we have the giveaway tool if
you want to use it where we can just do a
[SPEAKER_13]: hashtag and then it just randomly draws
someone who you have to go to like save
[SPEAKER_08]: the information and addresses so I can
send them to the people to send the stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: We can work on that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think I can do that from this end.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we can note the winner.
[SPEAKER_13]: Basically, you're saying can we note the
winner and figure out how to connect with
[SPEAKER_13]: them?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, I can do it on this end,
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I took over for Ken.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think between the four of us on
this first giveaway, we can successfully
[SPEAKER_13]: connect with the winner.
[SPEAKER_13]: I have high confidence.
[SPEAKER_08]: So get ready.
[SPEAKER_13]: If we didn't have Chris here, I'd be a
little less confident.
[SPEAKER_13]: Send an email to Chris if you win.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris will be standing by.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, you can do it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's too late now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've closed it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've committed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what?
[SPEAKER_13]: So what?
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, why don't in the private chat,
why don't you put in a hashtag?
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, I will get the hashtag because I do
have them selected because I'm able to I
[SPEAKER_08]: have a brand for all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've not seen this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Magic Voodoo work yet on the stream yard.
[SPEAKER_13]: And is this the Unicorn Cup Canadian
Creta?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, that's.
[SPEAKER_13]: I had delightful day at that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, let me just see what the what the code
is for Bavita.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me a second and we'll do a giveaway
for the Bavita pack and as well as the
[SPEAKER_08]: quad pack.
[SPEAKER_13]: How about save the terms?
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that a good?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I got I've got brands done like
overlays for it to make life easy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just I didn't write down what they were.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bavita is really easy.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Bavita.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's that's going to be the symbol.
[SPEAKER_08]: Simple addition.
[SPEAKER_08]: So are you guys ready?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you guys ready?
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to open it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you doing it?
[SPEAKER_13]: Why have it queued up?
[SPEAKER_13]: So you want it?
[SPEAKER_13]: You want this is the hash.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, that was my question.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, study, share, share screen.
[SPEAKER_13]: Give it to share.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, you're ready.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm always ready.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let everybody know what the hashtag is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Show it on the screen, maybe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hashtag Bavita.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hashtag, hashtag, hashtag, hashtag.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope that's not something really rude
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this pack is pretty bad ass.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, they're giving away two sea
vaults.
[SPEAKER_08]: One is a two liter.
[SPEAKER_08]: One's a smaller one.
[SPEAKER_08]: One can hold five, five point five of an
ounce.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other one can hold point two five of a
pound.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ten pack of the size four Bavita,
four pack of the sixty seven Bavita as
[SPEAKER_08]: well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's pretty damn dope package.
[SPEAKER_08]: You see a little picture there of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get that in the chat.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, give me some more.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my drum roll.
[SPEAKER_08]: People.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hashtag Bavita.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get it in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a straight up hashtag from here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: S.P.
[SPEAKER_04]: going in.
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And are we shipping globally?
[SPEAKER_08]: North America, North America here,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm sorry if you're like.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really far, but I haven't promised
anything to be shipped outside of North
[SPEAKER_08]: America.
[SPEAKER_08]: So keep getting come on.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want some more videos in there before we
do the draw.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you snacking on, Chris?
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your snack of the day?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we get can we get a one, two,
three snack bake from Chris?
[SPEAKER_08]: What do we got going on?
[SPEAKER_08]: And don't forget to enter Bavita for the
grab back.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're having a look.
[SPEAKER_08]: That looks like one hell of a fried
chicken sandwich.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check in the box.
[SPEAKER_08]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, give me a couple more guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is a homemade chicken sandwich.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be doing giveaways over the
next hour.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, like, don't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I don't know where you're going.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to win stuff, you should be
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's like tons of stuff to give away,
too.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, we'll do 20 more seconds.
[SPEAKER_08]: 20 more seconds.
[SPEAKER_08]: Enter your number.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have such boxes.
[SPEAKER_13]: We got smaller packs.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could there could be there could be.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could be a multi level winner today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe if you try real hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like 30, 30 entries.
[SPEAKER_04]: If Jesus was here with his like 30
accounts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ask him why our numbers are below 100.
[SPEAKER_08]: No problem, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was excited to do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got a lot of fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's wings and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got some snacks.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to pull the chef over a little
bit and have a little chat with them and
[SPEAKER_08]: see what we can do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got a bunch of fun hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for anybody that's joining us late,
where are we?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we doing today?
[SPEAKER_08]: So today we're on the rooftop of Borough
and Beyond, their townhouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're doing a bunch of giveaways.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we have a lot of the Vancouver,
you know, BC Canada growers elite,
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got John Berthello, B.C.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bubbleman, Justin from Growing Exposed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard rumors of Remo.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a lot of fun happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got food.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're smashing nugs.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're testing weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's and we're smoking off of a really
nice glass, which is pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a growing beyond has Canadian
produced glass, which is pretty bad ass.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you do have some seavalls there.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, this is the two liter.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, and this one currently has some Mac
one and ice cream cake in it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you're in the chat, you should.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to have one of those people
to get in on the giveaway.
[SPEAKER_13]: And let's say 10 pack of size four,
which would be.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is the four.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's the four.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's two liter, four pack of size 67,
which would be.
[SPEAKER_13]: This one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, small seavall, too.
[SPEAKER_13]: So wait, sorry, there's there is it two
seavalls, small and a two liter.
[SPEAKER_08]: So.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, two seavalls, a small one,
two liter 110 pack size 67.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me see if I have a smaller one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one 10 pack of size four.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, man, I hope I win.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are we at?
[SPEAKER_08]: We had 34.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I think this is about time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shall we do it?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_13]: But the smaller one, I assume three point
two five is probably about half the size
[SPEAKER_13]: of that.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you get half the size of this.
[SPEAKER_13]: You get this size.
[SPEAKER_13]: You get
[SPEAKER_13]: four.
[SPEAKER_13]: You get four of these and then a whole
bunch of the like little ones that you can
[SPEAKER_13]: throw in with an eighth or a quarter that
size.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ressa, you are you are voting for.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you spell it right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you spell the right Bavita in
the hashtag.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you don't, you don't get in the draw
for a small seavall, a two liter seavall
[SPEAKER_13]: and a bunch of Bavita packs.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have a Bavita enthusiast in the
chat.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big money, big money.
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, interestingly, I have them
keeping my tobacco.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I also have the tobacco ones,
which are a higher humidity.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're keeping my tobacco at a
perfect tobacco humidity, which is like in
[SPEAKER_13]: the high 60s.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_13]: You are muted.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think he knows that.
All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do the draw.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do the dirty.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're at one hundred and two.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hashtags.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got a ton of swag we're giving away.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck, everybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hands down.
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: We really needed like a mixing board.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fun thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was so close.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's like the wheel that goes like tick,
tick, tick, tick.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then like just goes past it.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we see four one nine.
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you on Instagram or can you email us?
[SPEAKER_13]: Speak to us.
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, it is one of his many accounts.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I want to see.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want them to send an email to?
[SPEAKER_13]: Why don't you send it to Chris?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Chris is standing by.
[SPEAKER_13]: Chris is very responsive on the emails.
[SPEAKER_08]: Put your email in the in the in the chat.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, don't make him do that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But send an email to have a Peter at Daga
D.A.G.G.A.
[SPEAKER_13]: dot L.O.V.E.
[SPEAKER_13]: Peter at D.A.G.G.A.
dot L.O.V.E.
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe if someone can just write down
who the winner was.
[SPEAKER_13]: S.C.C.
[SPEAKER_13]: four one nine plus one.
[SPEAKER_31]: Is this the right email, Peter?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_13]: It's like taking an Advil.
[SPEAKER_13]: And this one he labeled is like taking a
Xanax.

[SPEAKER_13]: And then this one is like Advil and Xanax.
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is like a one to one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, CBDA THC balanced.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the Advil is THCA rich.
[SPEAKER_13]: The Xanax is an ACDC CBDA rich.

because it's like everybody there's this
[SPEAKER_13]: global pandemic and it's going to kill

hospital or something.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I was like, I'm not going.
[SPEAKER_13]: Anywhere.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I didn't know what was going on.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then my sister, who's a surgeon,
was like, I think you might have lockjaw.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I just started taking like tons of
Advil and stuff.

not putting the seat down.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, but if the seat's up,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_13]: You definitely know I lifted it to go pee.
[SPEAKER_28]: That's why.
[SPEAKER_13]: So take the win.

[SPEAKER_04]: to press it hard enough.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, we have our next spot back.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got her or him or it whatever the spot
is.
[SPEAKER_13]: Chad, we have someone who's willing to buy
that oregano from you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, I'm going to add London and make it a
group email.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, adding London to email.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is quad winner.
OK.
[SPEAKER_13]: And have you been painting happy little
trees while waiting to jump back in?
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_13]: I even queued up.
[SPEAKER_10]: We can not hear Ken.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's cool to see him in London in
the same spot, though.
[SPEAKER_13]: That was Ken while he was off camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: He sees the live painting to the music.
[SPEAKER_04]: He does a live painting behind the DJ.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the rosin of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd love you guys to have a little
whiff of it, have a sip of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me know what you think and then just
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think there's a whiff.
[SPEAKER_13]: Weren't they just talking together?
[SPEAKER_13]: This is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's have.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very, very much.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_14]: First off, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I was going to put Ken in conversation
with Ken, but then they changed the
camera.
[SPEAKER_18]: Can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_18]: Check, check, check, check, check,
check, check.
[SPEAKER_18]: Check, check, check, check.
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_18]: Check that it's on first.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's on.
[SPEAKER_18]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_18]: Check, check, check, check, check,
check.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, so Ken, talk to yourself.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_16]: You got me on a different camera.
[SPEAKER_16]: You got me on the screen instead of you
guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, wait, what?
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's very, very kind of you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Silica.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't hear Ken.
[SPEAKER_13]: What was that, Chad?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was silica.
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep it dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, keep keep your beans dry,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Use your silicas.
[SPEAKER_17]: Is this on?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I guess we'll just introduce ourselves
first so everybody knows who we are.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got this wonderful dab that I want to
start with.
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Jamie.
[SPEAKER_17]: Where do you want it?
[SPEAKER_17]: Right here?
[SPEAKER_17]: Is this good?
[SPEAKER_14]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just naturally.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I should be.
On?
[SPEAKER_17]: On.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, where is Jimmy from?
We're good.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're sharing.
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a session on top of a roof patio.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm Jamie.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's OK.
[SPEAKER_17]: We can hear him and we can hear him.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, we're good to go.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, so I'm Jamie from Sessions based in
Kelowna, and I'm super pumped to be out
[SPEAKER_17]: here with you guys.
[SPEAKER_17]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_17]: Some weed on a Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_17]: Marketing and media production.
[SPEAKER_17]: That is our main goal for work for a lot
of different cannabis companies in the
[SPEAKER_17]: legal side.
[SPEAKER_17]: I get to smoke a lot of fire weed.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's really what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_23]: Is that like creating a job so you can
just get high all the time?
[SPEAKER_23]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_17]: It almost was, dude.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've always been a partier.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've always wanted to have a good time.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what it was always about.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I love having a good time with other
people.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then this industry and this business
is kind of that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_17]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, I'm Jeff from Borough and beyond.
[SPEAKER_23]: We do concentrate accessories and Canadian
glass made by local people.
[SPEAKER_23]: We've had a shop since 2015 to 2018.
[SPEAKER_23]: Now we do it online and we do wholesale in
the legal market with cannabis retailers
[SPEAKER_23]: and kind of all the accessories go with
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_23]: So if you want to smoke dabs, we have
everything that you want to smoke them in
[SPEAKER_23]: the highest quality way possible.
[SPEAKER_23]: Kind of always researching like the apex
way to take your dab.
[SPEAKER_23]: So we kind of got the whole process down
to a science and a lot of Canadian glass
[SPEAKER_23]: been sold over the years, a lot of events
and showcases we've done.
[SPEAKER_23]: And yeah, it's been a fun ride and it's
really fun being in kind of the niche that
[SPEAKER_23]: we do as well and kind of setting
ourselves apart.
[SPEAKER_23]: And we were the first in Canada to do it
like 100% Canadian as well.
[SPEAKER_17]: So you're promoting having a good time.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right now, what is the best way to take a
dab?
[SPEAKER_23]: So we have the you get your piece with a
quartz banger on it.
[SPEAKER_23]: We've got nine different ones from True
Quartz to choose from.
[SPEAKER_23]: And basically you heat it up with a torch
and then you have a sensor like the dab
[SPEAKER_23]: right that's on the table there and it'll
be able to measure the perfect temperature
[SPEAKER_23]: for your dab.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's called the dab right because after
you use it, you'll never dab wrong again
[SPEAKER_23]: until the sensor clogs.
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_23]: But that's, but that's user maintenance.
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, you got to keep up on that.
[SPEAKER_23]: We're always learning.
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's yeah, that's the way to take a
dab.
[SPEAKER_23]: And then you cap the top on one of these
slurpers and feed your dab through the
[SPEAKER_23]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_23]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_23]: And on to the next.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm Mark.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just I've started the Vancouver
Island Home Growers Guild, which is
[SPEAKER_14]: basically just kind of celebrating small
grows and what you can do at home,
[SPEAKER_14]: whether it's a four plant grow or whether
you have an ACM PR in your home and you're
[SPEAKER_14]: but you can you're growing at home and
you're, you know, celebrating the fact
[SPEAKER_14]: that you can do that, that you don't have
to be like the state of the art facility
[SPEAKER_14]: in order to grow fireweed because fireweed
has always come from little backwoods
[SPEAKER_14]: places and from people that have,
you know, kind of paved the way of a lot
[SPEAKER_14]: of movements, like maybe even organic food
and stuff is kind of influenced by people
[SPEAKER_14]: from weeds.
[SPEAKER_14]: So to kind of embrace what the island has
always been.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's like a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_14]: People, especially in Canada, Vancouver
Island is a place that has got a growing
[SPEAKER_14]: culture.
[SPEAKER_14]: So for us to to celebrate that,
and I started with doing seed swaps
[SPEAKER_14]: because I thought, well, that's a way for
us as small growers to get to know each
[SPEAKER_14]: other and to share with, you know,
each genetics is important.
[SPEAKER_14]: And now we're moving on to doing a small
cup.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to basically the people that
got together at the swaps are looking
[SPEAKER_14]: forward to celebrating the harvest this
fall.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're going to have a few sponsors to
give us some prizes and just celebrate
[SPEAKER_14]: what the big guys do.
[SPEAKER_14]: But as the home growers to give you a
piece of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm looking forward to it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate that for sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, I'm Jonathan with Green Amber Canada.
[SPEAKER_25]: We're based out of the Okanagan in British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_25]: We've been growing pretty good weed for
the past few years.
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's the respect to British
Columbians and the hard work that they put
[SPEAKER_25]: in all the many years that they've been
growing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_25]: And I recognize that myself being part of
the part of the the industry for a very
[SPEAKER_25]: long time.
[SPEAKER_25]: So we grow good weed and we do so through
our lighting.
[SPEAKER_25]: So we build up some lighting that is
helpful for not only, you know,
[SPEAKER_25]: the home grower, but definitely the
commercial grower.
[SPEAKER_25]: You designed your own lights, right?
[SPEAKER_25]: We've designed our own lights and we
tested them out in the Okanagan for about
[SPEAKER_25]: two years in different environments.
[SPEAKER_25]: And over that time period, we saw trends
that we recognize that we now have and we
[SPEAKER_25]: use that in the algorithms in our lighting
that can help you grow.
[SPEAKER_25]: But at the same time, if you are a smaller
grower, you are more of a craft grower
[SPEAKER_25]: that really likes the art of growing
marijuana, then these lights give you
[SPEAKER_25]: those bells and mussels that help you do
that.
[SPEAKER_25]: And that's what I've been doing for the
last little while while we're building out
[SPEAKER_25]: our facility.
[SPEAKER_25]: But it does help the average grower know a
little bit of how, say, the sun travels
[SPEAKER_25]: through the sky traditionally for
cannabis.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: So what is special about your lights that
is different from others?
[SPEAKER_17]: The ability to change the spectrum,
blues and reds.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_25]: So you can get your own spectrum and you
can try and see how how intense that
[SPEAKER_25]: spectrum is, too.
[SPEAKER_25]: You can dial that in at any time given
given 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.
[SPEAKER_25]: So you can program that in up to 24 hours
in your day.
[SPEAKER_25]: And basically, you can see the spectrum
change over that time period.
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm Jonathan Fernandez.
[SPEAKER_25]: Jonathan Fernandez with Green Amber
Canada.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm Jamie Norris with Sessions.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm Jeff with Borough and Beyond.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mark with the Vancouver Island Home
Growers Guild.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mark with the Vancouver Island Home
Growers Guild.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm really looking forward to trying this
out.
[SPEAKER_14]: The other thing that we are on is
definitely marijuana connoisseurs,
[SPEAKER_14]: right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm really looking forward to this,
Dab.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a gift from Marcus to me and from
the Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_25]: So Jeff, you're going to run us through
the process?
[SPEAKER_23]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm just doing a quick clean real quick
before we do that.
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, why don't you do a clean video?
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's do this clean video here.
[SPEAKER_23]: So I need to know, too.
[SPEAKER_23]: So you get a dabber, you heat it up a
little bit, and then you have an alcohol
[SPEAKER_23]: wipe, like a swab.
[SPEAKER_23]: And so this, it's like a magnet for all
the resin.
[SPEAKER_23]: So check this out.
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm just going to put it in there with a
dabber now.
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_25]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_25]: That is very good.
[SPEAKER_25]: As you can see, it's picked up all the
leftover resin, and he's got it out.
[SPEAKER_25]: If you can get a close-up of that,
you can totally see that.
[SPEAKER_25]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_25]: Looks a little easier than a Q-tip.
[SPEAKER_13]: Four guys cleaning one dagger.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it's a commune.
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the guy on the left accidentally
turned his mic off, Ken.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ken's not really listening.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ken, I think the guy on the left turned it
up.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that mic is off right now.
Will you turn that mic back on?
[SPEAKER_23]: Generally, you want to take the residue
out of it before you take a dab,
[SPEAKER_23]: because anything that's kind of baked on
isn't really going to taste too good.
[SPEAKER_23]: Because I mean, you're torching it,
kind of burning it off.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's like a burnt dab tastes kind of.
[SPEAKER_25]: Jeff, how hot could one of those get,
those nails?
[SPEAKER_23]: So butane burns at about, I want to say,
close to 1,000 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_23]: So generally, when you take the torch off,
it's about 900 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_23]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_23]: You want to take a dab kind of closer to
under 550.
550.
[SPEAKER_23]: Why is 550 the ideal number?
[SPEAKER_23]: You get the perfect balance of vaporizing
the THC to vaporizing the terpenes without
[SPEAKER_23]: compromising the flavor.
[SPEAKER_23]: But then also you get enough that you're
actually going to get stoned rather than
[SPEAKER_23]: having to go in for a reheat.
[SPEAKER_14]: Almost as hot as your deck.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm a big fan of coal.
[SPEAKER_17]: I like taking the terps for somewhere at
450 even.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, but it's a bit heavier on your lungs
though, right?
[SPEAKER_25]: Like I find when you get those terps and
you're burning them at that rate,
[SPEAKER_25]: they kind of just hang around.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's a lower temp.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, it's a lower temp.
[SPEAKER_25]: But this is like the perfect temp where
everything vaporizes and you get the most
[SPEAKER_25]: out of everything.
[SPEAKER_25]: As good as that press was, you get the
most out of that press at 550.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's also important to note though
that different rosins, different strains,
[SPEAKER_17]: different screen sizes will make a
different consistency of rosin,
[SPEAKER_17]: which then you turn to a different
temperature to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, so this is rosin, right?
[SPEAKER_25]: This is flower rosin, but this is cured,
warm cured flower rosin.
[SPEAKER_25]: It probably clocks in at about 60 degrees.
[SPEAKER_25]: 60, 65%.
[SPEAKER_25]: And there's at least, I would say,
still about 8% or 9% terps left in this.
[SPEAKER_25]: But it leaves a lot of crap on your bang,
for example, right?
[SPEAKER_25]: Right, because it comes from flour.
[SPEAKER_25]: It comes from flour, right?
[SPEAKER_25]: So the difference in rosin is like,
look, you could put this in a cart,
[SPEAKER_25]: for example, right?
[SPEAKER_25]: Versus say, we're looking at the big bag
from Lost Boys in Victoria.
[SPEAKER_25]: And the big bag is 73 to 159 micron,
right?
[SPEAKER_25]: The big bag is 73 to 159 micron.
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's the screen level, that material
that was used to press this, right,
[SPEAKER_25]: came out of.
[SPEAKER_25]: So 73 to 159 micron, and this is what he
pulled, and this is why it smells the way
[SPEAKER_25]: it smells.
[SPEAKER_17]: And how does it smell?
[SPEAKER_17]: Extremely earthy.
[SPEAKER_17]: Big bag, number five.
[SPEAKER_25]: There's citrus.
[SPEAKER_25]: There's a little bit of pine in there.
[SPEAKER_25]: Turpeline, for sure.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, there's some pine in there.
[SPEAKER_17]: What's the effect on the big bag?
[SPEAKER_17]: How would you?
[SPEAKER_25]: It's an upper.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's definitely an upper.
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, this is an upper.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_25]: Hondo P. Jessie at Lost Boys, once again,
from Victoria.
[SPEAKER_25]: That's some good work.
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, Lost Boys rosin.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I'm looking at.
[SPEAKER_17]: These guys do great work.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's fire.
[SPEAKER_17]: And the color on here is nice,
light, green color.
[SPEAKER_25]: That wasn't even fresh.
[SPEAKER_25]: When I got it fresh, it was like,
it's been opened a few times.
[SPEAKER_17]: See, this is the type of rosin that when I
look at it, it makes my mouth water.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: Just because I know that the purity in
here, the effect that you get from this is
[SPEAKER_17]: exactly what I want.
[SPEAKER_17]: The body wants it all.
[SPEAKER_17]: Closer.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was very, very nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I can say.
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to try some of this out here.
[SPEAKER_17]: See how it tastes.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, we were talking about rosin
cartridges on the drive up here.
[SPEAKER_17]: What do you think about rosin in cart form
compared to the flavor and enjoyment that
[SPEAKER_17]: you get from Out of a Banger?
[SPEAKER_23]: Honestly, I quite like it.
[SPEAKER_23]: Depends on the cartridge, though.
[SPEAKER_23]: Some of them are really high quality.
[SPEAKER_23]: Some of them are kind of not so high
quality in the cartridge department.
[SPEAKER_23]: So the best way to represent that kind of
flavor is to have it, you know,
[SPEAKER_23]: in a high quality cartridge.
[SPEAKER_23]: Now, if you have that high quality
cartridge that's meant for the viscosity
[SPEAKER_23]: of a solventless product, then you can get
a really good result out of it.
[SPEAKER_23]: You can get a flavor that's similar to
taking a hoot off of a banger.
[SPEAKER_23]: For example, so you're right there.
[SPEAKER_25]: He's OK.
[SPEAKER_25]: He's good.
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_23]: I just wanted to make sure I don't need my
help or anything.
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm ready to help if you need it.
[SPEAKER_23]: Those slippers can be kind of tough to
clean with a Q-tip.
[SPEAKER_23]: So I definitely know it's a process.
[SPEAKER_23]: But yeah, as for rosin cartridges,
they just have to make sure that they're
[SPEAKER_23]: also separated properly.
[SPEAKER_23]: Sometimes, you know, rosin can be
extremely viscous, but if they,
[SPEAKER_23]: you know, leave like a really high terpene
profile and you crash out the crystals
[SPEAKER_23]: and, you know, make sure that it's
separated properly, then I mean,
[SPEAKER_23]: it's it's pretty easy to do.
[SPEAKER_23]: But there's some strains that just don't
they don't like warm cure the same way.
[SPEAKER_23]: No, they don't.
[SPEAKER_25]: They clearly don't.
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.
[SPEAKER_25]: So everything is different.
[SPEAKER_25]: So when you phenol hunt, for example,
right, you're looking for for aspects that
[SPEAKER_25]: you can say, hey, when I take this and I
wash it right and I wash this and this and
[SPEAKER_25]: this and this level, what is it going to
smell like?
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.
[SPEAKER_25]: What can I press it into at the end of the
day?
[SPEAKER_25]: So it doesn't just start as as a press
like pressing is an art.
[SPEAKER_25]: But you also have to then phenol hunt the
exact kind of smells and the yield,
[SPEAKER_25]: because even if you can get it to smell,
if you can't get that plant to yield.
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's it's tough.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's tough to then make a factor.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_23]: Because it's you know, they describe it to
me like, you know, you have the phenol
[SPEAKER_23]: hunting is in itself an art and then you
have, you know, making sure you're
[SPEAKER_23]: breeding for a certain a certain like
trichome type.
[SPEAKER_23]: But yeah, so it's there's so many factors
that go into it, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_23]: there's like almost like ten different
points that they have to be watching out
[SPEAKER_23]: for from, you know, making sure like the
glands aren't too greasy, you know,
[SPEAKER_23]: making sure that the glands are going to
fall off, making sure the terpium profile
[SPEAKER_23]: is proper for hash, making sure,
you know, there's so many different
[SPEAKER_23]: factors.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's it's really here.
[SPEAKER_23]: Let me help you with that.
[SPEAKER_25]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_25]: Keep hitting it.
[SPEAKER_25]: Read it inside.
[SPEAKER_25]: Read inside.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, but see, but the readers now,
it's like now we've got degraded THC and
[SPEAKER_25]: turps now.
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.
[SPEAKER_25]: So you don't even know.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, but now it's a second, a second
heat.
[SPEAKER_23]: Get it from the sidewalls.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_25]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_23]: Don't inhale while you're while you're
torching it, though.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, because you might get some of the
butane in there.
[SPEAKER_23]: I never really think too many of these
these.
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, I think I, you know, I don't know
the effects of doing flowers years,
[SPEAKER_25]: but I've done stuff like this for years.
[SPEAKER_25]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, no, like because like so I what I
wanted to get the what I wanted to get
[SPEAKER_25]: across was the fact that once you reheat
it and it's still there and it's caked on
[SPEAKER_25]: and you keep heating and you keep heating
and you keep heating and you're just
[SPEAKER_25]: taking more degraded material into your
lungs.
[SPEAKER_25]: So sometimes you like keeping it clean all
the time is probably the best way to do
[SPEAKER_25]: it.
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_25]: Right.
[SPEAKER_25]: Because like, yeah, I'm just saying what
[SPEAKER_08]: I was thinking we could do is while we
have you here and we have everybody over
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me know, Ken.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter, we're going to try and do a
giveaway from two courts and sessions
[SPEAKER_08]: while we have the guys that are up here to
do the giveaway.
[SPEAKER_08]: So see if he can get ready to do that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what have you guys been smoking on?
[SPEAKER_08]: What's been your favorite to taste so far?
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to see what I just had here.
[SPEAKER_17]: Big bag from the Lost Boys on the island.
[SPEAKER_17]: This live resin is this is exactly kind of
what I wanted for the day.
[SPEAKER_17]: A bit of an upper immediately to the dome.
[SPEAKER_17]: Feel great.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what?
[SPEAKER_08]: So you brought a swag bag of stuff to give
away and you brought you got you got the
[SPEAKER_08]: two courts has given away a banger today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've got I've got them.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to put up a hashtag.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ken's going to let me know when we're
ready to go for that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm fucking baked.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you lost Peter?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can live without Peter.
[SPEAKER_08]: We will survive.
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I ask him what brand?
[SPEAKER_08]: So you didn't want to talk about your
series that you have coming up?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to you want to let people know
about that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you guys would like to hear about
that, too, because he's got you two in
[SPEAKER_08]: front of him.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we visit a lot of different producers
and a lot of different facilities in the
[SPEAKER_17]: legal side of things.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we are coming out with the show
because we travel a lot of different
[SPEAKER_17]: places.
[SPEAKER_17]: Our show is called All Fire No Mids.
[SPEAKER_17]: We represent great cannabis, great weed
and the people that put the time and love
[SPEAKER_17]: into making great products.
[SPEAKER_25]: Where are you?
[SPEAKER_25]: What's your name again?
[SPEAKER_25]: And where are you from again?
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Jamie Norrish.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm from Kelowna.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm Jamie Norrish from Kelowna with
Sessions talking about my All Fire No Mids
[SPEAKER_17]: web series that is launching in September.
[SPEAKER_17]: And our first episode, our pilot episode
is when we I don't know if you've got the
[SPEAKER_17]: opportunity to see it.
[SPEAKER_17]: But the Pistol in Paris advertisement for
their brand.
[SPEAKER_17]: We filmed that in Abbotsford with Dylan
and we documented that.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's the pilot episode.
[SPEAKER_17]: They'll be launching in September.
[SPEAKER_17]: And you'll be able to see that on the
Sessions Instagram, Sessions YouTube.
[SPEAKER_17]: They got Pistol in Paris.
[SPEAKER_17]: Pistol in Paris.
[SPEAKER_17]: Fireweed.
[SPEAKER_17]: Fireweed.
[SPEAKER_17]: So Pistol in Paris.
[SPEAKER_17]: They are, their slogan is legacy to legal.
[SPEAKER_17]: And they buy product from micro growers
that have transferred from the legacy side
[SPEAKER_17]: into the legal side that know how to
produce great cannabis and have the
[SPEAKER_17]: reputation for producing it for years and
years.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we started working with them to
promote those people, promote that weed
[SPEAKER_17]: because it's weed that I would smoke
myself.
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah, it was a huge project.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a large project for Sessions.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a first one as a group and it went
well.
[SPEAKER_17]: It went great.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're moving on to others.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just thinking the thing that got me
ripped today is London's edible.
[SPEAKER_14]: I kicked in a little while ago on top of
these dabs and yeah, just honored to be
[SPEAKER_14]: here.
[SPEAKER_14]: I follow those.
[SPEAKER_14]: Pistol in Paris looks like they have
really good, really nice flowers from what
[SPEAKER_14]: I see in the pictures.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_17]: They have some of the top flower on the
legal market.
[SPEAKER_17]: I've never tried it.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lot of great growers.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lot of great brands out there
too.
[SPEAKER_17]: So the industry has changed quite a bit
over the last three years where we
[SPEAKER_17]: started.
[SPEAKER_17]: Can't say the same thing that I'm saying
right now, right?
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a different story.
[SPEAKER_17]: But these people are transferring into the
legal space and now producing and
[SPEAKER_17]: providing that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's a cool little story on the side for
today too.
[SPEAKER_14]: My family's been growing a cut for a long,
long time and I would track it back about
[SPEAKER_14]: 20 years from when we got it.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what it is, but I got tested
today.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's never been tested ever, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just called Vera and she's an indica
dominant kind of thing and really nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: But she came out at like what?
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the man right here that we should
introduce him.
[SPEAKER_14]: The trim and test and press because this
guy is awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Dave, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_14]: This was super cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: You should do a dab with us.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here, do a dab with us.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, come on, come on.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got Vera tested and I got Lindsay OG
tested and I did really well.
[SPEAKER_14]: Being a home grower, you wonder what you
can actually, if you can compete or
[SPEAKER_14]: whatever and I think that the home grow is
fire.
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done over like 300 flower samples by
now and I'll tell you like working with
[SPEAKER_06]: micros and LPs and home growers,
I'd say the average is like 17 and a half
[SPEAKER_06]: percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you get a home grower that's in
the 20s, it's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of people slag some LPs,
but I work for some and they're putting
[SPEAKER_06]: out 27, 32% and it's fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: So whoever said earlier, whoever puts the
love in, that's totally right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took the results back for that Van
Island one and it was 76.8%.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty fucking strong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty fucking strong, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Big up to Jesse.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, Jesse came through,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But someone was talking about Bissell and
Paris earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a grower that works for them
because as they move into the legal
[SPEAKER_06]: market, and his name is Alex and BC
Greenhouse, shout out to them,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're a store in Maple Ridge,
put me in contact with Alex and I got to
[SPEAKER_06]: test some of his DBX the other day and
that was 32.6%.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when that comes to fucking market.
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, what was the moisture content?
[SPEAKER_25]: We talked about this earlier today,
right?
[SPEAKER_25]: What's the moisture content?
[SPEAKER_25]: If you're routing him in on TV now,
we have to know the moisture content.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really fun because that guy loves
what he does and he's gotten so much
[SPEAKER_06]: better and made like minor adjustments.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's had a few tests and he's been able
to look at it and make some adjustments
[SPEAKER_06]: and now like, I don't know, out of 300
plus samples, there's maybe five or six
[SPEAKER_06]: that are 30 plus, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not very common.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's absolutely killing it,
but he's really taken the data and
[SPEAKER_06]: branding it.
[SPEAKER_25]: At 30 plus the plan is basically hung over
dripping with THC, right?
[SPEAKER_25]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's look at the moisture content once
again, before we don't have any good
[SPEAKER_25]: results here because I believe in 32%.
[SPEAKER_25]: I believe it's in BC too.
[SPEAKER_25]: So don't get me wrong, right?
[SPEAKER_25]: Like you're not going to find it in
Ontario.
[SPEAKER_25]: You might find it in Quebec, but you're
not going to find it in Ontario unless
[SPEAKER_25]: they're spraying it with a lot of spray.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's really dialing it in though.
[SPEAKER_06]: He took samples from the inside of his
room, like in the middle of his room and
[SPEAKER_06]: from the outside of his room and the
variance was huge.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like outside of the room in the perimeter
where there wasn't as much fan action and
[SPEAKER_06]: there wasn't such like great environment,
he was down to about 17 and a half percent
[SPEAKER_06]: where everything was dialed in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like he was pushing 32.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like now he knows what sample to send.
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, even like when you use our lights,
everybody that uses our lights say the
[SPEAKER_25]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_25]: So we ran through these lights for about
two years, gave them to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_25]: Let them test them out and the data we
generally get when you follow like a sun
[SPEAKER_25]: cycle, typically if you can do that with
your lighting.
[SPEAKER_25]: So when you do that, you can basically
maybe increase yield, THC yield by 2%.
[SPEAKER_25]: So if you're like 25, you can get 27
maybe, right?
[SPEAKER_25]: So if you can then control the other
factors that you grow with, right?
[SPEAKER_25]: So if you grow organically like we do,
[SPEAKER_25]: we try to manage our inputs by what we put
there and how it breaks down over a period
[SPEAKER_25]: of time, right?
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.
That's cool.
[SPEAKER_28]: That's it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was over here because someone had like,
we're doing a dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to turn it on.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that was good though.
[SPEAKER_14]: No, but I just want to give you credit for
testing.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've only ever used my electric one.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not super familiar.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey Dave, I just wanted to say thank you
and to say get on with it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I've got a four year old,
she would fire to my house if I had a
[SPEAKER_14]: fucking bullet horn.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's an amazing thing that he does with
that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like anyone that gets into that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do that session.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter's still there, yeah?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do the sessions in the
TrueCores giveaway here pretty quickly as
[SPEAKER_08]: this dab goes on.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're getting a little bit of back miss,
which is nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you already give them that?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: You don't want water in your dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: I only ever use my peak, so this is kind
of near.
[SPEAKER_25]: The cool thing about it is the regulator.
[SPEAKER_25]: I love the regulator.
[SPEAKER_25]: It's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_25]: You can hit the perfect amount of beat.
[SPEAKER_17]: What rig did you just say that you use all
the time?
[SPEAKER_17]: The peak.
[SPEAKER_06]: The peak pen as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just like the electric, or the Puffco,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Puffco.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because I just like the electric.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the ease of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really like having a blowtorch.
[SPEAKER_17]: What temp do you set it at?
[SPEAKER_06]: I start at green and then I move up to
red.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know like 180, 185 maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Celsius.
[SPEAKER_08]: So hey Jamie.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we got these guys with this stuff here.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to talk about what you're giving
away for your giveaway pack of Swag.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: A little bit while these guys hold it up
and then Dave will slowly get out of the
[SPEAKER_08]: way.
[SPEAKER_08]: And while they are talking about the Swag
that's going on there, go check out at
[SPEAKER_08]: Sessions Highlife on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Send them a like or a follow because they
are producing this content over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why I'm stepping so close.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they have some shirts, some T's,
some awesome stuff.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's four sides.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep, that one.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_13]: So hashtag Sessions.
[SPEAKER_08]: So at Sessions is the code there for them
to do the draw.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are they ready for that?
[SPEAKER_08]: The turp train.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ken, does it look ready?
[SPEAKER_08]: So the camera.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, we're ready.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sessions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Enter it into the past.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me about what you got.
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.
[SPEAKER_17]: So here what Jonathan's holding up is a
photo that we took in our studio of some
[SPEAKER_17]: fire.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's Rosin Diamonds.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we have All Fire No Mid's shirt
and sticker pack.
[SPEAKER_17]: Then we have a Highlife.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is our other brand too.
[SPEAKER_17]: Highlife shirt and tank.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then there's two hats here.
[SPEAKER_17]: Our new logo and our OG logo, which is my
favorite logo.
[SPEAKER_17]: And then if you're a winner in Canada,
there will be another little extra thing
[SPEAKER_17]: in there that I'm just not going to put
details into.
[SPEAKER_17]: But you know what it is.
[SPEAKER_17]: Wink.
[SPEAKER_17]: Wink.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nugs Canadians get in the draw.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hashtag Sessions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get that entered in.
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you have to give away Jonathan?
[SPEAKER_13]: Just hashtag Sessions.
[SPEAKER_13]: Whoops.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got a thing from Jeff coming up next.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're just doing this one.
[SPEAKER_08]: So tell a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me a little bit more about what
you've been working on last year.
[SPEAKER_17]: So Sessions, the company is based in
Kelowna.
[SPEAKER_17]: But we are moving the entire studio and
office to the island.
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's what's happening in the next few
months.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're looking for a space for a new
studio, but also event space too.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd love to have a cannabis lounge.
[SPEAKER_17]: Right now legislation is being written for
BC to start incorporating cannabis lounges
[SPEAKER_17]: into the framework.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I want to have one.
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll have it connected to the studio.
[SPEAKER_17]: And once that's going, I mean,
I hope to see a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I hope to have multiple across Canada
as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds epic.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait for there to be a lot more
indoor consumption.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we could go to a shop and do this
instead.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then get really comfortable.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are we doing on the drawing?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to get pulling?
[SPEAKER_08]: 30 entries.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give me a couple more in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then let me know how people can
support your community.
[SPEAKER_17]: So you can follow us on Instagram at
Sessions Highlife.
[SPEAKER_17]: We also have a YouTube channel,
Sessions Highlife.
[SPEAKER_17]: And follow us on there.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're posting videos all the time.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're out in the industry every day.
[SPEAKER_17]: New facilities, new people to work with,
new brands to talk about.
[SPEAKER_17]: We follow the fire too.
[SPEAKER_17]: So the premium cannabis is what we chase.
[SPEAKER_23]: You guys are just powerhouses,
aren't you?
[SPEAKER_17]: Our team is growing, yeah.
[SPEAKER_17]: A year and a half ago, it started with
four people.
[SPEAKER_17]: Now we have over 12 employees.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're able to do a lot now.
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're feeling pretty good about where
we're at.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we love who we work with.
[SPEAKER_23]: Killing it.
[SPEAKER_23]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shall we get the draw rolling?
[SPEAKER_08]: Go for it, Peter.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're pulling a draw on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the question?
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, never mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are drawing right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have a winner?
[SPEAKER_04]: Drum roll, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody in check.
[SPEAKER_04]: Drum roll,
[SPEAKER_08]: please.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_08]: Congratulations, Glissaholic.
[SPEAKER_08]: You let me know when we're ready to move
on to the next draw, okay?
[SPEAKER_08]: When they find out what the winner is.
[SPEAKER_13]: So Glissaholic, send an email there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter, once you got their information,
let us know and we will go on the next
[SPEAKER_08]: draw with True Quartz.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet, so who won?
[SPEAKER_17]: Glissaholic.
[SPEAKER_17]: Glissaholic.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, congratulations to Glissaholic for
winning the pack.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you're Canadian, we'll put a little
extra stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you're not, I'm super happy that
you're representing our stuff wherever you
[SPEAKER_17]: live.
[SPEAKER_17]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome, really cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we're going to do is draw next on
the True Quartz banner.
[SPEAKER_08]: How am I right now?
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we're going to do next is draw for
the True Quartz banner.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to tell me what the draw is.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a serious discussion the other day.
[SPEAKER_25]: This is happening right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sign on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can enter right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey Peter, make sure Jonathan doesn't win.
[SPEAKER_08]: It won't be rigged again.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we have our studio guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're entering too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody can enter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jonathan, you can get one on your way out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, you can get one on your way out,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you tell me what makes them so special
and why you guys are who you are?
[SPEAKER_23]: So basically, there are a lot of different
grades of Quartz out there and us being
[SPEAKER_23]: connoisseur, hash smokers ourselves and
using these.
[SPEAKER_23]: We didn't want to spend a few hundred
dollars on an American made or Canadian
[SPEAKER_23]: made banger because it gets really pricey.
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm sure there's people out here watching
this that know that bangers can go over
[SPEAKER_23]: 500 US dollars each.
[SPEAKER_23]: And not a lot of people want to spend that
much on a Quartz banger.
[SPEAKER_23]: Does it actually make a dab better?
[SPEAKER_23]: So I mean, I love that one.
[SPEAKER_23]: There's nine different designs.
[SPEAKER_23]: So the main thing being with that one is
it has a very big, thick bottom.
[SPEAKER_23]: Everyone likes a big, thick bottom.
[SPEAKER_23]: Anyways, it retains heat, especially on a
Quartz banger.
[SPEAKER_23]: So it retains heat really nicely.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just more mass to hold on to the heat
that you torch it with.
[SPEAKER_23]: There's slits at the bottom of the little
small tube on the slurper.
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a smaller tube and then the larger
dish on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_23]: There's slits right here.
[SPEAKER_23]: And then when you plug the top,
the oil gets sucked into those slits and
[SPEAKER_23]: it creates like a vortex force as well.
[SPEAKER_23]: And it really like vaporizes it and
creates a lot of good surface.
[SPEAKER_23]: This area for you to completely vaporize
your dab at a lower temperature.
[SPEAKER_23]: And it just works really nicely.
[SPEAKER_23]: So the main thing about these bangers is
that they use equivalent material that
[SPEAKER_23]: those North American bangers use.
[SPEAKER_23]: But because there's so many different
grades that different manufacturers are
[SPEAKER_23]: using out there, that it creates something
that you don't want to guess about what
[SPEAKER_23]: you're dabbing off of.
[SPEAKER_23]: And nobody wants impurities.
[SPEAKER_23]: And things that they're smoking off of,
especially the surface.
[SPEAKER_23]: So it's just kind of guaranteeing that
these are made with the highest quality
[SPEAKER_23]: material that's available to the
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_23]: They're a little bit more expensive than
your $40 no-name banger.
[SPEAKER_23]: But they come with rubies.
[SPEAKER_23]: They hold heat better.
[SPEAKER_23]: They're a lot more pure.
[SPEAKER_23]: This is the one we're giving away here.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a regular style.
[SPEAKER_23]: They last longer than glass.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hold on, everyone.
[SPEAKER_14]: I messed up on the... It's not T-R-U-E.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me start over.
[SPEAKER_14]: Skinny and this one's sort of fat.
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you like better?
[SPEAKER_23]: Honestly, there's nine different designs.
[SPEAKER_23]: And they're all kind of like my children.
[SPEAKER_23]: I like them all equally.
[SPEAKER_23]: There's got to be one that sits in the
back.
[SPEAKER_23]: Honestly, I love the autospinner because
it's... So it's like this bucket here,
[SPEAKER_23]: except it has two angular holes.
[SPEAKER_23]: Drilled through it.
[SPEAKER_23]: So when you plug the top, like you do with
the slurper, the little rubies that come
[SPEAKER_23]: with it will spin like crazy.
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_23]: This is the regular one that we're giving
away.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's the tried and true.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's the most common design that everybody
tends to use as well.
[SPEAKER_23]: Just plop a bubble cap on top of that and
you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_23]: But that's the vast majority of people
like this style the most.
[SPEAKER_23]: Just because it's... So again,
hashtag True Quartz.
[SPEAKER_08]: Enter in now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to see a few people go on to...
What do you want, Burrow or True Quartz?
[SPEAKER_08]: Instagram, are you building?
[SPEAKER_08]: Both.
[SPEAKER_23]: So at Burrow and beyond.
[SPEAKER_23]: You get one right now.
[SPEAKER_23]: Which one do you want?
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's do at True Quartz because that's
what this is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go at True Quartz from the at in the
thing, hop in and Instagram and try and
[SPEAKER_08]: give them a like.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I see a few follows and likes in
the Instagram thing, I will finish the
[SPEAKER_08]: draw.
[SPEAKER_08]: So not only will you speed up the draw,
increasing your chances to win by
[SPEAKER_08]: following them, but on top of that,
you will get more chances of winning.
[SPEAKER_08]: So draw, help out the community.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a $300 banger, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not actually.
[SPEAKER_23]: This is the equivalent... Mr. T,
put a hashtag in front of that.
[SPEAKER_23]: $300 banger, but for $70.
[SPEAKER_23]: $70 banger.
[SPEAKER_23]: John, lose the E.
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a really, really... That is correct.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is not correct.
[SPEAKER_17]: Got the red pen out right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: Red pen, correct.
[SPEAKER_30]: The premium... Editing, Peter's editing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Rosins and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_17]: You do want a banger that doesn't have
impurities in it that would ruin what
[SPEAKER_17]: you're putting in your... You don't want
to disrespect that hash.
[SPEAKER_17]: If you don't care, then you don't care,
but people that do, it's important to have
[SPEAKER_17]: a...
[SPEAKER_17]: What are some of the impurities that you
would find in glass?
[SPEAKER_17]: I've heard of this, but I actually don't
know what it is.
[SPEAKER_23]: It could be trace metals and minerals.
[SPEAKER_23]: Also, there's like...
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that's like a peroxide radical or
something.
[SPEAKER_23]: It just ends up degrading a little bit
quicker when it's exposed to heat.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just kind of in the crystal matrix as
well.
[SPEAKER_23]: Those impurities, some of them are a
little bit more benign than others.
[SPEAKER_23]: It might degrade a little bit quicker for
the peroxide type of thing, but when it
[SPEAKER_23]: comes to trace metals, you definitely
don't want that in your quartz.
[SPEAKER_23]: That's something that's really important,
is making sure it's super pure.
[SPEAKER_23]: You've got to respect those turps.
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a good surface to vaporize off of.
[SPEAKER_23]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_23]: Does anybody else have anything to add
while we're waiting for this draw?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, but shall we do the draw?
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, Peter.

day Because it's fucking hot out and and
[SPEAKER_08]: and I'm getting tired and we have more
shows So we need to hurry but regardless
[SPEAKER_08]: we have had this immaculate day now I
think was very very very important for me
[SPEAKER_08]: to sit down with these wonderful people
and really chat about and touch on a
[SPEAKER_08]: Couple of the key points them my butt
doing that It's sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, probably It's very I thought it'd be
very important For us to sit down and like
[SPEAKER_08]: chat with you guys as we've kind of been
the the workers of the event And and kind
[SPEAKER_08]: of the people that kind of making the
action happen and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_08]: too It's a really take some time So if you
could give me another proper introduction
[SPEAKER_08]: there chef Nicole tell me a little bit
about your background You've been on the
[SPEAKER_08]: show before and around before so I'd
really like to get in there and tell us a
[SPEAKER_08]: little bit about what you prepare for us
because the food was fucking banging I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: really excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Nicole Hines with faded living.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a cannabis chef.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I made some honey jerk wings on
the barbecue with a mango salsa that was
[SPEAKER_00]: infused Just keep it simple guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love to barbecue So I was in my
absolute domain even in the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also do infused dinner parties I come
into people's homes and you know Create a
[SPEAKER_00]: new amazing meal Sometimes I even host my
own dinners Absolutely 110% I've done it
[SPEAKER_00]: many times over Yeah, absolutely and I
come in I do the thing Hey, I literally
[SPEAKER_00]: can that's an upsell you that's an upsell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do I really really do This was what I
wanted because you know the other day I
[SPEAKER_08]: had you come over and we press some we
press some rosin and we Tested some stuff
[SPEAKER_08]: and we we tried this amazing flower and we
got to really try a different experience
[SPEAKER_08]: What I would call a Tupperware party for
stoners, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that's essentially what we've had I
mean we've had some of the coolest people
[SPEAKER_08]: there are in the industry at this table
today and sit down to chat and be Able to
[SPEAKER_08]: be part of that conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's pretty important.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to have make sure your
microphones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the fair.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah So we've had it so like I was saying
Tupperware party for for for stoners and
[SPEAKER_08]: and stuff like that So, can you tell me
again because you were muted?
[SPEAKER_08]: What you do what you got into it like,
you know, we talked to you we talked to
[SPEAKER_00]: you Dabs Dabs But yeah, I cook with
cannabis I teach people even how to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: I can even come into your home and do that
And I'm writing a cookbook, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out It'll come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm aligning it with an article that I'll
be in February March of 2023 I'm thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's gonna be faded eats is Is kind
of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to get into the Canada
tourism space I want to get a bowler
[SPEAKER_00]: trailer and turn it into a cannabis Airbnb
and call it the faded camper And so there
[SPEAKER_00]: also be a cookbook with the camper as well
So, you know big tings coming my way So we
[SPEAKER_08]: get a good we get killer food and infused
and then we get a bunch of weeds And then
[SPEAKER_08]: we get we get Tupperware parties for
stoners So David, can you introduce
[SPEAKER_08]: yourself now and tell me a little bit
about what what you what we were doing
[SPEAKER_08]: today?
[SPEAKER_08]: Why you believe in your choice of
equipment that you use?
[SPEAKER_08]: And kind of like what what exactly is trim
test impressing can like any any dude just
[SPEAKER_06]: get this another house So I service the
entire legal market whether it's the ACM
[SPEAKER_06]: PR home grower micros or even the LPs And
I provide either mobile dry trimming
[SPEAKER_06]: mobile wet trimming I've got a couple of
different machines one for each and then
[SPEAKER_06]: also my light lab 3 cannabis analyzer from
orange photonics so I do potency tracking
[SPEAKER_06]: so I can come to your facility and
Literally take buds off of your plant and
[SPEAKER_06]: help you identify Where it is and what
week and so on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_06]: Which can actually be incredibly helpful,
especially if you've never grown that
[SPEAKER_06]: strain before you can start to identify
When the harvest days are or even start
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding depending on what cannabinoid you
want to sell and so on and so forth So
[SPEAKER_06]: what started?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is like I'm a home grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have two dislocated wrists.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't trim so I'm like, I'll buy the
machine So I got the machines and I was
[SPEAKER_06]: like, I wonder how good my weed is So then
I looked up a whole bunch of potency
[SPEAKER_06]: machines and I didn't find anything that
was sort of In the genre that I was
[SPEAKER_06]: looking for until I came across that unit
which is a serious piece of business and
[SPEAKER_06]: then I thought okay if I can turn this
into a business It has to be quantifiable
[SPEAKER_06]: data and people are gonna rely on it and
they're gonna make business decisions on
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got The best one that I think and
it's portable which is really the crux of
[SPEAKER_08]: the best portable unit and we were we were
talking about These units last week on the
[SPEAKER_08]: dank hour with Kyle Boyer on testing
because we really dug into that subject
[SPEAKER_08]: deep So I would encourage everybody to go
in and check that episode because there
[SPEAKER_08]: are a lot of interesting Aspects when it
comes to tools that for testing and
[SPEAKER_08]: there's a lot of like there's a lot of
different methodologies and we kind of get
[SPEAKER_08]: get to break into that and we really talk
about how this variability this method is
[SPEAKER_08]: probably the most ideal and accurate and
Consistent when it comes to what you're
[SPEAKER_08]: what you're looking for to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is well essentially that's how you can
like Build the gap between your intuition
[SPEAKER_06]: and the data is if you know what it is
that you're doing and I'm able to provide
[SPEAKER_06]: you that data You're able to use that and
move forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the results for your flower
actually it just beeps So it just came up
[SPEAKER_06]: so each test takes 12 and a half minutes
from start to finish But I include the
[SPEAKER_06]: moisture balancing so that it adds a few
more minutes, but it's important because
[SPEAKER_06]: you want to know what the weight exactly
so because
[SPEAKER_06]: I Love concentrates, but to be completely
honest with you like the glass scares the
[SPEAKER_06]: shit out of me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm really into like this is my rig
here It's an electric one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's super fucking easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is my it is like my hourly driver
[SPEAKER_06]: There's four different test settings and I
usually like to start it off on green and
[SPEAKER_06]: then move up to red but That really is how
I enjoy my concentrates.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I've got the NugSmasher Pro Touch
set up to NugSmasher I'm very very
[SPEAKER_06]: grateful.
[SPEAKER_06]: They put a computer on their on their
rosin press It makes it really easy for
[SPEAKER_06]: dummies like me that don't do math to get
really So thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what did I do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah trim test and press it says it in the
name I am mobile.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll come to you I go anywhere from
Princeton to hope and my slogan is taking
[SPEAKER_06]: your grow from good to great because it's
not about me it's about you and let's just
[SPEAKER_06]: see what we can do about like What where
do you want to go?
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to go better on CBD?
[SPEAKER_06]: Better on THC.
[SPEAKER_25]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them do have it we'll talk about
franchising later Jonathan Jonathan will
[SPEAKER_06]: talk about franchising later Okay,
actually, you know in all honesty there's
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a wonderful human being out in the
world and her name is Jill Carrero and
[SPEAKER_06]: she's an incredibly hard-working mom and
she represents orange photonics And she is
[SPEAKER_06]: like an absolute fucking genius and
whenever you need anything she answers
[SPEAKER_06]: like despite the time difference So huge
shout out to Jill Carrero if anyone's
[SPEAKER_06]: looking for the orange photonics,
you've got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to talk to her And yeah,
she's just an absolute like stud.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's awesome So well like I really you
know first you want it you want to give me
[SPEAKER_08]: a quick hello there Leah and say because
you provided some of the giveaway product
[SPEAKER_08]: today from quad so you want to say a
little hi and and People can support you
[SPEAKER_08]: and then we're gonna talk about how people
can support you and we're gonna talk about
[SPEAKER_08]: how people can support you and then after
that we're gonna let everybody know about
[SPEAKER_08]: the show later today and then we're gonna
pack up and run like the Dickens because I
[SPEAKER_08]: have to get all the way into Vancouver
North Vancouver to run a show at 5 p.m.
[SPEAKER_08]: So We don't need to rush through this part
either But can you tell me so quad you
[SPEAKER_08]: guys provide an awesome set of products?
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me a little bit about them and then a
little bit about what you do and how we
[SPEAKER_01]: can support you My name is Leah and I'm
the president of quad egg so We provide
[SPEAKER_01]: humates for plants animals and humans
predominantly in our agricultural space we
[SPEAKER_01]: focus on the biostimulants of humic and
fulvic acid as a Adjunct to any nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: program and we fit into any grow system So
if you are growing in living soil beds
[SPEAKER_01]: either as a home grower or commercially
all the way through to aeroponics You can
[SPEAKER_01]: safely fog our products and we focus on a
root zone development and nutritional
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake through plant tissues, so we're
super Adaptive and help basically your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants create better roots better shoots
and better fruits So, how do people
[SPEAKER_01]: support us well we we love Well,
we just basically help everybody in their
[SPEAKER_01]: grow whether you're growing cannabis or
vegetables in your garden We we look to
[SPEAKER_01]: improve the soil and improve the
ecosystems and so we're seeing that a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more conversation around regenerative
practices and regenerative knowledge base
[SPEAKER_01]: and soil ecology and bringing that
knowledge into commercial systems,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that Those lessons learned also help
home growers that are looking to do
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhat hydroponic or hybrid hydroponic
systems at home as well So we are very
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge-based very consultative based We
sell a product but we really believe in
[SPEAKER_01]: supporting the communities that we service
so a way to support us is You know ask
[SPEAKER_01]: your local hydroponics store if they carry
quad and if they do not Encourage them to
[SPEAKER_01]: so that we can support more people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big thing for us And then how
people support you
[SPEAKER_08]: Invite this guy over and you will be so
ripped Some pretty cool testing as well
[SPEAKER_01]: for like hot slayton And roll into what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, we need to talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually have a lot of people that are
I've heard that a lot today We need to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk That's the beauty about these kind of
events is you have opportunities to find
[SPEAKER_06]: those collaborative opportunities That's
what it's all built out of it's just sort
[SPEAKER_06]: of like grassroots community and then if
it grows from there it grows from there
[SPEAKER_06]: but I think that's the best way to sort of
like grow as well and it's a new industry
[SPEAKER_06]: and I May have been a daily consumer for
30 years, but it's new to all of us in the
[SPEAKER_06]: legal front And so it's nice to like make
legal mistakes I do work with a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: hydroponic stores and
[SPEAKER_06]: They all have my flyers and everything
like that and if I do a three test minimum
[SPEAKER_06]: So if clients don't have three tests,
they can just drop it at a drop box there
[SPEAKER_06]: And when they accumulate like five tests,
they give me a call and I just run to
[SPEAKER_06]: their store and I test all the tests
That's if you want to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the BC Greenhouse does it there
all the time
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome and don't forget to also
check out trim test impress and follow
[SPEAKER_08]: their instagrams and stuff if you're not
local check out the business and Support
[SPEAKER_01]: them digitally My name is Leah and I'm
