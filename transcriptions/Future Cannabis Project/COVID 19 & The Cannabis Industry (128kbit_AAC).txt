[SPEAKER_01]: Good afternoon or evening depending on
where you may be We are here today I want
[SPEAKER_01]: to thank everybody first of all for
joining us on relatively short notice all
[SPEAKER_01]: of our attendees and of course all of our
wonderful food centers as well We are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this because we have heard a lot of
consternation within the association
[SPEAKER_01]: around some of these issues Certainly the
nature of essential businesses what that
[SPEAKER_01]: means for our clients What it means for
whether they should or have to stay open
[SPEAKER_01]: What it means for their liabilities and
then also what it means for their bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: line We've also heard a lot of sort of
issues around, you know Especially from
[SPEAKER_01]: our perspective as people that that host
in-person educational events a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: issues around force majeure clauses How
those affect our business how those affect
[SPEAKER_01]: the sort of larger conference businesses
within Cannabis, but also how those all
[SPEAKER_01]: affect supply chain costs Contracts as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to start with a just a brief
disclaimer We did put this this sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation together very last minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is not legal advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Five attorneys that are online
talking about issues that we're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: From my perspective that I'm seeing among
the membership and from the other four
[SPEAKER_01]: attorneys perspective They're seeing with
their businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not legal advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have questions About what the
attorneys here are saying, please reach
[SPEAKER_01]: out to us You may have to engage us to
actually get that legal advice so You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, please don't take this totally at
face value But this is sort of what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing going on in the industry in terms
of a general overview One of the major
[SPEAKER_01]: issues that we've seen pop up especially
over the last week or so is the nature of
[SPEAKER_01]: essential businesses and what that means
for retail consumer facing businesses as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as those businesses that are further
back on the supply chain so farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: distributors other critical aspects of
that infrastructure and We have a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: people here that that have been sort of
directly engaged in a couple of those
[SPEAKER_01]: frontline fights Before we get into that
discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to quickly introduce everybody
We have four wonderful attorneys as I
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned here with us today We have Laura
de Caro who is of course one of our
[SPEAKER_01]: founding members.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was one of our three founders she's a
lawyer in San Francisco with LPS law and
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons that she's here today
is she represents the Berkeley patients
[SPEAKER_01]: group that was involved with a minor tip
with the city of Berkeley over what an
[SPEAKER_01]: essential business means and really
whether or not that would allow for The
[SPEAKER_01]: full spectrum of their services or whether
they would need to be curtailed in in
[SPEAKER_01]: response to the COVID crisis We have
Elizabeth Elizabeth is a new attorney with
[SPEAKER_01]: Clark Howell She is down in their LA area
with Ariel Clark And so we're super happy
[SPEAKER_01]: to have her here for the first time Lauren
Ruddick is our treasurer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's over in New York with Hiller PC
Again, just a wonderful contributor to all
[SPEAKER_01]: of our educational content last and
certainly not least.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Lauren Mendelson Lauren is with
the law offices of Omar Figueroa up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern California and of course works
Very very closely with a lot of the legacy
[SPEAKER_01]: operators up there And has just a great
set of knowledge around the industry and
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of what the immediate effects of
what's going on with this crisis have So I
[SPEAKER_01]: think the place that I wanted to Start
with was just sort of a general a general
[SPEAKER_01]: discussion about what COVID means for
businesses normally Whether or not
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses are sort of facing any
potential liability coming out of COVID
[SPEAKER_01]: for you know, putting potentially
employees at risk that are consumer facing
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know that my impression of
this is that there is some liability for
[SPEAKER_01]: employers that choose to remain open for
instance the California order has given
[SPEAKER_01]: essential businesses the Option but not
the mandate to stay open And so of course
[SPEAKER_01]: this has left some room for businesses to
close if they feel that that is
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriate for them It's also left some
businesses for some room for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses to stay open and so generally
under OSHA liability is There is some
[SPEAKER_01]: liability for employers if you put your
employees in a position that puts them in
[SPEAKER_01]: an increased level of harm over what's
reasonable and so I think that in this
[SPEAKER_01]: case given the larger Pandemic there is
some liability associated with potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: leaving your business open And then I
think that that's maybe lessened a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit with respect to the idea that these
are essential businesses so as long as
[SPEAKER_01]: those businesses are hearing to Guidelines
set forth by the CDC by other government
[SPEAKER_01]: entities that there is some measure of
reasonable Expectation that they won't be
[SPEAKER_01]: held liable as long as they're not
negligent Do you guys have anything sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of to add to that or is anyone seeing any?
[SPEAKER_01]: specific issues over businesses being
concerned about Remaining open or how that
[SPEAKER_01]: might sort of affect them down down the
road Laura.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have anything to say about that
one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, me yeah sure I mean, yeah,
this is a whole I mean like any other
[SPEAKER_04]: business that remains open I think that
everybody has a lot of concern if people
[SPEAKER_04]: are bending over backwards trying to
experiment with and reach out to other
[SPEAKER_04]: people about what they're doing to try to
protect not only their customers,
[SPEAKER_04]: but their employees and their vendors That
come on site to deliver We're getting
[SPEAKER_04]: updated information by the minute on how
long people believe that this really
[SPEAKER_04]: remain on a surface and so different
protocols are shifting Continuously,
[SPEAKER_04]: but yeah, I think with regard to any kind
of existing long-term liability It's
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely in the forefront of all of
these employers minds and particularly in
[SPEAKER_04]: a time when we're trying to make sure that
we're one maintaining access to something
[SPEAKER_04]: that a lot of us perceive to be extremely
vital particularly now and you know and
[SPEAKER_04]: keep people fed and housed and make sure
that we don't increase the burden on the
[SPEAKER_04]: housing insecurity that we have
particularly in the Bay Area and then you
[SPEAKER_04]: know, just trying to balance all of that
with Your insurance company and the
[SPEAKER_04]: federal government aid and everything else
that's coming at you Yeah, I would say
[SPEAKER_04]: that there's a lot of a lot of concern for
potential liability down the road We
[SPEAKER_04]: started talking about workman's comp
claims besides And I think that you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have been giving advice With respect to
SOPs and updating SOPs not only to follow
[SPEAKER_03]: the state laws, but also local orders and
in different safety And sanitation
[SPEAKER_03]: measures that might be particular to that
local jurisdiction We've also been
[SPEAKER_03]: encouraging our clients to collaborate
with specialists including legal
[SPEAKER_03]: specialists and employment law when they
are drafting these SOPs because there are
[SPEAKER_03]: you know many legal issues Triggered by
this and you know, there was a federal law
[SPEAKER_03]: extending You know paid family leave
passed in the last few weeks and there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of intricacies to untangle so I think
that you know, not only is Revising those
[SPEAKER_03]: SOPs with an eye toward, you know your
operations and safety but also making sure
[SPEAKER_03]: that there's you know an underlying legal
strategy there just to make sure that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're protected your employees are
protected and you're taking a holistic
[SPEAKER_03]: view of Your response to COVID-19 Yeah,
a lot of businesses, especially in the
[SPEAKER_05]: more competitive medical marijuana states
definitely should have contemplated some
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of safety plan in connection with
their application So we do see people sort
[SPEAKER_05]: of referring to their internal policies
making sure that they follow the policy
[SPEAKER_05]: because sometimes It doesn't matter what
your policy is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It only matters if you don't follow your
own policy So it's super important to
[SPEAKER_05]: check your existing policies and make sure
that you're following that because then
[SPEAKER_05]: not only could you space could you face
exposure under OSHA, but you also could
[SPEAKER_05]: have you know, sort of an internal
employment issue on your hands As an
[SPEAKER_00]: industry as a whole it would just reflect
poorly if we would be responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: getting folks sick, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: and so it is important that we protect
your employees and the and the customers
[SPEAKER_00]: that you see and proper PPE proper
sanitization procedures keeping distance
[SPEAKER_00]: within you know, if you are having
employees go into a particular space like
[SPEAKER_00]: a manufacturing facility or something like
that It's just super important that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about the larger picture here and
that that's more important right now than
[SPEAKER_00]: your bottom line It has to be we're in a
global pandemic and you have to adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: your procedures accordingly and go into
your emergency mode I think that that's
[SPEAKER_05]: been the biggest struggle that balance,
you know between being a small business
[SPEAKER_05]: owner and wanting to protect your
employees and knowing that the economics
[SPEAKER_05]: are going to impact them and have
far-ranging decisions beyond just
[SPEAKER_05]: COVID-19, you know Maybe their access to
health care depends on them having a job
[SPEAKER_05]: and if there is no job then they can't
have health care in the future You know,
[SPEAKER_05]: so this balance I think has definitely
been the hardest part for all of my
[SPEAKER_03]: clients anyway And underscoring what
Lauren said, you know, we've been trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to emphasize that you know, it's Quite
remarkable that cannabis has gone from an
[SPEAKER_03]: illegal market to part of the essential
health care supply chain And so,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we have been encouraging our
clients don't only you know, do right by
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves and their employees but to be
like the model Supply chain operators,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like make sure they're going
above and beyond make sure they're
[SPEAKER_03]: established A dialogue between you know,
their leadership and local jurisdiction
[SPEAKER_03]: just to make sure they are able to speak
to any safety concerns You know to I guess
[SPEAKER_03]: have a say in any, you know, surprise
orders that may be more, you know more
[SPEAKER_03]: restrictive because local jurisdictions
are doing that all the time and You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we in the last few weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen an influx of Articles from
opposition groups, you know implying that
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis should not be a part of the
Essential health care supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, just really important to
remember that we're all in this together
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a community.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really big moment for Cannabis in
general.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, and in that connection states,
you know, we represent for example a
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensary in North Carolina You know It's
sometimes incumbent upon the business
[SPEAKER_05]: owners to reach out to those
representatives and make sure that
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis is held as essential and you know
that mitigation efforts are taken to stop
[SPEAKER_05]: the spread of disease and What's been very
helpful for us are the guidelines that
[SPEAKER_05]: were published by American For safe
access, you know, they did send a very
[SPEAKER_05]: compelling letter to the various
jurisdictions in the medical and adult use
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis states Encouraging them to keep
these businesses open so for anyone
[SPEAKER_05]: looking for language to incorporate into
some sort of policy document or effort to
[SPEAKER_05]: Convince somebody that these businesses
are essential then look to the ASA
[SPEAKER_04]: guidance for that I mean to that end I
mean Elizabeth was saying this is kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: a pivotal moment for us But you know,
we're really relying on the arguments that
[SPEAKER_04]: we made in order to get here in the first
place and this is Really underscoring,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know are the necessity that we
maintain medicinal, you know as a as a an
[SPEAKER_04]: active part of our community and not
disregard the benefits that it brings to
[SPEAKER_04]: our community and we're really seeing you
know how the potential for a lack of
[SPEAKER_04]: access Really galvanized a whole team of
people who grew up through this industry
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think we're In large part
responsible for turning around some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: more conservative policies that tried to
deem cannabis a non-essential product
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it is essential for a lot of
people that we work with And like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: two things in there that I want to discuss
and one is like about the Designation of
[SPEAKER_00]: it being medical cannabis right versus
adult use cannabis and you see different
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdictions allowing it only for a
medical operators can keep operating some
[SPEAKER_00]: don't specify and I think that you know
People I am I'm of the view as many people
[SPEAKER_00]: are that all use this medical use in a
way, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're smoking joint because it helps
you calm down someone else might take an
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-anxiety medication for that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are getting a medical benefit from
that there's over-the-counter Medicines
[SPEAKER_00]: think of this as an over-the-counter
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need a prescription for that And
so I think what we want to avoid is
[SPEAKER_00]: getting ourselves trapped into a situation
where only folks who go have an official,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know car or have a doctor's
recommendation only they can get this
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine because there's many reasons why
someone might be a legitimate patient or
[SPEAKER_00]: have a legitimate medical needs and not
have gone through that expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: time-consuming difficult process of
getting a doctor's recommendation or a
[SPEAKER_00]: card and so in California, for example
certain counties have specified in cities
[SPEAKER_00]: that it can only be medical retailers can
keep operating, you know be a delivery or
[SPEAKER_00]: curbside pickup and that's been
interpreted Different ways and in
[SPEAKER_00]: different places and a lot of folks who
are freaking out against Sonoma County,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example Where I live we our county
issued a stay-at-home order before the
[SPEAKER_00]: statewide one did a few days earlier and
we had actually been in communication with
[SPEAKER_00]: the county to urge that they consider
cannabis to be essential for all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons and so when they publish their
order they listen to us but they added in
[SPEAKER_00]: that medical only restriction and we're
like we'll shoot we are talking about in
[SPEAKER_00]: our argument how it's so important
medically but now have we unwittingly put
[SPEAKER_00]: this restriction in there that they're
going to be you know policing who's going
[SPEAKER_00]: and buying this product so a long story
short I've had conversations with the
[SPEAKER_00]: health officer and that was the intent was
not to shut down any existing businesses
[SPEAKER_00]: or put people out of business or police
who's buying these products really that
[SPEAKER_00]: the point is social distancing and you
know preventing the spread of the virus
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know their view it and this is
that one county's view Is that essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: what I said earlier is that all uses
medical use all of these products could
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretically be medical cannabis products
Anyone could theoretically have a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: use that's one county's view other
counties might have a very different view
[SPEAKER_00]: the state didn't specify the state left in
vague which was really great and myself
[SPEAKER_00]: and a bunch of other people had been
writing to To Gavin Newsom's office ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: of time to request that he specify what
cannabis business is that they be defined
[SPEAKER_00]: as essential so that's just kind of to go
show how you can be involved at the local
[SPEAKER_00]: and state levels to make sure that we do
have it in writing so it's just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more clear and have some clarity about how
our businesses can move forward and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's so amazing how far the industry
has come from being criminalized to being
[SPEAKER_00]: essential in just a few short years it's
quite remarkable and the ability to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: these businesses open keep people working
keep the just it's that's very important
[SPEAKER_00]: too so that's kind of just what I wanted
to say there I was gonna say the sequence
[SPEAKER_04]: of events right what happened would play
down in the Bay Area anyway in the state
[SPEAKER_04]: of California right we had this order come
down on the 16th which was really kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: scary for a lot of people but we all
started looking up code sections that we
[SPEAKER_04]: were unfamiliar with immediately right and
everybody's looking for you know their
[SPEAKER_04]: industry segment is essential and you know
we felt like we had identified in
[SPEAKER_04]: healthcare and retails of the areas that
were essential and then in San Francisco
[SPEAKER_04]: our Department of Public Health decided we
were not and it took us a good 24 hours of
[SPEAKER_04]: some seriously solid social pressure on
the Department of Public Health to
[SPEAKER_04]: completely pivot on that point two days
later I think it was on the 20th Gavin
[SPEAKER_04]: Newsom actually did publish some
additional guidance on what was going on
[SPEAKER_04]: and cannabis is listed specifically in two
different places on the first page to the
[SPEAKER_04]: fourth page and I have that document if
anybody's interested in seeing it but it's
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially you know the the cannabis
workers are deemed essential workforce and
[SPEAKER_04]: the supply chain are deemed essential so
we have it pretty clear I would think in
[SPEAKER_04]: the state of California and the problem
then gets into local control which has
[SPEAKER_04]: always been as those of us on this call
probably can attest to kind of a point of
[SPEAKER_04]: contention in California and it's one
thing that you know maybe other states
[SPEAKER_04]: don't experience and maybe you can avoid
creating a problem with but I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_04]: in this instance you'd be able to avoid it
and the locals are coming up with more
[SPEAKER_04]: stringent or like just different
interpretations sure just one one word
[SPEAKER_01]: about sort of the difference between adult
youth and medical use my understanding is
[SPEAKER_01]: I was lucky enough to talk to a few
regulators this morning from from a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: different jurisdictions for instance in
Massachusetts Lauren exactly what you said
[SPEAKER_01]: was you know that that people in certain
jurisdictions where both medical and adult
[SPEAKER_01]: use is legal people have foregone their
medical cards because they have access
[SPEAKER_01]: through the adult youth programs and so in
a lot of jurisdictions you don't have you
[SPEAKER_01]: have individuals that would have had a
medical card in the past I fall into this
[SPEAKER_01]: category I used to have a medical card in
California and I simply don't need it to
[SPEAKER_01]: go to an adult use dispensary and so I
haven't bothered to renew it and if it was
[SPEAKER_01]: deemed only a medical necessity for
medical supplies versus adult use supplies
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be ineligible for that even though
at one point I did have that medical card
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've just chosen not to renew it and
so certain states seem to have explicitly
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of acknowledged that and opened it up
and other places like Michigan they've
[SPEAKER_01]: explicitly made a delineation there where
they've said that the medical the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries are essential businesses and
the adult use dispensaries are not in
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan one of the differences there is
that it's a very nascent adult use market
[SPEAKER_01]: and so not many people have sort of
switched out of that medical market into
[SPEAKER_01]: the adult use market and of course we
don't like to think of those two markets
[SPEAKER_01]: as fungible but consumer behavior may sort
of evidence of different a different
[SPEAKER_01]: course of action in terms of that conflict
sorry Lauren did you want to get something
[SPEAKER_05]: you know if we continue to you know stress
that divide also then we're perpetuating a
[SPEAKER_05]: stigma where we're boxing ourselves in
between medical and adult use and then
[SPEAKER_05]: we're forgetting how this plant ever
became you know classified as a schedule
[SPEAKER_05]: one substance in the first instance and
it's really you know perfectly safe and
[SPEAKER_05]: you know should be treated just like other
you know safe substances liquor is an
[SPEAKER_05]: essential business here in New York I know
that much but you know it's unfortunate
[SPEAKER_05]: that the the reverb the you know the
effect of this is that it's you know
[SPEAKER_05]: causing us to make distinctions where I
was hoping some of those distinctions were
[SPEAKER_04]: blurred well we created a system in
California where we had combined this
[SPEAKER_04]: combined it all and so we obviated the
need for the recommendation and so we
[SPEAKER_04]: created this system whereby and we as a
you know as a retailer you can't
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily ask someone what their
condition is you're not going to ask for
[SPEAKER_04]: their medical information so there was a
moment there was a hot minute in there
[SPEAKER_04]: where we thought whoa we need to make sure
everybody gets a recommendation just to
[SPEAKER_04]: cover themselves and to cover us for this
transaction thankfully that's not the
[SPEAKER_04]: current you know game plan or current
thinking but it could shift that way and
[SPEAKER_04]: we need to be able to you know educate our
clients about the need for public outreach
[SPEAKER_04]: the need for maintaining contact with your
local representatives I mean that's one of
[SPEAKER_04]: the key plays that we've been working for
years and years but really reaching out to
[SPEAKER_04]: people with resources so if they really
need to get a recommendation they can get
[SPEAKER_04]: one quickly because those are in most
jurisdictions it seems to be relatively
[SPEAKER_03]: accessible normal has been part of the
fight within each local jurisdiction
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout the state and I believe that
they have some great data on you know how
[SPEAKER_03]: many medical cards like have been retired
in recent months you know if anybody needs
[SPEAKER_03]: any help making that argument or
substantiating that I know that they would
[SPEAKER_03]: be happy to help and they also have
resources to connect people with doctors
[SPEAKER_03]: online so if you do if you are stuck in a
jurisdiction that ends up policing your
[SPEAKER_03]: use and requiring some kind of ID card
there are resources through normal to
[SPEAKER_03]: connect people you know who needed to get
that resource so we we one of the themes
[SPEAKER_01]: that keeps coming up is sort of liaisoning
with your local jurisdiction and making
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that you have an open line of
communication there obviously we ran into
[SPEAKER_01]: something in Berkeley last week Laura
could you tell us a little bit about what
[SPEAKER_01]: was going on in Berkeley sort of maybe how
that departed from the guidance from the
[SPEAKER_01]: state and sort of what what your course of
action might have been if any of that's
[SPEAKER_04]: true well I mean like we touched on
earlier you know there's this element of
[SPEAKER_04]: local control and we have to understand
that the locals have a great deal of power
[SPEAKER_04]: when it comes to their you know the health
and safety of their citizens and so you
[SPEAKER_04]: know I we did have an instance where in
the city of Berkeley they essentially they
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't try to close everybody down like
they did in San Francisco so San Francisco
[SPEAKER_04]: sent us an email like six o'clock at night
and said you need to close period there
[SPEAKER_04]: was no delivery there was no curbside
there was there was no option Berkeley
[SPEAKER_04]: pivoted a little bit and said well you
know we don't really like the idea of all
[SPEAKER_04]: these people congregating in these small
retail facilities that are you know I
[SPEAKER_04]: think in a lot of regulators minds
notoriously grungy and so they said well
[SPEAKER_04]: we had to pivot to delivery only which
effectively at that time would have
[SPEAKER_04]: shuttered all but one of the organizations
that was operating in the city of Berkeley
[SPEAKER_04]: another one was poised to commence
delivery within the next couple of days
[SPEAKER_04]: with the idea that this was probably
coming down the pipe but you know and so
[SPEAKER_04]: it really would have had a significant
impact on access to Berkeley residents and
[SPEAKER_04]: an impact on the Berkeley employees and
the businesses located there so we put a
[SPEAKER_04]: group of you know retailers together I
think Sabrina Fendrick was super super
[SPEAKER_04]: fundamental in making this group happen
she's just an amazing woman with so much
[SPEAKER_04]: energy and so much passion about this
access issue she's got him in my idol
[SPEAKER_04]: Sabrina's awesome yeah right and so she
put together a group of retailers we all
[SPEAKER_04]: collaborated everybody got on calls daily
talked about what we could do what we
[SPEAKER_04]: should do how to unite stand together
there's a really kind of inspiring
[SPEAKER_04]: movement everybody mobilized their
individual resources their lobbyists you
[SPEAKER_04]: know their personal connections and kind
of put the pressure back on the powers
[SPEAKER_04]: that be to make the determination that
came down a couple of days later which was
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially okay no in store but will
permit the curbside and if you're in
[SPEAKER_04]: California you probably know by now that
the bureau has been very rapidly turning
[SPEAKER_04]: around permission for curbside delivery
pursuant to the emergency orders so it was
[SPEAKER_04]: a it was a huge step because it really
made the difference between laying off 50
[SPEAKER_04]: people and keeping everybody employed for
us yeah that's a that's a huge issue and
[SPEAKER_01]: we've seen other places too that have
relaxed some of the licensing guidelines
[SPEAKER_01]: around delivery in order to provide that
it doesn't of course make providing
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery that's compliant with the state
required regulations of your GPS it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't it doesn't make that any cheaper
for a business and so it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily make it more available
especially in a time of existing financial
[SPEAKER_01]: duress so it's still not could maybe not
solve the problem but certainly could try
[SPEAKER_01]: to alleviate it and so are we seeing now
in Berkeley it's it's curbside pickup and
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery only right and the dispensary
doors remain closed and so in an effort to
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of cut down on human-to-human contact
we're not seeing dispensary doors open
[SPEAKER_04]: they're supposed to be you know there were
a couple of retailers that decided they
[SPEAKER_04]: were going to stay open you know they
really took a stand for access and hats
[SPEAKER_04]: off to them you know certain other
retailers decided that was too much of a
[SPEAKER_04]: risk to take for their patients permanent
access and the existence of their permits
[SPEAKER_04]: you know so everybody it was able to make
their own decisions on that one but yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: as far as we know I haven't driven by many
of the retailers in the last couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: days but they're supposed to have doors
closed yeah it was very expensive I mean
[SPEAKER_04]: you think about purchasing a couple of
vehicles to perform this delivery and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're talking about $20,000 investment
easy per vehicle retraining drivers
[SPEAKER_04]: creating new SOPs you know the lucky thing
is in Berkeley as in California delivery
[SPEAKER_04]: is actually as of right essentially with
your license if you have a retail facility
[SPEAKER_04]: so we lucked out that way I think you know
getting those kind of mechanisms built
[SPEAKER_04]: into the ordinances that we seek to pass
in additional jurisdictions is key right
[SPEAKER_04]: the ability to pivot and to say people can
do these things as of right I think will
[SPEAKER_04]: prove very important as we shift as an
economy the way that we do business and is
[SPEAKER_01]: that mostly what the other three on this
call so Liz Lauren and Lauren is that
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly what you're seeing as well in terms
of retail facilities have been allowed to
[SPEAKER_01]: do curbside and delivery but maybe not so
much in-person business yeah there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: few places that I'm aware of still do
allow the stores to stay open but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much they're all changing and
tightening the orders to have it just be
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery or pickup so and I think you know
I think that probably makes sense from
[SPEAKER_00]: just the perspective of limiting human to
human contact and not just human human
[SPEAKER_00]: contact but like human to surface where
another human entered into contact with
[SPEAKER_00]: contact so I think that it just makes
sense from that perspective although you
[SPEAKER_00]: do want to make sure if you're doing a lot
of deliveries your delivery drivers better
[SPEAKER_00]: be not sick and better be wearing masks
and gloves and that delivery vehicle
[SPEAKER_00]: better be super clean because that they're
going to be in that vehicle with with
[SPEAKER_03]: those products for an extended period of
time we saw the city of San Diego they
[SPEAKER_03]: issued a clarifying order that curbside
was okay and they issued very strong
[SPEAKER_03]: recommendations they were they were
suggesting anything from you know that all
[SPEAKER_03]: transactions be made on camera and that
there be like special timing mechanisms
[SPEAKER_03]: like only a certain number of people could
actually leave their cars at one time to
[SPEAKER_03]: pick up the delivery and they said in the
order like we will be inspecting each
[SPEAKER_03]: business like essentially like expect like
further scrutiny from us so that was a
[SPEAKER_03]: surprise because San Diego you know had
kind of held out for a long time and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know they're quite conservative so we were
glad but you know it was also something of
[SPEAKER_03]: a call to action like okay you know they
are going to be watching they are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be checking like we need to take this very
seriously but also not give them any
[SPEAKER_03]: reason to think that you know our clients
are anything but in strict compliance with
[SPEAKER_01]: these recommendations and rules and and in
terms of that guidance from San Diego did
[SPEAKER_01]: that a lot of what we're seeing is that
for instance Laura and I were talking
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier a lot of those restrictions come
down from the Department of Health was
[SPEAKER_01]: that coming from the Department of Health
or was that coming from sort of a Bureau
[SPEAKER_01]: of Cannabis Control and were those
requirements things were placed on other
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of similarly situated businesses or
were cannabis businesses sort of being
[SPEAKER_01]: singled out for additional scrutiny under
some of these policies so for the curbside
[SPEAKER_03]: rules I just mentioned it was cannabis
specific so I don't remember who exactly
[SPEAKER_03]: issued it I think it was San Diego's like
cannabis specific authority I do know that
[SPEAKER_01]: you know this was for dispensaries
definitely and Lauren you had mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: some some of the some of the practices
that people can take for instance in
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery you know wearing gloves and masks
and making sure that you're not sick you
[SPEAKER_01]: know we've also seen this critical this
essential business designation be placed
[SPEAKER_01]: on supply chains I know that you do a lot
of work with farmers up in Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: California sort of are you seeing anything
that we should take away from that sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: specialized supply chain issues or are
there best practices that you're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: you know obviously if you're cultivating
you can't do that remotely so which are
[SPEAKER_01]: you seeing any sort of specialized issues
up there right so yeah I work with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of cultivators manufacturers distributors
the whole bit and basically the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chain has been deemed essential by
the state of California at this point
[SPEAKER_00]: which is great and certain counties have
even called out cannabis farming like
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino County calls it out in their
agriculture section of the central
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses and you know so there's no I
don't think there's any question at this
[SPEAKER_00]: point in California whether or not the you
know just retail is essential or the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chain is it's understood it's it's
the whole supply chain otherwise there
[SPEAKER_00]: will be no essential product at the end
but there are still obviously if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: a worker anywhere in the supply chain that
is continuing to go to work they do have
[SPEAKER_00]: to follow there's CDC guidance there's
OSHA guidance CDPH has put out some
[SPEAKER_00]: guidance for you know basically if you're
in a manufacturing facility just follow
[SPEAKER_00]: good manufacturing practices in addition
to everything that the CDC and OSHA are
[SPEAKER_00]: telling you to do such as wearing masks
proper sanitization proper hygiene if
[SPEAKER_00]: staying home if you're sick a lot of this
is just basic stuff that honestly
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses should be doing anyway with
maybe the exception of you know
[SPEAKER_00]: unnecessary layers of PPE but in certain
types of facilities like a manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: facility your employees should really
always be having gloves and proper PPE of
[SPEAKER_00]: all sorts on just to prevent contamination
of any sort and you know just to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're sick with something else so I
do think that a lot of businesses are you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it impacts the whole supply chain
basically and not just cannabis I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: every type of business no matter where you
are now needs to really take a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: your day-to-day practices and make sure
that you're following OSHA guidance
[SPEAKER_00]: following the CDC guidance and keeping
yourself and your employees and your
[SPEAKER_00]: community safe keeping people apart if you
need to have people in the same room
[SPEAKER_00]: having them be far apart there's you know
just ways that you can keep people more
[SPEAKER_00]: distance encouraging working remotely for
a lot of these businesses a lot of their
[SPEAKER_00]: staff can be working remotely so if that's
possible then have them do it if they
[SPEAKER_00]: can't like they're on the farm or in the
production facility then just you know you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to take those other measures into
account but there is a lot of guidance
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been put out there by state
governments federal governments about how
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses of this sort should continue to
operate in a safe manner if they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do so so you know I we can maybe send
some of those links out to folks
[SPEAKER_00]: afterwards but I just encourage everyone
to take a look at those and and really
[SPEAKER_00]: take that into account if you're going to
be operating so sure yeah did let people
[SPEAKER_04]: back in I mean the stores doors are open
in the city and county of San Francisco
[SPEAKER_04]: right now I mean essentially the rule is
if you have two point of sales systems you
[SPEAKER_04]: can have two people in your shop at that
time if you have five POS systems you can
[SPEAKER_04]: have five people in your shop everybody
else needs to be queued up outside
[SPEAKER_04]: standing on a piece of tape six feet apart
you know it's pretty explicit they're
[SPEAKER_04]: they're pretty clear what they want from
you but there there are person-to-person
[SPEAKER_04]: patient consults continuing to happen and
there's a lot of really interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: tech-based patient-to-patient stuff that's
being talked about behind the scenes in a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of places so I think we're gonna see
hopefully a little bit of growth in those
[SPEAKER_01]: areas as well I was gonna say that was one
of the interesting things that we saw in
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan I believe it was in Michigan that
they fast-tracked tele appointments for
[SPEAKER_01]: doctors in order to be able to get those
medical recommendations because they did
[SPEAKER_01]: restrict access to medical only and so
they did find ways to sort of expedite
[SPEAKER_01]: those process using some technology
solutions sorry go ahead Lauren I was
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna say I think that this is you know
the industry as a whole is going to and
[SPEAKER_00]: not just the cannabis industry but every
industry is a whole is going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: shift a bit right how we operate I think
that things are going to be more virtual
[SPEAKER_00]: more online working from home might be
more of a common thing social distancing
[SPEAKER_00]: might be something we have to do for an
extended number of months who knows but I
[SPEAKER_00]: think this is an opportunity for us to
utilize technology and everything that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have available to us now that we haven't
had during past you know global pandemics
[SPEAKER_00]: to deal with stuff like this and we can
still be effective and work and get things
[SPEAKER_00]: done I think it's important that we keep
in perspective what's happening around us
[SPEAKER_00]: though right like people are dying and so
for us to just keep going on like business
[SPEAKER_00]: as usual we have to you know we have to be
just you know pay attention to what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening around us right and people are
hurting right now people have lost their
[SPEAKER_00]: jobs and it's wonderful that our industry
can keep keep operating right now but who
[SPEAKER_00]: knows right like anything anything could
happen and so it's important that we are
[SPEAKER_01]: prepared for the worst but hope for the
best yeah absolutely Liz are you are you
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing anything different down in Southern
California or is that sort of along those
[SPEAKER_01]: same lines of you know queuing outside of
dispensaries and sort of are there are
[SPEAKER_01]: there best practices that are sort of just
falling in line with with the rest of what
[SPEAKER_03]: we've heard today I mean I think that a
lot of the practice we discussed on the
[SPEAKER_03]: caller being taken into account you know
lots of curbside pickup I can't think of
[SPEAKER_03]: any anything that is unique to LA or a
particularly restrictive effort for LA we
[SPEAKER_03]: were pretty successful in that upfront
lobbying with the governor's office in the
[SPEAKER_03]: city to allow you know broad freedoms and
rules so we haven't had any type of like
[SPEAKER_03]: micro management of of processes but
people have been innovative and I think
[SPEAKER_03]: respectful of the social distancing rules
and items sure can we just shift a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit now and sort of move back to the state
level I know that you know we have this
[SPEAKER_01]: Appalachian Symposium that is coming up on
Thursday that we're doing online now one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the reasons that we push forward with
that is because those regulations were
[SPEAKER_01]: dropped by the CDFA that deadline for
comment periods has not been pushed back
[SPEAKER_01]: and so we're still looking at I think it's
an April 14th comment deadline are we
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing at the state level either in
California or Lauren in New York anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: else on the East Coast are we seeing any
sort of deadlines being pushed back we
[SPEAKER_01]: know that there's been some requests for
relief from the state of California in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of licensing fees in terms of
licensing renewals are we seeing people
[SPEAKER_05]: getting any relief from those anywhere I'm
not seeing relief on the fees what I am
[SPEAKER_05]: seeing though is relief on some of the
more onerous requirements and getting the
[SPEAKER_05]: application in you know for example
in-person fingerprinting requirements
[SPEAKER_05]: notary requirements things like that are
being waived temporarily by the CCC in
[SPEAKER_05]: Massachusetts I don't really have too much
direct experience with other states at
[SPEAKER_05]: this point of time and dealing with like a
provisional license that's headed on to a
[SPEAKER_05]: final license but I know with respect to
submissions they're being very gracious in
[SPEAKER_05]: terms of what you can submit you know
submit which can and you know move
[SPEAKER_05]: continue to move forward towards getting a
license have we heard anything in
[SPEAKER_04]: California we haven't we haven't obtained
consent yet like for an express delay but
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that you know if you're talking
with your licensed analysts there is an
[SPEAKER_04]: understanding that things are difficult to
get right now we're there is work going on
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah I was watching yeah so you know it's
there it is in the works in California
[SPEAKER_04]: it's definitely not not secured which is
really aggravating because seeing Governor
[SPEAKER_04]: Newsom's latest issue order issued last
night essentially giving the ABC express
[SPEAKER_04]: rights to delay licensing fees and delay
licensing renewal obligations and ignoring
[SPEAKER_04]: the Bureau of Cannabis Control I was
frustrated and I'm sure he's got plenty of
[SPEAKER_04]: good reasons for that but you know I think
it gives us this additional fodder to
[SPEAKER_03]: argue that we should be treated the same
there was a letter that went out I believe
[SPEAKER_03]: yesterday Clark Howell signed it along
with I think a hundred other members of
[SPEAKER_03]: the legal cannabis community and it was
specifically asking the governor to delay
[SPEAKER_03]: licensing fees by at least 90 days provide
a 50% reduction for the rest of the year
[SPEAKER_03]: for businesses that can demonstrate that
they need that reduction in order to
[SPEAKER_03]: retain their employees and then to provide
relief from penalties for you know BCC
[SPEAKER_03]: licensees that do not directly estimate
you know their revenue for the next year
[SPEAKER_03]: so I know that that was a really strong
you know missive to the governor's office
[SPEAKER_03]: and I hope that there are others you know
with similar letters in the works but I
[SPEAKER_03]: think we also need to be thoughtful about
you know what other kind of relief that we
[SPEAKER_03]: push for because I assume it's going to be
such a tight legislative season so I know
[SPEAKER_03]: that Clark Howell has been vocal in our
support of AB 1948 which would reduce the
[SPEAKER_03]: excise tax to 11% and would eliminate the
cultivation tax both until July 2023 so
[SPEAKER_03]: those were two things that we thought you
know would be a good you know good
[SPEAKER_03]: initiatives to really push and just to be
as specific as possible absolutely you
[SPEAKER_01]: know one of the other things that we've
seen in response to this crisis is the
[SPEAKER_01]: federal government jumping into bailout
certain sectors of course there are
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to be certain measures of
oversight on that we don't know if that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to happen or not what is the
availability to cannabis businesses for
[SPEAKER_01]: any of this sort of relief is there any
availability at all and one step further
[SPEAKER_01]: than that what is the availability for
relief for maybe ancillary services things
[SPEAKER_01]: like law firms that that could potentially
be suffering in this time yeah well I
[SPEAKER_05]: think that I'm happy to jump in here if
anyone else wants to but I think that you
[SPEAKER_05]: know the loan packages come in in
basically two forms there's the SBA the
[SPEAKER_05]: small business loans and then there's the
Cares Act and I believe that there is a
[SPEAKER_05]: restriction on the small business loans
for that prohibits any illegal activity
[SPEAKER_05]: and illegal activity isn't just plant
touching businesses their definition
[SPEAKER_05]: includes direct or indirect so it would
include ancillary businesses as well but
[SPEAKER_05]: under the Cares Act there is no similar
restriction for illegal activity however
[SPEAKER_05]: because those loans are run through
traditional financial institutions it's
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be just as difficult for a
cannabis business to have access to that
[SPEAKER_05]: funding as it would be for them to have
ordinary banking you know ordinary banking
[SPEAKER_05]: services so you know again I think it
depends on your relationship with your
[SPEAKER_05]: banker if you've got a good one you know
then this might be a program they could be
[SPEAKER_05]: interested in but you know we're
definitely taking a look at this for our
[SPEAKER_05]: clients and you know processing
applications where we can or submitting
[SPEAKER_05]: them definitely encouraging them to get
the you know the information together you
[SPEAKER_05]: know so that when the regulations
officially come out which I think is April
[SPEAKER_05]: 3rd you know people will be ready and
organized with the information they need
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to submit sure are there any
other sort of issues that people are
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing from the federal government coming
down that might impact our our sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: localized businesses whether they're
client businesses or other legal industry
[SPEAKER_05]: businesses I'm not on the federal level
but on the state level if anyone has any
[SPEAKER_05]: clients you know that are manufacturing
any sort of protective equipment you know
[SPEAKER_05]: on a call from New York here from the hot
zone I would ask that you you know see if
[SPEAKER_05]: your clients are capable of manufacturing
this stuff and sending it over to New York
[SPEAKER_05]: and sending over health care professionals
and anyone that you have they the state of
[SPEAKER_05]: New York has made very clear that they
will pay a premium you know for personnel
[SPEAKER_05]: for people for equipment you know so if
you've got the type of business some hemp
[SPEAKER_05]: businesses had reached out with their
ability to make masks or whatever it could
[SPEAKER_05]: be but there's definitely opportunity from
state governments to get funding for
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing yeah I just want to jump in
real quick and say that in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: federal resources that are available hemp
business would be eligible right because
[SPEAKER_00]: now the farm bill is passed that's legal
so I'm sure that we have some folks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: call that might be you know hemp operators
they can take advantage of those resources
[SPEAKER_00]: and then in terms of just making masks and
PPE and everything absolutely Laura we've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen some examples here in California of
different types of cannabis manufacturers
[SPEAKER_00]: and other operators that have made hand
sanitizer and other types of products and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really it's a really wonderful way to
step up and to show everyone that our
[SPEAKER_00]: industry cares and to use use your
facility and your everything for a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good cause right now and it's good
publicity for your business as well so I
[SPEAKER_05]: do encourage folks to do that if they can
yeah that's a really good point on hemp
[SPEAKER_05]: businesses they would have access to both
the small business and the cares act are
[SPEAKER_01]: those SBA loans that are given to
agricultural the agricultural industry are
[SPEAKER_01]: those issued through the USDA loans are
those the same ones I know that very I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't believe so yeah okay I think I was
talking to someone maybe a week ago I was
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about USDA support and sort of
issues with some of the small farmers a
[SPEAKER_01]: small loan program through them but I was
unaware of it before now I did want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: to one other aspect Lauren Ruddock really
wanted to talk about the force majeure
[SPEAKER_01]: clauses and sort of how sort of
preparation for the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: could could help us in some regard also
sort of as a prophylactic going forward
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously we want to take a look at those
clauses so Lauren could you just give us a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of knowledge around that what
we should be looking out for yeah I think
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard the word force majeure more
times in the past three weeks than I have
[SPEAKER_05]: in my entire legal career but you know
these provisions are you know frequently
[SPEAKER_05]: looked at as boilerplate completely under
negotiated but they can be a very
[SPEAKER_05]: effective tool to preserving you know your
supply chain the integrity of your supply
[SPEAKER_05]: chain and it's very important to know that
in the absence of a force majeure
[SPEAKER_05]: provision the law will imply some pretty
intense presumptions they will presume
[SPEAKER_05]: that certain events were foreseeable they
will presume that the non-paying party
[SPEAKER_05]: typically the supplier might be the only
one relieved from performance so it's very
[SPEAKER_05]: important that if you have a force majeure
provision that you think through you know
[SPEAKER_05]: first of all is it mutual or unilateral
does it excuse one or both parties for
[SPEAKER_05]: performance and does performance include
payment you know does the ability to pay
[SPEAKER_05]: or not pay does that constitute a force
majeure event or if it's related to a
[SPEAKER_05]: force majeure event and then you have to
think about you know the whole including
[SPEAKER_05]: but not limited to language you know some
courts will say if the event is listed it
[SPEAKER_05]: was foreseeable and if the event wasn't
listed it wasn't foreseeable and so you
[SPEAKER_05]: have to make sure that if you have a
finite list or an open list and you know
[SPEAKER_05]: be careful on that language you know in
one instance you might want to keep the
[SPEAKER_05]: definition very broad and open and in the
other instance depending on what side of
[SPEAKER_05]: the distribution chain you're on you know
you might want it to be very restrictive
[SPEAKER_05]: you know force majeure provisions have a
variety of other negotiable aspects to
[SPEAKER_05]: them you know for instance there's notice
provisions you know in the event of a
[SPEAKER_05]: force majeure one party might be required
to give the other party notice of
[SPEAKER_05]: non-performance and that notice might have
to come within a reasonable time or
[SPEAKER_05]: promptly or immediately or within
commercial reasonableness or best efforts
[SPEAKER_05]: or whatever sort of qualifier that you've
included to provide notice but that's
[SPEAKER_05]: another negotiable provision you want to
make sure that if there's some sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: disruption in performance that appropriate
notice is given and sometimes that notice
[SPEAKER_05]: not only has to be given within a certain
amount of time but it has to identify
[SPEAKER_05]: steps being taken to mitigate the impact
of the force majeure provision so that's
[SPEAKER_05]: something you can also require your you
know supplier or distributor to do is
[SPEAKER_05]: actually have them set forth what's
happening and what they're planning to do
[SPEAKER_05]: to correct it and then of course you've
got the number of time within which you
[SPEAKER_05]: can escape you know with or without
liability you know so it's important to
[SPEAKER_05]: include that amount of time if a force
majeure event lasts for 30 days 60 days 90
[SPEAKER_05]: days you know at what point can the
parties start to look elsewhere for supply
[SPEAKER_05]: particularly if it's an exclusive supply
arrangement you know at what point you
[SPEAKER_05]: know do the parties move on or do they try
to keep it you know do they have a basis
[SPEAKER_05]: to be able to withstand and then resume as
soon as the force majeure event ends these
[SPEAKER_05]: are all negotiable points that really need
to be thought about before you enter into
[SPEAKER_05]: any contract and the truth is you know
even though COVID-19 was you know not
[SPEAKER_05]: really foreseeable and not very
predictable in the cannabis industry there
[SPEAKER_05]: are a variety of force majeure events that
could happen that are definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: predictable and foreseeable and that
includes regulatory shifts you know
[SPEAKER_05]: particularly on the hemp front or in
cannabis when an entire product line could
[SPEAKER_05]: all of a sudden be you know illegal as we
saw with the vape ban you know so there's
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely these provisions should be
familiar already and they most definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: should not be overlooked and now that
we've had this major disruption you know I
[SPEAKER_05]: think everyone is in everyone's best
interest to sort of dust off those
[SPEAKER_05]: provisions look through them you know see
who's protected and make sure from a
[SPEAKER_05]: preventative care basis going forward that
you take the time to think through
[SPEAKER_05]: anything that could potentially happen to
disrupt your contract.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the discussions that I've heard
coming out of this discussion of these
[SPEAKER_01]: clauses that you're right we've heard so
little about through most of our legal
[SPEAKER_01]: careers and then of course something like
this happens and all of a sudden they're
[SPEAKER_01]: highlighted is the idea of impossibility
versus impracticability and how those two
[SPEAKER_01]: things are defined could you give us just
a little bit of background about sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference between those two and and
how those are interpreted by most courts
[SPEAKER_01]: my impression is that most courts will
deem it a force majeure event if it's if
[SPEAKER_01]: performance is impossible but not if it's
economically impracticable which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly high bar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you know it's been a long time
since I've litigated you know as sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: an anticipatory breach or you know that
sort of thing but you know I think you got
[SPEAKER_05]: to look to the contract what the contract
says you know you got to look to see what
[SPEAKER_05]: you know but the law of your state these
are definitely cased by your state by
[SPEAKER_05]: state laws and presumptions and looking
into it but you know we're definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: seeing disputes with respect to all of
those issues yeah you know and
[SPEAKER_05]: impossibility impracticability those are a
defense you know to breach so that only
[SPEAKER_05]: happens once you've actually breached the
force majeure provision gives you a
[SPEAKER_05]: mechanism to sort of avoid the breach and
work through a potential problem when it
[SPEAKER_05]: arises.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over here complaining legal issues don't
worry about me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a few questions that have come
in and so this one's from Tammy Wall and
[SPEAKER_01]: she's wondering is there any upside to the
industry not receiving federal funds and
[SPEAKER_01]: basically our point is if grants or loans
are being made available on the state
[SPEAKER_01]: level but not at the federal level and
we're being declared essential at the
[SPEAKER_01]: state level but not at the federal level
does that put any sort of pressure on the
[SPEAKER_01]: federal government maybe move legislation
forward where maybe that pressure hasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: existed in the past or in other contexts?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if it puts pressure on the
federal government.
[SPEAKER_03]: My hot take on that is I don't really see
them paying much more attention to
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis issues considering everything
that's going on at the federal level right
[SPEAKER_03]: now but I do think it'll put more pressure
at the state level for the governor's
[SPEAKER_03]: office to lend a helping hand and you know
right now it's really you know a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: the sanitization measures are dependent on
cannabis businesses having access to you
[SPEAKER_03]: know Clorox wipes, hand sanitizers,
you know different things that allow them
[SPEAKER_03]: to actually comply with the laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: The licensing fees are very high and we've
been lobbying to get those you know some
[SPEAKER_03]: relief there so maybe the fact that
cannabis doesn't have access to this
[SPEAKER_03]: federal relief will you know spur the
state to act.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah you know we have some constitutional
constraints in the state of California
[SPEAKER_04]: right with regard to expenditures and
requiring a legislative authority and
[SPEAKER_04]: approval for that so we're you know at
Sacramento people are kind of running
[SPEAKER_04]: through the exercises trying to see what
they can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not lost on them that this is
definitely a hole in the system that needs
[SPEAKER_04]: to be addressed and they're trying to look
at it from different perspectives but
[SPEAKER_04]: there are some limitations and there's a
big constitutional debate going on right
[SPEAKER_04]: now in our state and it's probably like
wise in other jurisdictions as well so I
[SPEAKER_04]: think that they are trying to address the
holes but they if they apply the federal
[SPEAKER_04]: funding they receive to the cannabis
businesses then they did definitely risk
[SPEAKER_04]: losing a lot of it if not all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any sort of do you think that a
solution for that could be involved and
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a question that's sort of from
Andrea Steele.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that any sort of solution
could be inserted into the next stimulus
[SPEAKER_01]: bill you know we're they're already
planning a force stimulus bill they're
[SPEAKER_01]: already looking at how that's going to be
doled out do you think that there's any
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of room there to make room for these
essential cannabis businesses given that
[SPEAKER_01]: they've been recognized as essential by
the states or is this sort of a is it an
[SPEAKER_01]: uphill battle at the federal level in this
context.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it's tough to predict like with
this whole situation right what the
[SPEAKER_00]: priorities are going to be as the pandemic
continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that overall seeing how many
different states and not just states but
[SPEAKER_00]: different countries around the world and
different cities and different countries
[SPEAKER_00]: have deemed cannabis to be among their
essential businesses I do think that has
[SPEAKER_00]: can give momentum towards overall like
federal legalization and I you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't write legislation not too involved
in the federal lobbying side of things
[SPEAKER_00]: there but I bet they're going to try to
put something in the next stimulus bill I
[SPEAKER_00]: think they try to put can they try to put
cannabis in the coronavirus bill and it
[SPEAKER_00]: got cut out at the last moment I believe
so they are they're going to keep trying
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's important for us to keep
supporting the groups that do the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: lobbying for cannabis legalization
nationwide because that's important that
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't you know stop fighting for that
even though some of us might be in states
[SPEAKER_00]: that have already legalized to various
extents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Us in New York would like to buy your
California grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would love to ship some of the excess
to other states that need it right
[SPEAKER_00]: interstate transport it's got to be a
thing but not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay well I know that we've been on for
about 55 minutes we don't have any other
[SPEAKER_01]: questions from from the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys have any sort of clothing
closing thoughts that you'd like to give
[SPEAKER_01]: just before we sign off I know it's been a
long day for most of us here especially
[SPEAKER_01]: for you who are on the East Coast so
anything else you guys want to add?
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say it's really good to see
your faces and thank everyone for joining
[SPEAKER_05]: us in this time I know there's competing
space for webinars and all this stuff and
[SPEAKER_05]: this is a really engaging conversation I
learned so much from all of you so thank
[SPEAKER_05]: you for your time and stay safe healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I just want to thank you all for
putting this together on such short notice
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was great that so many folks could
participate this is an important time
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got to be diligent we got to be
responsible right now it's a turning point
[SPEAKER_00]: for not just our industry but for like
humanity right now so it's important that
[SPEAKER_00]: we do everything with intention and with
an eye and our mind towards safety of
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves our employees our clients and
our community yeah but also amazing that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've you know really made such strides
that we're now considered an essential so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's that's I think the silver lining in
all of this yeah absolutely that's taken a
[SPEAKER_05]: long time to get here so the businesses
that make it through this are going to do
[SPEAKER_05]: great you know some businesses will
survive and some on not but this is you
[SPEAKER_05]: know a health crisis not an economic
crisis and the economics will pick up when
[SPEAKER_01]: the health crisis is over absolutely it's
okay well thank you all we're arranging
[SPEAKER_01]: those we're arranging those we're trying
to get those back together I know I look
[SPEAKER_03]: forward to meeting you all in person and
thank you so much to Chris like this was
[SPEAKER_03]: really like heartening to me to speak with
all of you I also learned so much and I
[SPEAKER_03]: think Chris you said this might be like a
regular thing so I'm also looking forward
[SPEAKER_01]: to hearing we've had a lot of comments
from people that just want to stay more
[SPEAKER_01]: connected with their communities you know
we have a really great community of a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of really really bright people here
and I love getting to talk to all of them
[SPEAKER_01]: about different things so we're trying to
make some of those conversations a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more public so when I get to you know
do my background research with you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: other people get to hear some of it so we
have a community of trained activists from
[SPEAKER_04]: all across the country and I'd be curious
to hear from people who are listening
[SPEAKER_04]: online in other jurisdictions outside of
California New York you know places that
[SPEAKER_04]: we maybe couldn't pay enough attention to
on this call like what they want to hear
[SPEAKER_04]: from what jurisdictions they want to hear
about and I think we should continue to
[SPEAKER_04]: have these conversations and invite them
down to the table I think we could do a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of good together yeah absolutely and
if you're interested in doing one of these
[SPEAKER_01]: in the future let me know we're always
looking for great smart interesting people
[SPEAKER_01]: to talk to so we love all of you stay safe
stay healthy I hope to see you in person
[SPEAKER_01]: soon until then we'll be back online
starting again on Thursday we'll do four
[SPEAKER_01]: hours of Appalachians which is it's going
to be an incredible event it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: great lineup and so I'm really glad that
the one saving grace of having to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: online is we get to show it to more people
so I'll see you all there awesome thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you you
Thank you very much.
