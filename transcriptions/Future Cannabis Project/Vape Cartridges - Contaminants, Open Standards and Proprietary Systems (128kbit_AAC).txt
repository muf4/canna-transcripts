[SPEAKER_00]: You have a history in vape cartridges from
your days slinging nicotine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're slinging weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk about kind of the evolution and
what you've seen and then maybe some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the toxicity issues we're hearing about
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, as far as toxicity goes with a
lot of the vape hardware that's available
[SPEAKER_01]: in the THC space, what a lot of the
consumers don't understand is that each of
[SPEAKER_01]: the products aren't made equally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it ultimately comes down to the
original source of the raw material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the stainless steel, the brass,
the ceramic, there's a good and bad for
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy cheap metal or you can buy
expensive metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest thing is all flour and
extraction processes are different across
[SPEAKER_01]: the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have guys using butane.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have you guys using dry ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have using CO2 and that all
reacts differently with different metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the biggest thing is when you do send a
cartridge to get tested for heavy metals
[SPEAKER_01]: and it comes back as a fail, what ends up
happening is the oil is etching away at
[SPEAKER_01]: the metal inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like leaching the metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's pretty much leaching into the
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is when it combusts or even when
it's just sitting there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when it's just sitting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole combustion process isn't as
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is metal wire in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most folks don't look into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it can either be a source of canthal,
stainless steel, there's nickel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they all serve its purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the heating element of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ceramic itself, most people have this
thought of, oh, the ceramic heats up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there needs to be two wires that run
into that ceramic to give you a positive
[SPEAKER_01]: and a negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get an actual electric current in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back to the heavy metals, like I was
saying, even when the oil sits there,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will etch away and leach from that
metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are using a lower quality metal
or you're sourcing a lower quality
[SPEAKER_01]: cartridge, you can't always trust that
product is going to be heavy metal
[SPEAKER_01]: passing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really comes down to the raw
materials used and also to the quality
[SPEAKER_01]: control at the factory level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of our products are thoroughly
washed, rinsed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a whole cleansing process for
the raw material that we use before they
[SPEAKER_01]: actually get sent to the assembly line and
broken down into the appropriate pieces
[SPEAKER_01]: for assembly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, the thing is, a lot of this
technology stems from the electronic
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarette world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of where the industry may move
forward will kind of follow suit of how
[SPEAKER_01]: things were in that industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: 510 cartridges are a technology of the
past in the electronic cigarette industry
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they've been repurposed for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, better ceramics are used for
thicker distillate and thinner CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes down to ceramic,
you can also purchase a cheaper ceramic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have a really coarse compacted
ceramic where if you were to break a
[SPEAKER_01]: cartridge apart and open the coil,
you can actually run your fingers through
[SPEAKER_01]: that ceramic and it will kind of break
apart like sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have a solid ceramic where
ceramic is- Just to clarify, that first
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario is not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that first scenario isn't good,
but it does- It's not what you're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not what you're looking for,
but it can work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if all the other material source
is of quality, it will work extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you are using more traditional,
well, traditional in the sense of this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry would be a more ceramic core,
solid ceramic core.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, ceramic is porous in its self.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what actually pulls in the
actual distillate or oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in turn, the positive and
negative wire that's running through that
[SPEAKER_01]: ceramic is what's vaporizing the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I mean, you know,
at iCrusher, we really emphasize on
[SPEAKER_01]: quality control.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we are working with some of the
top industry leaders in this space when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to pod systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say industry leaders,
do you mean on your supply side or your
[SPEAKER_00]: customers are industry leaders?
[SPEAKER_01]: Our customers are industry leaders and
well, our clients are industry leaders and
[SPEAKER_01]: they've kind of set a precedence of what
it is to move forward in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're making sure their chain
supply is up to par, that we can get them
[SPEAKER_01]: product and quality product at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can tell you that in the
Southern California region, we probably
[SPEAKER_01]: have a good 90% of what is out there
available to the general consumer right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are providing that hardware
specifically to those brands that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the general consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me ask this, we're being
secretive about who they are, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: your stuff's pretty apparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like if I went into a dispenser,
you could pick out your... Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: not necessarily, because I mean,
in China, everyone, we know the Chinese
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when it comes to shoes or
purses, there's a bunch of factories that
[SPEAKER_01]: make the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to make something that isn't
going to get copied.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've innovated on the design,
but then a month later or six months
[SPEAKER_00]: later, you see a bunch of identical
looking, cheaper quality material stuff on
[SPEAKER_01]: the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, it ultimately comes down to
the brands, you know, if they want to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with a cheaper supplier, that's fully up
to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the general consumer doesn't realize
that the product's not getting tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you don't know if it's pesticide
free and you don't know if it's heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: metal passing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the biggest thing is for us,
we publicly have everything on our website
[SPEAKER_01]: lab tested for every single one of our
products for heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we are the provider of hardware
and you know, what everyone else provides
[SPEAKER_01]: is what they put into that and sell it off
to the rest of the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so let's talk about kind of
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously there's been lots of
innovative new types of concentrates on
[SPEAKER_00]: the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of like, can you talk about
different concentrates and maybe like
[SPEAKER_00]: their characteristics, like maybe they
have different viscosities and like how
[SPEAKER_00]: that affects and interplays with you know,
which types of, what type of hardware
[SPEAKER_00]: technology is required?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the general consumer right now has this
perception of clear is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clear is cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is honestly not the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you were to leave a cup of
water outside, during the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: that air is gonna bring so much stuff into
that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not gonna be clear the entire time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will turn yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will turn cloudy.
[SPEAKER_01]: General consumers don't realize that,
that once air and heat is introduced into
[SPEAKER_01]: oil, it will oxidize.
[SPEAKER_01]: That oil will oxidize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not necessarily a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of it as a tea bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get a fresh tea bag and you put
it into a cup of water, a cup of hot
[SPEAKER_01]: water, it's pretty clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see the color change.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you leave that tea bag in that hot
cup of water, that tea bag starts to kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of deteriorate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flowers deteriorate a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your tea starts to get darker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing with oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes time gives it a little bit
better flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the general consumer doesn't realize
that when it comes to viscosity and
[SPEAKER_01]: finding the correct device for our
clients, that's totally up to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, distillate usually comes out
extremely thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Live resin is, you know, extremely,
extremely thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's almost a solid at that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where terpenes come into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, terpenes will break that down a
little bit, give you a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that will change the
viscosity of the oil itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not all oil is made equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all oil is meant to be clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that most folks need
to realize is if you are using a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes to create a flavor profile for
your biomass, you might have a looser
[SPEAKER_01]: liquid than a looser oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, a looser oil rather than a
thicker oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you like to smoke these days?
[SPEAKER_01]: Me personally, I personally enjoy the 2 to
1 CBD THC ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little bit more mellow of a high
rather than something that's gonna really
[SPEAKER_01]: get me, you know, couch potato mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then is there a specific, like,
is it live resin 2 to 1?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mainly distillate 2 to 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2 to 1 with CBD, you know, anything with a
25, anything with a 60% CBD to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like a 20%, 30% THC is
personally what I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a brand you like?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can say I do enjoy the Stizzy mango
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do enjoy that quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of all your products showcased out
here, which one would you smoke that out
[SPEAKER_00]: of?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, unfortunately, Stizzy doesn't
provide that in a syringe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's an idea for them to give to,
you know, dispensaries that might buy
[SPEAKER_01]: hardware for the general consumers to fill
their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: But me personally, right now I am using
the Zen, which is our newest device.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great thing is it utilizes USB-C charging
rather than the old micro USB that
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone still uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you're not gonna go having
to look for another wire because most
[SPEAKER_01]: folks have either Apple or Android.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phone charger and that plugs straight into
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great thing is you have three settings for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a low, medium, and high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are running a thicker oil in the
pod, you know, you can warm that up a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's in the pod right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, this is a CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just plain CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you filling it yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: I filled this one up myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is that like, because I'm looking at
that, it's like a tax-looking platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is this a disposable cartridge?
[SPEAKER_00]: The cartridge is usually one-time use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have your own proprietary platform
too, or is that a standard?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, so it's all proprietary.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, each of our pods are made to a
certain spec.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few brands that we work with
that, you know, have really taken over
[SPEAKER_01]: that space in a couple of states right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Florida, Michigan, and Southern
California have the Vfire, and there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple brands that have really made that
specific device their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning this device?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not this specific device.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's the Zen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vfire is a little bit bigger of a device,
a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that an iCrusher device?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, this is an iCrusher device.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Vfire is the iCrusher model,
and then there's a couple brands that
[SPEAKER_01]: rebrand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't have that here?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't disclose that information,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, we're talking, I guess my confusion
is I'm seeing devices that look like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: that look, well maybe not this one,
but that one specifically looks like a
[SPEAKER_00]: brand would, let me see the pod itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So brands are ordering thousands of these,
filling them, putting them in dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: on shelves, and it only works with your
device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the brands are also purchasing the
device, and rebranding the device
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But point being, they're standardizing on
your proprietary technology platform,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I find interesting, and so,
because I know, so basically Pax does
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you guys do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fizzy does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what historically I'm getting at
is, you know, common thread sizes,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: 510, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is thanks to the electronic
cigarette industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thread has become the standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because the electronic
cigarette industry, there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: smokers in that industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people that medicate and
use recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of those guys can walk into any
dispensary and buy a 510 cartridge and not
[SPEAKER_01]: be persuaded to buy a stick battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they have 10 lying around the
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they have 10 lying around the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got one of those really big ones that
blow clouds and the thing is they can turn
[SPEAKER_01]: the power down on those to work correctly
for a 510 cartridge.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a supplier, would you guys rather
not, like, is this kind of like an old
[SPEAKER_00]: technology?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been repurposed, and it's been
reworked to work better.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the viscosity is much thicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: The viscosity is much thicker,
and the thing is you can't pump more power
[SPEAKER_01]: into the cartridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do that, you end up in turn burning
the THC molecules and completely,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, at that point, what is the purpose
of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, for, this is my one advice
to most consumers is you've seen guys with
[SPEAKER_01]: electronic cigarettes blowing clouds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clouds does not make the cartridge any
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make your distillate any
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, at the end of the day,
the general consumer knows that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: one reason why they're doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to get their high.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to lower their anxiety,
you know, or even for medical purposes,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're trying to prevent a seizure,
you know, but cloud production is not a
[SPEAKER_01]: huge factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think perception-wise, so what you're
saying is if you blow and you don't see
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, you're still getting,
you're still getting something.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because I was dealing with that,
actually with the ghost vape where I kept
[SPEAKER_00]: sucking and blowing and being like,
I don't see any vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I was like, but I'm super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's lung capacity is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can get a pretty big cloud from
this if I really drew on it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm sitting there and I really have to
toke that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the case for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting back to kind of the proprietary
pod and battery kind of compatibility,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like your pod won't work with a
PAX battery and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you kind of seeing in that game?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, do you find it interesting that
there are all these companies coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: with proprietary connections?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's you know, it's it's their one
way of cornering a certain market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in the PAX, don't get me wrong,
works well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact that not every consumer can
pay 60 dollars for a battery, not every
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer can pay 60 dollars for a pod.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half gram at that point, not every
consumer can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working with some companies that,
yes, they're using one of our designs as a
[SPEAKER_01]: proprietary system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they're able to sell to
consumers at 40 dollars for a full gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the battery will last them for two
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, PAX has a market focus that
they're targeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're executing it extremely well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stizzi is doing the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we're just offering that
solution for brands like them or anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: that aspires to be someone like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can brands go on both platforms or do you
do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there like you got to sign with us or
with them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the specific details of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from what I understand, you know,
there are a few brands that do have two
[SPEAKER_01]: different devices for two different
purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: From different manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you talked about how this is still
relevant technology wise, but like what's
[SPEAKER_00]: the improvement that this has over kind of
the traditional legacy?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, with this one or 510
cartridges specifically, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: with 510 cartridges, they're great,
but most consumers aren't very careful
[SPEAKER_01]: with a lot of their things, you know,
with the traditional pens, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes you put it in your back pocket,
you will sit on it and it will snap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've all seen it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You drop it, the glass will break.
[SPEAKER_01]: You lose your precious biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, with the batteries and the pods,
you know, the pods are made out of PTGC
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a medical grade plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you are dropping this on
the floor, the battery is going to protect
[SPEAKER_01]: your pod.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in all reality, if you drop your pod,
it's not going to break on you and shatter
[SPEAKER_01]: on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from a smoking standpoint,
like is this one capable of handling more
[SPEAKER_00]: variability and viscosity than the other
one?
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had clients of mine send videos of
them putting live resin into some of our
[SPEAKER_01]: pods.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're still working.
Is that encouraged?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not encouraged.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not encouraged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do experiment at your own risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you had some live resin right in
front of you, again, which device would
[SPEAKER_00]: you pull out?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely have to say the guy
that I'm using right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been holding up pretty well,
but every mix will be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our clients has put live resin in
this specific pod and he has mixed it with
[SPEAKER_01]: different liquidizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either MCT, honey cut or even terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume if you're doing live resin,
the last thing you'd want to do is mix it
[SPEAKER_00]: with MCT.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes just a little bit goes a long
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone experiments on a different
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how did we get live resin?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was out of a crazy idea that he had to
put it in dry ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now look at where we're at with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's I mean, how did electronic
cigarettes come to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional analog cigarettes have been
around for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same thing with hand rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been around for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a standard for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took one person to say, hey,
I want to play Breaking Bad and I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: try something crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we have distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it just takes one crazy
experiment to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one person can lead the entire
industry space into a completely different
[SPEAKER_01]: direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, who would have thought 10,
15 years ago that we were going to be at
[SPEAKER_01]: an event where we can openly smoke and not
be looked at in a certain manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Batteries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
