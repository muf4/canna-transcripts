[SPEAKER_00]: When you think about what cannabis
cultivation really is, it is cut flower
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is nothing more than cut flower or
flora culture, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where my PhD was in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vast majority of my PhD research was
funded by the International Cut Flower
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we started doing this research,
cutting edge hydroponic research,
[SPEAKER_00]: we always have cannabis cultivators coming
in and talking to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: UC Davis is a public university,
anyone can walk in campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always kind of knew that cannabis might
be in my future when I was working on my
[SPEAKER_00]: PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: What years was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I finished my PhD in 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big proponent, a big fan of
evidence-based decision-making.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to look at studies, I want to look
at research, and I want to have a full
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding before I make a real big
decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something we can always do in the
cannabis world just because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes a lack of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing that's interesting about
cannabis is there are a lot of analogous
[SPEAKER_00]: plants out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we don't have to reinvent the wheel
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's oftentimes research that's done on
plants like chrysanthemum that have
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat similar research topics they can
go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very analogous plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did that get you interested in
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you done any research on the cannabis
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the University of California,
we're not allowed to do work on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The campus at UC Davis has somewhere north
of $660 million of federal grant money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to jeopardize.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, my PhD research was on cut flower
production, roses and chrysanthemums in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I got into the cannabis industry,
it was basically at a friend who forwarded
[SPEAKER_00]: me a job description for a production
manager position at Spark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked at this and I'm like,
the job description is horticulture 101.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're asking very basic questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And understandably so, that's all that
cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went into that interview and I
met with Eric Pearson, who's the founder
[SPEAKER_00]: of Spark and the executive director of the
time, another gentleman by the name of
[SPEAKER_00]: Robert Jacob.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, it's one of the easiest
interviews I've ever had just because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're asking horticulture questions,
which I happen to have a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: expertise in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, Eric Pearson just slams his
hand on the table and walks out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I got to go to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hire him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get a call the next day from Robert
Jacob.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he basically says, so we think you're
overqualified for a production manager
[SPEAKER_00]: position.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've created a production director
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to oversee the entire
production cycle and everything within
[SPEAKER_00]: Spark on the production side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were growing at that time?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were growing at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric Pearson has been cultivating since
the late 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, he was trying to step away from
cultivation more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they needed someone they can kind of
trust and to come in and take it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that what you did?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I oversaw every single aspect of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first got there, on the very first
day, Eric Pearson took me to one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an indoor facility inside San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's an indoor production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grown in hydroponics, which is
obviously very well versed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, Robbie, there's something
wrong with this facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our fertigation lines keep on gumming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, what are you running
through there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, oh, we've got our water,
newts, pH, yada, yada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's like, oh, we're also putting
something in there called Mendocino honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking to myself, OK,
Mendocino honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, well, it's kind of like
molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, that sounds like it might
be the culprit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you putting Mendocino honey in
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just been told to put that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, OK, well, first thing
we're going to do is we're going to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ultimately, they're putting a
carbohydrate in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only reason why you'd want to do
that is if you're growing with organic
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers and you want the, you know,
because plants don't absorb organic
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, in all honesty.
[SPEAKER_00]: They absorb mineral nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that organic fertilizer has to break
down into that mineral nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to do that, if you add the sugar,
you might be speeding up some microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: activity that will speed up that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you want to increase the microbial,
beneficial microbial activity to maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps outcompete a pathogen,
that's why you would put the carbohydrates
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm thinking to myself,
when I first got in the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I've never heard of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen this done before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been around the block a time or
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I called a couple of friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my friends is a professor at
Cornell in horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I called him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, have you ever heard of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, I've never heard of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I called another of my friends,
who's at the time was a director of
[SPEAKER_00]: research at Ball Horticulture out of West
Chicago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I called him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, have you ever heard of
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, never heard of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What had they heard about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What had they heard about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never heard of people putting
carbohydrate in sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these guys, when did they start
doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it an old wives' style?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an old wives' style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there is something to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if you're growing hydroponically
and you're fertilizing, which means you're
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigating and fertilizing on a regular
basis, I'm hand feeding nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: water to this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want that plant to go out
exploring for those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hand delivering to this plant an
already processed nutrient so that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: can just very readily absorb it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's highly bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't need to increase the
respiration rate of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to break that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to limit the root zone as
much as I can without affecting the health
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant, because that gives a minor
stress to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That actually pushes more sugar and carbon
into the shoot system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that actually is what you're pushing
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC is a 21 carbon molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expensive for the plant to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure that the budget for
carbon is allocated properly and to an
[SPEAKER_00]: effect that we're manipulating the
physiology and anatomy of the plant for
[SPEAKER_00]: our own needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did this experience tell you something
about how people in the industry were
[SPEAKER_01]: approaching cultivation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I think a lot of people,
you know, I will always say time and time
[SPEAKER_00]: again that I'm standing on the shoulders
of giants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people who came decades before
me cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the plant's been cultivated for
millennia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just decades, but millennia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, what's unfortunate about
cannabis is because of its legal issues in
[SPEAKER_00]: this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, the cultivators who have been
doing this up in the hills and the Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: Triangle haven't had access to the
Cooperative Extension Research at UC Davis
[SPEAKER_00]: or Cal Poly or NC State, Michigan State,
Cornell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't go and say, hey, I've got this
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what these universities are
meant to do, is to provide assistance to
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think, because I interviewed Reggie
Gaudino recently, because he told me the
[SPEAKER_01]: exact same thing, that he had his papers
published at UC Davis and he was working
[SPEAKER_01]: with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because they couldn't touch the plant,
he had to do the touching.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once it got to pass that, because they
can do the DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once he extracted, then they could work
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, because it's no longer cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's DNA, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is so ironic, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's where a lot of the research and
sciences die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's unfortunate about that,
though, is, you know, research that's
[SPEAKER_00]: geared towards cultivation and,
you know, for making it more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, in horticulture and in
horticulture and agriculture, the terms
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable and efficient are synonymous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're becoming more efficient,
becoming more sustainable, which I think
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone should be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, to become more efficient
grower, having access to a whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: physiologist at a UC Davis is basically
non-existent at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the University of
California is starting to see a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: proposals on hemp, obviously, since the
farm bill passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis is still, you know,
considered a four-letter word by UC
[SPEAKER_00]: regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I'm, you know, I had the sincere
pleasure to speak with the Dean of Ag
[SPEAKER_00]: Sciences to her advisory council at UC
Davis, and, you know, talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: low-hanging fruit that is cannabis
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, listen, hemp and cannabis,
they're the same species.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just different varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like if I were to have a red
rose and a white rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: My understanding is the scientists are
really, like, championing it a bit to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Academics see cannabis like any other
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one question about sustainability
and the commodification of this plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: scaled cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are those things synonymous?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, true commoditization of cannabis,
I think, is going to be difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of my research has really
been around mathematical modeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're doing mathematical
modeling for a biological system,
[SPEAKER_00]: it allows you to make predictions with
some level of confidence, that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I'm really interested
in doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically, one of the primary goals
of horticulture in general is uniformity
[SPEAKER_00]: across the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your crop ecology, you want to have a
uniform crop time and time and time again.
[SPEAKER_00]: A perfect example I always like to give is
poinsettias.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're a poinsettia grower,
you're likely to have a contract with Home
[SPEAKER_00]: Depot or Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Home Depot is saying, okay,
here's your end cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's outside of that range,
we're not buying that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be very uniform and
very precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the goal of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the type of research I'm interested in
doing, that I am doing, and that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: working on currently is a lot of
artificial intelligence research,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, of helping us build out these
models of really developing heat maps in
[SPEAKER_00]: individual facilities and grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so seeing where, you know,
for some reason, at this one spot in this
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, we have higher yields or we have
higher THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to figure out why that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, doing that type of
research, then you can have a better
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of what are those
environmental abiotic factors that are
[SPEAKER_00]: assisting you in that, you know,
increased yield and seeing if you can try
[SPEAKER_00]: to replicate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to create a very uniform crop,
but at the same time, optimizing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, why is it doing well here,
not over here, and trying to figure that
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing with your business?
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you creating products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we do have products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two products right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be launching a third one this
fall as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I started Doc Robb Farms
was because when I was still at SPARC,
[SPEAKER_00]: I received a phone call from my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom was calling me to let me know that
she was diagnosed with triple negative
[SPEAKER_00]: breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's currently cancer-free, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: They caught it very early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, she went through her bouts
of chemo and radiation therapies.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had two bouts of surgery to remove
tumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my mom went to college in the
60s, was invited to a hot party,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm literally not exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This actually did happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: She thought she was going to a tougher,
worse-showing party.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when my mom calls me to let me know
about this diagnosis, I let her know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, hey, I can get you access to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of cannabis that I've
grown personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is she?
[SPEAKER_00]: She's actually in the Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's in San Fernando Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I told her I'd give her
access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, well, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want a smokeable or a vapeable,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only want an edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything that I had groomed that I
knew was clean, that I knew did not have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, plant growth regulators or
Michael Butenal, which releases hydrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: cyanide when you heat it up, you know,
that was not going to be any good for her
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was going to have to go source
something for an edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was thinking to myself,
am I about to poison my mom?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was really the birth of Doc
Rob Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what did you envision?
[SPEAKER_01]: An edible?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to make an edible for her?
[SPEAKER_00]: I envisioned, well, I envisioned a line of
products because my thinking was,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, at that time, you know, I've done a
lot of consulting work and I've seen what
[SPEAKER_00]: people are putting on those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was thinking, well, I have the
expertise and I have the experience to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow this product on a very large scale
and still have a tremendous amount of high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be more people out there
other than just my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to start from the source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so vertical supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: My expertise is cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was the next step when you decided
that that was what you wanted to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really starting to, okay,
well, I have a lot of great relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: with some great growers that are following
standard operating procedures that I
[SPEAKER_00]: approve or have written for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sourcing product from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I was always interested in large
scale cultivation and not only just large
[SPEAKER_00]: scale, but something that's heavily
involved with technology, including
[SPEAKER_00]: technology into cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is where the future of not
just cannabis, but agriculture in general
[SPEAKER_00]: is going towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have a lot of love,
a lot of love for different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no wrong, truly wrong way to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm interested in is efficiency
and sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what methods are you drawn to then if
those are your priorities?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to grow with full sun spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So full sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why that's important is there
are photoreceptors in the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that when triggered actually
increase the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something you don't typically
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't you almost never see in
warehouse production.
[SPEAKER_00]: You almost never see it in greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see it in outdoor productions
because you have full exposure to the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you know what you're doing,
you can kind of kind of gain access and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, hack the physiology of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm also interested in is just the
sustainability of cultivation in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing that as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get into too much detail quite
yet, but there's, you know, we've put
[SPEAKER_00]: together a quite a large renewable energy
program that will basically be covering
[SPEAKER_00]: roughly half of our energy needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the big things I'm very interested
in also is integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, our motto is good science,
clean cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to use science to provide,
you know, a clean working environment for
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants to grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that we're lucky with cannabis
is not an ornamental crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to that poinsettia
discussion, if I'm at Home Depot and I go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the NCAP, and I pick up a poinsettia
and we have some white flies that fly off
[SPEAKER_00]: of it, I'm likely not going to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a zero tolerance for pests in
an ornamental crop like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For something that is a consumable,
such as cannabis, you can have a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of a pest population.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why that's actually a good
thing is because that actually increases
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the defenses the plant has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does the plant do when it has
defense or needs certain defense
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanisms?
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually increases the carbon
allocation to flower production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you use pests to fight pests?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're definitely a big fan of
biologicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think, the best way to control a
pest population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in your grow environments, are they
highly controlled, pristine environments?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going in there and there's nothing
on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the entire facility is this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer to work in an environment that we
call the hybrid indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar to greenhouse except for
it's almost a step up above the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting about this is it has
all the benefits of an indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, probably people are like,
well, what are the benefits of having an
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that's nice about having an
indoor environment is you have a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, the goal of horticulture
is uniformity.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a patient consumes a product,
I want that patient to have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: experience time and time and time again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to have a bad experience with
that because if one time it's not good for
[SPEAKER_00]: them, it's not what they were expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might turn them off to the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so giving the same experience over and
over again is paramount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, actually, that is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if we're talking about grapes,
wines, where different harvests might be
[SPEAKER_01]: different, there is a need for
variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be growing different strains
seasonally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is 100% correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's one big difference is
typically, I mean, it depends on who you
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to, but wine isn't really considered
a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe to some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are people who are going to be
using cannabis recreationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will also argue that the
difference between recreational and
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis is nil, almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using it recreationally,
the chances are you're using it for an
[SPEAKER_00]: undiagnosed symptom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to relax or I want to sleep at
night, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, along those lines, there may be a
vertical industry in this country or
[SPEAKER_01]: actually in the world, well, in this
country where the FDA oversees those
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the cannabis that is
going to be consumed in this country is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be considered more of like a
supplement, as opposed to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this is a but flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, flower would be this flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where would you put flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put flower on that supplemental
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it is still a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason why, though, that makes it
difficult because there are 113 known
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another 21 may have just been discovered
by the University of British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not one active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult to set up FDA trials
on, you know, something that has hundreds
[SPEAKER_00]: of active ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, really, you know,
trying to push for that uniformity,
[SPEAKER_00]: the best way to do that is an environment
that's fully controlled or is controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are inherent variables that we can't
control, and that's in the genetics of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But outside of that, we can control the
environment very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you have something like a
hybrid indoor facility where you're still
[SPEAKER_00]: accessing the energy from the sun,
which the quality of that light is
[SPEAKER_00]: unparalleled, the intensity of that light
is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my favorite part about sunlight is
it's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a sustainability aspect and
efficiency aspect there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that, too, you know,
the quality of that light is significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a lot of people, when they want
to drive photosynthesis, they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in driving, you know,
the P680, P700, which are the photosystems
[SPEAKER_00]: that are driving true photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you see red and blue
primarily driving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are other photoreceptors in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a perfect example is the photoreceptor
called UVR8.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so UVR8 is actually triggered by UVB.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that does when it's triggered is
it actually goes and promotes a biosignal
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway called the Chalcone synthase
pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces a compound named Chalcone,
which produces a compound named olapetolic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid, which produces a compound called
CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I'm sure you know, CBGA is a
progenitor for the vast majority of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, including THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, Jeff Lowenthal was also just saying
that a huge part of the effect of the real
[SPEAKER_01]: sun is its effect on the soil or the
growing environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you grow in?
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer hydroponics, but hydroponics,
all that means is it's soilless media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what does soilless media mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It means there's no soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And soil is there is an actual,
you know, if you're to go to a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: What environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Coconut core, mineral, you know,
like I'm not opposed to clay pellet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or true aeroponics either.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of my PhD research was in
aeroponics, where it's just nothing more
[SPEAKER_00]: than nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, without a doubt, the tiernoir is
going to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does not mean it's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does not mean it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just don't understand what that is
at this point, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about Desert Hot Springs and
the facility and whatever you could speak
[SPEAKER_01]: about about the marketplace and where
you're at with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also with your licensing and all of
that really sexy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super sexy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm very, very, very, very pleased
to say that we we just got our first
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation license.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're the 98th cultivation license
awarded in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're actually the first for tier two
mixed light, the first in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm very proud to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're licensed on that front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what exactly does that mean,
that particular mixed light license?
[SPEAKER_00]: So mixed light means sun with supplemental
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why supplemental lighting
is important is, you know, we're using the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun to drive photosynthesis to really push
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the sun's at a different location in
the sky in January than it is in July.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we want to make sure the DLI or the
daily light integral is roughly the same
[SPEAKER_00]: in January as it is in July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once again, uniformity,
I want the same product year in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, month in, month out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Day in, day out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what lights do you use for your
supplemental?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are currently doing a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of, you know, the tried and
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm also very progressive when it
comes to technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see the new hotness and I want
to play with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, right before we sat down,
a woman came up to us and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, check out my new light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very intrigued by that plasma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which don't seem to be less hot,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less hot, less energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, supplemental lighting is
a big portion of having this environment
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can control these abiotic
environmental factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the double 1000 watt HPS,
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there is some benefit to those
because they do produce infrared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I personally believe that that
infrared actually does have a benefit to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most people would say no,
but I personally believe that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's some research that we're
actually currently doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that also, you know, if we are to use
different types of lighting, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that also means that there can be
different ways of cultivating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if I'm using an HPS,
there are going to be parts of the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum that's going to, you know,
really be able to penetrate deeper into a
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But LED tends to not have that ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least the LED arrays that I've seen
thus far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get back to the facility and what
you're actually literally doing within
[SPEAKER_01]: what your plans are for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How large is it also?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have currently, under contract,
five separate facilities that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: building out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, by the end of this year,
we're going to have roughly 130,000 square
[SPEAKER_00]: feet of canopy space.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be hydroponic production
and hybrid indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sun driven photosynthesis here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also one of the things I'm a big fan
of is CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, injection, carbonation,
which is something rather difficult to do
[SPEAKER_00]: in outdoor production or even greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have used the same or the right
technology, we're working with a company
[SPEAKER_00]: called Aggas that has an AI driven CO2
carbonation that is just mind blowing,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, using CO2 to increase
yields is a no brainer, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, not all people are able to
use CO2 injections because of their
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with this hybrid indoor, it's perfect
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, THC is a 21 carbon molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expensive for the plant to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to provide as much of that
raw ingredient, which is CO2, for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the water out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality of the water and what you're
doing with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is what actually blew my
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first went to Coachillin,
which is where we're at, which is as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as I'm, it's my understanding,
is the largest cannabis complex in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first went there, I had two
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to keep the greenhouses
or the hybrid indoor facilities cool?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the water quality look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And immediately they hand me a water
quality report.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking over and I'm like,
this is cleaner than what we have at East
[SPEAKER_00]: Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, how much do we have?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because we're in a desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't be, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sitting on the second largest
aquifer in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're well, they cap it at a
thousand gallons a minute, but it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: going at 1500 gallons a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's really interesting about that
too, is it's the first, as far as we know,
[SPEAKER_00]: board certified water source for cannabis
in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which basically means that that can't be
tapped into outside of cannabis uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a really unique project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a sincere pleasure working
with the Coachillin team.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are fantastic people, really forward
thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we've seen a lot of cannabis
complexes before.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first got to them, we're like,
okay, this is fundamentally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their inspiration of technology is
right up my alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, integrating AI into building
out the models throughout the campus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And,
you know, it's been a really interesting
project.
