[SPEAKER_02]: Delta 10 THC, there's now a huge thread
regarding that when we had a fun little
[SPEAKER_02]: foray into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laman's background.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those who are familiar with Delta 9,
bring us up to speed on the Delta 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's different and all have their
own special ways of affecting each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But depending on how the different pieces
of the molecule are laid out, the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between THC Delta 9 and THC A
is THC A has a carbolic acid molecule on
[SPEAKER_00]: its tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carboxyl group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing, there's Delta 8 THC
which has gotten really popular with the
[SPEAKER_02]: water clear trend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people would throw a bunch of carbon
and some acids and stuff into their
[SPEAKER_02]: boiling flask and then they'd start
distilling it and it's coming out
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful water clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: They send tests in the labs and then it's
a very low percentage of Delta 9 THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually they got standards for Delta 8
THC, then started quantifying that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: more THC in this there is but then there's
still a little missing piece that like
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd see you know 60 to 70 80%
cannabinoids and this water clear stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that you know is all cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's plenty of isomers and stereo
isomers of THC and these are things that
[SPEAKER_02]: happen through reactions that happen
through heating and the presence of acids
[SPEAKER_02]: and bases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And given the different environmental
things or what was sprayed on those,
[SPEAKER_02]: that can actually be a big indicator in
what's happening in the reactions as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to that distillation method
where like you put stuff in a pot it boils
[SPEAKER_00]: at different temperatures and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well throw a catalyst in that pot that you
don't know is there like you know people
[SPEAKER_00]: spray put sulfur on their plants or people
you know certain things get sprayed on
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and when you concentrate that thing
in a hot flask under vacuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or fires and fire retardants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah there's a whole bunch of ways you can
do that but to go back to Delta 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta 10 is simply an unknown type of THC
that until recently was... Is it also
[SPEAKER_01]: psychoactive?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is Delta 8 also psychoactive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes in different ways they affect all
three of those can affect a single person
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are kind of cannabinoids that
have been only recently discovered?
[SPEAKER_02]: No they've been discovered but they're
only being mass produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mechelon knew about them since the early
90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Mechelon knew and knows about them
and he has and we are just now mass
[SPEAKER_02]: producing them because we have the freedom
of the market to start start playing and
[SPEAKER_02]: we also have the competition in the market
to try to make the clearest most beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: looking oil which you know...
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on a sec, we're talking like water
like that color?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it used to be Delta 8, THC Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying historically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Historically when they first started
getting this perfectly clear bottle of oil
[SPEAKER_00]: it was Delta 8 and they would do this
refluxing... It's carbons and acids and
[SPEAKER_02]: absorbents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would use a catalyst in the flask
that they were boiling in.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're talking about people who
appreciate the clearness, the
[SPEAKER_01]: see-throughness of it is that the consumer
or is that an expert?
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay and what is your opinion on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumers have been led to believe that
the clear the oil is... Well and that
[SPEAKER_00]: clear could come from a lot of different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be cut with another clear oil that
it makes you know just diffuses what color
[SPEAKER_00]: is in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of things that can...
Clarity is definitely an indicator of
[SPEAKER_02]: purity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an indicator.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the slight yellow, amber tint,
these are little atomic level refractions
[SPEAKER_02]: that are happening with chromophores that
hold into the tail end of the molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are chromophores Uncle Noah?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're basically like atomically small
things that will refract light at a
[SPEAKER_02]: different color.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by breaking that bond, when people
distill with certain things in the flask
[SPEAKER_02]: you can break that chromophore bond and
you can also break that bond through
[SPEAKER_02]: chromatography as well which people
eventually developed a method for Delta 9
[SPEAKER_02]: THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be water clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was just a method of taking a
single past distillate and then passing it
[SPEAKER_02]: through a series of usually magnesium
silicate or fluorosil actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: But different color remediating adsorbents
that were also being used to remediate
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticides and they still are used to
remediate pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just happened that you make water
clear Delta 9 after remediating pesticides
[SPEAKER_02]: properly as sometimes depending on the oil
and what kind of color and yeah the
[SPEAKER_02]: condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC 8 and 10 have been known for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're prevalent in the same way that
THC is in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a totally different cannabinoid that
is in very low percentages in some
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so much on the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a reaction through processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not going to have a bunch of
Delta 8 or Delta 10 in your flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have it in a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're isomers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Processing capacity until recently.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the one thing I break through
that allowed for because I think
[SPEAKER_01]: everything we're talking about is like the
ability to narrow the bands of what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: capturing and like so you can completely
like slice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it's funny too because you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's these little slices.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only way that's possible is that
we've now created these massive machine
[SPEAKER_00]: that will process a lot so we get big
bigger trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know we see information come out of
plant material from farms all over
[SPEAKER_00]: California grown differently, grown
different ways, different yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: different strains, different compounds or
the makeup of the cannabinoids in that
[SPEAKER_00]: specific strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get to see a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the same time as we're narrowing the
focus and really like getting the chop
[SPEAKER_00]: down into you know now we just picked up a
machine that will separate out individual
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can collect them individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a centrifugal partitioning
chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: This company called Rhodochron.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so just as I'm trying to catch it,
you guys are like opinion like
[SPEAKER_01]: marathoners.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC 8 and 10 are kind of like minor like
other cannabinoids that we've known about
[SPEAKER_01]: but haven't been able to isolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the market are we going to
eventually see like THC 8 tinctures and
[SPEAKER_01]: THC 10 tinctures in the same way that we
see other kind of minor cannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been seeing mostly, we've been
seeing a lot of THC 8 carts in cartridges
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's subsequently a decent amount
of Delta 10 THC that's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning when I buy a product people are
highlighting the THC 8 levels?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well no they're just calling it if you're
buying a cart off the traditional market
[SPEAKER_00]: you they're saying it's one thing but who
knows what really is in that cartridge
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So but because you can take garbage oil
and by turning by doing this process to
[SPEAKER_00]: convert to Delta 8 clean it up to make it
look clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of guys do that because they can buy
a really cheap oil get a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: fraction of that off and this really nice
looking oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just cheaper the way that it's
produced than like water clear Delta 9.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes extremely expensive absorbance
and a process to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the Delta 8 you throw some activated
carbon in your flask and if you distill
[SPEAKER_02]: right here you can get water clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean there's a few other parameters to
change but you just dump a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: garbage in your flask and then just mix it
with your oil and your oils coming out
[SPEAKER_02]: nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was what a bunch of people were doing
to fix their dark oil especially in the
[SPEAKER_02]: early days when people really weren't
distilling very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
