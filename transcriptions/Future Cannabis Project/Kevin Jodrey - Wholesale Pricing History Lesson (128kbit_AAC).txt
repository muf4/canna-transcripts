[SPEAKER_00]: The comeback of the traditional market
prices in California and how that's
[SPEAKER_00]: impacting the industry as a whole,
both the regulated industry and the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional industry, also known as the
black market industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pricing has been a roller coaster ride
in the last few years, and it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: been a long roller coaster ride over the
last couple of decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you talk a bit about pricing and
how you've seen it change?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, pricing never recovered from the
2008 financial crisis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the financial crisis of 2008,
when we lost all the homes, prices went,
[SPEAKER_01]: at that point they were right,
you know, indoor, good outdoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: 39, 41.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as soon as the crash happened,
all these individuals across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: that had upside down mortgages suddenly
started to cultivate in these homes
[SPEAKER_01]: because they didn't want to lose their
homes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of a sudden people who were really
anti-cannabis became very pro-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over a 20-month period, prices went
from 39 to 19.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we dropped $2,000 over 20 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they came back up around 22,
24 at home for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we lost almost, you know, half the
value.
[SPEAKER_01]: From 2008 to 2010, half the value of
cannabis was wiped out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the peak of five to six
grand back-rated camp era, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 84, 85, 86.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get into the 90s and it's holding heavy
at 40, you know, that high 40s.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get into the 2015 era when all of a
sudden people could start to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prices came down because more people could
cultivate in general, but you had more
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had a lot more different products
coming up because many people could
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivate and move it into dispensaries,
could get it into stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you started to see a lot more different
stuff moving about and different things,
[SPEAKER_01]: health prices and small quantities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it goes into the 2008 crisis that
drops us down by half again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're in the twos.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get into post or pre-legalization and
pounds were stacking up like cordwood
[SPEAKER_01]: because everybody was producing two or
3,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people talk about how legalization
wiped out the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, they wiped it out through lack
of enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always believed that lack of
enforcement was a complete strategy to
[SPEAKER_01]: de-capitalize the cultivator so that by
the time legalization happened,
[SPEAKER_01]: there would be no money left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I remember three years ago that I
was going to see, I'd go to visit friends
[SPEAKER_01]: and then literally be 2,000 pounds stacked
up in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I've never seen that in my
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, that's a ton in your living
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because nobody could move anything and
everything was cheap, pounds were 400
[SPEAKER_01]: bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a couple of years back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the legal pounds had plummeted in value
because there was so many of them because
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody was punching out 10,000,
20,000 square foot outdoor illegal grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just what happened was we
overproduced and with no enforcement,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis isn't valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is valuable when there's
enforcement, otherwise you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes, you're growing an ag crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do it correctly, then you can
pretty much succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when everybody is able to do this,
prices have, they have nothing to do but
[SPEAKER_01]: fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So prices fall and then legalization comes
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm still a proponent of legalization
because to me, as someone who was in
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis for as many years as I
was, I saw too many people come into
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis too late to fight for their
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: That the shame and the stigma prevented
them from getting into cannabis therapy
[SPEAKER_01]: quick enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I watched too many people wither and
die in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just said, listen, legalization has
to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to end up having all these
people continue this process?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my financial stability is less
important than your daughter who can't get
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis medicine and she has epilepsy
that gives her, you know, 60, 60 tremors a
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just believe that still.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew that it was going to be tough to
do what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But California did such a screw up job
with the rollout of the regulations,
[SPEAKER_01]: primarily with stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had 12,000 outlets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you have 700 outlets and who knows how
many we're going to lose over the next
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of months with permitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of a sudden you lose a tremendous
amount of your outlet to move product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is also compounded by many of the
stores or verticals are connected to their
[SPEAKER_01]: own production facilities too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really how many stores do you really
have in the state of California to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that many.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you have more distributors and you
do stores and the ability for the farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: to get product through the system quick
enough to get in there creates a situation
[SPEAKER_01]: where financially you're, you get
hammered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now I want to say what's,
if we look at Oregon, Oregon's the best
[SPEAKER_01]: model to look at because really it
reflects what we're going to do here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you're looking at eight dollar
eights, $60 ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people will be saying, well,
people want to pay for quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody's driving a Ferrari outside
here right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a Chevrolet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pay for what you can afford.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people don't realize that we're
consuming so much caustic crappy material
[SPEAKER_01]: as food, knowingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That if you think they're all caught up in
your pesticides and your cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: then why Black Market sells so strong for
so long?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody required any testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some states don't even test legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington doesn't test pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: In illegal cannabis, no pesticide testing
in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't catch people all the time
through third party labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bottom line is that it's that something
that we get caught up on here in
[SPEAKER_01]: California because it's so highly
regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the truth is if I drop the price,
it'll sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Black Market isn't all that
lucrative either because ultimately,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially here in Humboldt, you got
satellite imagery flying up and down on
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got electrical monitoring
occurring left and right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have... What do you mean by
electrical monitoring?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you pay over $10,000 a year to the PG&E
in cash in any form over the whole fiscal
[SPEAKER_01]: year, they report that to the IRS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So PG&E now works with the IRS.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the indoor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for all indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with Humboldt County,
three satellites flying over to top you
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time, they're doing a pretty good
job at picking up these grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes it difficult for people to
produce product in any form that works
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The product that you're seeing moving into
the system, I don't think is coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: the Black Market traditionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming from people who got permits
that they can then say, hey, I lost half
[SPEAKER_01]: my farm to mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that I harvested 400 pounds,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I harvested 700.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the farmers are basically having to
stick weed into the old traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: markets in the Black Market, whatever you
want to call it nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can actually stay alive because
the cost of the permitting was so
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have the issue of no stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the issue of too many
distributors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the issue of CEQA, which is what
people didn't realize is that you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: have this environmental control because
otherwise at state level projects,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to have this certificate of
environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Humboldt went the hardest on the whole
state on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also because we have the most
environmentalists that were willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: file suit if it wasn't pushed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you have is you have a situation
where you have multiple groups fighting
[SPEAKER_01]: over what should occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, by the time you're
done as a farmer, you've already lost a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple years worth of money in terms of
it'll take you years of sales to recover
[SPEAKER_01]: the cost of the investment to build the
farm to legal standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know farmers that are excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're moving products and like,
man, I sold 124 eighths.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sold a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got another 400 to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the outdoor pounds I see are just
getting into the system now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at outdoor pounds that are
hitting the market right now in legal that
[SPEAKER_01]: were harvested last October.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the delay from you cutting it to
you getting it to the testing lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: to get it into manufacturing processing,
to get it to the distributor, to get it to
[SPEAKER_01]: the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to get your money back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so most of the farmers are forced to
fight for their lives financially and
[SPEAKER_01]: utilize the old traditional market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the traditional market isn't booming
money either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, like right now, outdoor from
last year, 800, if it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go indoor right now anywhere from
like 12 to 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: They figured that the depths this year
should pull around 18 is like the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all traditional market money,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They figure that the depths ought to come
in around 18 because there's a shortage of
[SPEAKER_01]: specific things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Though the OG packs are diminished.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go to LA, OG is not hot in
colonial form because it's overproduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it depends what region you're in
and what you're moving and where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: moving it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bottom line is you're still
working on some low price products and
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear people are getting 24 for some
indoor and I know that there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: varietals from some certain companies that
move at 334.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those companies are big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they have is they have the
vertical model pretty much under control
[SPEAKER_01]: to where when it leaves their grow,
it goes right through their supply chain
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have the ability to barter
with the stores to get shelf space because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're highly branded and have all the
push.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it allows them to build a really
different model than any of the local
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most people, when you say farmer,
to me that means owner or operator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody else to me, I don't call them
farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call them commercial industrialists
because that's what you're using is a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial industrial agricultural model
where they control the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that control the supply chain lets
them get their product to the store
[SPEAKER_01]: quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lets the product be better in the jar
than ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to wait so many months to get
anything in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing pre-rolls, God help you if
those things sit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because by the time you open them up,
they're schwag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about for traditional market versus
regulated market in outdoor, in February,
[SPEAKER_00]: prices in the traditional market seem to
start going up again from that low that
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd been at.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did.
[SPEAKER_01]: They rose up to like eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went from like five to eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even higher, I've heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depends on what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depends on what it is and how good it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still pretty low for farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally, but it's better than zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was at four a couple years back.
[SPEAKER_01]: The prices that are going by the time you
are done getting paid after all your
[SPEAKER_01]: costs, at least through the supply chain,
some of the outdoor units are going six to
[SPEAKER_01]: six to eight hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's through normal markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you have to add in your
permitting costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the time you're done, regulated
market prices have been low compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: what farmers want based on how much
they've invested in the permitting costs
[SPEAKER_00]: without the ability to get loans or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meanwhile, the traditional market,
I've heard some farmers have gotten,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a thousand to even twelve
hundred this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're in that period of the season
where there's a shortage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you have to is that regardless,
customers make the decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were surprised that there would be
a shortage because there's been all this
[SPEAKER_00]: talk of oversupply, but all the heavy
regulation has made a lot of farmers quit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has, but that's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as the cannabis industry wasn't
built for the farmer, it was built for tax
[SPEAKER_01]: collection like all industries are.
[SPEAKER_01]: All industries are based off of how much
money can be derived from tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: So America favors three companies paying
the billion dollars in tax versus three
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred thousand companies creating a
billion dollars in tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you had looked at the economy of
the nation prior to this, you would have
[SPEAKER_01]: said, I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how this works.
[SPEAKER_01]: The customer doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care about how much money it
took you to get your permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go to the store and you go buy
food, do you go and get a hold of the
[SPEAKER_01]: company and say, how much did you have to
spend to make this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm going to pay you more.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you want the damn product for free and
you pay the minimal if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that for me, I'm seeing,
you know, like I said, eight to twelve is
[SPEAKER_01]: in normal up to up to maybe 18 for the
depths this year will come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's on the traditional, the regulated
market is less because for most of the sun
[SPEAKER_01]: growing groups, they don't have
distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you get into some of the
distributors that can distribute the sun
[SPEAKER_01]: grown, they have to take a chunk of that
money to make their money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by the time you're done,
what do you really make in per unit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone asked me, I'll give you an
example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have I have a half acre canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so someone said, what are you going to
do this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I'm probably going to grow crude
because it'll allow me at least just to
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivate and then get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I realized that by the time I was
done paying the excise for the acreage,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I was done paying for the
distribution costs, but the done paying
[SPEAKER_01]: the processing manufacturing costs have to
pay all the labor to create the product in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of the workers for the whole season.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized that if I just paid him the
thirteen five for the for the state permit
[SPEAKER_01]: and I paid him the twenty five hundred for
the water board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's fifteen grand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost fifteen grand on getting the
permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it didn't grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do financially better than if I
grew it and went through the whole process
[SPEAKER_01]: and had to play the game in October,
November, December, because when exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: will I get my money back?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to come out the pocket every
dollar I have left in my life so that I
[SPEAKER_01]: can maybe make it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather come out the pocket fifteen
grand, which is still too damn much to
[SPEAKER_01]: have to give out right now than have to
come out the pocket one hundred grand
[SPEAKER_01]: minimum to get this project through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without having to do diversion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, I would rather believe the
money on the permit in the short term than
[SPEAKER_01]: risk the diversion on the farm,
because fundamentally, the amount of money
[SPEAKER_01]: I have in the farm makes it to where if I
get caught, I lose that permit permits you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't get again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a liquor license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to have to figure out how
to hold it because right now, someone
[SPEAKER_01]: underage kids at the school doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how that's how I I'm looking at
it myself, where when you run the numbers,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is almost no real money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so most farmers are almost forced to
go back into the old markets to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: stay active.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, I would rather go get a job
and which I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking on more work than normal and
consulting so that it allows me then just
[SPEAKER_01]: to take the money I make and consult them
to keep the farm alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
