[SPEAKER_08]: We sound on a survey to licensed operators
all across the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_08]: We asked them feedback on specific
questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: We asked for their comments and we largely
based all those replies that we received
[SPEAKER_08]: and put them into these questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, there's about 15
questions that we sort of got in mind from
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we have time, we'll definitely you
know, do some QA if we can.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they're pretty dense and meaty
subjects, so I think we can just like go
[SPEAKER_08]: through and have a good time with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone cool?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, that's how we're gonna do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But first, all right, so Lori,
thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really a pleasure to have you here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if everyone knows,
but Lori's husband had a huge milestone
[SPEAKER_08]: yesterday.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a huge celebration and she drove up
for this event while something is going on
[SPEAKER_08]: with family and everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it means a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're like, come on, Lori, please say yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: So last time we were here, we were in the
amphitheater over there, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if everyone remembers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I kind of wanted to just take a moment
and retrace what we've been through in the
[SPEAKER_08]: last year.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think you guys are all gonna get a
kick out of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So right after we left last year,
we had July one and if everyone remembers
[SPEAKER_08]: July one, there was a lab testing and
packaging requirements and the destruction
[SPEAKER_08]: of products.
[SPEAKER_08]: That wasn't really fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had emergency regulations, number two,
and then public comment period.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had the regulations when we submitted
it to the OAL and waiting in that
[SPEAKER_08]: timeframe.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had in parallel temporary application
process and annual application process.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you had a trickling of
provisionals that went out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Temps you extended, but then we had to
legislate to get permission to provide
[SPEAKER_08]: extensions while processing applications
or not.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know if anyone knows this,
but Lori's team, definitely in December,
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember you saying on stage,
you're like, we will process every single
[SPEAKER_08]: application.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you guys did.
[SPEAKER_08]: You were working through the holidays.
[SPEAKER_08]: You were working weekends, you were
working nights, your entire team,
[SPEAKER_08]: and you finished the entire queue,
which I thought was really admirable and
[SPEAKER_08]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for doing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it brings us to 2019, where the
writing on the wall that CDFA and CDPH
[SPEAKER_08]: weren't actually allowed to give
extensions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then that led us to a round of
licensing attrition from temporaries to
[SPEAKER_08]: nothing, or temporaries to provisionals
and enables.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we have the new legislation that's
being pushed around sampling, white
[SPEAKER_08]: labeling, non-licensing, all this other
stuff that's going through.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then about last month, the agency BCCs
are pushing out provisionals.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also the $10 million equity grant
money was announced on a registration
[SPEAKER_08]: process, but then put on hold.
[SPEAKER_08]: Guys, that was just like a high level of
last year.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, does it feel like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we've had a lot of wins, and these
come directly from the survey responses.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis is legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: People are not going to jail.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have clean medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe a little too clean, but a little too
clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the medals maybe a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: We could accept a little bit more medals.
[SPEAKER_08]: Deliveries are allowed everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're not restricting access to
Californias and local governments who
[SPEAKER_08]: enacted a ban, which is huge.
[SPEAKER_08]: And credit to your group.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've advocated for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You stood for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And without your support and your fight,
I doubt we would have had statewide
[SPEAKER_08]: delivery.
[SPEAKER_08]: So kudos to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Issuing temp licenses.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for extending it and giving
people time to catch up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Transparency for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's interesting, social equity is more
of a focus than ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: From last year to this year, that is a
driving point in many of the conversations
[SPEAKER_08]: we're having.
[SPEAKER_08]: After some setbacks, the compassion
program is being reconsidered.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's great for compassion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Event licensing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were having more events.
[SPEAKER_08]: Provisional licensing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just in time for Meadowlands,
the Q&A database.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah!
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah!
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew I'd be in trouble if I didn't have
that ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, I made it by the wire, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for doing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I can't tell you how many
questions that we all, even this weekend,
[SPEAKER_08]: share.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to have a legitimate source that's
saying, hey, this is the answer.
[SPEAKER_08]: No misinformation.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can go to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for making that happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew I'd be in trouble if you would ask.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, we got to get this done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my team did a great job.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're just going to keep adding to it,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are a lot of the questions that
we're answering by email.
[SPEAKER_04]: And instead of just going to one person,
we're just going to share it all with you
[SPEAKER_04]: folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be helpful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: For the consultants that make money on
just that piece.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: But let's tackle some other things and
help each other out.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was like, well, I mean,
that's a lot, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Any thoughts on the wins or the past?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been brutal.
[SPEAKER_04]: For you guys, too, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the last year, 2018 is like a
blur.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I almost forget some of the things
until you mention them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will say this.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a lot of you don't know either is
that the first four months of 2019 we were
[SPEAKER_04]: statutorily mandated to have a Department
of Finance audit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for four months, we had about eight
auditors looking at everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'll be coming out on July 1st.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to report it to the legislature.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's something you might want to keep
an eye out for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you go through audits, too?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a report card.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys got me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw your report card.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, oh, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, yeah, everybody's.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kat Packer was here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And she's like, at least we don't have to
go through everything that we just went
[SPEAKER_08]: through again.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if anything, everything that we did go
through hopefully has made us more
[SPEAKER_08]: resilient and knowledgeable about the
process and kind of what we need to do to
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of continue to navigate and move
ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's dive in here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the journey is largely focused on
creating a successful, regulated supply
[SPEAKER_08]: chain for the largest cannabis market in
the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a tough job.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the last year, we've taken both steps
forward.
[SPEAKER_08]: And backward.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you need in terms of support to
realize your vision of a successful supply
[SPEAKER_08]: chain currently?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that when we talk about big
businesses, medium sized, small
[SPEAKER_04]: businesses, we want a little bit of
everything, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things in the statute,
when you have full vertical integration,
[SPEAKER_04]: it does make it difficult to strike that
balance because the big guys can hold
[SPEAKER_04]: every license.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so can the small guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that gets tough.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think for the state of California,
we really have to look at the small
[SPEAKER_04]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how do we make the new businesses
coming up?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we make them successful?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know that we've struck that
balance yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think our regulations are hard for new
businesses starting out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, when I say what kind of
support we need, well, and I think for one
[SPEAKER_04]: thing, you guys are a big voice in that is
we need more enforcement on the unlicensed
[SPEAKER_04]: market.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't ever expect you to make it if
you're going to continue to compete in
[SPEAKER_04]: this market with an unregulated,
unlicensed market that, frankly,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a lot of you know, some of them
are trying to get a license, but there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: good chunk of them that have no intention
of getting a license.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're almost saying, hey, we're just
going to wait till somebody says something
[SPEAKER_04]: or do something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for us at the Bureau, I talked to
my staff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I say this and I don't take it
lightly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a fight every single day.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I see the industry, your voice,
I think means a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to continue to say, hey, we need more
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need more to go out and make sure that
we can compete in this market.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think enforcement is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it touches so many of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm hoping over this, I just want to
crush the illegal market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't usually see you say that out
loud, but I feel the same way you do
[SPEAKER_04]: because we didn't work, go through all
this for the last few years to have this
[SPEAKER_04]: market be undermined for people that don't
want to get in the licensed market.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we feel it personal too because you
don't want to sacrifice all we sacrifice
[SPEAKER_04]: to see basically people just say,
well, we're not going to get involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just going to, you know,
not get licensed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not fair to all of you here that are
licensed paying all your fees and taxes,
so.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, to summarize more like
having an ability for small businesses to
[SPEAKER_08]: compete and going after enforcement in a
way where the illicit market does not
[SPEAKER_08]: exist and we can continue to thrive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one more thing, I had a conversation,
I don't know, Maya's here.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_04]: She asked me a question and she is a
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the hardest thing for us, like when
Alex and Andre from my team is here,
[SPEAKER_04]: when people come to me and say,
hey, you know, something happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to relabel all our product.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be nice if we could do something
a different way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have to say, well, we don't regulate
the manufacturers at the BCC.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to go to another agency.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really hard to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have to deal with three different
licensing agency and that's not including
[SPEAKER_04]: all the other agencies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I want to solve problems,
but it's hard when some problems that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: difficult to solve because it doesn't fall
under our authority.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think we need to find better ways
to collaborate with ourselves at the
[SPEAKER_04]: state.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we just make one agency and put you
guys on top of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we do that?
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess we have to look into that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that ballot?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_08]: But like, but what you're saying is that
there's just so much inter agency work
[SPEAKER_08]: that doesn't make it through.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we got to really think about that
going forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: And but I want to I'm committed to we got
to have better communication.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to tell you if sometimes it's
hard for me to get an answer from other
[SPEAKER_04]: state agencies, I can only imagine what it
is for the industry.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so so we've got to do better there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we're going to concentrate on
that, that we got to have consistency
[SPEAKER_04]: between the agencies and be responsive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you guys know we we want to
hear from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We really do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want your feedback.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we know there's I mean, you just
mentioned it like lab testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we need to relax a little on the
heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think I think lab testing is very
important.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we all think that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But where's where again, where's the
balance?
[SPEAKER_04]: And do we need to look at those things?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what's interesting and
specifically the labs, it was you look at
[SPEAKER_08]: other states and their lab testing
requirements.
[SPEAKER_08]: California is pretty stringent.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you're failing on something where
other states, it's OK, and you're failing
[SPEAKER_08]: by, you know, point one or whatever,
it's it's detrimental to these operators.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a huge setback.
[SPEAKER_08]: So last year, we asked you if you had a
North Star metric.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think you were at the time just
saying, well, there is a lot of change.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very difficult to have a North Star
metric.
[SPEAKER_08]: Processing as many licenses was a metric.
[SPEAKER_08]: Currently, is there a North Star metric
for 2019 for the BCC?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as you know, we're our metric is
like the end of July right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to we have about 18 hundred
temporaries that are expiring.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and getting a provisional.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting a provisional.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want any gap in licensure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am my my staff understands.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want anybody expiring.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody is expiring.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to get you in a provisional.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if that means we got to call you on
Sunday morning and we're hoping we're
[SPEAKER_04]: calling you on Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you make that happen for CDFA and
CDPH?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I just wish that was shared across
all agencies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a short term metric.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just but that is the direction we say.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't I mean, I don't want anybody
slipping through the cracks.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we also don't want you staying in a
provisional.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to get those annuals out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's important for a lot of
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like the word temporary or
provisional.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the word annual because that means
you're here to stay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's that's a big I mean,
obviously still going, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: working on that enforcement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just so you know, we're looking
at we're we're already starting to rewrite
[SPEAKER_04]: some of our regulations where we have
there's a lot of things we need to correct
[SPEAKER_04]: where there's a lot of things we need to
clarify.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's not this is no time to say,
hey, you know, you're stuck with the regs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if you have feedback, if things
that you think aren't working now is the
[SPEAKER_04]: time to start telling us, hey,
take a look at this or that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and depending on what happens with
legislation, you're probably going to see
[SPEAKER_04]: a regulation package, at least clean up
and clarification and new legislation
[SPEAKER_04]: towards the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: You are busy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, BCC is a really tough job.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can only imagine what you and your
department has to go through because not
[SPEAKER_08]: only processing applications, going to
these meetings, talking to all these
[SPEAKER_08]: agencies, you're hiring more staff,
you're integrating them into the process.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're talking to multiple stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those stakeholders often are changing to
try to keep track of everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it can get I don't know,
it can get easy just to just like,
[SPEAKER_08]: all right, maybe this is too much.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, what is motivating you to
continue to show up at everything,
[SPEAKER_08]: participate, keep pushing forward,
still having a positive attitude about
[SPEAKER_08]: everything?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, I'm just curious about
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's many times when I it is
overwhelming and you do get down,
[SPEAKER_04]: you see we see the struggles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the hardest part right now is
because we do most of my staff,
[SPEAKER_04]: we take it personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And normally when you're a regulator,
you don't get that kind of emotion.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't like to see people struggling
to just survive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think what motivates me is I think
there's there's more we can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not enough that we I think I've
always said this is not enough just to put
[SPEAKER_04]: in regulations and say, oh, we got our
final regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our work is done.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like my work is quite not done.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to make things better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to leave it in a better place for
those who come after me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I don't want to see so many people
hurting and painful because if anything
[SPEAKER_04]: you guys have taught me, cannabis isn't
supposed to be that and it shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Last November, we elected Governor Newsom,
who was part of the Blue Ribbon Campaign.
[SPEAKER_08]: On actually moving 64 forward.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he helped design the framework and you
were tasked with implementing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now he's seeing that implementation
process.
[SPEAKER_08]: He has been more aware of what's going on
in the industry, is more connected,
[SPEAKER_08]: and has also hired advisors like Nicole
Elliott, who is head of office of cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: in San Francisco, who was here yesterday
to his administration.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your relationship with Governor
Newsom's office and how have things
[SPEAKER_08]: changed from working with Governor Brown?
[SPEAKER_08]: What are their priorities and specifically
how does your mandate changed?
[SPEAKER_04]: So Governor Newsom's office has been
actually really responsive.
[SPEAKER_04]: They really understand the issues and I
think a lot of that came from him being so
[SPEAKER_04]: involved with the Blue Ribbon Commission.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nicole Elliott came on just a few months
ago and she's just hit the ground running
[SPEAKER_04]: and she really has a good overview of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is nice that we have somebody
directly in the administration that we can
[SPEAKER_04]: go to when we do have issues that come up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for us, that's been huge for us and we
have a really good relationship with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm really looking forward to the next
year because I think together,
[SPEAKER_04]: again, there's only so much the Bureau can
do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So having someone like her on our side,
it really helps.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the administration that actually wants
to move forward and push compassion and
[SPEAKER_08]: all these other things.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's really key.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm gonna have you play doctor for a
moment.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we, as part of the survey, collected
data points and basically said to measure
[SPEAKER_08]: the overall health of the industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have some vitals here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And based off of these vitals,
love to give your thoughts on the
[SPEAKER_08]: diagnosis of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we had five questions here and they go
from scale of one to five.
[SPEAKER_08]: One poor, five great.
[SPEAKER_08]: How would you rate the transition?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so these people just marked off
between one to five.
[SPEAKER_08]: How would you rate the transition to
current regs?
[SPEAKER_08]: Two thirds rated it one or two.
[SPEAKER_08]: How would you rate the metric rollout so
far?
[SPEAKER_08]: 70% rated it a one or two.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you more or less profitable than you
were last year?
[SPEAKER_08]: 53% are less profitable.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you hiring?
[SPEAKER_08]: One third is hiring, two thirds are
frozen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you believe California has created an
environment in which small cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: businesses can succeed?
[SPEAKER_08]: 95% said no.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are the same questions we asked
last year, but of stark difference in just
[SPEAKER_08]: the financial.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I'm not gonna be the doctor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the vitals.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think, doctor?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's sort of terrifying,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: When you see that, I felt like that's not
a very good report card.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know how long I'd be a doctor
with those stats, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's definitely alarming.
[SPEAKER_08]: But to your point on what success looks
like, getting those numbers up will tie
[SPEAKER_08]: into helping a lot of the operators here
that are going through that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And your commitment on doing the Q&A and
all this stuff, it's just like we're gonna
[SPEAKER_08]: have to attack it from a lot of different
angles.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is on the inter-agency one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we need a task force or commission with
representatives from the BCC, Food and Ag,
[SPEAKER_08]: Public Health, Tax and Fee Administration
to facilitate inter-agency communication?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that something that BCC should
quarterback?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it goes back to what I said about
coordination.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I think that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who came up with that?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just putting some ideas out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys have got a lot accomplished this
weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a lot accomplished.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been talking a lot and getting
feedback from everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what you guys, I mean,
I think that your idea is, I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: the state certainly, you guys figured this
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have the market on all the good
ideas.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a lot of good ideas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we work for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're paying your taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're paying your licensing fees.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of this stuff is good to demand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, hey, we need better
inter-coordination.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about putting a task force?
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually like that idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm in favor of something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about quarterbacking it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what the heck?
[SPEAKER_04]: Every team needs a quarterback.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's better than being the doctor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't want to be the doctor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I could have some better stats as a
quarterback.
[SPEAKER_08]: Doctor's tough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this relates to metric.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, 70% is related to one or
two.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, not a lot of people have had
access to it yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that data is a little skewed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our experience at Meadow has been pretty
interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, our engineers had no access to
the UI.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had to build pretty much in the dark on
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And metric's not that user-friendly.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little bit slow.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's prone.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really prone to human error.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't know the system intuitively,
it's there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's pretty cumbersome to account for,
especially when you're building software
[SPEAKER_08]: to integrate something that's there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also have found a lot of artifacts
from other states that weren't
[SPEAKER_08]: California-specific as we were going
through.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, one thing that we're seeing
is once you get access to metric,
[SPEAKER_08]: you have to order your tags.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then once you get your tags,
you have to put your inventory in,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: But the clock starts 30 days from the time
you have your training, not 30 days after
[SPEAKER_08]: you get your tags, which I think is where
you basically lose two, three weeks of
[SPEAKER_08]: getting the inventory in.
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are just some of our experiences.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your experience with BCC?
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the feedback there you're getting
from licenses?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this working the way you expected to?
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's not under your purview and
control.
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, I feel it would be in a better
position.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, but here you're it's a big
thing that's coming.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we're experiencing some of the
same things you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're seeing as it relates to even our
license types, like micro businesses,
[SPEAKER_04]: for example, it's very difficult if you're
a micro business manufacturer,
[SPEAKER_04]: distribution and retail, how that looks in
metric that really wasn't accounted for
[SPEAKER_04]: very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for a lot of us at BCC, we probably
got a look at the system around the same
[SPEAKER_04]: just recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't have access to the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were relying on another agency to
sort of navigate our regs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're finding we need to we're already
asking for changes from metric because I
[SPEAKER_04]: don't feel it's intuitive now.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least we get on there and we're like,
I can only imagine that if you're having
[SPEAKER_04]: to do this every day, you really do almost
have to have someone that understands the
system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hire someone specifically just to do
metrics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we need to make improvements
there and to like you were saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like the rollout probably wasn't
as, you know, it didn't go as well as we
[SPEAKER_04]: thought it would.
[SPEAKER_04]: For us, we know, like I don't even know if
it was a good idea telling you guys that
[SPEAKER_04]: you have to put all your inventory that
our regs say that you put all your
[SPEAKER_04]: inventory and we're unfortunately,
if I think if we knew understood metric
[SPEAKER_04]: and how it worked better last year because
we didn't have access to the system,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think we would have asked you guys
to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the things we're doing is if
some of you are retailers or distributors,
[SPEAKER_04]: we've actually turned off your ability to
get tags because we want to reach out to
[SPEAKER_04]: you first so we can explain what we expect
because we had retailers asking for like
[SPEAKER_04]: 50,000 tags because they planned on
tagging every single product and we've
[SPEAKER_04]: saying no, we don't want you to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just want you to tag one like candy bar
and say, Hey, we've got 5,000 units of
[SPEAKER_04]: candy bar instead of doing everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've been trying to like, yeah,
we've seen that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fix that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're not spending so much time at
the, the, at the beginning, trying to log
[SPEAKER_04]: your inventory.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're learning right there with
you, which you probably won't really,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's sort of scary, but what we are
finding is that it's taken up a lot of our
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're, we're pulling from
positions.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's, it's, it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got one full time person.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm, I'm bringing in a whole unit just on
the BCC side to deal with the questions
[SPEAKER_04]: and the issues and what we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, you're going to see from us in the
next coming months, putting more resources
[SPEAKER_04]: to help you guys, because I think that is
our job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, this is the state system.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to help you navigate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that means we, we've found that even
with BCC, we have to have the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the folks on our side that understand
metric too well, so we can walk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I, we're not, we're not,
I don't know that going to metric is the
[SPEAKER_04]: answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to have the answers for you and
walk you through the process.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we'll get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, but I want you to know on the BCC side,
um, we're not, I mean, as much as we say,
[SPEAKER_04]: you got to have that inventory or tags
order, you know, we're very flexible on
[SPEAKER_04]: those timelines in our regulations period.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are very flexible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, one thing that, uh, has recently
happened with metric trouble here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are like, but anyway,
I just want you to know, we also want to
[SPEAKER_04]: get you credentialed trouble.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're just, I think we're just
like, we agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're happy.
[SPEAKER_08]: This makes us happy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at you smiling faces.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, everyone's happy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, metric recently opened its additives
API, uh, based on a request from the
[SPEAKER_08]: state.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, how are requests from the state to
metric handled and prioritized?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there going to go, are there going to
be any metric user groups where people in
[SPEAKER_08]: the industry can weigh in on feature and
API prioritization?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That I think, uh, if you leave here today
and you go back and go to CDFA and metric
[SPEAKER_04]: and say that, I think that would be great
because here's the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so we, we've asked for a few things
too, like one, I don't know if any of you
[SPEAKER_04]: knew this, but the certificate of analysis
that the labs fill out, there was no
[SPEAKER_04]: ability for them to upload that system.
[SPEAKER_04]: You knew that for every C I don't know if
there's any lab folks here, but if you're,
[SPEAKER_04]: you would have to go through for every
test and write, right, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: click, you know, pass, fail, pass,
fail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we did, we are having that change.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can, you're going to get your
results faster, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just upload it and store it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those, that's just one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, we, like, again, we've had some
issues with the distributor one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So of course, when you're BCC,
we want to say we're top priority,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But then public health may have a priority
and food and ag may have a priority.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it gets very difficult when the three
of us are trying to prioritize cause we
[SPEAKER_04]: all think that's a priority.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the answer is, and you guys are
brilliant here is the industry prioritize
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's affecting you the most?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we need to work on first and what
can wait?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's, you got, you're onto
something there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we've actually organized or
self-organized in a lot of the trade
[SPEAKER_08]: organizations.
[SPEAKER_08]: Track and trace groups, um, you know,
for the cannabis distribution association,
[SPEAKER_08]: we have a weekly meeting on metric calls,
uh, where we're just troubleshooting and
[SPEAKER_08]: providing advice and saying, Hey,
this is what you should do here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, recently the transfer API,
uh, is open if you request it,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is really important.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you think about the transfer API before
that, you had to create everything within
[SPEAKER_08]: the system and now I can, can use it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but a lot of this stuff isn't being
published.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you don't know unless you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I, I really encourage everyone to get
engaged with their, um, their associations
[SPEAKER_08]: and the, uh, the regulatory bodies to,
to really get a handle on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause there are a lot of nuances here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but I'm glad that you, you share the
pain of metric do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we all, if you're,
if we're not putting good data in the
[SPEAKER_04]: system, then what use is metric,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we, we have to, right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, uh, switching gears, what does,
what does social equity mean to you?
[SPEAKER_08]: What does a successful equity program look
like?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I, I don't know that I know what a
successful program looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause apparently we put one out and then
we took it back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're working on it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had to think about it a little bit
more, which isn't a bad thing by the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's always, you know,
it's always good to be able to,
[SPEAKER_04]: to, to look at something and say,
Hey, maybe we didn't really hit the mark
[SPEAKER_04]: on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's pull it back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, I think for, um, for us at the
Bureau, um, I think it goes back to
[SPEAKER_04]: struggles and, um, who are the pioneers
with this product and getting legalization
[SPEAKER_04]: and are they sitting at the table?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's making sure that it's
open for anybody that wants to get a
[SPEAKER_04]: license or be in a business or be employed
by a business and cannabis that it is a
[SPEAKER_04]: very positive experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, you don't want anybody left
behind.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not, we're not arrested.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not arresting people like we used
to, but that, I don't think that's enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to, as a state, uh, we need to
bring, be more inclusive and bring those
[SPEAKER_04]: that were really the ones that were most
affected by the war on drugs into the
[SPEAKER_04]: system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I think we're still navigating
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think you're seeing a commitment on
the administration because not only do we
[SPEAKER_04]: have the 10 million, now we have the 15
million and you know, I, I think that
[SPEAKER_04]: conversation and, and it has, has people
are talking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, and I know money doesn't solve
everything, but it sure does help because
[SPEAKER_04]: one of the things we even putting out our
equity application in the month of March,
[SPEAKER_04]: we were seeing jurisdictions passing
equity ordinances at like a, like a real
[SPEAKER_04]: tremendous rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, wow, they, they made this
happen pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that was a good thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that, that was what sort of
triggered we're going to need more money.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of jurisdictions out there
that are putting social equity,
[SPEAKER_04]: um, making it a priority.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm happy that we're part of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're still trying to figure out
what is a successful equity program,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I think you're going to see some front
runners coming up, um, from some of these
[SPEAKER_04]: cities that have been doing it for,
uh, for, for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you're going to see,
and I'm hoping by, you know, we'll get
[SPEAKER_04]: that money out because I think the
important thing, it's one thing to wave
[SPEAKER_04]: money around, but you got to get it in the
hands, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to get in your hands because you
guys can't wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we get that.
So.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, actually it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Marissa and Kat and Joe and Nicole
yesterday, they mentioned something about,
[SPEAKER_08]: they had to go through all these hoops and
setting up their social equity programs at
[SPEAKER_08]: the entire structure.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were thinking about trying to not
so much open source, but create
[SPEAKER_08]: documentation and process and help other
counties and cities stage up these
[SPEAKER_08]: programs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when it comes to social equity,
um, a more homogenous, uh, system
[SPEAKER_08]: throughout the state, which, you know,
allows, you know, makes it more
[SPEAKER_08]: frictionless.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, one thing that we've been
seeing that's alarming though is how do
[SPEAKER_08]: you prevent equity programs from being
taken advantage of by predatory actors,
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, who are not intended beneficiaries of
these licenses?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think anytime, uh, the state is giving
money to the city and county, it's our
[SPEAKER_04]: responsibility to make sure that money is
being used appropriately and that we are
[SPEAKER_04]: monitoring things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that we're always going to be
able to catch that, but, uh, I think for
[SPEAKER_04]: the most part, I think we will have a good
system in place that we can at least audit
[SPEAKER_04]: and make sure, you know, it's going to who
it should be going to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I think we rely, you know,
like anything like complaints or anything,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we rely a lot on the industry to
bring that information forward to us.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, taxes.
[SPEAKER_08]: It should be no surprise that taxes are a
major point in contention for licensees up
[SPEAKER_08]: and down the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_08]: When there have been opportunities for
reprieve from these taxes, the attempts at
[SPEAKER_08]: reform seem to consistently fail.
[SPEAKER_08]: In a recent example, Bonta's bill AB 286
would have put a pause in the cultivation
[SPEAKER_08]: tax and given a one year reprieve to
farmers to show that decrease in taxes
[SPEAKER_08]: would lead to an increase overall.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, in your opinion, you know,
what's the state of taxes?
[SPEAKER_08]: Why aren't we moving forward on lowering
it or, you know, why are we, what are you
[SPEAKER_08]: thinking on?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we on taxes?
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's not under your, but just,
just opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think it's like, you know,
I mean, taxes is not a, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's not a popular term really.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you think taxes, you think
negatively, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, I think when you have different tax
structures, uh, from the state and then
[SPEAKER_04]: your local, local jurisdiction has a
different tax rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it just makes it very difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think one thing I've been learning
is like, I think everybody just thinks
[SPEAKER_04]: you're making all this money and so you
can pay all this taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think again, it's a balanced
approach because it's not just the taxes
[SPEAKER_04]: you're hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're all getting licensing fees now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you're having to pay licensing
fees and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, so our feeling is, is I want
whatever is going to be more successful
[SPEAKER_04]: for the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, um, it's very difficult for
you to plan when there's different,
[SPEAKER_04]: when you have state taxes, you have
different local taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, um, it would be nice if we had a
more, uh, I think thoughtful approach when
[SPEAKER_04]: it came, when it comes to taxes,
but, and then it's hard to pay for your
[SPEAKER_04]: taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always say if it's going to be hard
to pay for your taxes, who's going to do
[SPEAKER_04]: them, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, and it's in cash and all that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, one of the things that we're
really scared of on July one is,
[SPEAKER_08]: or at least I'm scared of you guys can be
scared of whatever you're scared of.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, is the possibility of CDTFA raising
the excise tax.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, in my mind, if it goes from
a 60% markup to a hundred percent markup
[SPEAKER_08]: or 80% whatever it is, you're going to see
an effective tax rate go from 24% to 30%
[SPEAKER_08]: at the distribution level to the retail
level.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then to the consumer, you're going to
see eight to 12% because you're going to
[SPEAKER_08]: see the, the excise is built into the
cogs.
[SPEAKER_08]: That local tax is going to tax it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The state tax is going to tax it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're looking at, yeah, another 10%
increase in prices to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and you know, if that happens,
it's being done on data that isn't in the
[SPEAKER_08]: state track and trace system.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's no way to really verify it or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I'm curious to hear your
thoughts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, have you heard rumblings of,
of CDTFA potentially doing that?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Nick was in, uh, the CCIA
summit.
[SPEAKER_08]: He says, we have the authority to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking at it.
[SPEAKER_08]: He didn't say it was going to be done,
but this is months ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, I'm just trying to prepare myself
on July one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, and I, by the way, we talked to
CDTFA a lot and I, I do think they get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they think the markup's higher perhaps,
but I think they understand that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: going to just create volatility.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's super fragile right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think again, having that markup
wholesale price markup that can change
[SPEAKER_04]: every six months, it does, doesn't create
like comfort level, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you think you're good for six months
and then the next six months, it could be
[SPEAKER_04]: something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a big reason why we changed our
licensing fees.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were basing our licensing feel fees on
that wholesale markup.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that's the difficult part
for the industry is just that every six
[SPEAKER_04]: months, you're always like wondering
what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, if, and I think as state
agencies, you know, it's not good.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we're creating this, uh, anxiety,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to tell you, like, I know all of
you worry cause I worry too, but there's
[SPEAKER_04]: nothing worse when you guys don't know
what's coming and have that anxiety.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that again, creates folks
maybe not getting into a license maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: because they're not sure and things of
that nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really, um, I think we need to give
you guys more, a better comfort level of
[SPEAKER_04]: what's coming down the road.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, especially because their operators
are, are not marketing up a hundred
[SPEAKER_08]: percent.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're at 60% or 30%.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen some at 30.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I don't know why, but there are 30.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and without track and trace,
I mean, they're looking at what,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they're looking at some of the
invoices in our manifest, but it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: giving them the information they really
need to make that informed decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but I think they understand that
though, but I think it's for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't, we don't know what they're going
to do either though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I'm trying to cause anxiety.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't be anxious.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it'll, it's all going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing is wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything is great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing is wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything is great.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just this mantra we had at the
leadership summit that was like,
[SPEAKER_08]: you are perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing is wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, uh, I mean, do you anticipate any
reprieve from taxes on the horizon?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, probably not.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, no more taxes.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, moving on.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give you a good one.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, to your point on the illicit market
has been a pain point for licensees.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, we know this is not lost in the BCC
and your office has taken measures to
[SPEAKER_08]: battle this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, can you tell us more about the public
awareness campaign you are undertaking to
[SPEAKER_08]: point consumer behavior toward licensed
businesses?
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, do you think it will be sufficient
when consumer behavior tends to be driven
[SPEAKER_08]: by, do you think this will be sufficient
though, when consumer behavior tends to be
[SPEAKER_08]: driven by price and convenience?
[SPEAKER_04]: So do I think it's complete?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sufficient.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's, uh, one part of what we need
to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't think it's going to solve.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think the public awareness
campaign is going to solve the illicit
[SPEAKER_04]: market at all, but, um, I always look at
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to come at it at all angles.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got to have aggressive enforcement.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to keep licensing people.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to work with the jurisdictions
to make sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's, it, it's getting weak.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't issue licenses in a majority of
the cities and counties.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got to keep on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we wanted to have a public
awareness campaign too, because sometimes
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we forget a lot of us,
you know, cannabis is 24 seven,
[SPEAKER_04]: but for the average consumer, they're just
looking, like you said, for the price
[SPEAKER_04]: point and where, where I can get cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not living this.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're going to get it where they can
get it cheaper.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we can sort of change some of these
California consumers mind that we want you
[SPEAKER_04]: to shop licensed, uh, shops, we want you,
um, to get safe cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, is it going to change everybody's
mind?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know this is California is,
you know, big on organics and,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you know, craft products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think you can sway some people to
go over their way to say, Hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: do they have a license or not?
[SPEAKER_04]: And ask that question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's one part of the campaign.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, it's, it's something,
is it going to change everything?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other part is to really inform the
illegal market that, we're, we're,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, we know where you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's time to get licensed and
this is how you get licensed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so is it going to change everybody?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I, you know, I'm a big believer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just hit everybody on all fronts,
this unlicensed market, and you're hoping
[SPEAKER_04]: that you get more people into the
regulated market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's, um, Alex, where's Alex?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's actually leading up that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, he is very good about taking
feedback.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, they're going, you know, they've been
going to the associations and running by
[SPEAKER_04]: some of our ads, you know, it's always
good for us to get feedback.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you know, the state trying to do ads
sometimes, they, you know, you probably
[SPEAKER_04]: are going, this is not going to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So CCIA has been very good at California
minority Alliance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys have a better idea of what's
going to work in us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, so it's, it's been a great
learning experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I, I really encourage you guys,
if you have any good ideas, please let us
[SPEAKER_04]: know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause again, what works up here in
Mendocino County probably doesn't work in
[SPEAKER_04]: LA.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, it's, it's been a pretty big
undertaking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot more work than I expected,
but I think it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think any message to help educate the
consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing's easy in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you guys feel something?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like whatever it's, it's,
it's, but it's all worth the effort.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I truly believe that it's not easy,
but it's worth the effort.
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we're, we're crushing right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we have four more questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we may have time for like two more,
two or three questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, uh, what are your biggest fears for
the viability of the regulated cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: industry in California?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, we've, we've got to make sure the
regulated market is successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I mean by successful that you're
stable, you're able to hire people,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're able to make money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and that is as far as I'm concerned,
that is our task here is to make you
[SPEAKER_04]: successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need to do whatever it takes to
make sure that happens because there is
[SPEAKER_04]: no, I don't think anybody here,
well, maybe you do wants to go backwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to go backwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but it does, um, it's, it's not just
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bureau, by the way, it's the entire
state, it's the state government,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's the industry, it's the consumer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really, um, making sure, you know,
I, I'd like to see cannabis really nor,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's already, you know,
when I looked at three years ago and now,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, cannabis is becoming normalized.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, all the, the, the, you know,
invented and you guys are innovative and
[SPEAKER_04]: all your products and it's just
incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you guys know, I come from alcohol and
it's like such a, a departure,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you have beer, wine,
distilled spirits and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like what it's, it's,
it is truly amazing what the entrepreneurs
[SPEAKER_04]: out here have been doing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, so I, I, you guys, I mean,
I just think you're going to be,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is where it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is where it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, will this is kind of interesting,
you know, another thing that's coming is
[SPEAKER_08]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now there's a bill that's moving through,
uh, that would possibly bring in hemp.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, agriculture into California and also
within our, um, uh, licensed market.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you view hemp and how do you think
about regulating it and where are you
[SPEAKER_08]: thinking about it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think about it a lot because you guys
think about it a lot because we get a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of questions on hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, I, I don't have any, I think hemp
is, uh, again, I think it's a great
[SPEAKER_04]: product that if we reg, but, but right now
the, the bureau or food nag or public
[SPEAKER_04]: health, it doesn't fall under our,
uh, authority.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it doesn't fall under a cannabis or a
cannabis product and the definition under
[SPEAKER_04]: MA, UCR say.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I truly feel though, if we're going to
bring hemp into, uh, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you can get, I mean, as you guys
know, our regulations don't allow
[SPEAKER_04]: distributors or retailers to transport or
sell hemp, but, and, and you probably
[SPEAKER_04]: think why if you say you're okay with hemp
and I'll tell you why.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think hemp does need to be part of the
regulated market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it should be regulated for,
uh, so it falls under cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that way you're benefiting from selling
hemp because you're already going through
[SPEAKER_04]: such strict standards with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes sense that it comes through you
guys, the proper supply chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our retailers and can sell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like there's, you know,
there's momentum.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that's a good thing for the
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I really think that's going to
help boost sales.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, consumer is demanding
more of these products and I think it
[SPEAKER_04]: should fall under us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that is good for the licensees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause if anybody can sell it and get it
from anywhere in the country and it can
[SPEAKER_04]: have, and we don't even know what's in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that's good.
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's, that's what we're like to hear.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, how do we reduce plastic waste?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably an easy answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think less packaging standards or
restrictions.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's, that's the answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, is it easy to get there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, um, I think, you know,
we got a lot of child proof packaging and
[SPEAKER_04]: I think though that will change as people
understand the product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like better and what we do really need to
protect and child proof packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I, I, we've heard you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a huge issue for, and I think it's,
I think rightfully so you should be
[SPEAKER_04]: bringing it up and continue to bring it
up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a possibility of establishing B
corps for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_08]: What would it take?
[SPEAKER_08]: What would it look like?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean by B corps?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like nonprofit for good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're doing, um, uh, we're doing a
feasibility study right now for
[SPEAKER_04]: nonprofits.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you, it's in the statute that BCC has
to have our feasibility study finished and
[SPEAKER_04]: our report on whether it makes sense to
have nonprofits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is due on January 1st of 2020.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're right in the process right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working with the university of
California Davis to do that feasibility
[SPEAKER_04]: study.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there's something anybody has,
you know, questions about, or you want to
[SPEAKER_04]: provide us some information, we'll be
happy to take it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially if, uh, you know, when the
compassion bill, uh, passes having those
[SPEAKER_08]: outlets, having that ability of,
uh, being a nonprofit would be helpful to
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think part of the, if you're
wondering, well, what's the feasibility
[SPEAKER_04]: study is, it's, I mean, do we,
I mean, I think we're looking at,
[SPEAKER_04]: do nonprofits, should we just have
nonprofits that are able to continue to
[SPEAKER_04]: give, you know, uh, care to whether it's
our elderly or veterans or, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: low income.
[SPEAKER_04]: And should we continue without being part
of the regulated system, but we have maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: some, you know, you know, uh, restrictions
in place.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, you know, going to those
populations or do we want it part of the
[SPEAKER_04]: regulated system?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that's part of that
feasibility study to see what's the,
[SPEAKER_04]: what's that best model.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure we can provide feedback on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, this is the last question I have.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been doing fantastic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, there are, there's still friction
between what, you know, what the state
[SPEAKER_08]: wants and what the locals want.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we look at an example, like,
the AB 1356 that was being moved through
[SPEAKER_08]: the committee, it was Ting's bill
essentially said, uh, it was trying to
[SPEAKER_08]: open up retail licenses, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if you were following,
but for those that weren't, um,
[SPEAKER_08]: to summarize, it's basically you have one
license mandated for every 15,000 people
[SPEAKER_08]: in every jurisdiction that, um,
voted in favor over 50% for prop 64,
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, or one license for every six alcohol
licenses.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that was the last iteration that I
saw something around there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it didn't move through committee,
but it was a bold move in trying to push,
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, retail licenses and licenses in
general, um, in these counties.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, you know, as it's, as we've seen,
it's been pretty slow, uh, for people to
[SPEAKER_08]: get regulated.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it's been slow for people to make
decisions and get, uh, offices stood up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Resources are thin to create another
department to do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, you know, so our thoughts around like,
how do we work on state and local?
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's that relationship?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you can only do so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, local is where the rubber meets the
road and you know, a lot of us are stuck
[SPEAKER_08]: in working in, in, uh, areas that may not
allow it or prohibit it, or we have to
[SPEAKER_08]: travel through areas that may not allow it
or prohibit it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so there's a lot of friction there,
but I think there's a way to make it
[SPEAKER_08]: better if, you know, and open to your
thoughts and how we get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think it's like anything you're,
you're trying to open up hearts and minds
[SPEAKER_04]: to cannabis, uh, regulation, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's sometimes is not an easy sell.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for us at the Bureau, um, it's making
sure our folks were always reaching out to
[SPEAKER_04]: the jurisdictions, providing them
resources where they need them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I think for a lot of cities and
counties, it is a resource issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't know where to turn to for
answers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't know where to get started.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, uh, um, Andre who's my governmental
affairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where he is.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Andre is back in the back.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what he does.
[SPEAKER_04]: 24 seven, uh, is going around to all these
jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_04]: How can we help?
[SPEAKER_04]: What can we, what, what can we provide
you?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you need from us?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we also are establishing our local
liaison unit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have 10 analysts will be hiring just
to reach out to the local jurisdictions to
[SPEAKER_04]: help them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or when they come, you know, a lot of
times, you know, you're going to them,
[SPEAKER_04]: they don't know how to answer questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think it's education,
education and having resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at least at the Bureau, we think it's
important that just like you, that we're
[SPEAKER_04]: responsive to them and that we provide
resources.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if that means we need to go do
regional trainings, we need to train their
[SPEAKER_04]: staff, we need to help train their
applicants.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the provisionals with the temporaries,
that's sort of, uh, we're, I'm hoping by
[SPEAKER_04]: the, you know, by the fall we're fully
staffed in our local liaison.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, unfortunately we've had to,
we do have people in that unit,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they've all been there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's working on making sure there's
no gap in licensure from the temporaries
[SPEAKER_04]: to the provisional.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is like, that is number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is our number one priority.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you want us to have that as our number
one priority right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thanks not for like waiting till last
minute when your temp expires and you get
[SPEAKER_08]: your provisional.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're like, you're starting to try.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're trying.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and just, just so you know,
um, I know we mentioned CDFA and,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I understand it's been tough on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we did give ourselves a little bit
more room because we pushed out temporary
[SPEAKER_04]: expirations and that really helped us,
um, you know, get prepared.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have been sending our own staff
over to CDFA to assist them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did in March, we sent six staff,
we have staff there for staff right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't want you to think just when we
see another, uh, agency hurting,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're also, we understand if, if they're
not successful, we're not successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, we do look at those things and
provide resources there to wherever we can
[SPEAKER_04]: help.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's appreciated.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and, and Andre, if it's helpful for
like people, the industry to, to go on
[SPEAKER_08]: with you to these local governments and
talk and, you know, just show who these
[SPEAKER_08]: stakeholders are, uh, that were normal
people that were parents or family or
[SPEAKER_08]: brothers or husbands or like, wives,
we can, we can do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, and maybe we just create this SWAT
team coalition and we just go through and
[SPEAKER_04]: systematically.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, locals have, you know,
local regulators have a lot of,
[SPEAKER_08]: they should be, you know, we need to get
in front of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, so we have a few questions here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and how much time we have?
[SPEAKER_08]: Five minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have some questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, all right.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I get the mic over high five,
that was a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Doing great.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you were speaking earlier about,
um, enforcement and we know that the state
[SPEAKER_05]: committed a lot of resources towards
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_05]: And while I agree enforcement need,
there's a need for enforcement.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's like 10 times the need to make
sure that everybody's licensed and
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody who wants that opportunity gets
that opportunity to license.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in thinking about that a hundred
million dollars that was, that was put
[SPEAKER_05]: towards the bureau of enforcement,
um, how it relates to equity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I deal a lot with the equity community.
[SPEAKER_05]: You talked about the money, $10 million
and, and now having to rethink that adding
[SPEAKER_05]: 15 million.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that you're asking the community
that can lease afford to wait for those
[SPEAKER_05]: resources to wait for resources.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and I think some of those millions,
millions that went towards enforcement
[SPEAKER_05]: could have been provided for the equity
community and they can't wait anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need those funds now because they
don't have access to real estate loans,
[SPEAKER_05]: family members that have money.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're struggling right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these equity programs are struggling
with, with funding to be able to process
[SPEAKER_05]: those licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need that money now and anything that
you could do to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like urgency is necessary.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate the comment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I, I, I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we, I, it's one thing to say you have
all these millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's another thing you got to get it out
to the folks that really need it and they
[SPEAKER_04]: need it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we are, I'm going to tell you we're
making, but we also want to make sure it's
[SPEAKER_04]: getting to the right people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am going to say, I'm happy that
we're getting another 15 million and I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: happy to see some of these local
jurisdictions start to come on board
[SPEAKER_04]: because that's going to help more people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, Laurie.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Reese from Posh Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you're talking about
enforcement, but we all know the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: problem that we are having as people that
own dispensaries, people that own
[SPEAKER_00]: deliveries is weed maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know weed maps is a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand what it's taken so long
to get that under control when other
[SPEAKER_00]: people have started on third, a third
party platform or ordering systems to take
[SPEAKER_00]: you off if you don't have a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why isn't weed maps able to keep
promoting that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we're seeing the prices at 30%
low because we cannot compete with the
[SPEAKER_00]: black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get calls daily from other people that
are in their business vendors and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: hurting and they don't call.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, Oh, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I actually shut my delivery down
until my store opens because I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't afford the store, especially
being an equity applicant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what people are saying is that we're,
we're about to, we're not going to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, people that's been around for,
for a long time way before me is having
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble because the black market,
I don't mean just flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, teachers, I mean, babes,
they're getting real crafty out there and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's killing us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before you know it, you guys are not
going to have people around to get money
[SPEAKER_00]: and to pioneer this industry because of
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need maps needs to be shut down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Laurie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Hua.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Jackie McGowan, K-Street
Consulting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for this event.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is about BCC enforcement on
licensed operators.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to use a specific incident
in Santa Cruz where BCC enforcement agents
[SPEAKER_03]: showed up unexpected, unannounced,
flashing badges, forcing their way in,
[SPEAKER_03]: pulling products off shelves,
interrogating employees, and basically
[SPEAKER_03]: conducting a raid without kicking a door
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first I want to ask, is there anyone in
the audience that knows what a BCC badge
[SPEAKER_03]: looks like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: One.
[SPEAKER_03]: One person?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to know if there's going to be a
hotline that we can call to verify that an
[SPEAKER_03]: inspection is occurring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because in this incident, these employees
didn't know if they were being robbed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there could be copycat incidents like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think there has to be education or
at least in an announcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: As to when enforcement is or an inspection
is going to occur.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Jackie, I don't know what specific
premises you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, normally our enforcement staff
is very professional.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do not announce before we go in.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they do have ID saying they're from
the Bureau and they have business cards.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if there's something more that can
give comfort to our licensees that they
[SPEAKER_04]: know who's there, I think we're open to,
I don't know if that's a hotline.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hotline.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something to verify.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we're open to something like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for providing such a great
format for collaboration within our
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a statewide distributor, I would like a
transparent way to make an employee
[SPEAKER_02]: purchase and give samples to my staff to
responsibly use.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's a bill moving forward,
Skinner's bill, which would definitely
[SPEAKER_08]: help that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's looking really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks really promising.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you may have your wish.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you're going to have your wish.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't take credit for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys can take credit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's definitely a collaboration,
but yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mountain Cannabis Company in Trinity
County.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a very specific question for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is bulk flour not in its final packaged
form, but with a COA allowed to be
[SPEAKER_06]: transferred from distribution facility to
distribution facility?
[SPEAKER_06]: The language in the BCC regulation 5037,
there's one sentence for this language and
[SPEAKER_06]: it needs to be clarified.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you tell me yes or no, if it can be
transferred?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're putting me on the spot right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you're here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uncomfortable questions and a comfortable
environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's been our theme.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I go on and on.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not that uncomfortable a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to make sure I give you the
right answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that needs to be on our new FAQ
system because we get that question all
[SPEAKER_04]: the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will get your information and we're
going to put that on the FAQs and we're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to email directly with the answer
and make sure it's the right answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: FAQ.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can do it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a manufacturer in San Francisco and I
think as you can tell, there's just a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know if a dispensary is going to
ask us to take something off of the shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the way they're interpreting
one of your rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know if we're doing the right
thing according to the other agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I'd like to suggest with what
CDPH has done with us is they say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, we want to come learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to walk through your facility and
see how you're doing it because we're both
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of learning together and then we can
help you understand what enforcement will
[SPEAKER_01]: look like as we figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the BCC, I'm wondering if you guys
maybe just like don't need to be enforcing
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are trying to jump through all
these hoops right now and instead you can
[SPEAKER_01]: just come and ask how we're doing it and
learn from us because we're trying to do
[SPEAKER_01]: our best.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just jump through the hoops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really understand why you're
enforcing dispensaries who are licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: right now instead of saying, let's walk
through and see how you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take some notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's come back and say, hey, we actually
don't like this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people shouldn't be scared that if the
timestamps off on their receipt,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to get a fine when they're
trying to make payroll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these aren't my stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm in the middle of the supply chain
and I have the fear both from.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for the most part, when we say
enforcing, most of when we're going out
[SPEAKER_04]: into the market, probably the biggest
thing that we are enforcing is when we
[SPEAKER_04]: come across product that hasn't come
through the legal supply chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's probably the biggest thing we're
enforcing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, we are trying to still
educate our retailers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about a timestamp.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds pretty ticky-tacky.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me give you one specific example
because I think this will help in the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around July 1st, some people from BCC came
to one of our dispensaries, Spark,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they pointed out our packaging as
non-compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually, it was compliant until July
1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spark got nervous and so they pulled the
product during our last two weeks to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: the product that would be non-compliant
July 1st because they flagged it and Spark
[SPEAKER_01]: said, just in case, we can't sell this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said, we have two more weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our last two weeks to sell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was some confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a summarize to constructive.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys just came and said,
hey, we're learning right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just gathering information and we're
not concerned about the outcome of what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're seeing right now because we want to
work with you to figure out what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to work for both of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would go a really long way.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would have been a better approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: A really long way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, July 1st was crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we think about what was happening
around that time, we just feel like we are
[SPEAKER_01]: your partners and that we are learning
together because neither of us know how to
[SPEAKER_01]: do it and we have to build it together,
but we need your help to not be scared of
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want you to be scared of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_04]: July 1st last year was very crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're all stressful and that would
have been a better approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think I don't want to just hear
about these things when I come to the
[SPEAKER_04]: Meadowlands.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want you to reach out to the Bureau and
if it means you say forward this to Lori
[SPEAKER_04]: Ajax, I want her to know I'm saying I
don't want you to be scared of us,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I want to hear it before it's a huge
problem and it's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you told me now, but feel free to
reach out to us too.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the best theme of this
whole weekend has just been let's talk
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good theme.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because Reese asked about Weedmaps,
but we didn't really get an answer on
[SPEAKER_07]: whether or not anything was going to be
done about that anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Reese asked the question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you blaming it on her?
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree that Weedmaps is a problem and we
should have internet platforms that are
[SPEAKER_04]: advertising for the license market,
not the unlicensed market.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are committed as a state and to make
sure that those that aren't getting into
[SPEAKER_04]: compliance, we get them into compliance
and that would include Weedmaps.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're also targeting people,
there's a list of people you can go after
[SPEAKER_08]: if you want to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that that's why we need
Weedmaps though, but you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, that was the end of the questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was all the questions we have.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Lori, for your time here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please show our appreciation and thank
gratitude for you making such a long trip
[SPEAKER_08]: to get here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really appreciated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that great?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
