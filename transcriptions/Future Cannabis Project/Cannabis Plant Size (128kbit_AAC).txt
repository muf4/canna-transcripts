[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, you said that the big isn't
always better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're growing hella leaf,
you're growing hella stalk, you're growing
[SPEAKER_02]: hella, you know, like these large coals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indoor cannabis, it's really, and I don't
bring this up very often, but when I do,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really, I'm serious about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, smaller plants produce higher
quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, because you're not spending
all of that time growing all that biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people think indoor of quality,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Most indoors grow smaller plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of that intensity is happening,
you know, it's bypassing these giant
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves and these huge stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge coals that most of the time in the
middle is all like super pre and like lime
[SPEAKER_00]: and like, I mean, different approaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, different approaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but, but so, so it's, you know,
plant later, you know, plant a little
later.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit later, you know, it's like
the more of them plant later.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a responsible agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it's like, there are different
methods, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that we're not, now that we're not
chained to plant count, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have a whole new world as a head of us
in farming.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a commercial weed will be a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there, there is going to be a
market for, you know, bubble gum,
[SPEAKER_00]: like artificial, like strawberry shortcake
flavored distillate that people are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the Behringer whites in of cannabis,
you know, and I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the mad dog 2020, you know, I mean,
that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, I think, yeah,
again, it's like all of this people that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been doing this all their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you are already have been
operating in the top 5% of herb in the
[SPEAKER_00]: nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you figured this out and you
take pride in it, it's like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as you just don't like compromise
your integrity and your morals and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and you represent the plant to the
highest of its purpose and integrity,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to come over back on you like
10 fold and success, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: while so many people in this like race to
the gold rush, you know, are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: just like race to the bottom imploding the
people are just going to be like
[SPEAKER_00]: landmining themselves because they,
you know, they don't know how to take care
[SPEAKER_00]: of this plant and all the intricacies of
the supply chain management stuff that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get you in trouble with like
things like pesticides or things like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and so, so things like lying,
lying isn't good for growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like don't, don't lie to me, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you've never done this before.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're lying to your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're lying to your, you're lying to your
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're lying to anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's like, it's not going to
work out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't work out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like tell me you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tell me you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then don't, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that, that, that's, that's the other
big thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, because a lot of
these guys are telling these other guys
[SPEAKER_02]: that they can do shit that they can't,
you know, like, oh yeah, I can run a
[SPEAKER_02]: 10,000 square foot greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that ego, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's back you and you, and you,
and that's growing 10, a hundred times
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger than you ever grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, dude, do you know how to do
that without using pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to take every clone and
methodically and preventively treat it
[SPEAKER_00]: with organic things from the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, or are you going to get some
fucking infestation that's going to wipe
[SPEAKER_00]: your shit out?
[SPEAKER_01]: So last question, cause you're going,
but so, so when do you actually plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when, cause like, are your plants
kind of that size or this size or
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere in between the two?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you're harvesting, probably
somewhere around that size, minus the pot,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, um, maybe, you know,
maybe a little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked my stuff be around head high,
you know, about head high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, last year it got a little big.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had stuff that was like around 12 feet
and I just, was that because you planted
[SPEAKER_01]: it earlier?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was just because my soil is just
fucking just, just dominating.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just charged.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when, when do you plant outdoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I usually plant,
you know, my seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like May 15th and my clones June 15th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, and when do you see other people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's the typical outdoor person up
north doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, you have, you have some
people that wrap their tomato cages and
[SPEAKER_02]: Christmas lights and plant in March.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, heavily mulch and plant in March
and just like Christmas light them all or
[SPEAKER_02]: dome greenhouse them with a little,
you know, utility light in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, in March, I say May for seed
June 15th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, for the clone is about average cause
it goes with the photo cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you don't want to tweak the clones
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeds don't usually pop into flower as
easy as clones do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put a clone out June 1st, you'll,
you know, and it's say it's an indica
[SPEAKER_02]: variety or you stand a chance of throwing
it into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sativa is less often because they'll,
they'll, they go a lot longer in the
[SPEAKER_02]: season.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a much longer bench time,
but you know, so it really depends on the
[SPEAKER_02]: strain and what farm, you know,
but, but those are too good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things from you is you're a
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't go, you know, these 200 plant
pound plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you're, you're, you're almost doing
like something that you've seen indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: showing success in, but doing it possibly
even better outdoors, which gets to sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of market perception of, Oh, indoor is
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe outdoor done this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see herb grown like green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know, the, it's just some
of the dev greenhouse you see these days
[SPEAKER_00]: is like it's markedly higher quality than
indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's like most people have never
seen that quality of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: fall season.
[SPEAKER_02]: My fault terms I'm doing like my fault
term, they grow really small.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure that makes them like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's like, like I said,
my wife thinks I'm stupid because she's
[SPEAKER_02]: like, she's always had like these huge
monsters and I'd like to keep them small.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, it just, they're more manageable.
[SPEAKER_02]: The less susceptible to all those weird
diseases, you know, well, and from what
[SPEAKER_01]: the public values, which is pretty looking
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: The development on, on, you know,
our, you know, our K-likes is our
[SPEAKER_02]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're just hand over hand over
fist.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the word I keep on looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Head over heels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hand over, you know, leaps and bounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, leaps and bounds ahead of,
you know, leaps and bounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaps and bounds ahead of the larger
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I'm, I'm, I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get the weight that everyone else
does, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get some good looking flower and I got
the love.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, every individual person
that comes across that testing standpoint,
[SPEAKER_01]: have you seen sort of any evidence of
turfing expression the way he's doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the giant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, I mean, I mean, as far as,
like also, you know, that how,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're doing in just in general from
testing sample, it helps a lot more with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, consistency from like,
you know, even like standardization,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cause it's like, if you have a
huge plant that's never pruned,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you, you know, and you test,
test a bud that's in the lower middle,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a certain bud that's up top with
tons of light, you know, you could see a
[SPEAKER_00]: massive fluctuation, you know,
maybe five, 7% cannabinoids, what have
[SPEAKER_00]: you, this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, but when you see plants
are, you know, that are pruned better and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of, you know, like, you know,
sun exposure is kind of distributed a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more evenly throughout the plant,
you know, these are grown, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in smaller ways and pruned more properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, you see, like,
you see the, the fluctuation all of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden kind of really narrow in,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the standard deviation of one bud to
the next, like might only vary,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, within like, you know,
five, 10% of itself or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, so it's like, if it was like 18%,
it might test, you know, 16 or,
[SPEAKER_00]: or like 17 or 19, you know, but it's like,
you see a lot more homogeneity created
[SPEAKER_00]: from, you know, consistency or
standardization, I guess, from bud to bud.
So that's the standard deviation of one
bud to the next.
Okay.
Okay.
