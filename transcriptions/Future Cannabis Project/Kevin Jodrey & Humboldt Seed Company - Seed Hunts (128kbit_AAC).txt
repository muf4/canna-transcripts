[SPEAKER_03]: And then I, when the sting was gone,
I went back because they had gotten me
[SPEAKER_03]: from, you know, I had been collecting for
a long time at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they got a collection that I would put
against anybody's collection today in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of sheer fog, quality of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that was real, because I was touching
all the older people that we get,
[SPEAKER_03]: not the candidates, and they would allow
me to access their work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old, geared, one-off, that one farm
had, that made that one farm so special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they took that farm, everybody
would go to them first.
[SPEAKER_03]: The humble legacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the main point of any of these hunts,
this is so much that you're going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not about your ego, about like,
I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that you're sharing your excitement.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of its passion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're hunting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that what you're trying to do is
you're trying to encourage, like to me,
[SPEAKER_03]: I know my role, because I know that I've
got 40 odd years here now on campus.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't go on forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get old and fucking die.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what you, and I learned this from
this old martial artist, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: This old martial artist I met was talking
about, you know, why he created this
[SPEAKER_03]: program to find the new master for his
kung fu world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he said, I'm thinking about death,
which means my time is coming and I have
[SPEAKER_03]: to create the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I have to do is I have to help
build the future I want to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the future that I wanted to see was
that people interested in chasing their
[SPEAKER_03]: desire, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like half the shit that I do has
nothing to fucking do with anybody but me.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the projects that we talk about
publicly are mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones that I don't talk about are the
ones that I work with with global
[SPEAKER_03]: operations because I'm on Andes,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't talk about those because they
don't want the information revealed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much going on internationally
that the US is being really left behind in
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of ways with what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not from a genetic standpoint,
but from just like a global economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing what Jamaica, Canada,
Germany, Switzerland, South Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thailand's just coming online right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: The American system is different because
all the drugs in the world end up in
[SPEAKER_03]: America.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Americans, if you're not selling in
America, you're not selling When you're
[SPEAKER_03]: selling to Europe, like when we're moving
to other countries, we're moving 200,
[SPEAKER_03]: 250 kilograms at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a big fucking load.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a big deal, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's not a big deal when like my
young partner, Gabe, was probably moving,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, a fucking thousand pounds
every 10 days for years out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you know kids that were 17 that were
moving a thousand pounds at a time,
[SPEAKER_03]: 300, 400, 500 pounds isn't a big fucking
deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the big deal is it's crossing,
legally crossing international lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the reality is how much money is being
made.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's small quantities in these pieces
where herb is moving from Portugal to
[SPEAKER_03]: Israel, and it's moving from Canada to
Australia, and it's moving internally from
[SPEAKER_03]: Columbia to Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's business, but the quantity of
consumption isn't like the consumption
[SPEAKER_03]: quantity in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: The U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: burns a lot of herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're selling cocaine, you're selling
more cocaine in America than anywhere else
[SPEAKER_03]: in the fucking world.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're selling any drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guarantee you we're taking more fentanyl
and meth than anybody else does.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're laughing the rest of the world on
drug consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't mean that we own anything or
are better in any way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just means that our population is drug
addicted.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're drug addicted, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We like a lot of drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is that when you move into
these other places, these markets are
[SPEAKER_03]: smaller, but what they do is they let you
understand the relationships between
[SPEAKER_03]: premises that we have built here and
premises that we can see hold true around
[SPEAKER_03]: the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we can see regional and demographic
identities that want certain things in
[SPEAKER_03]: very specific ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're messing around in certain parts
of the world, cannabis is consumed with
[SPEAKER_03]: tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either, almost no one is- It is
interesting watching that specific usage
[SPEAKER_01]: change as legalization comes through and
the price of herb goes down and the
[SPEAKER_01]: acceptance gets better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you're ever going to get
folks from Spain to fully give up their
[SPEAKER_01]: tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was in Israel, I learned the truth
of this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: The herb produced in these regions doesn't
produce enough wax.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no need for the plant to create
the antidesicant because it's too moist.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you end up having is weed that
doesn't want to burn well.
[SPEAKER_03]: The weed doesn't want to burn well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every place I travel tonight, I have the
people in the area who take me into the
[SPEAKER_03]: local world so I can see the shit gets
real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep myself to three bomb hits
and if I do any more, that's when I start
[SPEAKER_00]: to get into that real anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heart palpitations, can't talk to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got so high on some hash that I was
doing some hash research.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was doing reading and I was looking for
rosin lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't look at people in the eye,
can't find your words.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't do math.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to think about hot water
heater.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was questioning my ability to function
at that level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have the ability to actually use the
tool?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm laughing because I have the ability to
think about hot water heater.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to get myself emotionally stable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was cracking up because I'm like,
I'm fucked up right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: This stuff is real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I went in the garage to go get my
tools and then forgot why I was there and
[SPEAKER_03]: then started to question, I'm lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, no, I'm not lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm lost because I can't find my fucking
tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do I do now?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do now?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I do that and I get to like,
I'll go from one room to the other and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just be like, fuck, I don't remember
why I was supposed to come here and then
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have a good idea to go into a
different room to do something else but
[SPEAKER_00]: the time I get in that room, I'll also
forget and I just keep going from room to
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh fuck, oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not getting my thing done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those heights are pinnally strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for letting me talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, respect to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you never do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we were to go back to the root of the
question of what should people grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: What should a farmer grow that's growing
for other people or what should the
[SPEAKER_01]: average backyard farmer grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the average backyard farmer has the
most options they've ever had in history
[SPEAKER_03]: because seeds are legal now so the ability
for you to access seed stock is
[SPEAKER_03]: phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you want to do as an individual wants
to experiment cannabis is you want to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to say, okay, what is it that I want
this cannabis to grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: What am I looking for?
[SPEAKER_03]: What am I looking for?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is my need?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then ideally you would look for
someone who was doing the work in a
[SPEAKER_03]: similar climactic situation as yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that if I'm... Or at least have
the data to be able to help inform your...
[SPEAKER_03]: It helps if I'm going to go into,
I have a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be nice if you would do the
greenhouse work because then what I know
[SPEAKER_03]: is the stock you chose worked in that
higher humidity environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you worked in, you said you were doing
outdoor, it lets me know that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: resistant enough to the forces of outdoor
where some rainfall and some wind... It's
[SPEAKER_03]: not going to fall apart on itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what I would recommend for the
average individual is to get some
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity in what they're doing and if you
have six that you can do in your yard and
[SPEAKER_03]: you have six that your neighbor can do,
that gives you a possibility of 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the funnest part back in the day
is like trading with your homies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, hey, I did this, what did you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like Auntie or Uncle come through and
they're like, man, I got this old cross
[SPEAKER_01]: from forever, girl.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that way what that does, it lets you
enjoy the cultivation process and it
[SPEAKER_03]: allows you to steer in the directions you
want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's choosing your own adventure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and then what you do is you go
online into forums or you listen to
[SPEAKER_03]: podcasts of people that are about it and
then you start to be able to make
[SPEAKER_03]: connections with people about,
hey, that seems to be where I'd like to
[SPEAKER_03]: try and enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a specific case study, my friend in
California, so I was like, look at this
[SPEAKER_00]: menu of top dog hazes and hazel crosses
and let me know what you might want to run
[SPEAKER_00]: and you say, could you find out which has
the best... So he's trying to decide like,
[SPEAKER_00]: do I do long flower and stuff for the
California market?
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said, could you find out which has
the best structure and he's not crazy long
[SPEAKER_00]: on the flower time while still having that
real hazed smell and high type.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds like a unicorn,
but as a grower, that is what I am looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it seems like if you go like
haze into like a Chem 91, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: A little longer, not like a Chem 4,
which is a little shorter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can go into that into like an F2,
you can pull out stuff that's containing a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit better blood solidity and the
high is a little bit more rounded because
[SPEAKER_03]: most people, when you get right down to
it, they don't really know what real
[SPEAKER_03]: equatorial is like.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they want is they want uplift them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you give them something to make
some question their fucking validity,
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're looking at it in a jar like,
what is this weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't like that shit, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a very certain type that likes
this and I have to play with it at the
[SPEAKER_03]: right time too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's farrow weed, it's primordial.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the building blocks of all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is foundation herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we know is that you have to match
it to the right time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I know too is from like fucking
with the Colombians, their view on
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis is one of that when you go into
broad leafs, it pollutes your cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: system with adulterants that prohibit you
from uptaking Darrow leaf cerebral effects
[SPEAKER_03]: to the maximum advantage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they recommended to me,
this was an old Colombian dude that was a
[SPEAKER_03]: collector and it was killing to talk to
him because he collected everything from
[SPEAKER_03]: America.
[SPEAKER_03]: His collection was all over South America,
Central America.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the only person I ever met that
went that route and he lived in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he and I get together.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is fucking like Colombian party.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was giving me an education about how
they saw the relationship between the
[SPEAKER_03]: products, not from the lab point of view,
but from human point of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Experiential, cultural community.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what most interested me about like
world, like global cannabis populations is
[SPEAKER_01]: the cultures that have grown up around
them and how those cultures have developed
[SPEAKER_01]: independently from like one, even like you
go to the parts of Africa, like one
[SPEAKER_01]: village or another village, we'll have
slightly different variations.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're really the same in terms of
people that burn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Herb in general, a little cooler,
like in general, but not smoking takes
[SPEAKER_03]: away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's never been a place in that or
where I know in the world that I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: notice that something about herb is it
softens everyone's edges where like
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol like turns it up to 11.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were saying about the top dog stuff
that, you know, like, cause really when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're talking about like these PIFs and
stuff, a lot of that was really like
[SPEAKER_03]: Northern Lake fives hazes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you had a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They laid the, they laid these because you
can't cultivate any of these two hazes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are like the modern, those are a
little bit more domestic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think it was like,
you know, three to 5% is what you want the
[SPEAKER_03]: Northern Lights influence to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have another battery?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you could place it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can crisper in so much more nowadays.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole gene editing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole nother level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day they're taking more larger and
larger snips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a good backup track too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And where we go with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we were talking about, um,
and bringing, and bringing, and bringing
[SPEAKER_03]: these, uh, broadly genes in to make them
workable indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it just came down to selection
and the foundations of some of these
[SPEAKER_03]: modern hazes that you see in almost all
things are either haze A or haze C.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's, it's really like,
there's only those couple cuts that got
[SPEAKER_03]: released into the world at any quantity
that everybody copied followed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been playing with the haze,
like the haze terpenaline dominant stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of more like kind of like the
trainer wreck and the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And train wreck's interesting too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was bringing it like a nice bud
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a visual appeal that train wreck
had that was stunning.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hella jelly is like, is like the
modernized kind of like hazy, like with
[SPEAKER_01]: like some jam jelly notes up front.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I've smoked the hella jelly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to check.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got any with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got some in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me go burn a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I heard some good stuff about the
hella jelly too.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like a, like a beautiful
sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a long, fairly long flower time,
but short for a sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Define, define fairly long, like 84 under
a hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's well under a hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, well under a hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally commercially, commercially
viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're like, you could harvest it
in like October, it triggers really early.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like an early trigger time,
long flower time, but the stretch is all
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you still get these monstrous like
spears of jaw forming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the issue with like, when I,
when I learned when I first started
[SPEAKER_03]: working with hazes indoor was that I
learned that if I ran in that at 12,
[SPEAKER_03]: 12, what I got was 70 days of transition
and then 70 days of flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's those few minutes that really
make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the equator.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I run, I run them like 10, I go 10,
14.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to flower, please flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, and then once I set them,
then I can either bring up the cycle a
[SPEAKER_03]: tiny bit, or I can leave it as it at,
but otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love flowering them outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you can figure out the, figuring out
trigger time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I trigger them indoor and then bring them
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can reel back that trigger time,
you can get some really nice sativas to
[SPEAKER_01]: finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like by like a normal, like Northern
California harvest time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to, I used to spend more time
doing that shit just because, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're freaking on your own little thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I used to set up all the plants and
then run them on what was the light hours
[SPEAKER_03]: I expected at these times in order to get
a finish that I chose.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I knew if it took me 70 days to finish
it, I had to go back 70 days to this day
[SPEAKER_03]: and then say, what's my trigger time here?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I would set the trigger on the,
in the rooms and say, okay, what triggers
[SPEAKER_03]: at this lighting?
[SPEAKER_03]: And cause we, you know, we learned doing
that kind of work though, like with like
[SPEAKER_01]: working with trigger times, you can create
strains that are like, or varieties that
[SPEAKER_01]: are, you know, they work on the equator in
one way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work in California in a different way
and then they can work in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as they trigger early enough,
at the right amount of time, you can fit
[SPEAKER_03]: them into a range.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll flower under 19 hours of light,
under 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're totally fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Begging away, 19 hours, full flower,
quick flower to like six weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like being able to take that,
those kinds of traits and the like sativas
[SPEAKER_01]: and bring them up to Canada or the world
would be incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It opens up the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I'm trying to play around with
some of this Lebanese work that Bob's work
[SPEAKER_03]: with that Lebanese, that red lab cut into
his talk was just so the quality of that
[SPEAKER_03]: flower was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, that's a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just made me maybe get kind of
caught up in Lebanon again for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I realized I had Lebanese stock
chilling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just like, you know what,
let me, let me see if I can bring some of
[SPEAKER_03]: these early triggering jeans in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that I can start having stuff that's
coming in and that, you know, first of
[SPEAKER_03]: September, that's when it's finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how the Willie G's Lebanese
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was trigger early.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would bring, it would come in early.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot like this as far as the nose
and some of the structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's, there's, you got to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the whole thing is that with what I
learned from any of these big open,
[SPEAKER_03]: like when I'm looking at populations of
plants that were grown in fields,
[SPEAKER_03]: because they've taken whole crop,
they're not worrying about like outlier
[SPEAKER_03]: profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll select outliers and make sure
those seeds make it back into the seed
[SPEAKER_03]: batch, but they catch as much as they can
so that they're always getting a diversity
[SPEAKER_03]: of survivability.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're getting a homogenized profile
because you're blending everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't do that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just know that when families,
I always felt like family groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I go to the different villages,
it's these different groups that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: finding what they steered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same gene pool, but one valley is slightly
different than another valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they irrigate?
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of dung do they use?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's their, what's their, what's their
soil pH?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all this weird little cultural
backgrounds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is such like a fixture of like
human culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's astounding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like that's one of my greatest wish
in the future is that everyone really
[SPEAKER_01]: realizes like how deep our connection has
gone with this and why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's so many different things
out there that like I've treated different
[SPEAKER_01]: populations for different reasons that we
can't even like begin to scratch the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface of understanding it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're trying too hard to
understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just consumed and used.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to CRISPR it and put a bunch
of THC, as much THC as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: CRISPR out, CRISPR out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say the gene that, that is
controlled for try to get rid of that
[SPEAKER_03]: gene, the dream that's involved in this,
get rid of that gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: My whole problem with, with CRISPR tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the only thing I have issue with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I know why they use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it lets you do some really incredible
manipulations that, and they just start.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's a great tool for research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the EU just said CRISPR food is okay
without looking at CRISPR as, as GMO.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because it's really not GMO,
because you're not adding a dissimilar
[SPEAKER_03]: organism to the genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what you're doing though, to me,
that I, that I worry about cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: specific, specifically is for as much,
when I, when I was, I got, it was in the
[SPEAKER_03]: hospital a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I, when I was, I got out of this
coma, the ICU staff told me that they
[SPEAKER_03]: said, you know, they go, you have that
best set of lungs we've ever seen in the
[SPEAKER_03]: hospital.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, you obviously never smoked a
day in your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, and I looked at her and I was like,
I just didn't have the heart to tell her
[SPEAKER_03]: just how wrong they were.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it also let me realize, cause in all
these years we've been wondering like,
[SPEAKER_03]: what are we doing to ourselves at the
level of consumption we've had?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when you've been smoking weed for 40
years and you were smoking a lot of weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: my lungs shouldn't have this level of
quality, even though I'm an endurance
[SPEAKER_03]: athlete, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I spend my time doing endurance athlete
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: With all the smoking I'm doing,
it should be hindered, but they were like
[SPEAKER_03]: the quality of your lung as we examined
you in this ICU was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what I know is that nobody can
smoke cigarettes for 40 years and have no
[SPEAKER_03]: lung issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to tell me that cannabis
has any less tar or any less volatile
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the shape.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, it's, it's to me, it's other,
it's other genes that are present that
[SPEAKER_03]: create an effect that somehow negates the
cancerous properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So MIT figured this out like a few,
like a decade ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was a, they were researching the
difference, why people were getting cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: from tobacco smoke and why they weren't
seeing that the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was the shape of what?
[SPEAKER_01]: The shape, actually the shape of the tar
and how like the molecule of smoke,
[SPEAKER_01]: the molecules that are in there,
how they're shaped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in cannabis, they're shaped like,
you know, like a die from like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, Dungeons and Dragons, like like
eight, 10 sided die or 32 sided dies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was like, it was like a
dodecahedron or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the cannabis was shaped like,
or sorry, cigarettes were shaped like
[SPEAKER_01]: sickle tobacco is more, more irritating
actually embeds itself in because of that,
[SPEAKER_03]: because of that property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of that structural totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's actually technically more
toxins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Herb is herb is herb is more, more toxic
and we have no filtration in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, it just doesn't, it just
doesn't go on the inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't seem to bind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why they say smoking
together is bad, but there's new research
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out saying that that's not
necessarily true.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I worry about CRISPR just because what
I know is that it, and it's the same
[SPEAKER_03]: reason why they worry about it with food
is that the scientists on one faction say
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no issue, but the other scientists
who are just as educated on the other side
[SPEAKER_03]: say, yeah, we have concern.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't really know where to stand
with genetic editing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we're turning things on and off,
but we don't really understand why,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the collateral damage could be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not just a switch either.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you've got linkage and drag and when
you're doing like... It's not a switch,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a chunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, if you're taking books out of
the novel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're also not understanding the
relationship that has in conjunction with
[SPEAKER_03]: other genes that really only like machine
learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can tell you because what you're able to
do is look at a hundred thousand samples
[SPEAKER_03]: and say, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: The machine says that this gene
combination is what is occurring,
[SPEAKER_03]: not just that one gene in loci.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we've located the gene that controls
a certain thing, but when we manipulate
[SPEAKER_03]: it, we don't get the expected result,
which means that there's modulating
[SPEAKER_03]: effects from other genes that we aren't
aware of because we don't see the pathway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you're, that's really what
machine learning does in breeding is that
[SPEAKER_03]: when you're, when you use an AI,
you're able to ask the computer,
[SPEAKER_03]: what patterns do you see that are
consistent with the plants we want to use?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that now gives you a true pattern to
look at genomically, which, which parents
[SPEAKER_03]: should we use in the breeding project and
why, and we can do it mathematically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we see this sequence of alleles that is
indicated to not apply?
[SPEAKER_03]: But we go from looking at like,
we can look at like a thousand,
[SPEAKER_03]: a machine learning operation can look at
900 million.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can go up to 900 million
combinations to understand the nuances.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to be able to decipher the book of
900 million.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the, but the computer at least lets us
see the patterning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what it says is that the ones that
we chose for some reason, they seem to
[SPEAKER_03]: have this patterning.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can go through a bigger population and
pull that out and move them forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we go with success, which is really
how we breed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, it's just, you're using tools,
just like we're using genomic breeding to
[SPEAKER_03]: figure out what alleles are present and
what aren't present.
[SPEAKER_03]: Machine learning lets you look at a
billion different locations and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: what is the bigger pattern?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're still working on little patterns
because that's our level of understanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the machine can look at much bigger
patterns and it starts to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: really create some incredible potentials
of what if, you know, when you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are we seeing this grouping?
[SPEAKER_03]: And also what's possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we, if we ask the plant, when you look
at the gene patterning, what is possible
[SPEAKER_03]: from these parents?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it starts to be able to tell you and
help you understand what's the potential
[SPEAKER_03]: outcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, we can only predict it based off of
what we believe is an outcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're able to put a billion
combinations in, you see a lot of look
[SPEAKER_01]: back generations and find patterns and
things that would be impossible for a
[SPEAKER_01]: human to ever perceive.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not, we just don't have the ability,
but we have to be generational.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, based on the cannabis
right now, like we're working on,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all generational stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been some books, there's been a
lot of like new research coming out,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a lot of the understanding and
knowledge is still just word of mouth
[SPEAKER_01]: generation of what you learn from your
folks and what your folks learn from their
[SPEAKER_01]: folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And half it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: So half the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and half is you have bad observation
or it was like totally anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know, I know what I see and I know
what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I, I'm fortunate that I get to be
around people that are really brilliant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm able to like, you know,
learn from their experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the further down the rabbit hole we
go, the more I know we don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember some geneticists we were
working with really early on, they came
[SPEAKER_01]: into cannabis and they were like,
man, we really like, we think we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to identify these problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like some like disease stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, it was like CBD production,
THC production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we're going to knock these out and be
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they got into it and really
quickly the head geneticists came back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like, man, there's like
generations worth of work to do on the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis genome from like a practical
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to take like, this is going
to take so much human endeavor to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: like bring us to modernize cannabis the
way we've done with every other crop that
[SPEAKER_01]: we grow right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fun part about that one too is
that when they're talking about what
[SPEAKER_03]: they're going to do with cannabis,
they're still looking at it as a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Measurable by numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the only plant we really play
with that has so many complex
[SPEAKER_03]: relationships with us that are almost,
you have to have human evaluators.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get a population neck down,
but I don't think you can neck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's rare that I see the lab hand me
something that is better than someone who
[SPEAKER_03]: sifted it out of the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it may have better traits that are
valuable in how we produce it where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: quicker growth, better resistance,
but the selection process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like the people that I get herb from
that I play with, I work with global
[SPEAKER_03]: monsters.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoke weed from people that are growing
it out of the basements.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't really deny it, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I know that there's going to be
this nexus at some point, but... Do you
[SPEAKER_01]: think it'll come together or do you think
it'll fractionate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think there'll be this like
pharmacopoeia, like pharmaceutical level
[SPEAKER_01]: production that's just like kind of this
insulated little bubble?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there'll be like, kind of like
all that like cosmetics and like vape pen,
[SPEAKER_01]: even a vape pen is just like kind of super
isolate for really restrictive areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there'll be this like,
just this niche that is kind of like the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of like the normal smoker,
like the experienced smoker.
[SPEAKER_03]: The normal smoker though, the thing is
what I believe is that when you create the
[SPEAKER_03]: toolbox, then it's a very valuable,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think they'll come together or do
you think they're going to be like
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple markets?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you're going to have, oh,
you're going to definitely have multiple
[SPEAKER_03]: markets, but what I mean coming together
is that the small operator, just like
[SPEAKER_03]: right now, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Small operators getting buried alive,
small operator can get access to TC,
[SPEAKER_03]: get the plants clean, held and banked.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're benefiting from technology that
save your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to me, that's the modern science of
micro propagation going along with small
[SPEAKER_03]: people and you are also now able to go
take classes so you can learn how to do
[SPEAKER_03]: your own preservation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you actually, just because you cut a
meristem and fucking propagate it,
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't mean you've got rid of the virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like it's a little more complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: One cell winds up traveling through a
whole branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have one branch of a plant that's
super clean and one branch could have the
[SPEAKER_01]: virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the point is if we, if we know we got
a clean plant in that we went through,
[SPEAKER_03]: like an elite clone in other industries is
a two year stress test, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So two years this plant was fucking
stressed and nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can call it an elite.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we had an elite bank where you could go
and get access to an elite piece and then
[SPEAKER_03]: you could take it and, and, and buy access
to it, like you can any other plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you, you'd be able to keep it at
your house in your little in vitro setup.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it stays clean and you were
able to use it as a hybridizer where
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll, to me, there should be plants
available that people can access that
[SPEAKER_03]: impart specific qualities, meaning earlier
finish, higher resistance to pests and
[SPEAKER_03]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you can do now is take things that
you want to work with and you utilize the
[SPEAKER_03]: genes that come with this as a dominant
trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it allows people to be able to
work and, and produce products for their
[SPEAKER_03]: own needs, for smaller niche operations.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, that's where the knowledge comes
together and that we can use the tools.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you get machine learning,
you'll have first advanced machine
[SPEAKER_03]: learning that only larger companies can
afford.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you'll be able to go and get an
advanced learning fucking app.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll tap in through the cloud to
someone's shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I know is that you used to have to do
sex testing through the lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now for 1100 bucks, we can go pick up an
essay test and pick up the reagents and
[SPEAKER_03]: we're able to test for sex for about five
bucks a test.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to spend 1100 and a day to
learn how to do it, that's not bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's science and cannabis touching.
[SPEAKER_03]: So each one of these things influences the
small, yeah, it influences a small
[SPEAKER_03]: producer and it makes their lives easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we get into the genomic end of
it, it allows us to start to take a look
[SPEAKER_03]: and figure out, you know, which,
which plants are we playing with that are
[SPEAKER_03]: at opposite ends of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we want to see true heterosesis
without having to inbreed and stabilize
[SPEAKER_03]: two concurrent lines and then cross to get
the outlier, we can actually look through
[SPEAKER_03]: the world and say, if these two things
collided, we would get natural heterosesis
[SPEAKER_03]: because they don't share any common genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of shit is what I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the true F1 hybrid.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the ability.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they've already got them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that for small people,
like the small growing.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all, it's, it's where do I think this
stuff is going is that you're,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're creating a crafted, everyone's
like, no one's growing pot anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: More people are growing fucking pot than
ever grew up before.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, they're not able to.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the same level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They grow in two plants, four plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got a two light tent, four light
tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got a little backyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got their friend's spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got a little underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking prevalent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in all that development, all this
craft, the true craft development,
[SPEAKER_03]: hobby cultivation, you'll have so many
people cultivating that if you created
[SPEAKER_03]: platforms that allowed people to benefit
from the platform, then you would start to
[SPEAKER_03]: see people being able to get into breeding
work where you were able to say,
[SPEAKER_03]: look, this plant we released as a breeding
male and, and you can utilize it for these
[SPEAKER_03]: purposes, but it's not good here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's another one that's
released.
[SPEAKER_03]: So pretty soon there's gene banks that you
can work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: To play around and steer so that you can
take and get your desired effect and your
[SPEAKER_03]: desired mouth and nose, but with something
that works in your latitude and your
[SPEAKER_03]: specific impact, you know, to me,
that's, that's like what I'm excited
[SPEAKER_03]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the future holds with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, with gene banks now accepting
candidates, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually doing like, you know,
proper, you know, standardized research on
[SPEAKER_01]: them and then banking them and then
holding it and then having an identified
[SPEAKER_01]: as, Hey, this is this, like, it's here if
you need it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We take, we take plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of stuff coming out of the
EU right now, which are like huge banks
[SPEAKER_01]: that have kind of now, you know,
they work in, you know, dates and tomatoes
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, other, other industries and
have now started to steer into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's super interesting to see the work
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it all, it's all ag.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to see like how, where other ag is and
the big disconnect between cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: other ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like other ag is like, no,
we just want protein units per square yard
[SPEAKER_01]: or per acre, whatever grain yields of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, no, no, the cannabis,
if you go, you can go that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go, you know, we just want to grow
crystals on sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, really quickly,
you're going to lose all the special
[SPEAKER_01]: things that make this joint this joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause the flavor, this was, he did some
large population sifts and what his,
[SPEAKER_03]: the kid that did this one, Josh,
his deal is, um, uh, inclement weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's over in Washington on the coast in
a greenhouse, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything I send to Josh population
wise, it's gotta be resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what it does, it lets, it lets me
have some, some fucking mold city.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if it can make it through his,
his place, it can make it, it can make it
[SPEAKER_03]: anywhere wet in the peninsula.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just know he's close enough to the
hardest place to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just in a place that's rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when he says, Hey, out of a
thousand, out of a thousand plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is the one that didn't have any
issues and had the best qualities.
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition, I'm like, I'm about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's localized pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Okay.
