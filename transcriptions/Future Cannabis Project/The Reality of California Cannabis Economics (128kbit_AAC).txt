[SPEAKER_06]: This is what should be a very lively
discussion on who's winning and who's
[SPEAKER_06]: losing in the cannabis economic climate of
California.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my name is Andre Burke and I was born
at age zero and have successfully survived
[SPEAKER_06]: as a living organism long enough to become
a Forbes contributor.
[SPEAKER_06]: And connector in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Tim Schaefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a deputy state treasurer and the
office of treasurer John Chung.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the primary staff to the treasurer's
17 member cannabis banking working group
[SPEAKER_00]: which produced the material that Hezekiah
referred to obliquely in the last panel
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll have a couple of things to say
about that at an appropriate moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Matt Cuman.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an attorney.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been involved in cannabis since the
mid 90s in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been involved in a lot of fights
including the most recent one which we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: be discussing today about how the CHP
grabbed my client and took $230,000 and
[SPEAKER_02]: gave it to someone from the immigration
and citizenship services.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about what that is about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a senior partner in Alan Cuman and
Associates which is a political consulting
[SPEAKER_02]: firm and forecasting firm on cannabis
issues and I'm also the director of a
[SPEAKER_02]: think tank called California Cannabis
Educational Voice Foundation which was
[SPEAKER_02]: responsible for some of the work you saw
up in Humboldt County and its passage of
[SPEAKER_02]: its ordinance and I'm very pleased to be
here and thank you Susan Soares for
[SPEAKER_02]: inviting me and for doing such a wonderful
job on this event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi everyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Matt Young.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm with APOP Media.
[SPEAKER_10]: We put TVs and iPads and dispensaries all
over California.
[SPEAKER_10]: Once again thank you Susan wherever she
went.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I also am on the board of directors of
Glocka which is the Greater Los Angeles
[SPEAKER_10]: Collective Association which represents
about 35 of the legal dispensaries in Los
[SPEAKER_10]: Angeles as well as the UCBA and the SEC.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi my name is Beau Whitney.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm vice president and senior economist
for New Frontier Data.
[SPEAKER_09]: New Frontier Data is the global leader in
big data analytics specifically focused in
[SPEAKER_09]: the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been referenced in 68 countries 5
billion page views and our goal is to
[SPEAKER_09]: provide data that's well vetted actionable
nonpartisan non advocacy for policymakers
[SPEAKER_09]: operators and investors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Fran Turner.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the senior managing partner of Seven
Pass Global.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are a hybrid hedge fund and private
equity fund focused particularly in the
[SPEAKER_04]: non plant touching but additionally we do
investments on the plant side.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our first fund is actually a dual fund.
[SPEAKER_04]: Second fund is non plant touching and
we're also launching the world's first
[SPEAKER_04]: security token that's focused on a
tokenized fund.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to mention before we get started
we originally had two women prepared for
[SPEAKER_06]: this panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were unfortunately unable to make it
but I know that's important in this
[SPEAKER_06]: industry and so we'll have an all male
panel this time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So last month I part of the reason I was
selected for this panel is I sent a social
[SPEAKER_06]: media post and I was asking to speak
relating to an article about with
[SPEAKER_06]: companies who were thriving under the
medical marijuana model and who are now
[SPEAKER_06]: struggling under legalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: I posted it to Instagram, Facebook and
Twitter and I received 50 responses within
[SPEAKER_06]: the day, 45 Facebook shares and it was to
the point where I had to set up a Google
[SPEAKER_06]: form and a survey to collect all the
information.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things we'll be doing here
today is I'll be sharing some of those
[SPEAKER_06]: stories as we get into each topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the replies I got was it shouldn't
have to be a fight to stay out of jail and
[SPEAKER_06]: keep my own property.
[SPEAKER_06]: And business, but that's how it is now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess as a second time offender within
the span of two years after legalization
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking at one year in jail and I need
to forfeit my business and my property.
[SPEAKER_06]: So at the same time I'm getting it on my
email and I'm listening on the radio and
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a commercial selling register they
say for our online course.
[SPEAKER_06]: Find out everything you need to know to
make money in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm not going to identify who actually
put out that commercial but they're on
[SPEAKER_06]: this boat and they're on the next floor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the dichotomy we have with what
the promises are around this industry and
[SPEAKER_06]: what the reality is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to begin with Matt Young of APOP.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the California cannabis industry really
a get rich scheme anymore?
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately not.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm in the position to where I talk to
dispensaries every day, brands every day,
[SPEAKER_10]: ancillary businesses every day and
unfortunately it gets harder and harder to
[SPEAKER_10]: even survive let alone make money.
[SPEAKER_10]: Raising capital is one issue but on top of
that with the dispensaries
[SPEAKER_10]: on the dispensary side the regulations on
the distribution side there's testing
[SPEAKER_10]: issues, packaging issues.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're a cultivator, a manufacturer,
you're moving into new buildings,
[SPEAKER_10]: you're buying new equipment, you're moving
into new cities because unfortunately a
[SPEAKER_10]: lot of the cities where they were located
before they are not issuing any licenses
[SPEAKER_10]: and they're having to upend their whole
business and even companies that are 10
[SPEAKER_10]: years old that are very well established
large companies are experiencing growing
[SPEAKER_10]: pains to where they're a 10 year old
startup and no one is getting rich right
[SPEAKER_10]: now but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: The cream will rise to the top and
everyone buckles down and works hard and
[SPEAKER_10]: this is just the very beginning of a very
long journey.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if I can add to that, if we look
at just American statistics in general,
[SPEAKER_04]: so 80% of companies survive their first
year, 50% of companies are a business
[SPEAKER_04]: within five years and if you apply that to
actually regulated businesses it's more
[SPEAKER_04]: 20% actually survive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again it's lack of capital collectively
and obviously this is intensified by
[SPEAKER_04]: limited bank lending, again a scarce both
venture and private equity market as it is
[SPEAKER_04]: today but also just operations in regards
to regulated businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on top of that if we talk about
California specifically because of
[SPEAKER_04]: legislation moving a tad bit more slowly
what's happening is that other companies
[SPEAKER_04]: from other states or other countries are
also moving in and they are also well
[SPEAKER_04]: capitalized so therefore they're actually
capitalizing some of the existing market.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again it's an evolution, it's a large
market but it's definitely a longer play
[SPEAKER_04]: than a shorter play but the 80-20 rule
will still be applicable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most folks who are in what they call the
legacy market I guess it's been referred
[SPEAKER_02]: to haven't really and even the large
capital coming in don't understand the
[SPEAKER_02]: market trends and how everything's moving
towards biomass and the incredible amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of fragmentation and slices of the market
whether it's distilling, winterizing,
[SPEAKER_02]: all of the extraction all designed to
address this massive increase in extracted
[SPEAKER_02]: products is what I call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone may have a different nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I think and I've seen this even
with you know wealthy capital folks coming
[SPEAKER_02]: in and even with my cannabis guys you know
Hezekiah and I went you know go back to
[SPEAKER_02]: the Humboldt growers, they don't really
understand that and I haven't caught up
[SPEAKER_02]: yet to that real reality of where the
market's going and the individuals you
[SPEAKER_02]: know I can segment out just in the
extraction industry probably seven or
[SPEAKER_02]: eight different sub markets and people
aren't seeing that yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's gonna make a huge
difference in the statistic which I agree
[SPEAKER_02]: with that it's you know something like
two-thirds or three-quarters of folks are
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna go out of business even if they had
been in business before.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in North America between the 2015 and
2017 roughly six billion dollars was
[SPEAKER_09]: invested in the cannabis area.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of the money that I see being made
is not necessarily in the plant touching
[SPEAKER_09]: sphere.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the picks and shovel guys and so the
greenhouse providers, the soil,
[SPEAKER_09]: the nutrients, those folks that don't
necessarily depend upon the plant touching
[SPEAKER_09]: side of the of the industry and aren't
subject to 280e taxation etc.
[SPEAKER_09]: And depending upon the risk profiles of
the investors there's been a large amount
[SPEAKER_09]: of inflows on cultivation and retail but
there's also been a lot of inflows on real
[SPEAKER_09]: estate and software and so depending upon
where the investors minds are at the risk
[SPEAKER_09]: tolerance they're gonna either go with the
plant touching and go all in or they're
[SPEAKER_09]: gonna invest in the ancillary businesses.
[SPEAKER_06]: The conversation we didn't really complete
is one on banking and that's why it's a
[SPEAKER_06]: pleasure here to have Tim Schaefer with us
the California Deputy Treasurer of Public
[SPEAKER_06]: Finance.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to share with everyone what one
company wrote me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is Bloombox and these folks
provide B2B software as products and
[SPEAKER_06]: service and they said legalization didn't
help us with investment capital because
[SPEAKER_06]: there's no way to safely bank or insure
these investment funds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Smaller investors cannot incur risk and
larger VC type investors are still bound
[SPEAKER_06]: by so-called vice clauses commonly
embedded in their partnership agreements
[SPEAKER_06]: that prohibit even indirect investments in
federally scheduled substances.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this really and strictly a schedule one
issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: A complex question with an equally complex
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me start here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Banking many businesses is a question of a
banker being able to engage in reasonable
[SPEAKER_00]: risk management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give you an example that has
nothing to do with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many banks will refuse to open accounts
for check cashing services, for horse
[SPEAKER_00]: racing tracks, for payday auto lenders,
for card rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because often these organizations can mask
occult activities which will create
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory risk for the bank so they avoid
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now notice that it's perfectly legal to be
in the card room business or to run a
[SPEAKER_00]: horse racing track assuming you've got
licenses from your locality to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Introduce the notion of cannabis a
federally scheduled drug and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem begins to metastasize.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem metastasizes in this way in my
view.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bankers are risk averse and if this is a
risk management business the default
[SPEAKER_00]: position can easily become risk avoidance
rather than risk management if there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: clear pathway to economics that would
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That introduces the next facet of the risk
and that is because there is this growing
[SPEAKER_00]: wave in our nation to discuss cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that it may be de-scheduled
scares the banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well because they can set up an apparatus
that will require a great deal of
[SPEAKER_00]: investment only to look up and discover
that we're now off schedule one and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the same category as a card room
or a racetrack and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therein is I think one of the Rubik's
cubes that need to be solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I would encourage
you all to become familiar with,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hezekiah mentioned this in the last panel,
is this document right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna read it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's available on the State Treasurer's
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: The title of it is Banking Access
Strategies for Cannabis Related
[SPEAKER_00]: Businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can give you just a few seconds of what
the four primary recommendations are.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, at least for the here and now,
develop a system that will accommodate the
[SPEAKER_00]: cash industry rather than trying to force
it into the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure out a way to accommodate the cash
industry a little bit better than we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call that inside the office the armored
car bus route strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number 38 bus run by Brinks that makes a
scheduled stop everywhere and picks up
[SPEAKER_00]: currency to pay taxes and fees to the
state and to the local agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, develop a data portal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you who are familiar with the
Washington system know that the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: control mechanism in that state are
figuratively speaking kind of bolted on
[SPEAKER_00]: the framework that was used for liquor
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number three, invest in investigate the
feasibility of establishing a state-backed
[SPEAKER_00]: financial institution that would cater to
or accommodate the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I get questions on that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, and this to me is the
big one, develop a consortium of bankers,
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators, cannabis industry folks,
the stakeholders that were discussed in
[SPEAKER_00]: the last panel that are medical customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them together in a group that will
devote some energy and time to lobbying
[SPEAKER_00]: federal legislators and federal regulators
about the evolving nature of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the four things you'll see in
the report and we're underway with each of
[SPEAKER_00]: those four now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I agree with Tim.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if I can add a little bit
perspective from the bank side,
[SPEAKER_04]: up to about a year and a half ago I ran
America's fastest growing bank for a
[SPEAKER_04]: period of three years.
[SPEAKER_04]: We grew from 1.9 billion to over 13
billion that period of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Aggregating deposits is the most difficult
thing that's possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you take a look at it, you've got to,
if you have a perspective, A, asking for
[SPEAKER_04]: deposits or giving a loan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously asking for deposits is more
challenging.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to take higher risk strategies.
[SPEAKER_04]: That involved EB5, broker dealer,
cash businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: The regulators are spent approximately
half of the year, so about 150 business
[SPEAKER_04]: days in our offices.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, measuring and analyzing our
higher risk businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Banks themselves can hold 25% typically if
it's well run of their collective deposit
[SPEAKER_04]: base in high risk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what that means is it's a fight for
what high risk deposits can actually sit
[SPEAKER_04]: on that balance sheet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that comes the inherent risk that
Tim mentioned.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and again, if you take a look at the
smaller banks that are participating,
[SPEAKER_04]: there are about 300 banks across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: right now that actually actively engage in
cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_04]: To actually have a KYC and AML program,
a BSA program that facilitates it,
[SPEAKER_04]: actually costs tens of thousands of
dollars, if not hundreds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on top of that, if you look at these
smaller banks, they don't have the
[SPEAKER_04]: technology and some of the core processing
solutions to actually interpret and
[SPEAKER_04]: understand exactly where that money is
coming from.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that entire process on an ongoing basis
ends up costing hundreds of thousands of
[SPEAKER_04]: dollars because you need personnel and
staff to actually manage that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the main challenge that they're
having.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to Tim's point, it is very challenging
and the natural mentality of the banker
[SPEAKER_04]: can be risk averse.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other side of the challenge is the
actual payment side.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we think about Visa, MasterCard,
a bin basically is where all the
[SPEAKER_04]: transactions pass through.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you think of every $100 that passes
through a bin, only $1 can actually be
[SPEAKER_04]: high risk related.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so by definition, cannabis is high
risk.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we also need to come up with additional
payment mechanisms that will help evolve
[SPEAKER_04]: industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not only just a cash business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lately I've been saying that we have two
policies at play.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is to allow cannabis and the other is
prohibit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's impossible to move forward unless
one is going to win.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're back to you have to organize.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to go to the legislature.
[SPEAKER_02]: The courts aren't going to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to actually force this issue and
the absurdity of the contradictions
[SPEAKER_02]: between what is really happening and what
the population in this country wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ultimately Congress has to do
something about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gone back and forth with Fiona Ma and
other folks in the state government about
[SPEAKER_02]: a bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while it's a really wonderful idea and
I support it, there's just too many,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think too many barriers because of
federal prohibition to allow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So until we get Congress to do something,
and this is just an old song, I feel kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of stupid bringing it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But until we, you know, get our Congress
people to actually do something about it
[SPEAKER_02]: and organize effectively rather than the
old left-wing firing squad.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that joke, how does a left-wing
firing squad line up in a circle?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, everyone's going to have
to learn how to organize and work
[SPEAKER_02]: together, put the egos aside, and then
we've got to go to Congress because that's
[SPEAKER_02]: where ultimately I think this has to get
fixed.
[SPEAKER_10]: From personal experience, our companies,
we've lost two bank accounts just this
[SPEAKER_10]: month.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the reasons was we deposited more
than $5,000 per month into the account,
[SPEAKER_10]: which as a business owner, having $5,000
deposited in cash is not a lot of money,
[SPEAKER_10]: especially in a cash business.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the other was because even though
we're a non-plant touching business,
[SPEAKER_10]: we accept money from plant touching
businesses.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that account was subsequently shut
down.
[SPEAKER_10]: And right now I'm going to have to talk
and find one of those 300 banks because I
[SPEAKER_10]: have tried to open new bank accounts.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have to put our website down.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our website mentions cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have been unable, so far we've only
tried this week, but we've been unable to
[SPEAKER_10]: open a new bank account, which is very
discouraging, especially for someone who
[SPEAKER_10]: has to run a business.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll see, you know, what change we can
make.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to have to read that report too.
[SPEAKER_10]: But hopefully these rules can change
quickly because it's, that's one more
[SPEAKER_10]: deterrent to running a cannabis business
on top of all of everything else.
[SPEAKER_10]: Banking is also a huge challenge.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the, I don't know if the banks,
and I hate to put a wet blanket over
[SPEAKER_09]: everybody, but I don't think the banks
have an incentive in order to enter into
[SPEAKER_09]: this space.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think the banks have an incentive
to enter into this space because they,
[SPEAKER_09]: the way that they grow their revenue is
through acquisitions of other banks.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so they don't want to jeopardize those
acquisitions by entering into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: space.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're deferring and staying away from
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now I'm from Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in Oregon, we have two main credit
unions that provide banking services,
[SPEAKER_09]: checking and savings, $500 a month for a
checking and savings account.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's to cover the costs.
[SPEAKER_09]: But they only have 600 accounts total and
there's over 4,400 businesses in Oregon
[SPEAKER_09]: right now that aren't cannabis related.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the, that kind of draws a
picture of, or paints a picture of just
[SPEAKER_09]: the extent of how little banking is
offered to the cannabis industry right
[SPEAKER_09]: now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about taxes and costs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the replies that was shared with
me, this fellow says, I was on the board
[SPEAKER_06]: of Silicon Valley Americans for Safe
Access.
[SPEAKER_06]: San Jose imposed a tax, which was a point
of contention.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the real bad part was not just a tax,
it was no licenses for years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then an actual crackdown and monopoly
on 16 businesses just like BCC is doing
[SPEAKER_06]: now.
[SPEAKER_06]: How have they evolved and how has that
monopoly come about?
[SPEAKER_09]: The way that I look at taxation is that
taxation really influences the amount of
[SPEAKER_09]: legal participation.
[SPEAKER_09]: In the system and if taxes are too high,
then it dissuades people from
[SPEAKER_09]: participating either from an operator's
perspective or a consumer's perspective.
[SPEAKER_09]: And for example, and I think in Nevada
city, they had a $10 a square foot tax on
[SPEAKER_09]: their operations.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're a 20,000, regardless of if
it's canopy or whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in that sense, if you're a 20,000
square foot operation, already you're
[SPEAKER_09]: paying $200,000 in taxes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just at the local level before you
generate any revenue.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's just, it's basically,
and there was a phrase that I heard here
[SPEAKER_09]: in California, it's called prohibition
through legalization.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that really resonated with me because
they say, hey, yeah, come on in.
[SPEAKER_09]: We want your tax money.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're gonna tax you until you can't
operate.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then what good is it, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So, but consumers and businesses are
extremely price sensitive.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've at New Frontier data,
we have developed models that show just
[SPEAKER_09]: how price sensitive consumers are and what
level of legal participation would occur
[SPEAKER_09]: at various tax levels.
[SPEAKER_09]: We provided testimony at the state
legislature in Sacramento on a tax
[SPEAKER_09]: reduction bill that looked at a reduction
from 15% to 11%.
[SPEAKER_09]: So fairly nominal reduction, but it was
going to generate $168 million in
[SPEAKER_09]: additional retail sales, 64,000 new
entrance consumers from the Alyssa market
[SPEAKER_09]: into the legal market.
[SPEAKER_09]: And unfortunately, that proposal was voted
down.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not sure what solution I can
provide, but it's very, very compelling
[SPEAKER_09]: that as consumers are price sensitive,
policymakers need to adjust and develop
[SPEAKER_09]: their tax policies accordingly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, that's a really good
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it goes back to what I always
see is that there are contradictory
[SPEAKER_02]: policies at play.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the government does not want
consumption, for example, Mark Kleinman
[SPEAKER_02]: and some other prominent policy makers are
basically, you know, like in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_02]: how they wanted to limit, you know,
the amount grown and so forth,
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they put a syntax on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing the government contradicting
itself with saying we want legalization,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we really don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think until that is addressed and
until there's really policy goals that are
[SPEAKER_02]: clarified, you're going to see this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a conversation with Lori Ajax a few
months ago and I asked her, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: who's on your staff?
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said, well, we're not doing
policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Board of Equalization,
for example, has policy people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said, well, we do policy
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a professional policy maker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to me, that was a red flag that
we're not really thinking about policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really, you know, sweeping it under
the carpet, but everything's driven by
[SPEAKER_02]: policy, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so unless you have that resolved,
which it's not, it's a contradiction,
[SPEAKER_02]: then we're going to be in this mess.
[SPEAKER_10]: So another side of the tax issue is
leveling the playing field where legal
[SPEAKER_10]: license businesses are forced to pay all
these licensing fees, all of these taxes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you have the gray and the black market
that aren't contributing anything to the
[SPEAKER_10]: taxes, which is, you know, another
struggle to keep your legal business
[SPEAKER_10]: alive.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's where enforcement really has to
come into play to hopefully shut down the
[SPEAKER_10]: illegal operations.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's easier for those licensed
businesses to stay open and have a little
[SPEAKER_10]: playing field, because right now it's
really unfair and hard for the
[SPEAKER_10]: dispensaries and hard for the licensed
brands to be able to compete with
[SPEAKER_10]: companies that aren't paying payroll
taxes.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's 40% of your business,
plus you've got 280E, which no one's
[SPEAKER_10]: brought up yet, which is totally unfair,
which the governor just rejected that
[SPEAKER_10]: bill.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a lot of things we've got to
work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you know me, you've heard me speak
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm by no means an apologist for banks,
but the banter you just heard is really
[SPEAKER_00]: critical to the banking discussion as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bankers are creatures of analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without clear sight lines into financial
data, they don't get comfortable with
[SPEAKER_00]: risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the principal sight lines into
financial data for small businesses are
[SPEAKER_00]: tax returns.
[SPEAKER_00]: 280E essentially shoves deductible
expenses into the background for federal
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes, making it more difficult for the
banker to assess his or her risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That remains a problem that I think to
this observer is a bit nonsensical if what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to do is to achieve tax
compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing is that remember that to
a bank, and again, I'm not an apologist
[SPEAKER_00]: for banks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to keep myself centered on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: To a bank, taking a deposit, that deposit
is your asset.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the bank's liability.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bank's liability has to be offset with
an asset that will earn more than what the
[SPEAKER_00]: deposit is costing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we insist on this bizarre mechanism of
forfeiture, of asset forfeiture on
[SPEAKER_00]: federally insured institutions,
what have you forced the bank to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You forced the bank to take deposits from
the industry, but not lend to the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not lending to the industry is a lower
yield prospect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've now put the squeeze on the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm not an apologist here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to report the balls and
strikes, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've put the squeeze on the bank at the
very same time that some of our tax
[SPEAKER_00]: policies have put the squeeze on the
industry that's struggling to get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: finish line.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to size the extent of 280E,
New Frontier data presented in the White
[SPEAKER_09]: House, an analysis of the 280E,
looking at the entire U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: market.
[SPEAKER_09]: Over a seven-year period, cannabis
businesses pay approximately $14.6 billion
[SPEAKER_09]: in additional taxes than they would
normally pay if they were treated as a
[SPEAKER_09]: normal business.
[SPEAKER_09]: The health policy advisor for President
Trump said, why would I give up $14.6
[SPEAKER_09]: billion in revenue?
[SPEAKER_09]: And the response to that, of course,
is, well, look at all those jobs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at all the conversion from the
illicit market.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look at all of the social issues that you
address through this legalization.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there's obviously a net benefit to
the 280E tax reform, but it's gonna take a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of education and a lot of additional
data in order for them to be convinced of
[SPEAKER_09]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a quick point.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I start talking about 280E,
I'll go crazy, because I was the architect
[SPEAKER_02]: and the first guy who put the legal team
together to litigate the Champ case in the
[SPEAKER_02]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: tax court.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a whole other issue that hasn't
even begun to raise its ugly head yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I wanted to say was that I'm
talking to people and seeing some
[SPEAKER_02]: stirrings of trying to get local cities or
counties to actually have citizens
[SPEAKER_02]: advocate to have no taxes in those cities
or counties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's gonna catch on if
everyone can start to talk in their
[SPEAKER_02]: communities about not imposing taxes,
because you've already got the retail
[SPEAKER_02]: sales tax in California anywhere from 7.5%
to 9.5% plus the 15% state excise tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 22% to 25% right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't need any more taxes at the
local level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can always impose them later if
things start cranking up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think from an organizing point of
view, and that's often how I look at this
[SPEAKER_02]: as a political organizing matter,
I think you have to go to your small,
[SPEAKER_02]: the city councils and the county boards of
supervisors and say, look, and you'd be
[SPEAKER_02]: surprised how many people don't go to
these meetings or don't meet with
[SPEAKER_02]: legislators, but if you go and say,
look, you're gonna kill this industry and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna thwart your goal of ending
the black market, so why don't you look at
[SPEAKER_02]: the data, the kind of data that you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would encourage everyone to think
about finding a community, maybe like
[SPEAKER_02]: Berkeley, like Dale's Berkeley,
that's actually did just reduce their
[SPEAKER_02]: taxes from, was it 10 to 5% or something
like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And continue to sort of push on that
issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be my two cents on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving on to licensing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here was a comment that came to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I started down a path to getting a
distributor license in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I found insurmountable obstacles at
every turn.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was unable to find a location
suitable in the minute areas available
[SPEAKER_06]: within San Francisco where my activity was
zoned correctly, the city asked me nicely
[SPEAKER_06]: to shut my business down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: I let my five employees go and I cried a
bunch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eight of 10 brands I was representing last
year no longer exist in the legal market.
[SPEAKER_06]: The people behind those brands are like
family to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they lost their livelihoods over these
new laws.
[SPEAKER_06]: How far off course have we become?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're seeing it in some of our
portfolio activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: It almost becomes a competitive advantage
to actually have teams that specialize in
[SPEAKER_04]: getting licenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're basically putting together
consultants, bankers, professionals that
[SPEAKER_04]: specialize in those various licenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's almost an unfair competitive
advantage in regards to how we're going
[SPEAKER_04]: about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it goes back to what I originally
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're doing is leveraging companies
from other states, other countries to
[SPEAKER_04]: actually import their business into the
state.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got proven business models,
which is part of the credibility that you
[SPEAKER_04]: need.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they have the existing capital.
[SPEAKER_04]: So unfortunately, the lack of speed at
this moment or the tardiness in some of
[SPEAKER_04]: this licensing negatively affects the
California business specifically,
[SPEAKER_04]: but creates advantages for some of the
out-state competition.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other part here is we're going
after multiple international licenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we are seeing is it is an
educational process, but the period it
[SPEAKER_04]: needs to be somewhat shorter than what
we're seeing in California at this point
[SPEAKER_04]: in time.
[SPEAKER_09]: So from a policy perspective, it's really
difficult to balance the market versus the
[SPEAKER_09]: free market.
[SPEAKER_09]: In Oregon, for example, there's one
cultivation license for every $500,000 of
[SPEAKER_09]: the total addressable market.
[SPEAKER_09]: The total revenue in the entire market.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas in Florida, in an area where they
have limited licensure, that's one license
[SPEAKER_09]: for every $125 million.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the concept here is it's difficult
for policymakers to balance what's the
[SPEAKER_09]: sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's data out there.
[SPEAKER_09]: They just haven't asked for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It hasn't resonated with them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because in such states as Oregon and
Washington, you have super saturation of
[SPEAKER_09]: supply.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have declining values, declining
revenues, and then people go out of
[SPEAKER_09]: business.
[SPEAKER_09]: And compounded with 280E, compounded with
the lack of banking, then that's a tough
[SPEAKER_09]: nut to crack because people are,
that's real wealth.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because friends and families are the
people that need to invest in this.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you don't set it up correctly,
then you have a chance to wipe out
[SPEAKER_09]: individuals' wealth.
[SPEAKER_09]: To a massive extent.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the tough nut to crack right
now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And nobody's really dialed it in quite
yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's another thing to talk about is
wiping out your wealth, which I've
[SPEAKER_10]: experienced a couple times in my cannabis
career.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's why I had to start APOP and not
touch this plant anymore.
[SPEAKER_10]: But starting over at zero is tough.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you look at the social equity
programs that they're trying to start,
[SPEAKER_10]: this business takes millions of dollars to
do.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you don't have millions of dollars,
you've got to team up with people that
[SPEAKER_10]: have millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's companies I've talked to on
the social equity side, and it seems like
[SPEAKER_10]: they're kind of taking advantage.
[SPEAKER_10]: These people have already been beat down.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've already lost everything.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now companies are going to use their
experience and their arrest and their
[SPEAKER_10]: financial ruin for their own personal
gain.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's another thing that the
licensing, it's just another deterrent for
[SPEAKER_10]: the regular guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone wants to be a part of this
industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that regular person who has all this
experience, who loves the plant,
[SPEAKER_10]: loves the industry, he's got an uphill
battle to try and really participate and
[SPEAKER_10]: succeed.
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully events like this can get
people educated, get people to meet other
[SPEAKER_10]: people that can help them raising capital,
help them get licensed, all those kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: things.
[SPEAKER_10]: And hopefully it grows from there.
[SPEAKER_10]: This industry, in essence, is nine months
old.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're at the start of something great,
and hopefully it gets better and better.
[SPEAKER_09]: In nascent markets like this, it's natural
to have a lot of actors come in at the
[SPEAKER_09]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's excited.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a passion.
[SPEAKER_09]: But just naturally, these markets
consolidate.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so my advice to you as small
businesses, now policymakers want to
[SPEAKER_09]: protect small business while also allowing
for growth and development and
[SPEAKER_09]: consolidation in the market.
[SPEAKER_09]: But my advice to operators here is be sure
to do your due diligence.
[SPEAKER_09]: Be sure to have an exit strategy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk to people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you want to compete with the big
guys, then develop some type of
[SPEAKER_09]: consortiums or business affiliations or
groups, collaborations with others so that
[SPEAKER_09]: you can compete or realize just where your
cost structure is and plan accordingly so
[SPEAKER_09]: that you develop and carve out your own
niche.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if you don't, you'll just be
consumed and wiped out just like a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: the small businesses out there right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to whine for one second that
both the industry and the government and
[SPEAKER_02]: the consumers are not doing enough to make
the changes that need to happen because
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody's retreating to their corner and
trying to scrap it up themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what did Franklin say?
[SPEAKER_02]: We all hang together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to hang separately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't keep emphasizing that enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that actually means that you have to
talk to people and communicate and
[SPEAKER_02]: organize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because otherwise, you're just going to
back right into this legal concept that I
[SPEAKER_02]: keep explaining to everybody called
clusterfuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's essentially what's going to
keep happening unless you guys do
[SPEAKER_02]: something about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's leadership in this movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to refer to myself as a general of
the rebel forces and the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you need a lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need the people to actually stand up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to do more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's always going to be my message.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be an apologist for the
banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep repeating that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm really not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of our small banks, let's focus on
some numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think what Matt has just
described is a sliver in the door that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can stick your foot in.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we sit here today, there are roughly
165 banks in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's down from about 225 just nine years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And consolidation is an inevitable part of
the banking business as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's think about how little banks
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little banks start with an entrepreneurial
instinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll bet that sounds familiar to most
of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That entrepreneurial instinct brings
together local business people who say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, I've got a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we start a bank?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then their journey begins also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they are subject to regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a request for your sympathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, I'm asking for empathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand where the other folks are
coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes our problem easier to solve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we can engage in more productive
dialogue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those small business people come
together and they form a bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the first thing the regulator
says to them?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't grow too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't make certain kinds of loans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't engage in certain types of
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: That regulator keeps that group of
business people on a very short leash
[SPEAKER_00]: until it can be satisfied that that new
little bank doesn't represent a contagion
[SPEAKER_00]: point for the larger banking system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If in fact, a regulator shows up and says,
it looks to me like you may be banking a
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are the people who are directly
impacted by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The original shareholders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess who the directors of the bank are?
[SPEAKER_00]: of that little bank are, the original
shareholders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see how the problem becomes
cyclical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what I would offer up for your,
just to ponder.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we conducted one of our public
hearings up in Santa Rosa, I heard from a
[SPEAKER_00]: very passionate member of the industry,
the cannabis industry, say, I can't even
[SPEAKER_00]: go into my local community bank and sit
with a single senior executive of the
[SPEAKER_00]: local community bank and have a
conversation about my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Class, what's wrong with that picture?
[SPEAKER_00]: That entrepreneur wasn't asking for a
loan, wasn't asking for a deposit
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: That entrepreneur was asking for the
expertise of that local banker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had the same conversation that
I've just had with you with local bankers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we stop retreating to our
corners, as Matt has described,
[SPEAKER_00]: and understand that small business
flourishes in the banking sector the same
[SPEAKER_00]: way small business will flourish in your
sector, and it's only by talking to one
[SPEAKER_00]: another effectively that we're going to
make some progress.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tim, would you like to explain the set of
visual aids you've brought here?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure others are curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I flashed this one around.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is available on the state treasury.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would encourage you to review it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you, having worked for John
Chung as his employee for the last five
[SPEAKER_00]: years, and as his consultant for seven
years before that, this is not somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: who writes reports and files them away.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our blueprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought a fresh copy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one on my desk, I promise you,
is dog-eared and it's got lots of little
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow stickies on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an important roadmap for the hard
work that will have to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to make any apologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing that you... Boy,
that didn't last.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one went fast, didn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing I would want to encourage
you all to pay attention to is there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of jurisdictions in the United
States that have examined the feasibility
[SPEAKER_00]: of creating a public bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the moment, that has nothing to do
with your business, but stay with me for a
[SPEAKER_00]: few seconds and I'll bring them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been resurrected as a result of
the Occupy movement after the financial
[SPEAKER_00]: crisis in 2008, 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: People in small businesses and many
communities in California felt that Big
[SPEAKER_00]: Wall Street had abandoned them,
and so the call went out to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: state, or in some cases, a locality,
get into the business of owning a bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: The model typically held up as a paragon
of success is the Bank of North Dakota,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is owned by the State of North
Dakota.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might add, to temper your enthusiasm,
the Bank of North Dakota is the only
[SPEAKER_00]: publicly owned bank in the United States
and it was formed 99 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not to say you should be
discouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, inevitably, after we legalized
cannabis two and a half years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: two years ago, the public bank movement
merged for a little while with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis banking group.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just made things worse in some
jurisdictions, but that doesn't mean it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be worse forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are from various parts of the
state, Santa Rosa, or you are in Richmond,
[SPEAKER_00]: Berkeley, Albany, Oakland, and Alameda
County, each of those areas is looking
[SPEAKER_00]: into this public bank idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city and county of San Francisco is
looking on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I serve as the treasurer's delegate to the
task force, to the San Francisco
[SPEAKER_00]: supervisors on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state itself is looking into it,
although ours, here's the merger,
[SPEAKER_00]: ours is focused on standing up a bank that
would engage in the cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that doesn't necessarily mean a bank
the way you and I know a bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be a payment system, it may be a
credit union, it's still being studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: SB 930, authored by Senator Hertzberg at
the request of candidate for treasurer
[SPEAKER_00]: Fiona Ma, full disclosure, I'm not
campaigning here, was introduced into the
[SPEAKER_00]: Senate last year, was passed out of the
Senate by, not unanimously, but very
[SPEAKER_00]: close, and got to the second house and
died in its appropriations committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect that we will see that back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference is that we will have
completed the study that's read and
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended in here about how to do that
that may inform the legislature in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next legislative session beginning in
January.
[SPEAKER_02]: With all due respect to my esteemed
colleague, the private banks in the state
[SPEAKER_02]: will allow a public bank over their dead
banking bodies, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my perspective on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you all for a great panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a fun tax question, if that can
even happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Matt Cumin, you represent a new client
that was a licensed transporter that had
[SPEAKER_03]: $230,000 seized by the Department of
Homeland Security.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seized by the CHP.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seized by the CHP and turned over to the
Department of Homeland Security.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since this technically is the first shot
across the bow against the licensed
[SPEAKER_03]: industry by the federal government,
I am curious, does that licensed operator
[SPEAKER_03]: owe taxes on that money, or are we gonna
wait until a settlement is reached before
[SPEAKER_03]: that's determined?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell if I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, first of all, should I take two
minutes to tell the story, or does anyone
[SPEAKER_02]: want to hear about what's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great case that we're gonna use
to smash open the contradictions,
[SPEAKER_02]: so keep following it, support us.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CHP did stop my clients first for a
mud flap violation on their pickup truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then let them go, and then they followed
them up the road, stopped them again,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it turned out that the CHP had it
in for my clients, who had both been in
[SPEAKER_02]: the CHP and had left the CHP.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the clients had been fired from the
CHP.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got reinstated, and then he resigned.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one was accused of stealing from
a locker room at the CHP.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was actually charged criminally,
and the jury did not find him guilty,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he is therefore innocent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the CHP terminated him for
insubordination, because he wouldn't tell
[SPEAKER_02]: them what happened upon his advice of his
lawyer during that criminal proceeding,
[SPEAKER_02]: so he was fired for insubordination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are my guys, so when you hear all
the press stuff about how dirty my guys
[SPEAKER_02]: are, just remember that these were guys
who were just doing their job,
[SPEAKER_02]: and neither of them were, I mean,
there was a real story behind who they
[SPEAKER_02]: were.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened was once they were stopped
on the second stop, they were treated like
[SPEAKER_02]: animals by the CHP officers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were taken to the Merced CHP station.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CHP called the Fresno office of the
United States Citizenship and Immigration
[SPEAKER_02]: Services, had an officer from that office
in Fresno come up to Merced and take the
[SPEAKER_02]: $230,000 into custody.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a clear workaround to the Roy
Barker Blumenauer Amendment, for those of
[SPEAKER_02]: you who don't know, federal law that
prohibits the Department of Justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: From spending money on cannabis
interdiction in medical cannabis states,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Department of Homeland Security has a
separate budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: So isn't that tricky?
[SPEAKER_02]: The federal government has shown us what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when we challenge, and I just,
we'll be filing forfeiture administrative
[SPEAKER_02]: claims and so forth, and we're gonna be
challenging that in federal court in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Eastern District, when the Eastern
District forfeiture attorney for the
[SPEAKER_02]: United States Attorney walks into the
courtroom, guess what I'm gonna tell this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna tell the judge, he can't be here
because his budget doesn't allow him to be
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've spoken to a couple of other
attorneys, notably Eric Shevin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't gotten a lot of details from
him, but we know this is a trend.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gonna take the money and give it
to DHS as a workaround around Roy Barker
[SPEAKER_02]: Blumenauer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should really, really make everybody
stand up and shout, and I hope everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: will do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the basic story.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna be filing all sorts of
actions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm already talking to clients around the
state.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna, Mark Wasserman and his
brother Craig, where are you guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Raise your hands, my co-counsel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be creating a huge stir
about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna be getting attorneys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna get an attorney from every county
in the state to be on the pleadings.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna get a class action injunction
against the CHP, and then, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then when this thing is revealed for
its absurdity, then the legislature will
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully fix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gonna fix this because this is all
about a legislative fix.
[SPEAKER_02]: The courts are gonna just follow the law,
call balls and strikes and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not gonna give us anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really haven't, and they don't plan
on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not where you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the legislative arena.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow us.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's gonna be lots of stories about
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't believe a goddamn word the CHP is
saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, my name is Etienne Fontan.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm with Berkeley Patients Group.
[SPEAKER_07]: We turn 19 next month.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've unfortunately been kicked out of
over 30 different banks, and we've heard
[SPEAKER_07]: this discussion of banks coming along and
it's actually gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it gonna unfortunately take a worst
case scenario where a distributor or owner
[SPEAKER_07]: is murdered before there is actual action
taking place at the state slash federal
[SPEAKER_07]: level?
[SPEAKER_07]: I would hate to think that, but
unfortunately, these are the realities we
[SPEAKER_07]: face every day when we're having to move
large sums of cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Berkeley Patients Group has been a
stalwart member of the community,
[SPEAKER_02]: and particularly of the reform community,
and my hat's off to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a client that was bringing cannabis
to a cannabis retail operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was someone, a criminal was staking
out the operation, followed him,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then beat the crap out of him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's lucky that he wasn't murdered.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think these sorts of things are
going on, but people are afraid to report
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's part of why we don't get
more action, because people don't realize
[SPEAKER_02]: the severity of the problem.
Okay.
Bo, do you have something you wanna say
about this?
[SPEAKER_09]: So prior to joining New Frontier Data,
I was the chief operations officer at
[SPEAKER_09]: Golden Leaf Holdings in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of my coworkers didn't show up one
day, because their best friend was
[SPEAKER_09]: murdered.
[SPEAKER_09]: He had his head blown off for $40,000.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so to me, on a personal basis,
people are already being murdered.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I agree with you, people don't
necessarily talk about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if that's gonna be what
puts the whole banking issue over the top.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gonna be something else, probably
just the scale and economics, rather than
[SPEAKER_09]: the humanity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Dale Gehringer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I represent California Normal,
National Organization for Reforming
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana Laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a non-profit, a 501C4.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never been in the business, of course,
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also probably the oldest marijuana
organization in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had a bank account with no
problems, I must say, since 1974.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we started, we did encounter a glitch
about 10 years ago, when we started
[SPEAKER_01]: listing dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we tried to get a PayPal account,
so people could pay dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_01]: or collectives, actually they were patient
collectives, who wanted to get listed
[SPEAKER_01]: online, could pay by PayPal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And PayPal said, hey, we're terminating
your account, because you're dealing with
[SPEAKER_01]: these things that are federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we said, oh, well, you know,
you do have a point there, they are
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal, we'll stop doing business with
those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we continued to list doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, doctors are legal, and there's a
federal court decision even saying so.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got wind of that, and they terminated
our services altogether.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, more recently, we've started to hear
a spate of non-profits, like other normal
[SPEAKER_01]: chapters, like doctors organizations,
like the Alameda County Democrats,
[SPEAKER_01]: Browning Mary Democrats, who have not been
able to get banking services.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, all non-profits.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there something happening there amongst
the regulators in Washington?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there some new rule or something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why has this started to happen after all
of these years?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dale, I think this working committee out
of the prohibitionists and the White House
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Office of National Drug Control
Policy have a multifaceted, targeted
[SPEAKER_02]: campaign going on right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is the transferring assets to DHS or
other agencies that can take the asset.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's obviously a stupid play, because
we're going to beat them in federal court
[SPEAKER_02]: when the US attorneys come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a part of it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think also you see this massive tax
auditing that's going on in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: With all the problems we have here in
California, way to the IRS starts auditing
[SPEAKER_02]: your businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just going to get the licenses
from the state, and they're going to start
[SPEAKER_02]: auditing at a much higher rate than they
do for small businesses generally,
[SPEAKER_02]: like we see.
[SPEAKER_02]: My colleague, Rachel Gillette,
some of you may know her in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked to her frequently about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's multi-multiple strategies that
they're engaging in.
[SPEAKER_02]: To continue to attack us and continue to
try to cripple this industry, and those
[SPEAKER_02]: people are not going to stop unless we
shout and scream, basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Following up on SB 930, the review that I
did on that bill, it seemed that the
[SPEAKER_05]: focus, the scope of 930 was becoming more
and more narrow, only for direct services
[SPEAKER_05]: provided to these businesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: As we know, businesses have lots of
related services.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it going to get expanded?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it going to remain so small?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has no support from banking
community, as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a policy of the state
treasurer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an opinion from his policy advisor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to be clear on that, because
there's media in the room, he has not
[SPEAKER_00]: taken a position on SB 930 or did not take
a position.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my view which I expressed to the
author, and to the sponsor, that the bill
[SPEAKER_00]: had some infirmities simply because of the
economics of the banking business and the
[SPEAKER_00]: manner in which new banks are set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now having said that, I was reminded of a
story that I was told by former State
[SPEAKER_00]: Senator Art Torres, who back in the,
I'm thinking now middle 1980s,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of you are old enough to remember PSA
Airlines and Air Cow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gasoline prices went up, and airfares
from Southern California went up with
[SPEAKER_00]: them, and Senator Torres in a politically
brilliant move said, I've got a great
[SPEAKER_00]: idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get these guys to the table if I
introduce a bill suggesting that we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: state airline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly everybody from the airline
started to show up in Sacramento to
[SPEAKER_00]: discuss fair regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was my view to Senator Hertzberg,
because I'm not a political expert by any
[SPEAKER_00]: means, but it was my view to Senator
Hertzberg and to the sponsor of the bill
[SPEAKER_00]: that SB 930 will have accomplished an
awful lot if you simply get the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything you can do to get the
conversation started, and even if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: grunting and sweating, to make that ball
move forward just a couple of inches is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I think you can expect to see it
back.
Thank you.
