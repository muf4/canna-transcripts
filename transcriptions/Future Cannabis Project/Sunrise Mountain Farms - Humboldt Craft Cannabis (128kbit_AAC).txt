[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're here today with Dave and Laura
Lee of Sunrise Mountain Farms,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're going to learn a little bit
about their farm and their flowers that
[SPEAKER_02]: they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hey, guys, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us a little bit about how you got
started in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the background?
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, I've always had a love of cannabis
ever since I was a teenager.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just moving out to Humboldt County,
I actually came here because it was just a
[SPEAKER_01]: really beautiful place that talked to me
and called me in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then being here, I kind of just got
into the I got my eyes opened up to the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just kind of felt like it was
something I just started to play with
[SPEAKER_01]: because I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then next thing I knew, I just really
connected with it and found myself kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: immersed in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long and how long has that been for
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been 21 years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's that's a stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, as far as what you do
for farming, I mean, is it for is it more
[SPEAKER_02]: for the you like some people do it for the
plants, some people do it for the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, where do you stand with?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I kind of like play around both of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like the connection to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the medicine that it's creating
that's going to the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I got into cannabis also about 20
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 22 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I started, it was in southern
Humboldt and I got to learn from people
[SPEAKER_00]: who had been doing it for like 20 years
before me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like it was kind of a privilege
to learn from people who had been growing
[SPEAKER_00]: organically in harmony with nature,
but still like they were gorilla growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but in like a really this kind of
sustainable way where it wasn't like
[SPEAKER_00]: trashing nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and then I also got to work with
people who were working breeding a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was really exciting for me,
because I was finding medical benefit from
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I've always wanted to bring
organic medicine to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you guys been doing it for quite
some time now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to talk a little about Sunrise
Mountain Farms?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what makes your farm, you know,
your farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I purchased the property about 18
years ago and have been cultivating there
[SPEAKER_00]: for 18 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super very small scale, of course,
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, and so we've had a long time to
work in that location and really get to
[SPEAKER_00]: know our terroir and really get to know
like what works and what doesn't work and
[SPEAKER_00]: the influences of the climate and the soil
and even different locations on our
[SPEAKER_00]: property.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was curious about that,
because you guys I watch you guys on
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been your farm yet, even though
I would like to visit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I see you guys are up at higher
elevations.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's about twenty two hundred feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The property ranges between twenty two and
twenty six.
[SPEAKER_01]: The the farm itself is probably right in
the middle of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, and you know, it's been you
know, we talked about like 18 years and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's so the property has been like a slow
evolution of what our vision has been.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and so it's not like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We came in and like a lot of people just
bulldoze and put a garden in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like we really connected with the
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like homesteading style.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always grew with fruit trees and
plants and, you know, companion planting
[SPEAKER_00]: and permaculture has always been a part of
our gardening practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used to work with making teas and
just experiment a lot, because back like
[SPEAKER_00]: 15, 20 years ago, you know, there wasn't
really very much knowledge about growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, now you can like just look
up anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were just really like really fun
and exciting to like experiment with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also scary at times when there's
like helicopters flying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so it was just really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be part of that kind of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have anything unique, you know,
that you do like something that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you do in your farm,
like compa mulching, compost teas,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, recycle it or anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: The past five years, I've been getting
into the KNF and JDOM methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really just breaking away from buying
any nutrients and just really looking to
[SPEAKER_01]: the land and also sourcing stuff that are
more like organic fruits and vegetables
[SPEAKER_01]: and then finding every year is always so
much more learning that goes in with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so being able to take old products and
turn it into fertilizer, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: forest microbes and the IMOs and just the
ferments and just bringing that into the
[SPEAKER_01]: fold and not having to rely on store
bought products and our results every year
[SPEAKER_01]: been getting better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like seems like the more we're
breaking away from that and just getting
[SPEAKER_01]: into this idea and to go back also with
Laura Lee was saying when we got started,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we had our gardens mixed in with our
fruit trees and our vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of regulation, we had to
switch a lot of things around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to move our garden spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our garden itself, like,
you know, it's like part of it is older,
[SPEAKER_01]: but really a lot of it is newer because we
had to move things around and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just consolidated parts because
we had these little microclinics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's like this area that's here's the
cannabis, you know, and so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we're working on like that kind
of newer garden to add more plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit trees to that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we did move our garden,
we actually took some of that old soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of that old soil and we moved it to
the new site because we've been soil
[SPEAKER_00]: building for 15 years, you know,
more than, yeah, for the years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, we've been soil building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to bring that, you know,
to the new garden site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're working on developing that
more there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also like how to capture water
just by how you're designing your your
[SPEAKER_01]: plot, you know, so we have a slope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we worked with swales, you know,
so on the slopes, we have our swales to
[SPEAKER_01]: capture all that rainwater and hold that
snow when it does come down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the right below that, we did mounds
because it flattens out a little bit to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of help capture any kind of runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we just store that water as it's
raining and coming down when it's present.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's there for the plants later on.
Like better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you talking about storing in an above
ground or just in the actual soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just stays so if the beds are
nearby, the moisture level general in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground is higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a permaculture technique where
it's like swales will kind of collect the
[SPEAKER_00]: water, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been really like awesome to be
able to implement all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: ideas into what Sunrise Mountain is now
and what we're shaping it and forming it
[SPEAKER_01]: to be, you know, because now in our new
area that we are farming, we are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporate the companion planting and the
fruit trees again and start bringing in
[SPEAKER_01]: these elements that kind of make it more
of a whole like one whole holistic kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think you guys are going to do
like, because I don't know, in my mind,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like if you have to have the cannabis
plot in one area, then like the borders on
[SPEAKER_02]: the outside of that would be where you
have the permaculture systems like
[SPEAKER_02]: running.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it works best that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we do also we kind of experiment
every year with like growing plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: companion planting like within the
cannabis beds too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then sometimes that can block airflow
and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has to be the right kind of plants
like chamomile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love chamomile.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did carrots one year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two years ago, I planted a huge row of
carrots down in a flower bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was wild how many ladybugs came in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you some photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the only thing, a caveat I would
say is that there was increased water
[SPEAKER_02]: usage and increased fertilization
requirements to maintain both plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I tried this year was the potatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, I will follow Nick on Green
Source Gardens, you know, and he kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: turned me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I listened to this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: With him and Shango Lois, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just was like, oh, potatoes,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, it was awesome because it
created an awesome living mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're eating potatoes throughout
the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it didn't interfere with the plants at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, it was kind of nice because
what I found with that living mulch,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was a little higher,
it made my plants not so much just go
[SPEAKER_01]: outward to fill their space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the potatoes started to die back
and it came time for like pruning time,
[SPEAKER_01]: it really like the plant structure was
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was helped shape by that higher living
canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so can you do me a favor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm a stickler for detail
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give me an idea of the base
planting?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the potatoes were planted around the
base of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can give you exactly as a 40 foot row
that's four feet wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have the plants running right down
the center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had the potatoes right along the
edges.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might try that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just planted a row of garlic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe on the other side, I'll try.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another plus to that, too,
is also if you have rodent problems,
[SPEAKER_01]: like ground rodent, moles and bowls and
things, they don't really particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: like the potatoes because they get in the
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of a sudden, you're creating
another barrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the stuff we've done in
developing is also wiring our beds to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground rodents out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's always ways they find their
way in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a unique to you guys situation
because we're not very far apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe as a crow flies five or 10 miles,
but I'm only at 200 feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the valley, we don't have any
problems with rodents.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be like one errant one that comes
through once in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys have to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: See the complexities of farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every site has its own complexities.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I'm going to try the potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I got tuned in with potatoes
from Alpenglow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Craig was telling me about it because I
was researching symphalins and dealing
[SPEAKER_02]: with symphalins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe the potatoes were actually like
a good addition to a garden to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: mitigate maybe their problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives them a food to go to.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: As opposed to the root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's the argument of like why
you're attracting them in too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's all very valid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think the science is settled on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's an interesting, interesting time
to research it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting about your farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think now we should look and check out
your really cool flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: See what you guys got here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we looking at here?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is our hot berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that there is a new strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We phenohaunted that and we actually bred
that on the property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our creme de luna, which is a
cultivar that we've been growing now for
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also crossed with this triple
berry goo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can, yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aff goo crossed with blueberry,
razzleberry, and I'm kind of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, man, it's berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's berry with a sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a sour thing and it almost has a
hint of cheese or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like a creamy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really the creme de luna.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's got different factory,
you know, pick up different scents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's really complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a complex profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, again, I hate to use the word
since we're trying to get away from indica
[SPEAKER_02]: and sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really like a kind of a balanced
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our creme de luna, which we've been
growing for 12 years, like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's super indica, really good for sleep,
muscle spasms and relaxing and really good
[SPEAKER_00]: for like bringing your focus in the creme
de luna.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we yeah, really like bring your focus
into one focus or quieting your mind at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really high in mercine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we cross that with more of the
daytime strain, which is the berries,
[SPEAKER_00]: the triple berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that brings it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's pineine in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so it's actually mercine,
pineine, really berry flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of there's some
sesquiterpines in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like a lot of kind of micro
terpenes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was this super frosty?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, interesting flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really high quality outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we were really stoked on its
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the plant itself is just is just
the beauty.
[SPEAKER_01]: She really just wants to be admired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big fat trichomes on these beautiful
formation buds and long colas,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the I know people are so into
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the THC on that was 32 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, hey, that doesn't hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then total terpenes or yeah,
total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, total cannabinoids were 37 or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty strong stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: DZ3.
[SPEAKER_01]: DZ3.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, DZ3 is a dozyzose bred by Green
Fire Dynionics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are coining it, the DZ3, to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two different phenos that we grow
on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we want to have a different name to
kind of like just help the customers
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that there are two different
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're different from each other
because one leans towards skittles,
[SPEAKER_00]: one leads more towards docydo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can complete.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smell the skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's got that real candy and with
the with the gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that gas mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a candy gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Candy gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Candy gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: The custies or the custies will pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: DZ3 leans towards the skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's chunky too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chunky and the flavor like that nose comes
through in the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually work with Papa Select with
that to make live rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got 10th and Emerald Cup with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gets up there, gets a little Yeah,
so it's a recognized DZ3.
[SPEAKER_00]: DZ3 is also kind of a more of a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to smoke it during the day or
early evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's super flavorful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has like a little hint of lemongrass,
kind of tropical fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty euphoric.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of like the euphoric.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was going to say it's kind of
trippy psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might have to take a bite of this with
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you should.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then strawberry CBG CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry G is a CBD variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been growing it for about five years
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We Fino hunted it about five years ago,
along with a lot of other CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really like this one for the plant
structure, the way it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also the effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually a two to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's closer to a one to one,
depending on the year and the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental factors, because it changes
slightly.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to wait, but I might as well
interject now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what makes your farm unique is you
guys, you're Fino, I shouldn't say Fino,
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivar hunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cultivar hunting and breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as opposed to just like getting what's
on the market, you're doing more of your
[SPEAKER_02]: own breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love growing our own strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like part of what makes it so fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take this amazing strain and that
strain and let's make like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of like the medicine that that can
create for people, like bringing these
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes together with those or these
different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like we, you know,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, you know, Fino hunting,
the amazing work of other breeders,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and so we were able to find
these unique cultivars within these
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and pick the best one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should give you guys some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some pretty interesting genetics
that I was breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should give you guys some afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little love to try it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the strawberry G is, we Fino hunted
that, it's MTG seeds, strawberry
[SPEAKER_01]: godfather.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we Fino hunted that and we luckily
enough tested and kept that one and found
[SPEAKER_01]: out that it was a CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, you know, let's keep this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from that, we're just,
we love smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very relaxing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we tend to also make other products
out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have a tincture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what this is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a tincture there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also have a pre-roll that's
infused with the Keef of the strawberry G
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gives you a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I don't know, as I get older,
I almost lean more towards the CBD rate
[SPEAKER_02]: balanced ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Balanced ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like actually CBD and THC work
synergistically together and it just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of amplifies the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also, they balance each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might not get as high, but your
body is going to feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really kind of more medicinal because
I think like, you know, breeders and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Triangle here for decades have
been growing, you know, we weren't testing
[SPEAKER_00]: things or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been growing for like this
euphoric feeling, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, CBD doesn't give you that euphoric
feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's so many strains that are super
high THC and people are really into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the CBD is really great for anxiety or
you're just kind of calming their nervous
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I have a lot of sports
injuries, like achy bones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pain, achiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: It relieves the achiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, that's what CBD does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great for that too, for chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a lot of people give us feedback
about our tincture and smoking the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really works.
[SPEAKER_00]: For them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also we got feedback from
retailers, dispensaries that that strain
[SPEAKER_00]: was really helping their patients who were
having seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really good for, you know,
for some people perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to make any medical claims or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that we, you know,
it's a cultivar that we grow because we
[SPEAKER_01]: know it's true medicine, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's hard to not, it's not like the
favorite in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to be honest with you, there's a niche
of the market that really looks for that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a medicine and it tends to lean
toward those folks who aren't looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: that punch in the face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's like, I mean, you correct me if
I'm out of place here, but the boomer
[SPEAKER_02]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, dude, I was told, you're right
there with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my parents come visit me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give them, I give them strawberry gin.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, this is the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give them something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, whoa, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I'm holding on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you hand me that pre-roll box,
I'd love to open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also have the strawberry G in this
pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it opens up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's all sealed up right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a knife if you want to crack it.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, there we go.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I worked really hard on the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I create all the packaging, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was working with a box maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: We figured out how to make a triangular
box.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, oh, it's a little tray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like a little tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a picture of the strawberry G
plant inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terroir matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it talks about our terroir.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try to stay away from plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We totally stay away from plastic and
mylar because we're really environmentally
conscious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a big enough vial to actually
reuse for multiple other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we really encourage people to reuse
these glass tubes.
Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's lovely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for sharing all that stuff,
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think probably the final question would
be, in light of everything that's happened
[SPEAKER_02]: in the industry, what's one thing you
would like to see changed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if you had to pick just one thing
you could change either with education or
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation, what do you think would make
the most impact?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one thing that would really make a
huge impact is if we were allowed to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: directly to our consumer base.
[SPEAKER_01]: So farmer market style or just supporting
the small farmers in a way that connects
[SPEAKER_01]: us to our consumer base so that the
consumer base can really understand what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing, what we're creating,
where we came from, and what the medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're producing together can give to
them or bring to them is really all about.
I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that avenues to sales for us,
more retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not having to go through distributors that
all have their own brands that they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to always push their own brands first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're kind of like, oh,
yeah, yeah, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there were distributors that didn't
have their own brands, that would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That model in California I think would
work better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people are pushing their own
brand and business as they should.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're direct to consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do make our own sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: I connect with buyers myself, calling
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, a lot of the work that I do
now is bookkeeping and really the
[SPEAKER_00]: administrative kind of stuff and sales and
marketing and packaging and all that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've kind of transitioned from
farming for years to kind of doing
[SPEAKER_00]: administrative stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dave is really on the farm more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't wait to try some of your
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very excited, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Russell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.
Thanks a lot.
