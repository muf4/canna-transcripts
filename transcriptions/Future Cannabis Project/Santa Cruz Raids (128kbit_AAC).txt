[SPEAKER_00]: Hi y'all doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to talk about what's going on in
Santa Cruz today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some updates about what went on and
my understanding is that some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: properties that were being hit today they
had search warrants for and others they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't and in one instance that I had
discussed with somebody they basically
[SPEAKER_00]: used the new laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are in Santa Cruz County and
if you're on Ben Rice's email list you
[SPEAKER_00]: would have gotten the notice about how
what they did was they altered all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation that allowed them to to abate
and fine people and they basically took
[SPEAKER_00]: away a bunch of our rights with regards to
appeals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made the kangaroo court even more of
a kangaroo court and they've upped the
[SPEAKER_00]: fines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like now every gram of concentrate or
every gram of flour you can be fined ten
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars for.
[SPEAKER_00]: On top of that there's a hundred dollar a
plant citation so if you have 400 plants
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're looking at a forty thousand
dollar fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the tactics that was deployed
today was that they showed up at
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody's property who had everything in
a greenhouse there was no plants outside
[SPEAKER_00]: or visible from the sky but they
threatened them and said hey you can
[SPEAKER_00]: either self abate or we are going to be
back in a couple days with the search
[SPEAKER_00]: warrants and then you'll have to pay a
bunch of the fines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I want to do is A I want to talk
to everybody out there about being
[SPEAKER_00]: prepared for these visits and B sort of
give you guys some of my ideas about how
[SPEAKER_00]: to deal with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is do not consent to a search.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that once you do so
regardless of what they're threatening you
[SPEAKER_00]: you've given up a bunch of your rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have very little recourse if you have
consented to a search.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter what they tell you whether
they show you a warrant because sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: they're showing you bogus bullshit do not
consent to a search.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the first thing that everybody out
there needs to be aware of and what
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody needs to be doing is when you
see them walk up to them with your camera
[SPEAKER_00]: on and record it and whether it's live
streaming here on Instagram Facebook or
[SPEAKER_00]: any other platform where it can be up in
the cloud make sure that you are recording
[SPEAKER_00]: what is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Record that interaction because we need to
be able to document their harassment and
[SPEAKER_00]: their encroachment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a lawyer I've read a bunch of
stuff and I've been doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Audible has a great library of law books
but I think that there's grounds to
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge even a consented search when the
consent was made under the duress of a
[SPEAKER_00]: threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you know this is something that we
are always told and I'm guilty as charged
[SPEAKER_00]: as well that sometimes in the heat of the
moment when you're surrounded by 12
[SPEAKER_00]: officers with AR-15s jacked up on steroids
and in bulletproof vests and you're at
[SPEAKER_00]: home with your family it becomes really
difficult to just say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to start saying no.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to start taking a stance and we
need to stop allowing them to walk all
[SPEAKER_00]: over us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we prepare for this bullshit that's
going to be coming I want to remind
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody out there do not consent to a
search.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to leave the property leave if
they try to stop you or ask you a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions tell them that you were not
discussing your day and if they continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to hold you back ask them if you
are if you are being detained and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't being detained and you aren't under
arrest then you should be allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: But make sure that you document everything
and that it's really important to record
[SPEAKER_00]: them because as we start to coalesce there
is no we yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now there's a bunch of us that are
pissed and nobody's actually getting
[SPEAKER_00]: together and organizing but I'm hoping
that like given the given the further
[SPEAKER_00]: encroachment that some of us are going to
wake up and start to smell the coffee that
[SPEAKER_00]: laying down and taking this shit isn't
going to get us any further.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to lead to more and if you
hear what's coming out of their mouth and
[SPEAKER_00]: you hear what's coming out of my mouth
other people's mouths from the last year
[SPEAKER_00]: we warned you guys that this was going to
happen this year and they warned us they
[SPEAKER_00]: said that they're going to be back and the
way and based on conversations that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: had with people that have been hit this
year is that this isn't the end of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're going to continue to throw
out this season and they're coming back
[SPEAKER_00]: next season.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what we we do have the power to
make change and the power to make change
[SPEAKER_00]: has happened in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past we had to run a referendum
those things are not cheap and in the past
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been blessed to have big donors and
maybe a lot of those big donors have moved
[SPEAKER_00]: on to other counties and you can't blame
them because this is not a climate for any
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of business to thrive in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean that we don't have
what it takes to make things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was over 300 properties that were
hit and each one contributed $500 to a
[SPEAKER_00]: legal fund that's $150,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: $150,000 goes a long way that would allow
us to A, run an initiative or B,
[SPEAKER_00]: file a lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have all the answers but but I'm
just trying to brainstorm and try to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out what it is that we can do as a
community to stand up against the
[SPEAKER_00]: oppression and the encroachment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's really going to
begin with us unifying and even if that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just something small like forming like a
mountain landowners mountain homesteaders
[SPEAKER_00]: organization where we can start addressing
more than just the cannabis concerns
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think that when you just talk
about everything and with regards to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis it falls upon deaf ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of us out there out here
that have made this our home and we care
[SPEAKER_00]: about a lot more than just being the right
to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We care about fire safety and community
safety and standards and health and there
[SPEAKER_00]: are a bunch of topics that we as growers
in the community can get around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes we do need lobbyists but you know who
the best lobbyists are?
[SPEAKER_00]: We.
[SPEAKER_00]: We.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we jump together we are the citizens
of this county.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the ones that need to unite and
make our voices heard so that when we get
[SPEAKER_00]: together we form a voting bloc.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be awesome to have full-time
professional lobbyists but the reality is
[SPEAKER_00]: that a lot of the money has dried up
because of the encroachment because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures because of the chopping back of
the plants and so a lot of us are
[SPEAKER_00]: struggling and so we don't have the money
to just fight them the same way but we can
[SPEAKER_00]: fight them in an asymmetric warfare by
finding commonalities with other organized
[SPEAKER_00]: groups working to support their causes in
exchange for them supporting our causes
[SPEAKER_00]: and even if we all if there was 300 of us
and we all we all committed to donating 50
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks a month to a cause in in a year
we've saved we've already saved $300 a
[SPEAKER_00]: piece 300 times 300 that's 90 thousand
dollars that goes a long way and we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to stop playing the short game we need to
go the long game they like they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking with us for years and they will
continue to do so so I don't know this is
[SPEAKER_00]: just my fucking rant because they're about
to vote up some of this beautiful Cuban
[SPEAKER_00]: black haze aka uptown pif grown by my man
jay family trees who's killing it I took
[SPEAKER_00]: the family off the mountain today and it's
been a stressful day as we try to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: further harassment but I'm just reaching
out to the community today to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: inspire some action and if anybody out
there is listening and wants to take part
[SPEAKER_00]: and be involved hit me in the DM we're
gonna start we're going to start rallying
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a that's a big shout out to my men
supercat the original wild Apache yeah I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know I don't have anything really
more productive to say at this point I
[SPEAKER_00]: just wanted to get that off my chest that
we need we need to unify we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: organize we need to start talking about
things start taking action and I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that everybody out there who's
getting ready to be rated is prepared to
[SPEAKER_00]: let them know that you do not consent to a
search regardless of whether they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: warrant or not and make sure that you
record your interaction with them please
[SPEAKER_00]: take those steps because the more that we
can the more that we can organize and
[SPEAKER_00]: record and document their encroachments
the more the game plan will come together
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't have to have the game plan
together right now but at least we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: to work on getting it together and that's
gonna start by just taking small actions
[SPEAKER_00]: so again I'm gonna repeat it one more time
or probably the tenth time since I've gone
[SPEAKER_00]: live be prepared for their visits when
they come please do not consent to a
[SPEAKER_00]: search keep your mouth shut they're gonna
ask you a bunch of questions you just have
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell them that you're not here to
discuss your day and their standard
[SPEAKER_00]: questions happen to be is there cannabis
on the property do you have a firearms
[SPEAKER_00]: they're looking for any in to squeeze you
so exercise your right to remain silent
[SPEAKER_00]: exercise your right to not consent to a
search and record everything and spread
[SPEAKER_00]: the word run tell that as I contemplate
and discuss this with a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_00]: people I will be becoming more vocal and
active in sharing my thoughts with regards
[SPEAKER_00]: to how we can defend against their
encroachment I want everybody to remember
[SPEAKER_00]: that while it seems like they're winning
they're actually scared there have been
[SPEAKER_00]: cases that have come up recently where the
DA and the Sheriff's Office have been
[SPEAKER_00]: purposely withholding evidence and even
against judges wishes why the only time
[SPEAKER_00]: that you do that is if you have something
to hide and why do they hide it because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're scared to lose power so if you do
wind up in one of those situations I
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage you not to just take the
dismissal push push if they're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: hide something it's worth getting and I'm
sure that the community will be here and
[SPEAKER_00]: if it isn't looking and we'll find a way
man much love to all of you thank you for
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to my rant I hope everybody has
a blessed day big up respect yourself fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: the police let's let's beat this swine flu
it's worse than COVID you you you you
