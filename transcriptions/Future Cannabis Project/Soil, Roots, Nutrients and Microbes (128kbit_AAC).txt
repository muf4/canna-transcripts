[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Colin Bell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the co-founder and chief growth
officer for Mammoth Microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our company develops liquid organic
microbial soil additives that act as a
[SPEAKER_02]: catalyst to maximize plant nutrient uptake
to significantly increase plant yield and
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient use efficiency across many crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was attending the talk today on
maximizing a fertility program for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and it was just an amazing job of
dialing in the function of specific
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients across the growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the critical part of
understanding how to grow a crop with
[SPEAKER_02]: precision is understanding how the key
nutrients incorporate into the plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: how the plants are using those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this talk was very, very well done
about understanding the timing of
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients and how they're incorporated
into the biomolecules for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go real quickly into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, the highest requirements that
cannabis has are for nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium, magnesium, iron, and boron.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has, it needs all of the nutrients like
all plants, but those are the hot button
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other requirements are very
pedestrian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most all potting media that people produce
cannabis in are phosphorus deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants need phosphorus early to grow a
root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, beneficial microbes can
help with phosphorus availability and
[SPEAKER_00]: maintenance as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really comment on microbes today
because that was not the topic of my talk,
[SPEAKER_00]: but plants need phosphorus early to grow
that root system out.
[SPEAKER_00]: During veg, I like a one to one ratio of
nitrogen to potash.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start to flower, you want to drop
your nitrogen down and increase your
[SPEAKER_00]: potash at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you kind of do that through late bloom
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at finish, most people just flush
all the nutrients out for the last couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's four distinct phases of growth
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're doing it correctly,
you fertilize them all a bit differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cannabis has one of the highest
requirements for boron of any crop I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also mentioned that almost all mother
plants are deficient in magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers don't put enough magnesium on
their mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you often see marginal yellowing in
the older leaves of mother plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a lack of chlorophyll,
which is caused just by taking cuttings
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're removing a lot of magnesium from
the plant as you harvest your cuttings or
[SPEAKER_00]: your clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore you need to replace that
magnesium with fertilization.
What was the thing
about the balance and the intake?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the short version of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a pretty heavy feeder,
but it's also very soluble salt sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a normal situation, if my fingers are
plant roots, the salt content in the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: roots is higher than the surrounding soil
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moisture goes very easily into the
roots by osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant doesn't have to work because
water molecules are a little bit kidney
[SPEAKER_00]: shaped and they're charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water molecules stick together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as water goes in, it goes up the
plant and out the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, when you add too much salts
around the roots, that osmotic advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: is lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put enough salts around the roots,
moisture is pulled out of the root cells
[SPEAKER_00]: back into the soil by reverse osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how fertilizer burns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why a plant with high soluble
salts looks wilted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though the media is wet, it is wilted
because the plant can't take in the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture that's there because of the salt
differential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just trying to explain in simple
terms, physiologically, how fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: burns.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question that I'd like a lens
opinion on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of those things is, as growers are
evolving and trying to distinguish
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves, everyone needs to still get
that yield and maximize yield,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're trying to maximize the quality
within their phenotypes as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the hypothesis we have is the
deficiency of micronutrients to enhance
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant's ability to incorporate those
molecules and maximize cannabinoid and
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like that's true in the grows
that you've seen where micronutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: might be undervalued in their nutrient
program?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, yes, Colin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also for organic growers, getting good
quality available micros can be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit problematic for the organic side of
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, sure, you know, you've seen
the barrel thing probably in your first
[SPEAKER_00]: week in college where, you know,
we need more protein than we need vitamin
[SPEAKER_00]: B12 as humans, but we need them both
equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants only need about five parts per
million copper, but they need copper just
[SPEAKER_00]: as much as they need nitrogen and
phosphorus and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main things that micronutrients do
in plants is they drive enzymatic chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: reactions in the plant to make things like
terpenes and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miners are, you know, you can't neglect
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So although the macro elements incorporate
and make these proteins or enzymes,
[SPEAKER_02]: which do all the work, there's co-factors
that actually incorporate into these
[SPEAKER_02]: proteins or these enzymes to allow them to
function.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are typically in the form of
trace nutrients, micronutrients or trace
[SPEAKER_02]: metals.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Iron is another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is iron important for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the ones that it has the
highest requirement for.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no iron in chlorophyll,
but plants need iron to make chlorophyll,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why when they become deficient,
you lose chlorophyll in the new foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron is also involved in a lot of
respiration and energy type processes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why when you often see a plant
with iron deficiency, you'll see it kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of stunted as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not only lacking in chlorophyll in
the new leaves, but the carbohydrate
[SPEAKER_00]: management is not functioning optimally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think the biggest education
gap for fertility program is in general
[SPEAKER_02]: for cannabis cultivators as this industry
progresses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tough question, Colin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, number one, there used to be
a lot of voodoo in this industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of eye of newt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, everybody's got their own
little secret, you know, formulas and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't have any problem with
that, but I think that's going away slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: and being replaced by science and
chemistry and microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think growers are gradually growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're becoming a little more technical
and a little more knowledgeable in that
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they blow me away with how
much science some of them really do know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, horticulture to me is an art as well
as a science.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, there's a scientific
aspect to it, but sometimes it's just that
[SPEAKER_00]: green thumb feel thing and we do things
that cannabis responds to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't always know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just know that they like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say they're just becoming more
scientific and less artsy craftsy,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I can use that word.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's inherent partially with the
history of this crop where it has been in
[SPEAKER_02]: the gray market, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're able to work with it more
openly and we can gather that science
[SPEAKER_02]: where in every other crop we have pretty
good agronomy science around the fertility
[SPEAKER_02]: programs, corn all the way to tomatoes,
fruits, or strawberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is quickly growing, even mammoth
microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a 65 acre high CBD farm and
several 5,000 square foot greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all we do is agronomic research to
understand plant responses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is not only with yield,
but root development, terpene production,
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid production, and everything we
can do just to maximize the phenotypic
[SPEAKER_01]: potential across different strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us as microbiologists, and I think,
you know, some of our team, we can be
[SPEAKER_02]: characterized as world thought leaders.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this area, we're understanding and
we're trying to figure out how to stress
[SPEAKER_02]: or instigate chemical signaling with the
microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's obviously a nutrient use
efficiency aspect that microbes provide
[SPEAKER_02]: where you can maximize nitrogen,
or phosphorus, or sulfur, or potassium,
[SPEAKER_02]: or even micronutrient uptake through
simple or pretty standard biogeochemical
[SPEAKER_02]: cycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what microbes do in nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants interact with microbes in nature to
maximize plant nutrient use efficiency,
[SPEAKER_02]: maximizing availability of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Microbes do several things, but plants are
environmentally triggered.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Lynn, I want you to key in on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can initiate some chemical
signaling where microbes are triggering a
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical or a signal to allow plants to
say, hey, I need to respond to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can respond to it through a
cannabinoid production or a terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can actually engineer that,
meaning that we can introduce that
[SPEAKER_02]: particular chemical signal through a
microbial interaction you can train plants
[SPEAKER_02]: not to do things that they're not
genetically capable of, but to express
[SPEAKER_02]: that gene to maximize that particular
trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would say two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, for years, we couldn't do
research on cannabis legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's all pretty well out the window,
and we can do the type of research that
[SPEAKER_00]: you and others are conducting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, nobody knows this,
I'm sure you do, Colin, but the average
[SPEAKER_00]: tablespoon of healthy field soil contains
four billion microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about 1% of the dry weight of that
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I cut my hands like this and hold soil,
I have more microbes in my hand than there
[SPEAKER_00]: are people on this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how important microbes are to plant
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good key that you can use,
Rob, in your customer calling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, soil is media that we do
with indoor growing is often, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: well deficient in nutritional content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that needs to be inoculated
and you need carbon sources to help
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know this better than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, don't, you know, to answer your
previous question, what's the thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're most not familiar with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil microbiology is a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: One reason it's a very complicated
subject, you know, it's deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what you're getting into is deep
in the pool in terms of chemical signaling
[SPEAKER_00]: and microbial interactions and all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complicated field and it's hard
even for more technical growers to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stated earlier, cannabis has a higher
boron requirement than just about any crop
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said in my talk that boron is involved
in translocation and utilization of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates, which is a fancy way of
saying boron helps the plant make sugars
[SPEAKER_00]: and move them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need that when you come to forming
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants can grow perfectly well
vegetatively with not very much boron,
[SPEAKER_00]: but by flower time, you better have the
boron there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem, of course, is that boron
toxicity is the most common toxicity in
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in most plants, if you are 25
parts per million in the leaf tissue or
[SPEAKER_00]: below, you're deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're above 75 or 100,
you're toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only about a 50 to 75 part per
million window in the leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the boron requirement was very
surprising to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that's probably the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also, when I started working with
cannabis, a bit shocked at how soluble
[SPEAKER_00]: salt sensitive it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost every grower I've ever worked
with at times has gotten into soluble salt
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble, which is why I did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This finger thing in the talk today to
explain to them what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: One cool trick if you have a grower with
high soluble salts, sugar water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get with about five pounds of sugar
per hundred gallons or some molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a carbon source that stimulates the
microbes to eat the fertilizer salts up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if growers do that, Ohio State
University came up with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my experience with it is if you drench
with sugar water, you'll lower your salts
[SPEAKER_00]: by 50 percent in about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because of the microbial
interaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: You talk about how the microbes interact
with the plant roots to reduce what
[SPEAKER_02]: growers typically call the lockout,
where nutrients might be unavailable,
[SPEAKER_02]: but microbes can actually cycle that,
balance the rhizosphere or the root zone
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So roots can actually take up nutrients in
a healthy manner and not have to worry
[SPEAKER_02]: about focusing blow ground, but can focus
on above ground because there's no lockout
[SPEAKER_02]: or stalemate of nutrient uptake in the
root and rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people swear by it and some people
say, I think it depends on your growing
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy and your strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think they're stressing the
plant a little bit nutritionally and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get, you know, better terpene
production, better CBD production with the
[SPEAKER_00]: flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some say that with ingestibles or
smokeables that you get a better flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: less harshness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's not a universal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a point of contention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, and more so in cannabis than any crop
I've ever worked with anywhere in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably worked with a thousand crops,
you know, doing what I do as a diagnostic
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when growers would get into
trouble, they'd send me stuff just like
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they do to you, Colin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just the genetics, we've been
breeding cannabis for 6,500 years on this
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the genetic diversity in cannabis
is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, yes, you need to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to learn how to grow your strain,
both with fertility inputs and lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: and irrigation and microbial inoculants
and just the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a believer in flushing,
but not everybody is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I respect that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hear from growers that when you flush,
you get a cleaner end product,
[SPEAKER_02]: meaning if you even look at the color of
the ash, it's white instead of dark and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's allocated or associated with a high
salt or chemical buildup that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: burning cleanly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think about that as just diluting
the salts that are taken up by the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand it well enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most the growers that I talk to,
at least the synthetic growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: do flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: The organic growers, not so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that there's a real need to
do that in organic systems just because of
[SPEAKER_02]: the nature of the nutrient inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's harder to flush when you're
growing organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please understand, I'm not against organic
growing in any way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do it right, you can grow a
heck of a crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you were talking about foliar nutrient
applications, and they're very popular in
[SPEAKER_02]: many crops, especially nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my question was specifically is there
a different uptake for different nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: when you try to do foliar applications?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think your answer was yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to go into that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The corn and wheat research shows that
urea nitrogen and potassium, 50% of that
[SPEAKER_00]: can be absorbed within eight hours of
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: The micronutrients are really slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes like four days to get 8% of the
foliar iron into a leaf, at least in those
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants don't absorb foliar nutrients
well at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants with thick, heavy, waxy leaves like
rhododendrons or privets just don't absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just too thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and a lot of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But plants with thinner leaves,
with thinner cuticles absorb foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Palm trees are terrible at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in the tropics, and palm trees just
don't absorb foliar nutrition very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some plants like cannabis,
which has a pretty thin, delicate leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: are pretty good absorbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ratio and the speed of absorption
varies quite a bit with the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a follow-up question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You made a really good point that when you
add a foliar application, the nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: are only going to be absorbed when the
leaves are still wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it's dry, no more absorption.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you re-wet the leaves to take up more
of those nutrients?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: In outdoor agriculture, once it dries,
there's no more absorption until you get
[SPEAKER_00]: fog or dew or a little bit of rainfall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you re-wet the leaf, absorption
resumes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, so that residual will become soluble
and be able to take up by the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also don't believe in applying real high
amounts, real high rates of foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep the rates lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a range that you could give just
very generally?
[SPEAKER_00]: In cannabis, if the conductivity of your
nutritional spray is above about 1.8,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be a little uncomfortable.
Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is if you spray real high rates
of foliar nutrients, the osmotic
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration in the droplet is such that
as the droplet dries, and the salts become
[SPEAKER_00]: more concentrated in the droplet,
moisture is pulled again by osmosis out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf into the droplet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're actually promoting transpiration
instead of absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather apply lower rates more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the absorption isn't that terribly
efficient for most of the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The analogy I always use is if this
microphone is a Pepsi bottle, and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to catch Niagara Falls in the Pepsi
bottle, if I double the size of Niagara
[SPEAKER_00]: Falls, what goes in my Pepsi bottle is
still the same amount because the Pepsi
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle to me represents the limited
ability to get foliar nutrition into a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foliar nutrition is real efficient in
correcting deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever the plant isn't getting,
it's real easy and efficient and cost
[SPEAKER_00]: effective to just put some foliar on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big believer in foliar nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many plants, it goes in better from
underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is that a lot of the absorption
takes place through the stomates,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are those little pores in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many plants have more stomates on the
underside of the leaf than on the upper
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I don't know if cannabis is in
that category or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any ideas?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's true, but I actually don't
know 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get my microscope out and have a
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, there's more stomates on the
underside.
[SPEAKER_00]: B, the spray stays wet on the underside
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get better absorption from
the underside.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the extent a grower can, their foliar
nutrition should be directed upward.
[SPEAKER_02]: You made some really interesting comments
about silica applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using a foliar spray to add silica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Silicone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Silicone, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silica, go to the beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Silicone.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some really interesting functions
that might be anti-pathogen or anti-pest
[SPEAKER_02]: properties of the silica, where it fills
in those spaces and actually physically
[SPEAKER_02]: blocks infection sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's an interesting property of
the pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very alkaline, typically.
[SPEAKER_02]: The silica, do you think the pH pressure
itself might represent an antimicrobial,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, against powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the mechanism of that
resistance in the literature is from
[SPEAKER_00]: thicker cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: The alkalinity may have an effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of fungi grow better, I guess,
in lower pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering, why can you put a bottle
of Louisiana hot sauce on a restaurant
[SPEAKER_00]: table for six months and it doesn't go
bad?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacteria don't grow well at low pH,
and there's a lot of vinegar in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why hot sauce almost never goes
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well documented in the literature
that silicone helps plants resist aphids
[SPEAKER_00]: and mites as well as powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very well documented
scientifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one reason I like to have silicone
in my program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another reason is strong cell walls for
heavy bud formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about bud weight, ultimately,
and then the oil that you get out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last question for me regarding silicone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's equally effective being
applied as a root drench?
[SPEAKER_00]: Both are fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that potassium silicate tends
to precipitate with other fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on a grower's delivery system,
sometimes I'll just say, let's just put
[SPEAKER_00]: the silicone on foliarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they have an A and B tank dual delivery
system, I can put potassium silicate in
[SPEAKER_00]: with compatible nutrients in the B tank so
we don't have precipitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium silicate is completely insoluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes calcium and silicon, and it bombs
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you add it in with irrigation on a
day off from a fertigation?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did all kinds of compatibility studies
with my fertilizer program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have any problem with anything
until I put potassium silicate in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't play well with others,
so you either need to put it on generally
[SPEAKER_00]: by itself either through a drench or
irrigation application or as a foliar.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're extremely high dilution,
I would assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quarter of a hundred gallons on most of
the products, which is a one to four
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred dilution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't like to put a whole lot on
of anything at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want a reputation of burning
people's crops up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little conservative in my
application rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have clients who say, whatever Lynn
tells you, just double it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to take those chances.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can go on foliarly or it can go through
the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your roots have to be healthy and
functioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what Lynn is saying is less is more,
yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were a cannabis grower commercially,
which I'm not, the medium that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: choose would be a combination of coconut
fiber, Canadian sphagnum peat,
[SPEAKER_00]: and perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, most container media have
multiple ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for that is as they fall
together in different combinations,
[SPEAKER_00]: they create different types of pore space
for the roots to grow within.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, Canadian sphagnum is naturally
hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It repels water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coconut fiber is naturally hydrophilic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sphagnum peat is a fine medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been used for many, many decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow a heck of a root system when you
have coconut fiber in your mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's partly due to the physical
structure of coconut fiber and partly due
[SPEAKER_00]: to its high potassium content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put a little gypsum in there for
buffering and for calcium and sulfur
[SPEAKER_00]: availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coconut fiber is naturally high in
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's high in calcium and low in calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has a pretty good pH in the sixes,
so it doesn't need dolomite or limestone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to add calcium to it, gypsum is a
great and inexpensive way to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the benefit of calcium and sulfur
nutrition, and you also get some buffering
[SPEAKER_00]: to help keep your pH home.
Thank you.
I'll see you next time.
