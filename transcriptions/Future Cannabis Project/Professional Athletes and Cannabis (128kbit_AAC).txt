[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to our pro athletes and cannabis
panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is also for anybody that's an
athlete, whether you're 80 years old and
[SPEAKER_07]: you go for a walk in the evening,
like if you're a runner, you like to swim,
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever, anybody can use cannabis within
athletics.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're quite lucky to have these
high-end professional athletes up here
[SPEAKER_07]: with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the end of the day, this
information translates to everybody in the
[SPEAKER_07]: room.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I always like to analogize that we've
got these top pros, but I'll be the
[SPEAKER_07]: average Joe up here and all of you can
listen from my perspective as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also really call this panel
Marijuana Rebranded.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really, I think, since the year 2000
when Y2K, the world didn't end,
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody kind of started to doubt certain
things and people collectively,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, woke up conscious-wise in America
to the fact we were being lied to about
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's when the culture shift really,
to me, 2000 happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now, 18 years later, it's a beautiful
place to see where we are today.
[SPEAKER_07]: The true rebrand, really, marijuana was a
drug.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was bad for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bad people used it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It made you lazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It made you stupid.
[SPEAKER_07]: And even the word itself, marijuana,
I'm sure most of us know the connotations
[SPEAKER_07]: behind the word were not positive.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now, cannabis is a medicine and
cannabis is used for wellness and to help
[SPEAKER_07]: people and to fix seizures and enlightened
people use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So on that note, on the light of
enlightenment, I'm gonna start off by
[SPEAKER_07]: letting our panelists, starting with Al
here, introduce themselves instead of me
[SPEAKER_07]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess the way I'd love for you to
introduce yourself is tell us who you are
[SPEAKER_07]: and then tell us, really, ultimately,
the most important part, why you're here
[SPEAKER_07]: today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Al Harrington, former NBA
player.
[SPEAKER_05]: I played 17 years professional basketball
from Orange, New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now reside here in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I live on vacation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I'm doing here today,
obviously, is just to continue to raise
[SPEAKER_05]: awareness about the unbelievable benefits
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And quick on my story, I told you I grew
up in Jersey.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the war on drugs was really real where
I grew up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I either seen people getting locked up or
I was always taught to believe that
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis or marijuana at the time or
reefer, how people used to talk about it,
[SPEAKER_05]: where I'm from, was a gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: So throughout my whole life, especially me
going to the NBA out of high school,
[SPEAKER_05]: I was always afraid of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I got in the NBA, that was the
first time that I saw actually top-notch
[SPEAKER_05]: players actually using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the time, I still didn't understand
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It still didn't make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I looked down on my teammates that
used cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in 2011, my grandmother had come to
see me play when I was playing for the
[SPEAKER_05]: Denver Nuggets.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Denver is obviously one of the first
markets to have a medical program.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she suffered from glaucoma.
[SPEAKER_05]: And glaucoma is always the first thing
that cannabis was that actually healed,
[SPEAKER_05]: was something they considered to heal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was able to convince her to try
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was hard because she was the main
person growing up telling us that weed was
[SPEAKER_05]: a gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I was able to get her to try it,
I checked on her an hour and a half later.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I went downstairs, she was
downstairs reading her Bible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I asked her how she was doing,
she said, I'm healed.
[SPEAKER_05]: She said, it's the first time I've been
able to read my Bible in over three and a
[SPEAKER_05]: half years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for me, that correlation was just
crazy from someone like her.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I always say, if my grandmother's not
going to heaven, we're all going to hell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the first thing that she would do,
would actually go down and read her Bible.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just spoke volumes to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that point, I started to educate
myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of that season, I actually had
a knee surgery and got a staph infection.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was in the hospital for 10 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had four surgeries in a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at some point, I thought I was going
to die.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when I was sitting in there,
obviously, I'm taking all this pain
[SPEAKER_05]: medication.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this lady that I knew in Colorado came
to see me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she introduced me to CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she gave me all these topicals.
[SPEAKER_05]: She gave me tinctures, capsules.
[SPEAKER_05]: And ever since that day, I haven't taken
an aspirin.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't taken an Advil.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't taken any pharmaceutical drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: To manage my pain away from the game.
[SPEAKER_05]: And pretty much, that's my story.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_08]: Al's story is great.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jim's and everybody's up here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the reason I'm in cannabis is
because I ask a lot of questions and do a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot of listening.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you do that, you can hear countless
stories of lives this changes.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Matt Nordgren.
[SPEAKER_08]: I run a fund called Arcadian.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do a lot of investing in the industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been doing that for years.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been very successful at it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also was a former athlete.
[SPEAKER_08]: Somewhere probably in between Joe and Al,
Jim and Al.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a backup quarterback my whole
career.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a little bit of an average Joe that was
around a lot of high level athletes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so didn't have to use a lot of it for
pain.
[SPEAKER_08]: But was around a lot of guys that did for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And really saw a lot of benefit that it
did give a lot of athletes.
[SPEAKER_08]: I used it as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: In my own personal story, my grandmother
had Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were able to help her quality of life
at the end of her life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Had a couple of cousins with cancer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Was able to increase their life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Had quality of their life at the end of
their life.
[SPEAKER_08]: All three have passed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so not just hearing other people's
stories, but you end up experiencing some
[SPEAKER_08]: of your own.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think these are the types of things
that make this industry work.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we got into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has been one heck of an economic
benefit, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it feels really good to be in an
industry that you can do good business and
[SPEAKER_08]: feel good about the business that you're
doing every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Eliza Maroney.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the co-founder of Lucky Box Club,
a cannabis subscription service here in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we actually do deliver actual
products to your doorstep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also known as the cannabis yogi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've launched a brand that infuses yoga
classes with cannabis in various different
[SPEAKER_01]: ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every attendee receives a lucky box,
one of our boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they get to learn about new brands and
products in the process before,
[SPEAKER_01]: during, and after their classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives people a really warm,
intimate space to experiment with new
[SPEAKER_01]: products and to learn about the different
ways of using cannabis and CBD as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have CBD-only boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am in this because I, just like
everyone else I think in this room,
[SPEAKER_01]: have been profoundly moved by this
amazing, incredible plant in many
[SPEAKER_01]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my history does stem back to being a
cultivator and going from cultivation into
[SPEAKER_01]: retail and really understanding the entire
plant process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really proud of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a professional athlete.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the only one on this stage right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do have a lot of insight in how
cannabis can enhance performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can also help people to heal after
post-workout and games, I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Nick Moody.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually recently just retired from the
NFL.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I'm here, to focus on this
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I played for the 49ers.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's who drafted me, kind of my
introduction to the industry firsthand.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Niners.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the Seahawks and the Redskins.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we got a company started a couple years
ago initially, my dad and a couple
[SPEAKER_06]: partners.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we're transferring, we're
translating.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm tripping right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we're switching over from a grow to a
manufacturing facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what our primary focus is right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason I'm really big on marijuana
is not just me, it's my family.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a whole, we believe in the benefits of
it, not just physically, but for your
[SPEAKER_06]: mental well-being.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with my history on football,
I played linebacker and free safety at
[SPEAKER_06]: Florida State and then in the league.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've had plenty of injuries,
dislocated shoulders, broken bones,
[SPEAKER_06]: concussions, disc issues, arthritis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've had pretty much just about
anything you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my thing is the benefits of just the
plant itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Them wanting to restrict us from being
able to use it and prescribe us opiates,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's a big contradiction in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what I'm kind of getting into
more.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now is the efficacy for that and the
wellness and the THC and the CBD as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm no Gary V, but I occasionally swear,
just a warning.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanted to say it must feel fucking
good to be able to come out of the closet
[SPEAKER_07]: of cannabis and not have the NFL breathing
down your neck.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was huge because personally from
my experience, I was a guy that was
[SPEAKER_06]: actually in the drug program.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got put in there for two years and I
put in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I failed the test and then I was
placed in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that comes along with, I was tested
twice a week, every week, so up to eight
[SPEAKER_06]: times a month.
[SPEAKER_06]: They would come six in the morning,
three in the afternoon, Saturday mornings,
[SPEAKER_06]: ask you where you are, you got to give
them a log of your travel.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I actually had family members and
friends that have actually been on
[SPEAKER_06]: probation.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had less restrictions than I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: But just being in that process and seeing
other guys go through that process and
[SPEAKER_06]: then just that you actually kind of really
realize how much cannabis does help you in
[SPEAKER_06]: terms of your injury and then the stress
and like dealing with the stress of being
[SPEAKER_06]: a pro athlete, the family demands and all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when you have that taken from
you, when you're somebody that actually
[SPEAKER_06]: relies on that, you don't even realize you
rely on it, but it does really help you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you kind of see like the negative
outcome of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you'll be in certain situations
where you wouldn't even have been in that
[SPEAKER_06]: when if you were allowed to still be able
to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen different guys get into
situations when they're in the drug
[SPEAKER_06]: program where they start doing things they
would never normally do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were just like completely
different people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And honestly, I think that with the NFL
program, they kind of do more detriment
[SPEAKER_06]: than they do good when they restrict us
and then try to tell you what to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how you need to act and you got to
follow these rules and you can't act like
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody else, even though you're a
normal person, but you got to act this
[SPEAKER_06]: certain way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Meanwhile, some of the guys that are
writing the checks, they do some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: wildest stuff you could imagine.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys ever watch Ballers before?
[SPEAKER_06]: I live in Miami, so that show is pretty
accurate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, I agree with you too,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: And really that makes a poignant point.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you are caught using cannabis,
you're almost then put over a threshold to
[SPEAKER_07]: have to take opiates for pain because you
can't use a natural remedy.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a friend of mine named Marvin
Washington, that played as well and I
[SPEAKER_07]: think he's in the process of filing some
form of lawsuit against the NFL for forced
[SPEAKER_07]: addiction when they don't give you a
solution.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, it really does, it sadly pushes
you guys when you have no other option.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pills are the only thing to do when you're
playing that hard and being hurt.
[SPEAKER_07]: So cheers to you and congrats on
retirement.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so quickly I'll go over what I do in
the athletics and cannabis field very
[SPEAKER_07]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I put on an athletic tour around the
country, somewhat like Tough Mudder
[SPEAKER_07]: Spartan Race called the 420 Games.
[SPEAKER_07]: We compete, we do yoga, 4.20 mile runs,
jujitsu, big owl coached a three on three
[SPEAKER_07]: basketball tournament here in Venice last
March.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we go out and we do the opposite of
what people think when they hear cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: We go be active, we bring our families,
our kids, and we don't smoke at the
[SPEAKER_07]: events.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we talk about stuff like this at the
events, things like cannabis is an
[SPEAKER_07]: alternative to opiates.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have an edible line called Canna Athlete
and it's an edible product.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a spray for before you work out for
focus and it's a post recovery serum.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then lastly, I tried very hard last
year to open the world's first cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: gym with Ricky Williams.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was called Power Plant Fitness.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a venture on the shelf that we hope
to eventually bring into fruition where
[SPEAKER_07]: the trainers understand how to use
cannabis and help you figure out if it is
[SPEAKER_07]: or it isn't for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's an important point.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another point I wanna touch on,
I don't think cannabis on, well actually
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna back up.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are really two ways athletes can use
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can really delineate it in two very
defined manners.
[SPEAKER_07]: And one, most people understand is
recovery, CBD, you hurt, you smoke,
[SPEAKER_07]: you feel better.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're gonna go into that for sure
today on the opiate side of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I've always enjoyed it for focus.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've always liked to smoke before I go
into the gym, before I swim, before I ski,
[SPEAKER_07]: before I surf.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it gives me something that's a focus
that I don't normally have.
[SPEAKER_07]: It really translates across my life with
ADD like when I was in college I smoked to
[SPEAKER_07]: write my term papers and I just needed it
almost for a focus, i.e.
[SPEAKER_07]: a medicine versus to get high.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's really two ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: Focus, athletes can use it for training or
during athletics or they can use it for
[SPEAKER_07]: recovery.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wanted to just kind of actually,
like Matt for example, did you ever use
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis during your career when you were
training or during a game?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Jim both of the categories you just
mentioned used it for and so did a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: the guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, I mean in our sport I would
imagine the numbers have gotta be 60% of
[SPEAKER_08]: the players and probably you're higher
maybe, huh?
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say like 85.
[SPEAKER_08]: In an NBA it's probably what, like 95?
[SPEAKER_07]: 0.9.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean it's, you know either way
it's a significant amount of people that
[SPEAKER_08]: benefit from using this for both of those
areas.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did and I saw a lot of guys do it,
Jim.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone else want to chime in on focus?
[SPEAKER_07]: The aspect of using cannabis to get the
what I call eye of the tiger.
[SPEAKER_06]: Me in particular, I like to use it to
focus.
[SPEAKER_06]: For me it's like it takes away the
nervousness and the butterflies so it just
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of makes you feel like you do or go
out there every day and practice.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's another day, nothing out of the
ordinary.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes everything normal, easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I like to liken it to is to
everything in life, there's something
[SPEAKER_07]: called flow state and whether you're an
athlete, whether you're a musician,
[SPEAKER_07]: whether you're an artist, having sex,
anything, when your mind goes away and
[SPEAKER_07]: your body just becomes one with your mind,
that's called flow state.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why artists have always been kind
of let to be that sect that used cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: and psychedelics and even the surf
community and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So flow state is something, again I like
to translate this beyond just athletics
[SPEAKER_07]: and why cannabis really is good for
athletes and fitness but it correlates
[SPEAKER_07]: across our whole life to allow us to enjoy
things like athletics.
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes the things you love, it allows
you to love them a little bit more and
[SPEAKER_07]: appreciate them a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the focus side of things,
I think we kind of covered it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Al, you've mentioned before you
don't like to use cannabis before you
[SPEAKER_07]: train and again I want to hear from Al
because I don't think everybody should use
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis and it's important to hear from
someone who maybe it doesn't affect in the
[SPEAKER_07]: best way before they train.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do they get in the gym?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah for me, so I'm an indica smoker.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I like to smoke the heavy stuff so I
can go sit down and chill out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the reason why for me,
obviously for me to consume right before
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to do anything, especially
athletics is probably not the right thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now most people say why don't you try
sativas?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've tried sativas and then sativas
make my heart race.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was in a lose-lose.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why I actually choose not to
consume before.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't knock it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've actually started to be able to kind
of control it now because I use so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been using this a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now I actually can smoke indicas and
actually get stuff done.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have four kids so I have to medicate
before I deal with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've changed a little bit, Joe,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice, I like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Flow state parenting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Another point on that, Joe, the
interesting thing is just being able to
[SPEAKER_08]: figure out what works for you because the
amount of products that are coming to the
[SPEAKER_08]: market now, you can sort of experiment and
do just what Al did and no one person is
[SPEAKER_08]: alike.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean our chemical makeup is so
different.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our systems work so different that it's
just important to continue to figure out
[SPEAKER_08]: what works for you and what environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's something I wanted to touch
on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, Al, if indicas are more
sleepy and heavy to you, that's a great
[SPEAKER_07]: way that you know yourself, you know what
you want in your medicine and you know
[SPEAKER_07]: when to use it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to me, the one thing I'd like to try
and debunk to as much as I can,
[SPEAKER_07]: we've got Dr. Sue Sisley here in the front
row today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Dr. Sue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's give Sue a hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: I might even ask Sue a question right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's a long myth, in my opinion,
that indica means one thing and sativa
[SPEAKER_07]: means the other, meaning that indica's
head heavy and it makes you sleepy and a
[SPEAKER_07]: sativa is an energizing cannabis result.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what Matt just said is truthfully to
me what's most important.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody, especially, I'm saying this
because we're talking about fitness and
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis, knowing what works for you is
way more important than hey, bro,
[SPEAKER_07]: do you have an indica or a sativa?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like understanding your body type
and then how cannabis works.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, from a science standpoint,
the myth has really been shown that indica
[SPEAKER_07]: does not necessarily mean one thing and
sativa doesn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the easiest way to understand that is
two people can smoke the same plant and
[SPEAKER_07]: they feel completely opposite.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really about knowing yourself,
especially within athletics, in terms of
[SPEAKER_07]: what type of cannabis you use and when.
[SPEAKER_07]: E, what about you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to chime in on this one because
it's something I love talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really interesting to see that
it's really not indica sativa anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that we're learning so much about
terpenes and different cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: even how our endocannabinoid receptor
system works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's so much research that has
not happened yet, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it has been federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something that we're just now
touching the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really important to understand
that there are different ways to also
[SPEAKER_01]: apply cannabis to your workout.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it sounds like you should be using
topicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, topicals are amazing and people
don't give it enough credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many ways for your body to
benefit from cannabis as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: tinctures, understanding CBD versus CBN
and how you can use blends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And creating your own blend, it really
goes deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to go off on a tangent,
but just pointing out that there's so much
[SPEAKER_01]: more than just smoking or vaping nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really a blessing that we have
all of these options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even patches, I've been seeing lately,
you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I take from you dialing it right
into this is that you really have a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: options to choose exactly what type of
medicine to get you where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, again, I just think it's starting
slow is important.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in this room, just to show of hands,
I'm interested.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who likes to use cannabis before they go
for a run or they do something athletic?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's about half and half.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, so cannabis has also been proven to
be a neuroprotectant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's something I kind of want to
touch on and delve into the CBD side of
[SPEAKER_07]: things.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we've got big ex-pro athletes
that played football here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we've got a yogi.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've got Al, who played basketball,
where you get banged around pretty darn
[SPEAKER_07]: good.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we all use CBD in different ways in
a recovery facet.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, Matt, do you want to talk a little
bit about CBD as a neuroprotectant and
[SPEAKER_07]: how, like, a football player uses CBD
both, you know, prior to injury as well as
[SPEAKER_07]: post-traumatic injury?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that would be, I'd love to talk
about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: In particular, as my father was a pro
football player, and as was I,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, I grew up around all of these
players from the 60s and 70s.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I get to see at 50, 60, 70 years old,
the repercussions.
[SPEAKER_08]: And these guys are in tremendous amounts
of pain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Almost none of them are in some kind of
pain.
[SPEAKER_08]: And head trauma is a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we ought to give Dr. Sue more money
so she can figure some of these things
[SPEAKER_08]: out.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, to see my generation now,
see the past generation's downfall.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you've seen the movies.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's a really important topic for
us all to think about.
[SPEAKER_08]: CBD is a great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: A non-psychoactive molecule.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can derive it from hemp or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And with Mitch McConnell's efforts,
we're about to have hemp legal federally,
[SPEAKER_08]: thank God.
[SPEAKER_08]: We think very soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's going to be tough for the NFL to
not recognize that in other states.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that there's a lot of
different types of CBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: As she talked about, you kind of have to
figure out which one's good for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some great brands we can suggest.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think as a neuro protector, you know,
I'd see guys using it literally 10 minutes
[SPEAKER_08]: before game time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's because CBD doesn't take away
from their ability to use their minds as
[SPEAKER_08]: much as THC might.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I've also seen, Jim, a lot of times,
a lot of guys using it on Mondays,
[SPEAKER_08]: day after games, to do more of the
rehabilitation efforts.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think rather than being pumped full
of all these medicines that they would
[SPEAKER_08]: prefer to give you, which I know you can
talk about, and Dr. Sue and Mike James,
[SPEAKER_08]: who's got some great stories out there,
can tell you about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Playing football, I can't tell you how
many of these minor concussions you get.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, every time you get hit,
you just assume, like, you shake it off.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they're little concussions.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've all had the real ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, they knock you.
[SPEAKER_08]: It lights out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if CBD can be helpful in these
efforts, it's something we all need to
[SPEAKER_08]: consider.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think CBD is real important when it
comes to the neuro stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Mike is a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually train to do rehab down in the
same place in Miami.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've seen firsthand him recovering from
the concussions and having to wear the
[SPEAKER_06]: glasses.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've had a couple of concussions
myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've had concussions that I know
weren't documented.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I know I've had, like, I've definitely
had over 10.
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometimes every now and then,
I'll get, like, little headaches in the
[SPEAKER_06]: front of my head.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I take my sublingual CBD and things
like that, the pressure will go away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any anxiety and stuff like that,
just from all the head trauma and contact,
[SPEAKER_06]: it helps with the relief of that a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hear that from a lot of guys now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So more and more people are kind of
reaching out, trying to find out more and
[SPEAKER_06]: more about CBD and see how they can get
their hands on it and how to treat their
[SPEAKER_06]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_07]: Al, you're quite the entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've admired your rise in the industry
with your brands and Viola and everything
[SPEAKER_07]: else.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we talk about CBD, something I
think as an athlete, and again,
[SPEAKER_07]: translating across the board, but
especially for recovery, there's something
[SPEAKER_07]: called whole plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can take CBD.
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD has become a buzzword in the general
public.
[SPEAKER_07]: And half the time, like, quite honestly,
it's like when you buy organic food,
[SPEAKER_07]: I wonder, like, is this really organic or
do they just put that on the box?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really important, like,
with all of your food in life,
[SPEAKER_07]: food is medicine is how I'm going to end
this today.
[SPEAKER_07]: Know where your medicine comes from,
just because something says CBD doesn't
work.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't mean it's good for you,
and it doesn't even mean there's CBD in
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So know where you're getting your
medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people like Al, who are doing it the
right way, tested.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whole plant medicine is an option where
people, you know, you don't have to take
[SPEAKER_07]: THC, but when you ratio it with THC,
and whether it's an 18 to 1 to CBD and
[SPEAKER_07]: it's a very low amount of THC,
using the whole plant versus an extract
[SPEAKER_07]: can be much times, it's called the
entourage effect, and it's a lot more
[SPEAKER_07]: beneficial sometimes medicinally to have
that combination of the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to talk a little bit about,
excuse me, whole plant medicine?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so like you said, for me,
obviously, when we first started,
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to go through the education process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my, I had knee, my first knee surgery
I had I think was in 2001, and from 2001
[SPEAKER_05]: to 2009, I used to take
anti-inflammatories like Celebrex,
[SPEAKER_05]: Advil every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I would take one in the morning,
one at night, whether it was during the
[SPEAKER_05]: season or, you know, or in the summertime
when I was actually training to get ready
[SPEAKER_05]: for the season.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we all know like, you know,
the potential side effects, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I looked at them, I knew what they
were, but you know, like a lot of us on
[SPEAKER_05]: this panel, you know, especially athletes,
you know, this is a way to make a living.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you kind of got to put your body in
those positions or those predicaments and
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of just have to see what happens,
because you're providing for your family
[SPEAKER_05]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But once I got introduced to cannabis,
and I realized I had an all natural,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, option, you know, it spun me for
a loop, because I was just like,
[SPEAKER_05]: how can these professional teams say that
they have our best interests at heart,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they don't want to give us something
that, you know, that we could take that is
[SPEAKER_05]: without all the, you know, potential side
effects of, you know, I always laugh about
[SPEAKER_05]: when we look at these commercials of these
new drugs that come online.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just like, you know, people
skipping, you know, to a sunset,
[SPEAKER_05]: and everything is just so happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at the end is like, side effects,
instant death, internal bleeding,
[SPEAKER_05]: eyeballs falling out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you think about with cannabis,
we have none of that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and, you know, for me, like I said,
you know, started with my grandmother,
[SPEAKER_05]: then me, and now it's like my whole
family, like literally my whole family
[SPEAKER_05]: consumes.
[SPEAKER_05]: My aunt just went through a bout of breast
cancer, went through chemo, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I gave her Rick Simpson oil that,
you know, one of my friends produced for
[SPEAKER_05]: her.
[SPEAKER_05]: She actually gained weight, you know,
throughout the process.
[SPEAKER_05]: My grandmother's church, you know,
obviously, you know, she's 80-something
[SPEAKER_05]: years old, and all her friends are
80-something years old, so they get knee
[SPEAKER_05]: replacements and hip replacements,
and she's always calling me out,
[SPEAKER_05]: what can they take?
[SPEAKER_05]: So now my grandma's actually the biggest
drug dealer in our church.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what she's transitioned to.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's also the most popular person in our
church.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, but yeah, but you know,
ever since I've learned this, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: my daughter, you know, literally I just,
last week, started putting my daughter on
[SPEAKER_05]: a CBD regimen.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, she has ADHD, and, you know,
watching her personality swings and
[SPEAKER_05]: different things like that, and being
that, you know, we're giving her a drug
[SPEAKER_05]: that I fully don't even understand,
and, you know, when I really think about
[SPEAKER_05]: it, the course that we're setting her on
is that she will be taking pills for the
[SPEAKER_05]: rest of her life.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I gotta stop that, and I'm gonna try to
stop it through this plant, and we're
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna see what cannabis does.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna start, like she said,
we're gonna start messing with blends and
[SPEAKER_05]: different things like that, and we're
gonna try to heal her illness.
[SPEAKER_06]: Naturally.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll work.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll work for the ADD.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have ADHD, so when I was in college,
I was diagnosed, my head coach actually
[SPEAKER_06]: suggested I would get tested for it,
and that was one of my ways of,
[SPEAKER_06]: one of my reasons for medicating was my
ADD.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would help me focus and study my plays,
because if I didn't smoke, there was no
[SPEAKER_06]: way I could like sit still and like
actually sit there and study.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would go play the game, go out,
and then that was big for my ADD,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I was on medication in the league.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was on the Ritalin.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was dehydrated, my heart rate would
go up.
[SPEAKER_06]: During practice, I'd be sweating so much,
like my hands would be clammy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have to drink Pedialyte.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had all the symptoms, and I would take
30 milligrams twice a day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't that how it works though,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: If you take your kid into the doctor and
bounce it around too much, oh,
[SPEAKER_08]: ADD, you need to get him out, or you take
your kid and he's not bouncing around.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh, he's depressed.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna need to put him on some
antidepress.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you can't get out of there without
something, it feels like.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is, it's sad.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really hate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to naturally teach my family an
Eastern philosophy of medicine versus a
[SPEAKER_07]: Western.
[SPEAKER_07]: All drugs aren't bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've talked so much bad stuff about the
pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanna say one thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're lucky to live in a place where
technology, surgery, and even medicine,
[SPEAKER_07]: pharmaceutically, can keep us alive longer
and help us.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's so goddamn overused.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a place for opiates.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you're hurt and you're really,
really, really hurt, there's a place for
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But really, you can use cannabis to really
accentuate and as a compliment to those
[SPEAKER_07]: types of pharmaceuticals when you have to
take them, thereby reducing the amount of
[SPEAKER_07]: pharmaceuticals that you have to take as
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a cool story about your daughter.
[SPEAKER_07]: My daughter's just like me with ADHD,
and we're trying to figure out ways to get
[SPEAKER_07]: her to calm down as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll let you know what I figure out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, please do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, this isn't a new thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to always point out, when I started
the 420 Games a few years ago,
[SPEAKER_07]: it was like this big, wow, we've never
seen anything like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Athletes and marijuana, oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's like a secret fraternity that we
all were in for all these decades,
[SPEAKER_07]: especially these guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: They all knew that inside the locker room
that they used weed, but they couldn't
[SPEAKER_07]: talk about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't talk about it because I was an
executive and people could get blacked out
[SPEAKER_07]: at our Christmas parties, but God forbid I
lit a joint, I would be an outcast.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I looked back as I started to do this
because I was a closeted cannabis user
[SPEAKER_07]: since I played soccer in high school and I
was the starting pitcher in my baseball
[SPEAKER_07]: team and all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I looked and pumping iron, Lou Ferrigno
and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the early
[SPEAKER_07]: 70s, they were smoking weed at the gym
when they were competing for Mr. Universe,
[SPEAKER_07]: the most prestigious bodybuilding contest
in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got Phelps, Usain, the fastest in
land and water ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those were both known cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got my man right here, Big Al.
[SPEAKER_07]: The entire NBA, that's why I fisted Al,
is the NBA represents the most heavy
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis using professional sports league
and they're the most incredible athletes
[SPEAKER_07]: that I like to watch more than any of
them.
[SPEAKER_08]: How many seasons was it for y'all?
[SPEAKER_08]: 17.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a lot of seasons to play.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wasn't getting concussions, thank God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still playing, by the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I was 6'8".
[SPEAKER_08]: Well,
[SPEAKER_07]: on that note, I want to ask, starting with
Al and then we can go down the line or
[SPEAKER_07]: whoever wants to pop in, but to me,
a question as a proponent for the pro
[SPEAKER_07]: athletes is how do we get the professional
athletes, the owners of these businesses
[SPEAKER_07]: and these teams to allow cannabis to be
used?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we all kind of have seen CBD as
our gateway.
[SPEAKER_07]: My statement and my unfortunate reality is
that it's only going to be money and we
[SPEAKER_07]: need to with data prove that cannabis can
actually be better medicine with people
[SPEAKER_07]: like Sue and her research to show that
this will actually get you on the field
[SPEAKER_07]: and keep you playing longer and they're
not going to really do it just because it
[SPEAKER_07]: makes somebody feel better.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_07]: How are we going to get this legalized to
use cannabis in the NFL and beyond?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think the first thing you said is
true.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to take money testing,
Sue.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: To continue to break down these barriers,
but what I think, just say NBA guys,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's going to take one of the top guys to
come out and say he used.
[SPEAKER_05]: From the NFL, I always say like if Tom
Brady did it, but from the NBA,
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally think it's going to happen
sooner than later too because the league
[SPEAKER_05]: has changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's call LeBron.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got LeBron's number?
[SPEAKER_05]: I got somebody close to LeBron that's
thinking about doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys are in a different stage in
their lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I was coming up, just to say,
there wasn't as much endorsement money and
[SPEAKER_05]: different things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if there was, he was tied to
McDonald's for a million dollars and that
[SPEAKER_05]: was a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now these guys are making $40 million
just from their contract.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they have all these endorsement deals
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally think that now they make so
much money that they don't care no more.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, I'm going to be exactly who
I am now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have to hide who I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: I personally think that there will be an
NBA player that will make this statement
[SPEAKER_05]: within, I would say, the next two years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I think that'll just continue to push
the conversation forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to continue to break down
barriers and then we need people like us
[SPEAKER_05]: who are retired athletes to speak our
truths.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you said, come out the weed closet or
the green closet.
[SPEAKER_05]: As we continue to do that, we just keep
raising awareness and we'll just keep
[SPEAKER_05]: breaking down barriers.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is great to hear, Al.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_08]: What a great world we live in now that
everybody has a voice.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're seeing this across the board.
[SPEAKER_08]: People can be exactly who they are and not
be so worried about it anymore,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is really the ultimate, I don't even
know how to say it, but the ultimate
[SPEAKER_08]: responsibility that the cannabis industry
has is to build an industry the right way
[SPEAKER_08]: from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Female empowerment, sustainability,
environmentally conscious, we get to do
[SPEAKER_08]: all this versus every other industry
that's trying to reverse engineer
[SPEAKER_08]: themselves right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: By speaking up, doing things right as we
build this, it's not only our
[SPEAKER_08]: responsibility, but it's a luxury.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great to hear that you think there's
some big people about to say some things.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think across the board, some big actors
are about to do that, some NFL guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're going to continue to see the
chips fall as long as we get good research
[SPEAKER_08]: back from Dr. C.
[SPEAKER_01]: My perspective is very much in line with
yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that initially, we need
education.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to educate people the same way
that you had to educate your grandmother
[SPEAKER_01]: and show her that this isn't something to
be afraid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our job as the cannabis community to
come together and really take the time to
[SPEAKER_01]: go to your families and to explain to your
kids what this is, explain to your parents
[SPEAKER_01]: what this is, explain to your grandparents
what this is and how it affects your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, when the time comes and when the
athletes are ready, it's your guys' job to
[SPEAKER_01]: endorse the right brands that are doing
the right thing in this industry because
[SPEAKER_01]: there are so many bad actors, but there
are lots of us with the right heart that
[SPEAKER_01]: really want to get clean products into
your family's hands.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think with the NFL, it'll take a little
longer, though, because with them,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's more so the image of the league and
the brand, just how you kind of see it is
[SPEAKER_06]: with the Stanson National Anthem.
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as on the lower level, the coaches
themselves, these coaches I've had
[SPEAKER_06]: personally, they're just like,
if you guys are going to do it,
[SPEAKER_06]: go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know if you need it, you need it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're aware of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got our tests, our annual tests once a
year, so it's either in the spring or it's
[SPEAKER_06]: in the training camp.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you fail that, that's when you're in
the program.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you pass that test, you're good for
the year.
[SPEAKER_06]: They know what they're fully aware of.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't want it to be so blatant for it
to damage the brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about the brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once it gets to a corporate level like how
it was in Canada, like with Canopy,
[SPEAKER_06]: with that level where the same guys like
Jerry Jones has the money and the oil,
[SPEAKER_06]: he can put it in the marijuana,
then they'll be all for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, at the end of the day,
those guys, the owners are businessmen.
[SPEAKER_06]: The business inside of it is really open
in their eyes because a good friend of
[SPEAKER_06]: mine is actually a big corporate owner,
and he's friends with a couple of owners
[SPEAKER_06]: of the NFL, and they're kind of opening
their eyes to the business opportunities
[SPEAKER_06]: of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually put some money into the
stocks in Canada and things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're coming around, but I think the NBA
is just always ahead of the NFL in terms
[SPEAKER_06]: of how they treat the players and how to
let the players express themselves and the
[SPEAKER_06]: actual say that the players have.
[SPEAKER_08]: Baseball and hockey don't even care,
do they?
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll just follow your guys' lead.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know if you're tested once a
year and you get the call, you know you're
[SPEAKER_07]: clean, you go get tested, how high do you
get right after that when you leave the
[SPEAKER_07]: testing facility?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it depends on how long you had to
wait.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you had like in the spring,
say it's April, you go to mini camp in
[SPEAKER_06]: June, so you stop in like March,
so you have like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I would usually give myself, I would cut
it short because I like had my system
[SPEAKER_06]: down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be like, all right, my body fat's
here, I need this many days.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to drink two gallons of water a day,
do my regular workouts, I'll be good in 10
[SPEAKER_06]: days.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like I would cut it closer to most
guys, but a lot of people would do like
[SPEAKER_06]: 30, they would stop then.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I remember like after that,
everybody had their test and everybody
[SPEAKER_06]: would like go, everybody would go link up
together and everybody just have a good
[SPEAKER_06]: big session.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd be like, oh, the test came.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'd be like a whole seg, they do about
segging a lot of times, so like it'll be
[SPEAKER_06]: the DBs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes we'd be like, oh, they do
something, everybody thinks it's corny
[SPEAKER_06]: because most of the, most times the guys
that don't smoke is the Olaman,
[SPEAKER_06]: for the most part.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'd be like in the spring,
the first test, like everybody would get
[SPEAKER_06]: mad, like, oh, why are you testing the
Olaman first?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know they don't smoke anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like.
[SPEAKER_07]: The linemen don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they do about seg group and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of breaks the, everybody gets
split up, everybody gets done in spring
[SPEAKER_06]: and then in training camp.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kickers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and kickers, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, you need to get those,
get them out the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: They need a ceremony for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have a bowl loaded and just be
ready to rock after that test.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, I think it is something
important to say again, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: all these guys have lived these lives and
it had to wait until now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I work, I want to quickly mention an
organization, Sue's on the board,
[SPEAKER_07]: Al's part of it, Matt's part of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to be part of it soon,
I hope, if you'll honor us.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Athletes for Care.
[SPEAKER_07]: We work with retired athletes,
not only just to help them understand
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis, but to help understand how to
assimilate back into life after,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, beyond the glory kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when the lights go off and you're not a
professional athlete anymore, it's not the
[SPEAKER_07]: most easy thing in the world financially
in a lot of other ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so beyond just teaching them cannabis
is an alternative to opiates, we've got
[SPEAKER_07]: mentors and then people who are just out
of the league.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, one of the big things and
pillars of that organization, and again,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's not just cannabis, but I want to
mention that one of the pillars is
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis to keep them level and keep them
healthy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a great organization you should
check out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as we end here, kind of as we wrap this
into kind of Q&A, to me, what I've seen
[SPEAKER_07]: happen is a movement of a few guys doing
this and then starting to talk,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then a few more ex-guys talking,
and then 420 games and other people
[SPEAKER_07]: starting things.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a social movement out there,
and there's thousands and thousands of
[SPEAKER_07]: people that define themselves as athletes
that use cannabis, canna athletes,
[SPEAKER_07]: or whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what your product line is built
for, from what I can see, Al.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's just, I'm very, very thankful
to these guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So before we wrap this up and go,
go into a Q&A, let's give them a huge
[SPEAKER_07]: round of applause for being brave.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're the front lines of this movement.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's these guys that are going to help us
legalize it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, it's these guys that are going to
help move it across the line.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, from here, I guess,
why don't we jump into a little bit of a Q
[SPEAKER_07]: &A?
[SPEAKER_07]: You got a mic?
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This question is for Jim.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned the Power Plant Fitness
Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the current state of on-site
consumption in the regulations now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when do you think that will be
possible that you will be able to open a
[SPEAKER_00]: gym that you can consume on-site?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, legally, it's possible now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's ways to do it in a,
call it a cigar room style where it's
[SPEAKER_07]: separated and ventilated.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, we were legally able to
potentially do what we did.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were unable to open the gym due to some
regulatory stuff outside of that,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then the inability to, we had a pretty
large capital raise that was right when
[SPEAKER_07]: Trump and Sessions kind of came into
office, which kind of killed our raise
[SPEAKER_07]: from some more traditional VCs that were
going to get into the game.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, legally, there's a lot of
things you got to jump through,
[SPEAKER_07]: but there's ways to do it now if you
wanted to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, if you want to open a cannabis
gym, give me a call.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still trying to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Smoking ice hockey rink.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this question is for Nick.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you mentioned that during training
camp, and over the summer, you stay clean
[SPEAKER_04]: unless you're tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you notice that recovery time from
being hit or having some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: concussion-like symptoms was more or less
after using cannabis and CBD?
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I didn't have too much head trauma.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, as far as off-season, when I had to
actually stop smoking, I felt more of the
[SPEAKER_06]: effects of my training, like as far as my
recovery and my rest.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when I felt, like, me, I
personally, I like smoke on my way to
[SPEAKER_06]: working out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I'll smoke right before I get there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's kind of gets me in my right
mental state.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, like, I actually feel like I breathe
better when I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it sounds weird, but, like,
when I don't smoke, I feel like I can't
[SPEAKER_06]: breathe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I get that, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've asked him that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Given the fact that the professional
organizations are not accepting abuse,
[SPEAKER_02]: how do athletes, current athletes,
get educated on, you know, the various
[SPEAKER_02]: effects of cannabis and what it can do for
them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it more just like athletes sharing
their personal stories in the locker room,
[SPEAKER_02]: or how did you, how did each of you start
your journey into, you know, researching
[SPEAKER_02]: the effects and what it might do for you?
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess kind of once I actually got into
the program, I looked into it more deeply
[SPEAKER_06]: as far as, like, once they started making
me, like, listen to them explain all the
[SPEAKER_06]: chemicals and stuff like that,
then I kind of understood, like,
[SPEAKER_06]: how it actually, like, helped me when I
looked at it from the scientific
[SPEAKER_06]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, like,
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not an athlete, but I can still tag in
on how I learned, which is, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably by doing the wrong things
sometimes, like smoking too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then coming back from that,
I mean, I'm sure that has to be something
[SPEAKER_01]: that a lot of people still do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't the wealth of information
available that there is, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: now, and that there has been in the last
two or three years, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the market has changed so much,
and the conversation has really shifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I mean, to start, at least myself,
I mean, I remember smoking my first bowl,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I was like, well, okay, this is
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then somebody would give me a
different, you know, some purple,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I was like, oh, this is way,
this is not what I just smoked last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, it's trial and error.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then hopefully learning from your
mistakes and also sharing the information
[SPEAKER_01]: with your friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, in general, education is probably
one of the biggest issues in the industry
[SPEAKER_08]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: And not just for consumers on the street.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even major politicians don't know what is
going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think, in general, that information
is critical.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've invested in some companies
recently.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the WebMD of cannabis we think is
really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think there's more information tools
to come.
[SPEAKER_08]: But just understanding what is happening
is probably the most important answer we
[SPEAKER_08]: can give you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, for example, we invested in a lot
of insurance companies.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, does anyone have life
insurance here?
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, has anyone tried to get life
insurance while you're smoking cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: and get tested for it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, I mean, it used to be life
insurance.
[SPEAKER_08]: You would get denied if they found
cannabis in your system and in every other
[SPEAKER_08]: way you were healthy, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is absurd.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, they penalize you basically somewhere
between if you're a tobacco user or an
[SPEAKER_08]: extreme alcohol user.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they'll give it to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you think about these insurance
companies, the resources they have,
[SPEAKER_08]: and to not be educated enough to know that
you're telling me I can't get insurance
[SPEAKER_08]: because if I don't even consume alcohol or
tobacco or opioids, but I use a natural
[SPEAKER_08]: product to sleep or my pain, that you're
gonna penalize me on my life insurance to
[SPEAKER_08]: take care of my family?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, there's things that are just
crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're getting better, they're starting
to get smarter, but it's an institutional
[SPEAKER_08]: thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as far as she said, as far as the
trial and error, I think that's definitely
[SPEAKER_06]: a big one.
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as myself, I kind of learned that
edibles are another good way I like to
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of medicate before physical activity
or playing the game because I know it
[SPEAKER_06]: would last longer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I could be the edible for the game,
it would last me the whole game.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if I just smoked a blunt, it would only
kind of last me through the first quarter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you kind of learn from the older
guys too.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're first coming in, you're like,
all right, how do I do this?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do I make sure I can get high before
the game and I don't get caught and I can
[SPEAKER_06]: make sure I get my stuff with me?
[SPEAKER_06]: So you kind of learn from other guys,
they teach you how to go about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as far as actually learning what the
plant does to you, now it's getting to the
[SPEAKER_06]: point now where more guys are open to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now it's like, I've always been known
to the younger guys in college and guys I
[SPEAKER_06]: played with, I was always a smoker.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the guys that didn't smoke or didn't
smoke as much, they're hearing more of the
[SPEAKER_06]: medical benefits and they wanna know more,
so they wanna talk to somebody else that
[SPEAKER_06]: actually does it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get more people coming to me face to
face, especially training in Miami,
[SPEAKER_06]: where I train at with my trainer,
Vaughn Rideau, and then my doctors I go to
[SPEAKER_06]: that do like the stem cell therapy and the
prolo and the nutrient IVs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of everybody else all at the
same time is trying to gain interest in
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So at the same time, athletes are learning
about it more than medical professionals
[SPEAKER_06]: that look into not the traditional methods
of healing, like the surgeries and the
[SPEAKER_06]: injections, but more of the homeopathic.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're kind of helping us educate as well
too, because they're learning at the same
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess this question is more for Eliza.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cool to hear your guys'
experiences on the professional field,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm not an NFL player.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you could tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was hoping to hear a little bit more
about how you suggest we incorporate
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis into normal people fitness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did ask the question, who consumes
cannabis before a workout?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I just see a show of hands who uses it
after?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, a little bit more than the before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are three ways to use cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can consume it, you can inhale it,
or you can apply it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So topicals, in other words.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing is just educating
people about those three different modes
[SPEAKER_01]: of application and understanding how they
can be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends on the activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certain activities that I
personally wouldn't recommend using
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis beforehand, because sometimes
things are dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain people, when they're lifting super
weights and stuff, I wouldn't recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: high THC, because your muscles do get a
little bit more relaxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got somebody laughing over here,
because obviously he's done it once or
[SPEAKER_01]: twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one thing to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once again, educating yourself and
learning about these products,
[SPEAKER_01]: starting with micro doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that I teach in my
classes all of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Micro dosing, which means that you're
using less than a medicinal dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So start with two to three to five
milligrams, and then work your way up from
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really give your body and yourself a
chance to understand how your body
[SPEAKER_01]: interacts with this medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also just understanding that you want
to find the least amount necessary to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the desired effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is something we don't really see
very often in the pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, we want to make sure we
eradicate that, so we're going to give you
[SPEAKER_01]: three times the normal dose to make sure
that you don't need to come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to start with, once again,
the least amount necessary for that
[SPEAKER_01]: desired effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to allow yourself to find space
and to really find that time to focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: With yoga classes, weed is awesome before
a good yoga practice, or meditation even,
[SPEAKER_01]: and really getting into your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when people are on their mats in
my classes, it's called bend and blaze.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people, they think that they need to
get blazed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I say no, I want you to get
lifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want you to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big difference between high and
lifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want you to find that in-between
space where you feel enlightened as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to feeling stoned and like you
need to lie down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a few different ways to apply
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I answered your question,
but I think it's important to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for anybody who's interested in
applying cannabis to their practice or
[SPEAKER_01]: day-to-day activity, please find me later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to talk to you about what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how we can enhance it and also solve
any issues that you may have in your
[SPEAKER_01]: day-to-day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like lifted.
[SPEAKER_07]: I call it activated.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of our term for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as we close up, there's something I
kind of like to close up on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I like to bring cannabis into a bigger
picture and a bigger discussion and not
[SPEAKER_07]: just talk about it as like to get high.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis is part of our lives,
whether you're an athlete or not,
[SPEAKER_07]: to be well and to be happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I started this off by saying, you know,
marijuana used to be a drug and it was
[SPEAKER_07]: bad, but really it's a medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis is a medicine that makes us
better people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we should look at not only cannabis,
cannabis is a plant, everything we put in
[SPEAKER_07]: our body.
[SPEAKER_07]: So food is medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And America looks at medicine as what I
think of as a drug, which is a white pill.
[SPEAKER_07]: And medicine and a pill, or excuse me,
drugs or a pill, that's trying to fix
[SPEAKER_07]: something that was bad decisions made over
a lot of years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that if we can use cannabis in
a lifestyle of wellness, eating right,
[SPEAKER_07]: thinking about what we put into our body,
what kind of cannabis we use, when we use
[SPEAKER_07]: it, how we use it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want everybody to think about
mindful cannabis use, especially as an
[SPEAKER_07]: athlete.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if you're going to use cannabis
and you're going to go out and you're
[SPEAKER_07]: going to go surf in a big wave or do
whatever, you want to be on your game and
[SPEAKER_07]: you don't want to get hurt.
[SPEAKER_07]: And same thing in life.
[SPEAKER_07]: So be mindful with your cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_07]: Find out what works for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the same for everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: God bless you all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's give these guys a big round of
applause.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.
Thank you.
Bye.
See you next time.
