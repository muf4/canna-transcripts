We all believe the same thing about the
planet.
We think it can change culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: The burning weed when it's root in hell.
It is true.
[SPEAKER_04]: The message is out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flame is getting hotter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're trying to turn that light on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are we?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're young.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our community.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is me.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Greenhouse Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we, sir?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking over the Newport Harbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our beautiful California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're blessed by God for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here we are in the Greenhouse Podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my home, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of my porches.
[SPEAKER_05]: The home of Peter Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, are you on these porches every
night, checking out the sea?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of work from home, so I prefer
to just sit out here during the day and
[SPEAKER_00]: crush calls and help people with the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I like to think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, this is a great place to crush some
calls.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a good thinking space.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other one, I do like the other
thinking space as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other balcony facing back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter fucking Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two patios overlooking the Newport.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew Peter Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I moved out to California
to pursue and get back in this industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved into a tent on a roof in Marina
Del Rey.
[SPEAKER_00]: You told me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marina Del Rey is pretty fucking nice,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I could afford a room in that
house, before I could afford my own
[SPEAKER_00]: apartment, before I could move my co-op
friend out that I was with at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humility is undervalued.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to lose it to be able to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a true believer in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am grateful to God to have the
opportunity to find and follow my passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me the opportunity to see this
view, and I appreciate every second of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for taking the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so honored to be on your podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're sitting at a table of these shoes,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about these for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fly Sol Shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the Industrial Hemp
Revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get deeper than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoes are just a start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chose shoes because most people are
grown with two feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not, I'll make you a special
shoe.
[SPEAKER_04]: One shoe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make you a pad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Call me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the first hemp... Hand-woven,
hemp shoe in North America.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones you have in front of you are made
out of a canvas, but the one that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: wearing, this is actually my very first
prototype.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it's hand-stitched.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unique thing about the shoe is that
every single pair is one of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the pattern will not line up on a shoe
the exact same way twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I designed them like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been rocking these since,
sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you rate your own shoes, why would
you wear somebody else's?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just about the shoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about this Industrial Hemp Revolution
that you are very much on the forefront
[SPEAKER_05]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: This got a start way back in the day,
and it failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a huge marijuana legalization
movement and hemp legalization movement
[SPEAKER_00]: that had its upstart once, and it failed
for several different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that I believe it failed is
because the culture didn't accept it as
[SPEAKER_00]: really a better replacement for many,
many textile goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, everything besides the leather
on your body that you're wearing right now
[SPEAKER_00]: could be made better, more durable,
antimicrobial, antifungal, hypoallergenic,
[SPEAKER_00]: out of hemp, and waterproof.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you think it's the culture that didn't
accept it, or do you think it's the powers
[SPEAKER_04]: that be that stood to lose so much they
didn't allow the infrastructure to
[SPEAKER_04]: really...
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me answer that directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Culture dictates everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If what we will not accept, we have to
stand up together and make a change as
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem, and I see in the country
right now especially, is that we are so
[SPEAKER_00]: bifurcated, we are so divisive from our
political stance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's come together on a plan that
industrialized hemp is the gift from God.
[SPEAKER_00]: It remediates the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It removes more CO2 than a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces better fiber, better paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our constitution is written on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can't get behind that,
heck, that's anti-American.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Preach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Preach.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm proud to be an American,
where at least I know I'm free.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not free to grow hemp though,
interestingly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not in our state.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we come from Texas.
[SPEAKER_05]: We hail from the great state of Texas,
as you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are still not able to grow our own
hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we're really nervous about is
that industrial hemp will push out the
[SPEAKER_05]: medical hemp, the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this past 18 months, or past year,
2019, I traveled to 68 cities and 19
[SPEAKER_00]: countries building a manifest of each
individual industrial or hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, THC, minor cannabinoid markets,
and where the culture and regulations and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything was gonna be.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gonna shock you and probably a lot
of the people that are watching your
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the future of cultivation of hemp for
refined cannabinoid production will,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion, cease to exist in the
United States in the next four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The economic advantages of labor rates
that are achievable in countries like
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia or Mexico, for two examples in
the Western Hemisphere, simply will follow
[SPEAKER_00]: the commoditization that's taking place in
many agricultural products such as fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: cut flowers or sugar cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't grow it in this country because
the difference between the longest day and
[SPEAKER_00]: shortest day in Colombia is 41 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Northern Hemisphere simply can't
compete with that many cycle ability.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that full crops of hemp a year?
[SPEAKER_04]: Outdoors?
[SPEAKER_04]: Three maybe?
[SPEAKER_04]: Four to five.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows relentlessly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a relentless plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God, thank God.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you climate control it,
and the Institute and the Institute of
Agriculture is here, it's gonna grow in
one way, and the other is gonna grow in
another way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's an institutional type
of capital that's been invested in these
[SPEAKER_00]: countries because they already recognize
that it's only gonna go one way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a forecast for CBD isolate,
and isolated molecule to be trading at
[SPEAKER_00]: $100 a kilo in the future, just like
sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta think about it that three years
ago we were selling it at 18.5,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12.5 the next year, 6,500 last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm selling it for 1,500 bucks right now.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just CBD or for industrial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the future of the industry in the
United States is short-lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you turn on institutions like Mexico,
which already have agricultural producers
[SPEAKER_00]: with 20 straight kilometers of established
greenhouse, they can just take,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, we'll carve out this mile and flip
it over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I hear that and I totally see
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what say you about the smokable hemp?
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a concern that the smokable hemp
flower will be banned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hence, kind of paving the way to ban any
smokable flower of any sort in Texas.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very strange, this kind of land that
we're living in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the reason that the United States has
really lost this battle is because we are
[SPEAKER_00]: so bifurcated our state laws that say,
you know, I'm going to do this and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Texas, unfortunately, is suffering from
that exact consequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we launched the state system in
Washington, they were pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we literally set up the track and
trace office in the WLCB.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, unless Texas, they shouldn't ban
that because there's a lot of medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, smokable hemp is probably
the only sub-facet of the industry that
[SPEAKER_00]: will survive in the United States because
the importation of hemp flower for smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose that will be refined to that
nature will not come from those importing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get refined into an isolate or a
distillate or easily shipped container.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something to be said for local
flower, artisan flower, just as there are
[SPEAKER_05]: the marijuana flower that we love so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you put yourself into growing the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is a reflection of how much you
care for yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to be one time removed from what
you smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to have access to know what it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't smoke flower coming out of
Mexico.
Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but you know, the isolate,
who fucking knows?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all sort of future thinking,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what will come.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is stopping that from becoming that
reality?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there still any stop gaps now that are
hurting hemp fully coming online?
[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial hemp, let's classify the two
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industrial hemp production and
cultivation of hemp for industrial
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes versus refined cannabinoid
production, whether it be miners or CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial hemp will survive in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the United States is very far behind
in building the key linchpin, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: production and extraction, or I'm sorry,
the processing facilities to make it into
[SPEAKER_00]: fibers, to make it into, you know,
reusable textiles that we can develop and
[SPEAKER_00]: replace cotton or replace.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge infrastructure though that has
to be built.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a neat, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a couple different really
forward thinking states that are taking
[SPEAKER_00]: like industrial waste sites and they're
planting hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's perfect for, you know,
put on your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to ingest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like toxic waste land, you like go
plant some hemp on it and it absorbs it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, planted at Fukushima.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes radiation out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's here to save our world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you, this is, it's here to
free the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's here to reverse this negative
paradigm that we've been demonizing
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-based medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's here to elevate our consciousness,
you know, free us from PTSD, reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation, our body, uh, help us with
our neurological diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: The deprivation of the endocannabinic
system of the human being is the most,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, tragic thing I think the United States
government has done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems systematic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like ripped from the... Well,
think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the United States is built on a
corporate agenda to feed us food that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes us sick, treat us, treat those
ailments, not cure them, feed us more
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines to treat the symptoms of those
medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually we rot away and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, unless you're conscious of,
uh, and make your own choices,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and that's what I want to inspire with
these shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are here to inspire the, uh,
embrace, uh, people to embrace
[SPEAKER_00]: industrialized hemp at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Revolution is coming through style,
through comfort, through a lifestyle brand
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to move into some other
categories of niche that, that are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, accent pieces.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_05]: It does.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're accent pieces and they're more
than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they're, they're true,
um, true pieces of self-expression.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just, Ooh, I'm loud.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm flashy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also, you know, that, that I care.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've made a commitment to, um,
you know, this planet to making one plant
[SPEAKER_05]: based decision, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because even if you buy them, because you
think they're fly, because I love them,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're making that decision to buy a plant
based.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we give the consumer a choice of four
charities, the Amazon, to the ocean,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the United States of, uh, of choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can donate a portion of each sale to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've mailed us back the postcard,
tell us what you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: So real quick, we skipped over it,
but what is the Instagram handle?
[SPEAKER_04]: Fly soul shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soul like your soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you got to kind of have a little fly
soul to carry it off, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So not S O L E S O U L.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fly soul shoes on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fly soul shoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So back to the, uh, the endocannabinoid
system and the, um, the deficiencies,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm seeing some studies that are just
coming out on, uh, migraines, ADHD,
[SPEAKER_04]: things of this nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're now, they're now, um, pointing to
endocannabinoid deficiencies as the
[SPEAKER_04]: premise of these issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, fun fact, fun fact.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the fun fact is,
[SPEAKER_04]: so the fun fact is, um, um, CBD or,
or the cannabinoids themselves,
[SPEAKER_04]: your endocannabinoid system, but the CBD
specifically is, um, I believe the only
[SPEAKER_04]: thing we found that can actually go in and
remove the plaque from the brain that
[SPEAKER_04]: leads to Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_04]: So getting back to what a miracle it
actually is, this plant is fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it does so much for so many
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's over a 5% variance in its DNA
content from plant that is override range.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a nine, there's like,
a 0.3% or less there is between you and a
[SPEAKER_00]: chimpanzee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about that for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about how long it's been around
genetically modified itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why, you know, if you say plant the
same genetic at sea level versus 1800
[SPEAKER_00]: meters, you're going to have a completely
different, you know, um, you can't take
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics from Canada and plan them in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_04]: They think you can though.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they've ruined Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Jamaican used to have Jamaican gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were all in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you in Jamaica?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a sneaky little guy though.
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta, you gotta know where to find
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta know where to find him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Under the radar.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not going to let you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk about Jamaica and what's
happening there and all of the new strains
[SPEAKER_05]: cropping up in Canadian money flowing in
and what the fuck's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in 2015 bio track where I was the
CIO, CFO, designed and implemented the
[SPEAKER_00]: track and trace for the university of West
Indies and university technology in
[SPEAKER_00]: Kingston.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we passed and wrote the law with
minister Paul well to legalize the
[SPEAKER_00]: possession of cannabis on the island up to
two ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought they were on the fast track to
becoming a very successful country at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but Jamaica has a, uh, uh,
cultural hurdle to get over by which
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of greed and there's a lot
of corruption and everybody wants it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pride of Jamaica has cost them the
opportunity to actually really be anything
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the branding of Jamaica was,
you know, come to Jamaica, get on the
[SPEAKER_00]: beaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so branded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swimming in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_02]: People would be getting naked in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we were there once, we were there
with her, my stepdaughter and walked out
[SPEAKER_02]: onto our balcony, like just gotten into
the hotel room, big cliff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Overlooking this thing that cruises up
right underneath us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, well, welcome to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw something slide down the slide that
I, but Jamaica has still, um, regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: their program to a medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in other words, if you're a tourist,
you have to go into a place and lie to a
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say, you know, just to get really,
I have my medical card.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're okay with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: Liz grow has her medical card in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, you know, the industry,
um, over the past decade, a great friend
[SPEAKER_00]: of mine, Dr. Darrell Hudson, um,
who's a world renowned geneticist,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, PhD in this industry, uh, in Canada,
outside of Toronto, uh, has been studying
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoid contents and THC levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of Jamaican cannabis for over a decade in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a wellness retreat, um,
in Jamaica as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Psychedelic research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, we've, we've talked about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, over the past decade,
Jamaican gold had a certain THC and you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: find it, you know, in very various areas
of the island, people have been
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing, uh, CBD and hemp into the
island and not understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is part, a classic example of the
Jamaican arrogance that is costing them
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is that they've been smuggling
it in, planting it and not pulling the
[SPEAKER_00]: males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been pollinating, uh,
the entire Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there used to be no CBD on Jamaica,
no CBD in their strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's a one to one everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, is that where Lamb's Breath went?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is that what basically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I mean it just diluted,
diluted, diluted, diluted.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on an Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're going through your field and
pulling your males.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're screwing everybody.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's not their way of, I mean,
their way of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we were in Cannex in Jamaica,
I don't know if you're blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you were at that,
uh, one, uh, geneticist panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Darrell Hudson was on the panel with
several other people and Jamaican said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we were, we saw that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shot that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was almost like very, you could
feel the confrontation, the conflict in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, you know, after all these
conferences, that was the best,
[SPEAKER_00]: because he came up and said, Jamaica is
about combining all the weed from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Island and smushing it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're going to act toward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he doesn't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That that's not what the industry's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about smushing your weed
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about refining our art of what we can
create to help people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a really about getting high.
[SPEAKER_00]: The secret is it's, you know, everybody
likes to smoke and get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it, but it's really about what we
can do to change the planet and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and help humanity become healthy again.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a gateway drug to health and
happiness 100% because you can't not think
[SPEAKER_05]: about the other decisions that you make on
a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_05]: When your stress levels level is down and
you're in communion with a plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: you start thinking about things that are
real.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, literally aids with homeostasis,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It levels out every system in your body.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, I mean, is a huge, but even at a
societal level, you see what we're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's super communal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever seen like anybody like get
high and like go fight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, more, you know, you share,
express kindness, you know, you express
[SPEAKER_05]: ideas, you know, and vulnerabilities,
you know, and in a space that we,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, Oh my God, this is live.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is being recorded.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's hardcore recorded.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, we're, we're doing something big
with this conversation right now,
[SPEAKER_05]: but yet I don't feel encumbered by,
you know, like fears of like looking like
[SPEAKER_05]: an idiot with you guys, you know,
because we've shared this together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I encourage people to smoke
on the street to be honest, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I want people to smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want people to be familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want their kids to smell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So California now, um, you might already
be aware of this, but very recently
[SPEAKER_04]: there's only five, if you have a doctor,
there's recommendation.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only five places you can't smoke
in the state of California in public.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, um, I mean, you got to look at
the pop brothers a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Within like so many, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The best, the, within so many,
what's their Friday called?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, shut the fuck up Fridays.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're great.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but yeah, operating a boat is one of
the places in public that you can't smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: within operating a boat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a vehicle that is operating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and within so many feet of a school
and there, there's two others.
[SPEAKER_05]: I forget what they are, but why,
what if you use the herb for worship?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would certainly use it, but that's why I
really have made more of a transition away
[SPEAKER_00]: from the regulated THC market here in
California and letting the dust settle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I'm going to give you
some truth right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulated market is surviving because
they're participating in both sides and
[SPEAKER_04]: 80% of the legal market in California is
black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, no, no, in the legal
dispensary market, that is a chain of
[SPEAKER_00]: custody, which only legal product tested
product makes it into there's a more
[SPEAKER_00]: robust, even existing in LA black market
dispensary that they are selling their
[SPEAKER_00]: excess products that they're producing on
their old facilities labeled in and they
[SPEAKER_00]: just put it in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, listen, can't really blame
them to be honest with you because,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the taxation system, the state of
California, you know, I remember I was at
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2015, the first department of taxation,
um, hearing on how to design the track and
[SPEAKER_00]: trace system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, you know, we tried to
give the state an idea of, listen,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't thwart the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to give taxation at various
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had reconstructed the taxation,
uh, um, code for Washington because they
[SPEAKER_04]: had learned this lesson already.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you felt they were on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, this was early,
this was 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the time it really got handed down,
uh, so many more influencers had come into
[SPEAKER_00]: try different techniques to really get the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they did is really screwed themselves
because if they were to actually provide
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry, especially in the beginning,
a little less of a taxation, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: or actually a significant less taxation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tax it in a different model associated
with production at various life cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: changes of change of custody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they would have made a lot more money
instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have made it literally or nearly
impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially in LA is a tragic example
to make money in, uh, in the legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, why would I buy an
eighth of cannabis at $75 when I can go
[SPEAKER_00]: next door and listen on lead maps and buy
it for 25 bucks?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 1992 pricing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 2020.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So walk us through the track and trace a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for those that, that don't understand,
um, what's been rolled out or what,
[SPEAKER_04]: what is, you know, up your sleeve when it
comes to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, um, in order to provide a closed
loop economic system for agriculturally
[SPEAKER_00]: tracked product, you need to make sure
that there's no illegal or illicit
[SPEAKER_00]: inventory coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to make sure that you're not
having money laundering taking place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to make sure that you're not
delivering this regulated commodity to,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, people that shouldn't get it like
children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really what that means is that you
need to have, unlike any other
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural product, a track and trace
down to the gram for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when Washington went live, uh,
37 country companies bid on the RFP for,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, track and trace software program for
the governmental regulatory system,
[SPEAKER_00]: bio track, THC, which is based in Fort
Lauderdale, um, won that bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, during the implementation of
that, uh, we, you know, learned a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about, you know, what taxation models work
or, you know, you know, how to not allow
[SPEAKER_00]: monopolization or, you know, big corporate
interests just to own the whole market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, uh, you know, it was the
beginning of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So track and trace is literally
quintessentially important for the opening
[SPEAKER_00]: of international trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one day we will have a federal legal
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day we will be able to export
California branded cannabis cause
[SPEAKER_00]: California branded cannabis is the best in
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell you that every day of the week and
twice on Sunday, but I'm saying this when,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it has a premium all around the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: But give me, give me a little insight on
how it's even traceable down to the gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, there's a couple of different
techniques to do it that are implemented
[SPEAKER_00]: right now in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, RFID tagging radio frequency
identification is implemented by bio
[SPEAKER_00]: tracks largest competitor and the winner
of the city of California is contract
[SPEAKER_00]: called metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a company called Franwell,
the core, which really developed a system
[SPEAKER_00]: of track cabbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote a paper in 2016 of 16 different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sneak, uh, pounds out the back
door.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when Colorado and Washington went live
bio track one, Washington metric one in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, it's been a learning
process for both companies since and a
[SPEAKER_00]: battle of who's going to get the next
state contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, California was a beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like no other, because it's the fifth
largest economy in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 60% of the cannabis in the world
has grown here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it is, it might be an under
estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, that's conservative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, and it's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, trying to regulate an existing
market versus something that was coming
[SPEAKER_00]: new is, uh, proving to be more cumbersome
than a track and trace system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyone that exists in my opinion
really can handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, metric has an RFID tagging system
to answer your question and you just scan
[SPEAKER_00]: your RFID reader.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Colorado, we saw an example of an
example of them just being in a box and
[SPEAKER_00]: scan the box and you're growing eight
rooms, you're not reporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to happen with the
system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why, why is cannabis, why is it a
necessity to track to that level?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a schedule one regulated
drug.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we lose that, I mean, if we ditch
that, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cannabis comes down to schedule five.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, it enables a government to tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get down to the nitty gritty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is your question, Ash?
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your website?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if weed drops down to schedule five as
hemp has, what, what game changer is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we now get to consume lemon extract the
same as cannabis extract because it's no
[SPEAKER_04]: longer schedule one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, is that their, is that their hook in
the fish?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that schedule five?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the reason it's not a safety
issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, there's no other play.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're going to, you know,
safety plays a part in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if we're going to give medicine
to people, let's make sure it doesn't make
[SPEAKER_00]: them sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to smoke regulated tested
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke, I smoke clean organic cannabis,
preferably outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for hundreds of years, millions of
people have smoked cannabis grown in the
[SPEAKER_04]: Hills by hippies that don't wash their
hands without much, you know, like it's
[SPEAKER_04]: been an industry, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But we start talking about the beginning
of the industry when, what were we talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about earlier?
[SPEAKER_04]: 2012, 2000, when the first money really
came in and we start, we start looking at
[SPEAKER_04]: this new horizon of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, um, you know, pioneers in
the industry in Colorado, like Norton
[SPEAKER_00]: Abaleas and Los Arias, uh, green horizon
and affordably of, uh, Neda in
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found it really, River Rock in
Colorado, uh, in 2009, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, these guys were, are really like the
heroes of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Norton was recently in the national
geographic, um, about his struggle,
[SPEAKER_00]: about how, you know, from a legal
standpoint, they had attacked two
[SPEAKER_00]: attorneys that, uh, you know, believe so
heavily in plant medicine that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, they took a, you know,
everything they had to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: really provide a legal evidence and
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: For undeniable fact, this is a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes you better.
[SPEAKER_00]: What country was this in?
[SPEAKER_04]: This was in Colorado, in the U S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, that's really what I
think that, you know, Colorado was really,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, the really the launch pin for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: California, I mean, they made a medical in
98, but, uh, Colorado by beginning to
[SPEAKER_00]: track it and agreeing to do that may came
to a level where now we can tax it and now
[SPEAKER_00]: we can pay the IRS income.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can have a federally regulated
system and eventually we'll be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: export our cannabis and the United States
will have a THC revolution, but that has
[SPEAKER_04]: to be trackable at each point of the
process.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's raw material, extractive material,
finished product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if there's a recall, you need to
be able to find out where it came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's the root of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, there's a, there's a most
advanced system that I've come across
[SPEAKER_00]: after all of the track and trace systems
that I've looked at from Switzerland,
[SPEAKER_00]: SIGPA, SIGPA to, um, you know,
what exists in the marketplace is now a
[SPEAKER_00]: system called Backbone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're the same guys that built
QuickBooks and, uh, and that's sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sold it to Oracle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've come in with a real ERP that gives
you just a life cycle dashboard of where
[SPEAKER_00]: it stands through the entire life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really the best system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Backbone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Backbone IQ.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I, I love your passion is it's so like
it's hard not to just like get fired up
[SPEAKER_02]: being around you and like, like I think
you, you, um, you, you've got such a,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, an amazing depth and knowledge for
this and, uh, you're fired up about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to know what is sort of your
future, like your ideal future,
[SPEAKER_02]: like what does it look like for America
and this, and this hemp game and this,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, and really the cannabis, you know,
uh, revolution baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, uh, I was working for that law
firm until my birthday in August and I
[SPEAKER_00]: resigned to launch the shoe company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very focused on this, but I'm
moving my sole shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just wrote you a jingle since we don't
take it to be quite honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't serve that company best as the
CEO or even a CEO executive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm best as, you know, being on the road
and spreading the, my, my vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the, uh, former executive vice
president of Nike for the past 13 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: Danny Tway's coming in as CEO and I've
built a team of all my friends in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're a team of passionate people for
it and we're to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I, uh, I accepted the role as the
global expansion officer for green
[SPEAKER_00]: horizon, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we, uh, are building a million square
foot cultivation facility in Coachella and
[SPEAKER_00]: launching a brand called natural States
for CBD and hemp products of many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many different categories in 23 countries
in the next 24 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll be launching the first,
uh, beauty, CB health and wellness,
[SPEAKER_00]: women facing line in Harrods in London,
this upcoming quarter and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: edible line in Japan, uh, and culturing
each product by the geography in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can, can I get some of those?
[SPEAKER_04]: Edibles or do I got to import them?
[SPEAKER_05]: This woman's line, you know, you got to
test them.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Liz gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I, I believe that the woman is
really the decision maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Women are much better leaders than we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had this conversation last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, it's so obvious to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the sooner we can get out of this
male dominated society, the better will be
[SPEAKER_00]: my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Hillary for president.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I, I, I like Bernie's chances,
but I love her as a foreign too.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's much bigger than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's definitely just as long as
you get the orange demon out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter loves that guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter cannabis on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this, uh, I was a swimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I got this jacket in sixth
grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't grown since the beard too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I got it big.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I could go into it intentionally.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were that smart as a six year old.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is SA San Antonio,
uh, St. Andrew school.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, my mother was a flight attendant
for 42 years and she would fly to commute
[SPEAKER_00]: to Chicago, to fly to China, to fly back,
commute home, and then work a second job
[SPEAKER_00]: to pay for me to go to this private
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my life goal is taking care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, this, this past January,
I could, because able to accomplish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drove every early possession across the
country, moved her into the building next
[SPEAKER_00]: door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she is retired.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that her official retirement?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was she working up until you, you snatched
her up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should have had mom on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tell us about some speaking engagements
you have coming up or, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: things that are shaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, green horizon is, uh, the entry
for the Hill figure family to enter the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tommy and, uh, is our co-founder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so his daughter and I, um,
are going to be touring certain locations
[SPEAKER_00]: in Europe, um, and, uh, Asia and South
America and central America and the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States really conveying the message of how
this plant can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'll let her speak about her story,
but, um, she's written a book that's a New
[SPEAKER_00]: York times bestseller called bite me about
her battle with Lyme disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how some of the proprietary
formulations we're coming out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've developed a medicine involving
cannabinoids that's treating it
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So green horizon has a lot of things to go
green horizon, California.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really like your such a Renaissance
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you are touching so many pieces
of this plant in these industries.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, um, if you could pick one,
you could just pick one thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: What would it be industrialized hemp and
what thing within industrialized hemp?
Fashion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, killing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Killing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you can't stump this fucker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he's got the answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not trying to stump.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just so grateful that I can think of
questions, you know, while I can't,
[SPEAKER_05]: it just kind of dawned on me, you know,
last night when we were prepping for this,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like, Oh, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my podcast.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can ask whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm so curious, you know,
about, you know, people who are truly
[SPEAKER_05]: changing this industry, changing the way
we are conscious about hemp in this plant
[SPEAKER_05]: and marijuana and fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it's just, it's a cooler
way to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, when you're in line
with, uh, you know, it's good for the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole and not just yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you start making better ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, life is not about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about altruism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about loving the common man and not
expecting anything in return, doing it for
[SPEAKER_00]: the love and master hippie, you know,
I practice plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I practice ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I get in touch and talk to
God as much as I possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live by God's justice and hemp is God's
justice, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's another shirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got about 12 shirts out of Peter today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's print some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's possible to,
um, do you think it's possible to like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what does the campaign have to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we keep convincing people to buy
hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it starts in a couple of
different levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, obviously rocking these
motherfuckers, taking off the leather and
[SPEAKER_05]: putting on the hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear you universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you, you gotta make it cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta make it something you identify
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody looks down and is like,
damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you say, wow, it's made out of
hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, have you ever had the
reaction to these that they're not cool?
Nope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not once.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not once.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen the reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked around in a show once that when
it told me, I just made it for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a little town in Mexico and I make
these with a family.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fifth generation cobbler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is my very first pair I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was walking around in it,
dude, these are, and I just made it for
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got stopped 27 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: In one day, where are those shoes from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, maybe I should do
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, um, what, uh, how long have you had
these?
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandmother died in June 4th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that's, I was running on the,
uh, beaches of Tel Aviv serving the
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose of this law firm that I had no
interest in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't get home and take care of
my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I'm going to take the shoe
that I designed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: June 4th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never, um, never held another man's
shoe for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And listen to the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: This foot has walked the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, this shoe has gotten around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, it's, uh, I just, I'm so inspired by
you, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long time coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to tell you, you've totally
fulfilled all of my, um, preconceived
[SPEAKER_05]: notions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just with stories and, you know,
little things that I've seen in social and
[SPEAKER_05]: here and there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, your name is Peter,
but I feel like, you know, you're kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: a Jay Peterman figure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're this man who, you know,
on Seinfeld, we all know Jay Peterman.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Josh is also, you know,
described to us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, you're like this Jay Peterman
figure who is, who's gone all over the
[SPEAKER_05]: earth, who is just, uh, he's altruistic.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's there for content.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a common man.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's there for his fellow man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he wants to make the world a better
place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he's bringing back these beautiful
shoes or this root that you put between
[SPEAKER_05]: your teeth and you feel, uh, you know,
I'm just like, you're like the explorer
[SPEAKER_05]: that brings back little gifts for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave up the direction of my life to God
when I started practicing ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been very ups and downs,
but I was fortunate enough to serve the
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortune 500 law firm of Zuber Lawler and
be the director of their cannabis client.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, when you live out of a suitcase
for 18 months and travel 25 days a month,
[SPEAKER_00]: you meet awesome people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You realize that the things that people
value like cars and like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: possessions and even real estate really
don't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fallacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even money's a fallacy in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that's created by society
that really doesn't have any true value.
[SPEAKER_04]: We agree that there's value is the only
reason there is value.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what the most powerful and
valuable currency there is?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your effect on others.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, you can change the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so money is the placation of our
weakness.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you give up the importance of it in
life, you know, you live off a little bit.
