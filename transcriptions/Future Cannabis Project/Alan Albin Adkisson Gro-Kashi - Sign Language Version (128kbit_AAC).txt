[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is your This is our baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is grow Kashi and it's like a multi
vitamin mineral complex A fertilizer that
[SPEAKER_00]: can help your garden achieve beneficial
runoff Be more beneficial if you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: leave a footprint leave a beneficial
footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes So I'm Alan Ackerson.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my company grow Kashi We use
solid-state fermentation technology and
[SPEAKER_00]: effective microorganisms and a blend of
multi vitamins and Beneficial products to
[SPEAKER_03]: create that for you guys I lost there's no
way I could How do we say effective
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganism?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we have here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's This is our situation folks
[SPEAKER_00]: So So what he needs to do is try to figure
out how he's communicating Just like they
[SPEAKER_00]: would out compete the pathogens during our
beer making or our wine making Or a cheese
[SPEAKER_00]: making Okay, so I come from a dairy
background Where as a child I traveled
[SPEAKER_00]: with my dad and we would cover up the the
feed for the animals at the dairies And it
[SPEAKER_00]: was just that the beginning of a science
called solid-state fermentation
[SPEAKER_00]: The runoff from the silage Cured the
pollution in the manure lagoon So that's
[SPEAKER_00]: when beneficial runoff the idea of
beneficial runoff Came around especially
[SPEAKER_00]: involving lactic acid bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: So years later I got into the cannabis
business when I moved here to the Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: Triangle about 2000 and Because I had a
background in the bioremediation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic Superfund site I Thought we could
use the same microbes When growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis To make our farming beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: She says you came up with this from a
dairy farm I grew up working at many many
[SPEAKER_00]: dairies in Washington State in California
and so after I was out of the dairy
[SPEAKER_00]: business, I was in the cannabis industry
and Jack hair and Eddie Lep had me trained
[SPEAKER_00]: to make this Bokashi product because of my
background
[SPEAKER_02]: So those were my mentors she says where do
you like to source your material from oh
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we try to source our Inputs for this
product from only people and companies
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been proven to give back and You
know be deemed at least organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know in certification processes So my
beta testing group Vets every single
[SPEAKER_00]: product that goes into this product
[SPEAKER_03]: If we were building soil we would use one
gallon to one yard Later on we would use
[SPEAKER_00]: one-third cup per square foot top dressed
bi-weekly
[SPEAKER_00]: Several weeks after your application it
[SPEAKER_00]: is the food for your beneficial
microorganisms
[SPEAKER_00]: Top dressing is best in my opinion also
Although you could make a drench and
[SPEAKER_00]: drench your plant and the soil Absolutely,
it's a multi-purpose probiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: We could take an activated aerated compost
tea like Elaine Ingram talks about and
[SPEAKER_00]: Then use this product at the end and
stabilize it up to ten days
[SPEAKER_03]: She says and what part of the growth
seasons do you like to use this for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Throughout the growth season, but I tend
to stop about halfway into a flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: period Because the product has a tendency
with some crops like onions and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep the crop from ripening fully I
believe that it's because it keeps it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative state
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes would stay clear Onions and
other crops are also known to not mature
[SPEAKER_00]: fully if we keep this product going
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the one thing that we all have in
common is that We would like for our
[SPEAKER_00]: farming to be beneficial You
