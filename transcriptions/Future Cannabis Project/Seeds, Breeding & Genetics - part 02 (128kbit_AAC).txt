[SPEAKER_06]: 2013, I think, or 2012.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back when we could still do stuff in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Back when High Times was really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back when it was actually fun in Holland.
[SPEAKER_02]: A long time ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the first year we met was 2012.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had booths across for each other at
High Times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Swerve had the biggest, biggest,
amazing, crazy booth with like 30 people
[SPEAKER_06]: working it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Loud Seeds was this little booth right
across from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think four of us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they had a microphone.
[SPEAKER_06]: They had Hap on the microphone back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where was that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Here?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you had a big ass booth over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't the milk bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was... No, it was the one that was
outside the city in little ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Power Zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Power Zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a cool venue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wild.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've sat on panels before.
[SPEAKER_06]: We hung out in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: One time we even hung out in Amsterdam and
I was talking to Swerve and he was like,
[SPEAKER_06]: so I heard someone was saying you talk
shit about me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I literally got a text at the same
exact time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was like, I heard Swerve's pissed
at you and fucking he's talking shit about
[SPEAKER_06]: you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like that kind of stuff went on
back in the day a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: The drama from... That was like the early
days of Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: High school drama.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was even more crazy than high school
drama.
[SPEAKER_06]: The marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: The marijuana industry and a lot of guys
acting like kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it funny though how more people took
offense to stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Than actually worrying about the simple
fact of we're doing something extremely
[SPEAKER_02]: illegal and we have to worry about the
cops.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're more worried about the other
person that was like, hey, your cuts are
[SPEAKER_02]: really bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're worried about the cuts or the seeds
but you're not worried about the fact that
[SPEAKER_02]: everything we do is 100% illegal and we're
actually breaking the law to do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a weird thought now that I think
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How lucky the modern day grower is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The modern day generation.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't even have to experience the
stuff we had to get to this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like bizarro world in some ways
back then too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of wild to see like you guys
were talking, how you have like some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the...
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was saying, some of these people
that are placing the orders and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: like, oh yeah, we need 100,000 seeds or we
need a million seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, wait a second, a million?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to grow all those seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, yeah, we've got a land and
we're going to grow all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, wait a second here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, some of these companies are
stockpiling seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard...
[SPEAKER_06]: A specific company bought 5 million auto
flower seeds this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I was like, they must have a lot
of land.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got to be crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to get in on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to sell some seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it turns out that they're stockpiling
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like they're burning through that
every year.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think big companies are getting ready
to go online and they want to have
[SPEAKER_06]: stockpile and they have tons of money.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was never a thing back in the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: A million seeds, like maybe 50,000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: A kilo of seeds was like...
[SPEAKER_06]: You get a big deal.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get a kilo of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, yeah, 33,000 seeds,
40,000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, in seeds change, depending on the
cultivar, you can have small seeds,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can have big seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can weigh anywhere as small as like
0.012 of a gram to 0.2, 0.25.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen some monsters think like Ray
from Homegrown Natural Wonders,
[SPEAKER_06]: Odie that used to work for Sub.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has these seeds that don't even look
like cannabis seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're so big.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he grows outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all indicative to the cowlicks
that it was growing, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I did side by side.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I first started making seeds again
after my little hiatus, I had some
[SPEAKER_06]: outdoors and some indoors.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the outdoor ones were the same as the
indoors, the females.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the seeds that I harvested off them
were completely different looking in the
[SPEAKER_06]: sense the outdoor ones were much bigger.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's because of the... I was
using Gavitas, like 1,100 watts on them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so because they're so strong,
it changes the bud density.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that puts pressure on the seed so
the seed doesn't get as big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't get anywhere near as big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't have the chance to spread out and
get some roundness or room.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you started working in Amsterdam over
10 years ago?
[SPEAKER_02]: Around 10 years ago?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, about 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, buddy?
[SPEAKER_02]: How you been?
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my first cannabis cup as a
competitor was 2009 or 2010.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget when our first award is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think our first award is from 2011.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that at the Power Zone?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just talking about how it was in
the Power Zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: The good old days of the Power Zone before
we had that awesome raid at that beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: tennis courts.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the last one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't the official last one for me,
but it was my last one for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was an adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing like being raided by Dutch
police.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they arrested Mila out of all
people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Arjen bailed Mila out of jail for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because she was doing demonstration,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: She was in the middle of a demonstration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Classic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was an adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The changing of the guard, so to speak,
from when they went from like sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: chill and relaxed over in Holland to super
conservative.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like 2012 was cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was like the last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sort of like Steve Hager and the Temple
Dragons being part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was a sort of bittersweet
moment there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it good or bad?
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing about the cups back then,
which was really cool in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_04]: was that it was every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you had a whole year to kind of
gear up for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when it happened, it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was also still kind of hokey.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that hokeyness came through as sort of
like authentic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then now maybe they're more efficient
as far as like more people, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_04]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you have so many of them and you
saturate your market, it's like how many
[SPEAKER_04]: cups can you really go to?
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a company, it's really hard to pick
and choose.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you have the nightmare to think
about every show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it going to be a winner or a loser?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a winner?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a loser?
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's more losers than winners these
days at these shows because we've
[SPEAKER_04]: saturated.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing cups every other week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cash grabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're doing this like one day
events.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Detroit, one day event.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm coming in Portland, one day event.
[SPEAKER_08]: Colorado, 420, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the Portland one is just an award
show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even an event.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's technically just an award show.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just like, hey, give us your weed
and your money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give us your $1,100 for entry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give us your money and your weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no show so you don't get $500
entries.
[SPEAKER_06]: We get to charge you the full price.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, and that was the problem
is that like also because when most people
[SPEAKER_04]: came to Europe, it was double the
venturing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, not only were you judging a
cannabis cup, but you're actually in
[SPEAKER_04]: another country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so everybody was pumped up and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you drive like, you know,
a Riverside, it's not like it's not got
[SPEAKER_04]: the same sort of flair to it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, okay, this is going to be
fucked.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's no parking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we haven't thought about these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like this crazy like lack of,
of basic things.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Oklahoma was a disaster and they didn't
have water.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like 107 degrees, three hour wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: Parking was two miles.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the place people were in wheelchairs
wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is just a few months ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, it was just like my,
I got, I got stressed out calls from my
[SPEAKER_04]: friends who were like, can you get me in
touch with anybody at high times?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we have no water.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I could hear people like yelling in
the background.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, Oh dude, it's fire fast going
on out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a proper, it was a proper disaster.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I think that the future of that
is going to be back to those 300 to 500
[SPEAKER_04]: people events that are like, you kind of
get to talk to all of them and every hang
[SPEAKER_04]: out instead of like a couple thousand
people or 10,000 people or 20,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause those, those, they just loses at a
certain point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's impossible to really judge it
properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a Denver, those two years or
three years where there was a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand people at the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was, it was, there was a,
I mean, cause I moved to Colorado in 2009
[SPEAKER_04]: and I was really surprised for the first
time in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd actually like bed on the floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking right horse, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I was like, Oh, this place could get
legal here, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all of a sudden, Hey,
fucking rec weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of a sudden we're like, wow,
I'm in this spot after being in Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_04]: for so long.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, but to see how they lost that
whole gig due to bad organization and
[SPEAKER_04]: like, it's really hard to put a hundred
thousand people anywhere and make them all
[SPEAKER_04]: happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had no structure to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then when you add dabbing to it,
it just killed me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, not enough tables.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not enough plugs, not enough tables,
too many people passing out of ambulances,
[SPEAKER_04]: not enough water, not enough water.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was just like, again,
recipe for disaster high times.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they got in corporate too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're, and they're getting their ass
handed to them when it comes to like
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to get an IPO going and trying to
like think that it's really like the
[SPEAKER_04]: culture is moving ahead faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they still have the opportunity to
change.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have the core.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have the core.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have the core.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they're lucky.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're lucky to be able to fall,
but it's the written, the magazines are
[SPEAKER_04]: dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's like a waste of time.
Print.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of print media is dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and then when you go, but when you go
online with it, it's, you got to be
[SPEAKER_04]: working nonstop.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you have to be working on those
events and they don't have a great track
[SPEAKER_04]: record when it comes to taking out permits
and doing all these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's one of the things when it comes
to doing cannabis related events,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the, I've tried to do it for
years and in Amsterdam where you think it
[SPEAKER_04]: would be easy, it was even more hard
because they actually had rules,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had one year where I let a Dutch guy
do the marketing for me and he just put
[SPEAKER_04]: out like on Reuters, like we're going to
roll the world's biggest joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be 500 grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then within an hour we had the cops
contacting us going like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, we're going to be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, yeah, but everybody's going
to put their own weed in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, there's not going to be one guy
with 500 grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were like, no, the minute it all
goes into that one joint, it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to rage you.
You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, shit, why the fuck did you
tell them?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the main, you got to like, just do it
in these situations and then talk about it
[SPEAKER_04]: after that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my word of advice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that whole system over there,
like as far as their coffee shops and how
[SPEAKER_06]: they get weed, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're only allowed like, what,
500 grams at any one given time in the
[SPEAKER_06]: coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: And most of them have, most of the coffee
shops have networks of guys on scooters
[SPEAKER_06]: that will deliver and run from the cops
because they can't get pulled over.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll get arrested.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not legal until it gets through the
door.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a total cat and mouse game.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's also the weirder one,
which was they now, because when I was
[SPEAKER_04]: there, it was not legal to sell space cake
ever, but people still did.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now they actually have rules,
but the rules are you have to be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: see the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, basically you just have to
make the worst edibles possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like here you go, make the worst edibles
and then you can sell them.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as people can see little flakes of
weed in all of your products.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, oh, counterproductive in
those things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the funny thing about Holland
though is it's like, they're looking at us
[SPEAKER_04]: like with a mouse agape, like they just
can't believe what's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, no, you guys had 25 years
to do this and make this work,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you just never wanted to acknowledge
the grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the grower is the most important part
of the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in the day, it was pretty much you go
to the guy, he grew weed, you got it from
[SPEAKER_04]: him.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very small window.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you get it from a guy who has 20 guys
growing for him and 15 guys trimming for
[SPEAKER_04]: him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it goes through this UV control after
and gets handled seven times before it
[SPEAKER_04]: gets to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you wonder why it's not quite as
good as it was when you got it from your
[SPEAKER_04]: friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Dutch have been dealing with that
for 20 plus years.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why the weed was always like,
meh, kind of mediocre at best.
[SPEAKER_04]: And occasionally you get a good batch,
but that was because it was grown small by
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody, a few pounds here and there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the minute you got any kind of
consistency, but the whole point was they
[SPEAKER_04]: don't recognize growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to play this small grower cat
and mouse kind of vibe thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just be totally criminal and not give a
shit and rent huge warehouses and play
[SPEAKER_04]: that game.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those people don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's your classic no care weed at all,
as you can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are bringing stuff up from Morocco
and the stuff that came up from Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, now Spain is... I mean, if you go to
Europe and you don't go to Spain and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're a cannabis lover, then you're out
of your mind because that's where it's...
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Barcelona is the new Amsterdam for
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the heart and soul.
[SPEAKER_04]: The soul of cannabis in Europe is there
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was in Amsterdam for a long time,
but again, it wasn't the Dutch people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was all the tourists.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all the same guys in Barcelona that
were in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and now it's... The weather is nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, food.
[SPEAKER_02]: The food is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The food's actually good.
[SPEAKER_02]: The food is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not bad in Holland if you go to the
right spots, but for the most part... It's
[SPEAKER_02]: everything Holland's not in that sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good weather, good food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's bland.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are sort of nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're nicer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now they're rioting like
motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, we're in Spain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: People dying and stuff, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and that's the thing about they're
very passionate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can say that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very passionate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very passionate, but in general,
I mean, definitely when it comes to
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, it sits... It has a much more
California vibe to it though too.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're there, you can actually... You
can finish outdoor weed there in November.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't... Colorado is not... Amsterdam
is not conducive to outdoor growing in
[SPEAKER_04]: almost any way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few pockets of places,
but... Yeah, not even in greenhouses out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they really run off of natural light?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all still supplemental over in
Holland.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where, I mean, literally indoor
growing came from Holland because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they got all the water in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's never been a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got all the water in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, now you see how... Because
we're growing on a scale, it start to look
[SPEAKER_04]: very similar between the way people grow
in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was there, I was always butting
heads at these guys because I was ignorant
[SPEAKER_04]: and I was thinking that the American way
of growing was the right way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at that time period, everybody was
growing with air-cooled lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you were putting the lights right
down on the plants and growing completely
[SPEAKER_04]: different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody over there had 15 feet in
the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, you guys are crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it was like this whole change of
technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now America has adopted the Dutch
system and are doing it, I would say
[SPEAKER_04]: better because Dutch are very efficient.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can do it with less people.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can always cut every corner because
they don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll use an automatic thing,
whereas I think we're still kind of,
[SPEAKER_04]: for the most part, trying to create jobs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not trying to automate everything
too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's getting there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the most part, it's like the scale
is... I think you still do better when you
[SPEAKER_04]: have more hands on anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Automation is great, but you still need
people to take care of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just the reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you need to have the human touch,
the human hand, the human interaction,
[SPEAKER_02]: no matter what.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my honest opinion, like I said,
automation is awesome because it makes
[SPEAKER_02]: things obviously that much more efficient,
but the human touch, the human hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think there's things that should
be automated.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's things that shouldn't be
automated, like watering.
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally love automated watering.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the greatest thing ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: But my friends up in Seattle, House of
Cultivar, those guys hand water.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's because for their model,
hand watering works.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have 88 different cultivars at any
one given time.
[SPEAKER_06]: In a 34,000 square foot facility,
that's a lot of hand watering.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think those type of things should
definitely be automated.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like you can control it better.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the more you can control your
variables when you're growing large
[SPEAKER_06]: quantities, and also repeating the same
results, those things are important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, plants appreciate the timing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You realize when you try to do... If
you've ever tried to save money by not
[SPEAKER_04]: having like, I don't need a timer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just turn it on and off every day at
the right time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll never do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always gonna be a minute here,
a minute there, two minutes here,
[SPEAKER_04]: five minutes here.
[SPEAKER_04]: For you to literally get it on the time
every day is not happening, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a fail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when it comes to watering,
even though you could be consistent,
[SPEAKER_04]: depending on how you're growing,
it's better to feed them less amounts,
[SPEAKER_04]: but on a very consistent schedule,
and kind of let them go where they need to
[SPEAKER_04]: go and let them... Instead of trying to
baby every single plant, because my mom's
[SPEAKER_04]: the worst.
[SPEAKER_04]: She picks up every single plant when she's
doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: She'll go in and it takes her two hours to
do what takes me a half hour, because I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: just kind of like, well, I'll go do it,
come back, and if I see a missed a spot or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever, I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But she'll go in and pick up every single
plant, double check, triple check,
[SPEAKER_04]: and water it just right, perfectly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not effective time-wise.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all look great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what you do with your moms and
your things that you're not.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you're doing production,
in a way, it's a lot nicer when you can
[SPEAKER_04]: just plug a dripper, depending on your
system, how you're going to feed it,
[SPEAKER_04]: or bottom feed it, or have it on a
Dosatron, or whatever system you're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be using.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you notice that, wow, they sure do
produce way better when someone else is
[SPEAKER_04]: doing the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm a big fan of... For making
seeds, I prefer making seeds in a sterile
[SPEAKER_06]: environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: I use cocoa, which is more sterile than
soil, obviously.
[SPEAKER_06]: But as far as for smoking, I prefer living
soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't beat the taste.
[SPEAKER_06]: Salts are good, and they're great for mass
production.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for seeds, salts, using salts,
as opposed to organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So GH is pretty much salt-based.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's all salt-based.
[SPEAKER_06]: HGV.
[SPEAKER_06]: My friends in Arizona are using HGV,
and they're crushing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything with a G or H in it seems to
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's being made out of salt these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is the most effective, and it is
easy, especially in a Dosatron situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Things like when you're automated,
you kind of have to fall into line.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very hard to do organic and have it
automated beyond... I think even with
[SPEAKER_04]: that, when you're doing living soils and
stuff, there's really no point of
[SPEAKER_04]: automating it, because your work schedules
are a lot lower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wrigley in Nevada has a 40,000 square foot
facility of living soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they've scaled it, and that's great for
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't tried the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just have soakers in there or
something?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's an interesting concept.
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe it's more beneficial for the
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even making seeds, maybe it's better.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in my results, I feel like I've gotten
better results from using cocoa with seeds
[SPEAKER_06]: and using Net-a-Fem drippers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I water several times a day,
and I keep it real simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, seven times, three minutes maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four minutes max.
[SPEAKER_06]: Depending on how big a pot, I've grown in
as small as one gallon and 12 plants per
[SPEAKER_06]: 600.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just more water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just more water all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they dry out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you ever use the Charcor biopots?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's cocoa, and they come in these
blocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have bags, and then you hydrate
them, and they spring out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can transplant one bag right to
the next.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can use the- That's convenient.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the one liter will go in like a two
gallon.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for making seeds, it's super simple,
because you can- And I like from Nick
[SPEAKER_04]: Drow's Pyramids.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've seen those, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The pyramid pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are badass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the thing is when you're
growing on a scale, it's all about
[SPEAKER_04]: consistency.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about trying to do things.
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of have to get real boring if you
want it, because you can't start making
[SPEAKER_04]: adjustments.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to make everything very linear.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want your lighting schedule to be-
There's no point of turning bulbs in
[SPEAKER_04]: different directions to try to fill in
gaps.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you get all those old ways of
thinking like, I'm going to run a couple
[SPEAKER_04]: over this way and a couple over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you start growing anything that's
especially custom built and or when you're
[SPEAKER_04]: talking 40, 50, 60,000 square foot
facilities, it's kind of boring because
[SPEAKER_04]: they all start to become very homogenized.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all CAD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all rolling tables.
[SPEAKER_04]: SOPs.
[SPEAKER_04]: SOPs all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what's your SOP like?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's 50 pages.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you start to see it when you tour all
these facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: You start to go like, yep, it's
unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_04]: My thing that I loved about back in the
day, especially when people were a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit more creative, was that you would find
a nugget at every grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: There'd be one guy who just filled
reservoirs every day for seven years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he came up with the smartest way to
never fuck up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just like, oh yeah, I went to
Home Depot when I got this thing and I put
[SPEAKER_04]: it under.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, genius.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because those people did it every
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now the problem, it takes a lot of
that creativity away because if they're
[SPEAKER_04]: fertigating with Dosatron, you pretty much
have them under contract or you have Argus
[SPEAKER_04]: or you have another one of these big
companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're a slave to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like driving a Tesla.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like you're not going to go home and
fix that thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: If your car breaks up, call Tesla and
they'll come and tow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of where a lot of the
grows are getting.
[SPEAKER_04]: See you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where a lot of the grows are kind
of going towards where it's just literally
[SPEAKER_04]: everything is under contract.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus people are as you noticed,
the next few years of this industry are
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be a lot of litigation because a
lot of people are putting a lot of energy
[SPEAKER_04]: and money into something and then figuring
out that it's totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, you don't, that was a big
waste of, oh, you mean we have to tear it
[SPEAKER_04]: out and someone's heads are going to roll.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all you see now in this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the big winners are going to be
lawyers in the next few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you guys were talking about it
earlier with all the hemp stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a couple of friends of mine,
even, I think they had, I think it was
[SPEAKER_02]: about 15 acres, thousands of pounds that
this state of Kentucky had to completely
[SPEAKER_02]: in under just bulldoze came in hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so many dollars seed straight up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred thousand seeds, 200,000 seeds,
a buck a seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, these are hemp seeds we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people complain about us selling THC
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, THC seeds, you know,
uh, you know, and that's the situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's, it's kind of flabbergasting to
see where, yeah, they put six,
[SPEAKER_02]: $700,000 in from a company who said,
Oh no, this is actually this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the COA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then their COA was full of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a point in time last year where
that one plant that they have to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: right one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a point in time last year when
if you put in like a COA into like Google
[SPEAKER_04]: search, there was like, bam, there'd be
like 50 of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you'd recognize like,
you'd be like, Oh, I just saw that one
[SPEAKER_04]: yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, literally it's like someone
would be in the parking lot, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: make a COA real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, so the same COAs were going
around for nine different types of seed
[SPEAKER_04]: that were nothing to do with those COAs at
all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Same thing with SOPs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't trust three letter things.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once it's been broken down into three
letters, it's usually a bad situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on, James, jump in.
[SPEAKER_04]: SOPs, we're talking to your language now.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking... I actually erased all our
SOPs and now we use a program called
[SPEAKER_08]: Traniel.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot better.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are in the crazy world of SEOs and
internet positioning and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's one of those things that I
don't really feel very sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do feel sorry, but I don't ever like
envy anybody's position because I know how
[SPEAKER_04]: hard that is.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the bane of my existence.
[SPEAKER_08]: Websites, it's just trying to keep them
up, trying to keep them going,
[SPEAKER_08]: working security wise, making sure we're
secure because we get randomly 100,000
[SPEAKER_08]: attacks a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you got closed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your account got shut down more times.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like probably like 17 time Instagram shut
down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we have the most boring Instagram
account ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: As soon as we put something up,
it would take it down 24 hours because
[SPEAKER_08]: that's the only way we can keep it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every time we get to 10,000 or 20,000,
boom, it shut us down 17 times.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were running out of names to name shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: What else do you call yourself?
[SPEAKER_08]: People would just report us.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like the genocide of cannabis,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_08]: They keep cutting down everybody's YouTube
accounts and all these Instagram accounts.
[SPEAKER_08]: People will forget about what people went
through and I don't know how many of you
[SPEAKER_08]: guys have all your pictures printed out
and have hard copies of them, but majority
[SPEAKER_08]: of them up there on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_08]: If they delete your account, that's your
history and people don't remember what
[SPEAKER_08]: people had to go through and what they
did.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like when ICMAG got deleted,
everybody's grow tips that they did,
[SPEAKER_08]: all that history all went away.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've got a form opened up on CJ now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So all my breeders have the ability to go
in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a form that's held on its own
separate server that's hosted in
[SPEAKER_08]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very secure, but everybody's able to
use it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have your own room.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can do the facts.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can ask him about his strains.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can ask to talk to the breeder
one-on-one and get the information from
[SPEAKER_08]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it hosted by Excess For All by any
chance?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were like the original guys in
Holland who did everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like anything shady back in the day,
it was always Excess For All.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, well, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was in the same building of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But actually that kind of swings it around
to when I heard that Swerve was going to
[SPEAKER_04]: join us, I was like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, interesting enough, I remember the
show that you came and I remember that it
[SPEAKER_04]: was funny because like, we didn't actually
talk during that show because we were both
[SPEAKER_04]: busy doing our own things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then later there was this kind of
like, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Adam doesn't like me or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just kind of how the industry
rolled.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it wasn't even that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was a situation of that I
recognized at that time, because I had
[SPEAKER_04]: heard your name and I think you were one
of the first guys in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_04]: because it wasn't that, I mean,
there was people selling online,
[SPEAKER_04]: but there wasn't a lot of people putting
their name out there yet that kind of like
[SPEAKER_04]: put their face behind it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think I kind of was curious at
the time because I felt like you were part
[SPEAKER_04]: of that next generation of breeders coming
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not as an insult, but it was like,
I was like, oh, see, he's got a little
[SPEAKER_04]: system because he's like online high
fiving himself every five minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: His homeboy is like, but we were actually
creating waves that I was seeing in
[SPEAKER_04]: Amsterdam just by the name.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I give you definitely kudos for that,
because that was also like, as you see the
[SPEAKER_04]: hustle has gotten fierce, but it's also
crazy, kind of like ridiculous too,
[SPEAKER_04]: because like the quality of the camera
that we have in our phones is so much
[SPEAKER_04]: better than those nuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like back in the day to get a photo of
your cannabis, to get a macro of your
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was trying all the time to like,
like imagining and you know, literally
[SPEAKER_04]: like the other day I got one of those
little tiny scope things and I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you see where we're at now?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just click, click it on your phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you got a 400, you know, times zoom,
you can take photos, videos.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like thinking to myself like,
man, we were like struggling.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like trying every angle to make
things work.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also the internet was sort of like,
I grew up in a generation that was kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: like, we didn't take, we didn't like we're
generation X.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we didn't really like jump to it as
much as the next generation, which
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely jumped to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think now it's, it is like,
it's like, like he was saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: if your Instagram account gets deleted,
you have no, no existence.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, I feel like that's kinda,
uh, it shows you a little bit of where the
[SPEAKER_04]: sales, it's a lot of smoke and mirrors,
you know, and you can't smell the weed,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't smoke the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some awesome photos.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I was saying, cameras are as good
as a SLR camera was.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can make the weed look way better
than it is for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some people just have a really good
eye, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: They could like bam, all that Avid and
Eagle 20 doesn't come up on right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, so what's your situation now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you're kind of bringing, uh,
you're kind of bringing things back
[SPEAKER_04]: online.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, keeping it going.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we've been, uh, just kind of
been low key.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, uh, you know, like most in
this industry, we hit a minor road bump
[SPEAKER_02]: called the police department.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, they won first split second,
but thankfully we have solid lawyers and
[SPEAKER_02]: they took care of everything for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we've managed to mitigate our
losses and we've been just direct sales as
[SPEAKER_02]: well as our, our wholesale over in Europe
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we faded away from Europe for a
minute, but we've been hitting the States
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hopefully about to announce once
everything's locked down and signed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, uh, tri-state deal, bringing us
to Nevada, Arizona and California legally,
[SPEAKER_02]: which would be kind of cool to be able to
embark on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we've been fighting for Nevada.
[SPEAKER_02]: For since my now defunct partnership with
MJ America, MMJ America in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, otherwise, yeah, man, just keeping it
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, that's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that you say that, now that you say
that, I'm like, oh yeah, Salazar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember being in his office probably a
month or two after you were there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, and I was wondering how that,
and that's a classic example of,
[SPEAKER_04]: of how the, the, the industry kind of
gobbles up talent, takes it, eats it up,
[SPEAKER_01]: takes what they want from me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he was, he was, you were dealing
with a guy like literally a, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, uh, loan shark, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what he did for a living.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like, okay, well, I guess I know
where we're at here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're, so that, that actually,
uh, the whole vault thing just sorta,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, the whole vault thing they,
uh, um, when it came down to finances,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a beautiful letter from their lawyer
and said, we appreciate all the genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: that you did for us, all the breeding that
you did for us, everything basically that
[SPEAKER_01]: you did for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, have a great day because you
can't be a part of it anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And is that because of the out of state?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because of the out of state thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they didn't want to, they didn't want
to do things the opposite side,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was the licensing way, um,
which would have been able to allow us to
[SPEAKER_02]: retrain.
[SPEAKER_02]: The control of the IP, which is one thing
that after I realized and learn off of
[SPEAKER_02]: that one was, and has been my main focus
and pitch is intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_02]: People forget about the IP part and about
the fact of like, we're all talking when
[SPEAKER_02]: you work with these major corporations
now, that's what I refer to them as,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, these huge farms that can buy
you 10 times over and you do all of their
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's their IP now and you forget
that and don't realize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've just lost your legs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's a hundred.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the best deal you can do as a
grower is become like a decent percentage
[SPEAKER_04]: owner that makes it so that what you're
doing is for the, for the bigger,
[SPEAKER_04]: for the greater good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you're trying to come in and
exactly what you're saying, like the
[SPEAKER_04]: minute you bring, cause by law,
when you bring genetics into their
[SPEAKER_04]: facility, it's their thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no way that you can argue that
unless you write it into your contract
[SPEAKER_04]: somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even if you do, you're the one that
broke the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're writing yourself out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I ship plants across the
country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's against the law.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got an ISO right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't say that, you know, when you're
trying to battle them in the, in the court
[SPEAKER_02]: of law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to win every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's, uh, been definitely,
you know, proven over and over again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's one of the things that's
the hardest part as a, uh, as a grower
[SPEAKER_04]: breeder in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first came back to America,
I was like convinced that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, Oh, this is going to be,
you know, no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just like hit roadblock after
roadblock.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it always came down to partnerships
based on the, you know, if, unless you
[SPEAKER_04]: were working with somebody that was 100%
the owner, financier and all of the above,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's always that like, Oh, by the way,
so-and-so doesn't like this, that,
[SPEAKER_04]: or the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of a sudden, you know,
the, all the, all deals are off and it
[SPEAKER_04]: really, it's sad, but you know,
when you bring genetics, a living thing
[SPEAKER_04]: like that, the minute that they can
replicate it, there's going to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to always anticipate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when it comes to, like I said,
you know, if you get locked out,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's really hard to, recourse is hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so what are you guys' thoughts on
material transfer agreements?
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically signing that you're,
if you sell people sees that they're not
[SPEAKER_06]: going to be breeding with them.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's impossible to do anything with.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's like the, it's like the
Crawford brothers.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a good example where they got
everybody, anybody who tries it,
[SPEAKER_04]: it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: The same thing with even with Milo from
all the big hemp companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so big Buddha, big Buddha tried to,
he sent letters of, you know, to anybody
[SPEAKER_04]: using any cheese of any type.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I even just, I told him, I was like,
dude, I'm doing fromage.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a cheese sage cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you going to do about it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, you know, it's just him trying.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, it's one of those situations
where I was like, well, I didn't really,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it hurt your image.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the industry more than helped it
because we're kind of all in it to like,
[SPEAKER_04]: we know Milo and big Buddha, even though
they didn't create it, they just,
[SPEAKER_04]: I, it's like, it wasn't even a creation of
theirs, but I'll give it to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They promoted it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got it out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they don't, but when you start to say
like anything cheese related, which now
[SPEAKER_04]: you're stepping into a whole other
industry too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like what, so now none of us can
say, you know, anything is like cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, come on now, you know, we've,
we're saying we were using people were,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's amazing that it didn't get used as a
name for cannabis law earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just made my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one of those like, Jesus,
why didn't we live in Holland?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why didn't we, why were we not thinking of
this?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we were the king of puns.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the easiest.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, would have been the easiest
strain, but in general, I think,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, you know, we're like, we were saying
earlier, it's really, you can do all,
[SPEAKER_04]: you should trademark your stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you really are confident that you're
the first person to do it and you have
[SPEAKER_04]: something super original and it seems to
be valuable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not very enforceable and you may be
enforceable.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I think you could probably as a
big company making seeds, you could
[SPEAKER_04]: probably enforce it to a degree hemp is
more enforceable because it's recognized
[SPEAKER_02]: by either way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all still enforceable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my patent and trademark attorney,
like he's very much so explained to us how
[SPEAKER_02]: you can enforce it, but it comes down to
the fact, are you going to spend $15,000
[SPEAKER_02]: to enforce you from using something?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to spend that kind of
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to waste that money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the truth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the thing is you're always losing
when you, I feel like whenever you're on
[SPEAKER_04]: the attack, like say you're the guy who
was out there attacking, you're,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're, you're looking like an asshole and
you're also not going to win.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: You might get the guy to like,
you know, change the name if he's smart,
[SPEAKER_04]: which you know, it's not a big deal for
the most part, but your genetics are
[SPEAKER_04]: already compromised at that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the way that people's a lot of
times don't get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, you know, to me it's the
names.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And names are actually easier to,
to protect because it's a name genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, there's DNA snippets and you have
actual markers on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to have to have a
genetically modified plant to be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: protect it as a patent of the situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't just protect a cultivar with the
material transfer agreement.
[SPEAKER_06]: That just states that you're not going to
breed with their genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that's, I think so
unenforceable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you think that they're not going to
breed with your genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens if they, here's the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the question to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens if they have a hermy and all
of a sudden their whole room's pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they have shit tons of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw them away?
[SPEAKER_06]: I test mine for stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's the same ploy as Monsanto
trademark markers within their.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say I spend a hundred thousand
dollars worth of research and I'm selling
[SPEAKER_06]: these seeds for a dollar seed and I sell
them to somebody.
[SPEAKER_06]: They buy $50,000 worth of seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then they replicate it and they're selling
the same exact seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're S wanting it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as ethics, I think the only way you
can protect yourself is if you did put
[SPEAKER_04]: those markers in, which costs a bunch of
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to do that and you have to,
that's the only way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise there'd be like no, no way in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could tell you, I could tell you,
um, I can, I could give you a very strong
[SPEAKER_02]: company in Oregon not to go with because
they'll, they'll, they'll, they'll give
[SPEAKER_02]: you nothing but THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing but THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing but it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing but THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hemp, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a lot of good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've seen some, I've seen,
I've seen a lot of, it depends on your,
[SPEAKER_04]: it depends where you're located too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like some things like the T1 this year
worked really well in Colorado and last
[SPEAKER_04]: year, not so great.
So,
[SPEAKER_09]: well, you know, the thing too,
I think people flower that are flowering
[SPEAKER_09]: hemp too long or a week too long go above
a 0.3 level.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not the hemp level on that part.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can get full term hemp that doesn't
get hot though.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we're working on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if you compare it to the not hot
hemp, I'm trying to get the inside lane.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's not hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you look at cherry wine,
cherry wine, for example, there's so many
[SPEAKER_06]: different phenotypes of cherry wine,
but there are phenotypes that do not go
[SPEAKER_06]: above a 0.3.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, I feel like that's the same
about the Electra hemp that you're talking
[SPEAKER_09]: about.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the most common hemp out on the
strain right now in the product for a CBD
[SPEAKER_09]: joint.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: If people are flowering that same hemp at
home and it's a week or two too long,
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's above that 0.3, especially if
they're going through with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just haven't fully figured it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: The tomato industry has figured out
tomatoes over the last 50 years using them
[SPEAKER_06]: as an example.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just scratching the surface of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we're going to have hemp plants
that have zero...
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's Genkana from Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can also spray your plants with stuff
that'll prevent from... I'm going to spray
[SPEAKER_06]: with sugar water.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the question is, it's like the CBG
side of the fence of people that are
[SPEAKER_02]: specialized in CBG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to find that one cultivar and
really replicate the absolute shit out of
[SPEAKER_02]: that somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the hardest part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also flowering times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do we look to for the future of the
CBD hemp?
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it about two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'll be able to pick it up
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, just don't put all your eggs in one
basket with anything right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say just take into account
that if you run hot and you have one
[SPEAKER_04]: strain in the field, then you've got to
take down that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So think along the line of
compartmentalizing your situation and
[SPEAKER_04]: having maybe different fields doing
different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the problem is, it's also if
you're trying to grow a smokeable hemp or
[SPEAKER_04]: you're trying to grow biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're trying to grow biomass or if
you're trying to grow other cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_04]: besides CBD, there's other flower... You
can take stuff way earlier to guarantee
[SPEAKER_04]: that you're not going to have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't try to ride that line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's a lot of times... We're
not trying to get the same end result
[SPEAKER_04]: unless you are trying to get a smokeable
flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're trying to get a smokeable
flower, I would just do... I would do
[SPEAKER_04]: clone only in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_04]: That way I know exactly what's going on in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Real deal stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I love seeds, it'd just be
safer right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they can't store us that come from a
seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can get it right to the mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to know your breeder and know
your source.
[SPEAKER_05]: My breeder and my source is right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know the willy gee.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think right now, CBG is a big
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_04]: It followed the same trend as CBD as far
as a kilo of CBD two years ago was worth
[SPEAKER_04]: about 20,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's worth about 2,200 or 2,000,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 10 times drop in two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: CBG was 60,000 last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already 20,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to drop just like everything
else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so everybody keeps like, oh,
what's the next one?
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys in Oregon now have a CBD
cultivar that tests between 9 and 15%.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is?
[SPEAKER_06]: What string?
[SPEAKER_06]: Electra?
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it 30%?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: 30%?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean like our Boax?
[SPEAKER_02]: Our Boax MC is 18%, 16%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like 17, 18 seems to be like the
kind of coasting line for a lot of this
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some little pops here and there,
but I never heard 30% myself either.
[SPEAKER_05]: 30% is when you see the THC levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you're probably, at that point I
would imagine you are over the line.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Viagra for CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: My dick's hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're able to convert from CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a joke.
[SPEAKER_06]: Repeat the joke.
[SPEAKER_06]: So CBD basically is a precursor and you
can convert that into other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And CBD can now be converted to THC using
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So technically ship, world shipping for
cannabis is no longer an issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: You ship it as hemp as CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, it's kind of funny
because you were, as you're saying that
[SPEAKER_04]: there's enzymes you can convert and you
can put on the plant in the field and
[SPEAKER_04]: completely knock out THC also.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a group in Hawaii right now and
they claim, they're out of Oregon,
[SPEAKER_04]: but now they're in Hawaii because the
thing is, all around the, like anywhere
[SPEAKER_04]: that's got really good growing conditions,
it's very hard to keep your shit below
[SPEAKER_04]: like 1%.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It just wants to spike because of the
conditions being so perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Hawaii had a, the few people that
actually had licenses, most of them ran
[SPEAKER_04]: hot last year too, just like a lot of
places.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're testing that there and that's a
game changer in itself because you could
[SPEAKER_04]: take a straight up THC strain and then in
the field, hit it hard and have all those
[SPEAKER_04]: turps, but not have any THC on the final
product.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's, I think we're going to come up
just like anything, we're going to kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: slip our way around as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just the ability to grow on a scale
that we're finally able to grow on just
[SPEAKER_04]: creates more bigger ideas and bigger moves
that we can hopefully do and stay one step
[SPEAKER_04]: ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just scratching the surface of all
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, we're just learning how to
cultivate properly and how to breed
[SPEAKER_06]: properly and use marker assisted breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe GMO has its place potential.
[SPEAKER_06]: I compare it to like brain surgery,
how if you're, they were scared of brain
[SPEAKER_06]: surgery when people started doing it and
GMO might not be the solution.
[SPEAKER_06]: We probably, who knows if we even have to
do it in our lifetime.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we can use analytical driven
breeding and marker driven breeding
[SPEAKER_06]: without actually editing the genes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, we're just scratching the
surface of all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we're like, Dede Miri out of Israel,
he's doing a lot of clinical research.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the number one cancer clinical
research scientist in the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's comparing it all with different
cannabinoid profiles and chemotyping,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is basically going in and looking at
the chemical expression of the plant and
[SPEAKER_06]: how it works with people's bodies.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're just, he discovered all these
receptors before we only had two,
[SPEAKER_06]: they thought we had CB1 and CB2 receptors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now from CB1 and CB2 receptors,
they have 28 other like nuclear receptors
[SPEAKER_06]: in our body that actually interact with
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, and that's just, flavonoids is a
whole nother thing that we really don't
[SPEAKER_06]: talk about, but that is what they believe
will help cure pancreatic cancer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so even from a medical side,
we're just really scratching the surface
[SPEAKER_06]: of what's happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's possible 10 years from now,
we'll have a lot more of it figured out,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I still don't believe we'll have it
all figured out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way because they would,
just like you're saying 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was as illegal as it can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there wasn't clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't actual labs that were
testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there were, but they were just
starting out, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, universities, I mean, that's where
it gets, that's where it's really
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting because, you know,
they're getting grants to study something
[SPEAKER_04]: that should have been studied a lot in the
last, I mean, with the last 75 years have
[SPEAKER_04]: been sort of, only studying it on a
negative, you know, looking for negative
[SPEAKER_04]: results, not even like wanting positive
results.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's pretty interesting for,
if you think about like a young kid going
[SPEAKER_04]: into college and he has an option to
really take cannabis on a next level
[SPEAKER_04]: serious from a biological point of view.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think they're gonna have,
you know, think about the 50,000 ways that
[SPEAKER_04]: they already knew what to use hemp for,
and then add into that also these high
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoid plants, which nobody was
really, I mean, they were out there,
[SPEAKER_04]: but nobody was really focusing on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we have a whole arsenal of
potential compounds coming out of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That are just lead the cures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that are gonna be like epically,
you know, beyond anything that we're even
[SPEAKER_04]: comprehending when it comes to like,
when you see how simple some of those
[SPEAKER_04]: things like with hemp, for instance,
because also that's again, like with hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And imagine when we grow like the ultimate
plant, which is a high THC, high CBD,
[SPEAKER_04]: high fiber content, high, you know,
cellulose content, everything,
[SPEAKER_04]: all the above.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and it has all the other cannabinoids
in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it grows 15 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it does, you know, there's all these
things we haven't even, because we're
[SPEAKER_04]: still trying to separate the differences,
but they're all in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's a pretty exciting,
like the next 10 years are gonna be
[SPEAKER_04]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's gonna be, finally, when people get
over the whole CBD craze, they're gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: get more into bioplastics and,
you know, because that's something that I
[SPEAKER_04]: think is the next big problem in the world
is everyone's gonna be on the same tip
[SPEAKER_04]: where it's like, yeah, this plastic
situation is getting a little out of
[SPEAKER_04]: control.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else can we use?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, Legos has already said that
they're gonna replace all of their Legos
[SPEAKER_04]: with hemp bioplastic by 2030.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's like, you know, that's huge
right there when you think about a company
[SPEAKER_04]: like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of where I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even, you know, as much as I'm excited
about cannabis in general, that whole next
[SPEAKER_04]: generation of like, oh, that house is
built out of it and the car is driving on
[SPEAKER_04]: it and all of, you know, that's where
we're gonna be going towards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Except for you, James.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll be fighting with your merchant
account guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but commercial people should be
hitting you guys up, no?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, commercial growers and commercial
farms are contacting, I would assume.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, James, for bulk seed and for seed,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've stayed away from bulk hemp seeds just
for that very reason, because of the Chay
[SPEAKER_08]: wine was hot and I don't want to be
responsible for somebody's losing their
[SPEAKER_08]: crop on my ass.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wasn't, I didn't step into that
field.
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't my expertise.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, it's one of those things,
I sell something, I come back up and I can
[SPEAKER_08]: see results and I see paperwork and I do
my damage to get to the bottom of things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that organ company you speak of,
I've talked with them and I almost dealt
[SPEAKER_08]: with them.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know who I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I just, I never wanted that on
my conscience.
[SPEAKER_08]: It cost somebody their field to get
tossed.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never sold them for that reason.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've stayed out of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do sell bulk film stock and bulk other
seeds, but we haven't gotten into hemp
[SPEAKER_08]: seeds just because.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got one company I work with and
they've got three years with the COAs.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's been doing it for a long time in
Maine.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the Best Coast guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Best Coast Genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: He uses an auto box strain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beacon's good.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of us have hemp seed lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, we've got like seven hemp seed
lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have literally seven different
varietals that we put out in hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have COAs for all of it, but no,
not Boax, LX, Nectra.
[SPEAKER_02]: Autos are going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a long ways to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's two autos.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's O2TO, which is an auto box strain.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's an auto as far as an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has a lot of potential.
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't figured it out completely yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you really want a little auto flower
hemp plant?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and then what you do is you plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you're harvesting in July.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you plant like, yeah, you get three
harvests per year.
[SPEAKER_06]: You plant 20,000 per, not even,
you can plant 10,000 per acre.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you plant more.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the thing is, is we're working on
getting these CBD level higher.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the big thing is getting,
because right now auto flowers are
[SPEAKER_06]: somewhere between five and 10% for CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's going to evolve into 18
to 20% CBD in the future, but it's going
[SPEAKER_06]: to require a lot of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of selection.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of selection, a lot of work,
a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I totally believe it's possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I saw auto flowers in 2012.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went and saw Olier's auto flowers in
Spain and they sucked.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were really, they were, they were
this tall.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, they were.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, so the further away you get from
Rurales, the better it gets.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the stuff that's auto flower now is
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're getting stuff that tests high
twenties.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has good flavor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Buddha is doing some good stuff for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mephisto is killing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mephisto.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mephisto for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: But even the stuff I'm doing with my buddy
Nick is open source.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're doing stuff together.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're crushing some auto flowers and
we're testing really high.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we're just testing stuff in the
twenties with our auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the deal is, is it's not right for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not right for every situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for people that want to get multiple
harvests in a year that are willing to
[SPEAKER_06]: invest in 15 to 20,000 seeds per acre,
that might be the ideal solution.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's, it's not a one size fits
all solution.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no one size fits all solution.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an option.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an option.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an option.
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy in Alaska who needs it,
he needs it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of situations that actually
need it though, too, where it's just like
[SPEAKER_04]: they're there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't rely on the like, especially
bringing in a cultivar that's never grown
[SPEAKER_04]: in that region.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Colorado's got some pretty,
pretty intense weather.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people came in and grew.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to one farm that had 16 pivots each
and it was 240 acres.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're talking about 1800 acres of hemp
all within a few, you know, it's a 15 and
[SPEAKER_04]: a half square mile area just packed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But next door to them was another 2000
acres of guys who were growing industrial
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp and they were just letting stuff just
blow across the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was like, wow, you guys are not
growing any smokable hemp here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything is seeded and they couldn't,
had a hard time taking that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in general, it's just, you know,
yeah, the scale that people are growing
[SPEAKER_04]: now there's tsunamis of pollen flying
around.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can talk about it real quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to fly the Caribbean for work.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's got to get a quick, quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the collab.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is our collab that we're doing
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are some of the samples that were
grown and for Adam to try out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we basically, I made these seeds
a year ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a tough job, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody's got to smoke them all.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I basically make stuff and I make sure
it's tested before it's ever released.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want it grown out by multiple people.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do COAs, we do everything and compare.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So ours is a Sage and Sour.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was talking about earlier how I use
three males instead of one.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's Sage and Sour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sage and Sour.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Sage and Sour, the first time I saw it
was at Harborside in maybe 2008.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really fell in love with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like sours.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my loud seeds that me and my friends
started, it was based on Sour Diesel,
[SPEAKER_06]: like love sour.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Sage and Sour was this kind of like
sour.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has this, the Fino they had was,
it was a little more wispy, but it was
[SPEAKER_06]: like super greasy and it grew big.
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't yield as good as Sour or
anything like that, but the taste was like
[SPEAKER_06]: lemon funk with the, and I fell in love
with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like that lemon funk with a little
bit of that Sage in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so Adam and I kind of, I decided I was
going to make seeds and I talked to Adam
[SPEAKER_06]: about doing a collab.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I wanted to do some interesting
crosses with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wanted to give people the most
availability for the F1s for selections of
[SPEAKER_06]: their own.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so like this one right here,
this is an LA antidote from FC Genetics
[SPEAKER_06]: from our buddy at FC.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got his 20 to one, it's your buddy that
I met, that I got some clones off.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he, yeah, he's, he has some good
stuff, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this was his LA antidote that he made
and I put it on the Sage and Sour and it
[SPEAKER_06]: has some amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let him, let him check that out.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's two Finos of it here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll, we'll grow and we'll do
selections.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I went to Arizona and worked with the
company out there and we did selections on
[SPEAKER_06]: starting with a thousand seeds,
narrowed it down to 120.
[SPEAKER_06]: From the 120 after we pulled out the males
and the herms and everything else,
[SPEAKER_06]: we selected about 35 and they still,
they're keeping the 120, but like we do
[SPEAKER_06]: analytics, we do smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta, the analytics don't tell the
whole story.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, so the skush from Duke Diamond,
we put that on there and that has like
[SPEAKER_06]: that old school skunk smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you smell it, it smells just like
cantaloupe.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get fresh cantaloupe on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're living vicariously through our
nose.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know, if you guys want to smell
these afterwards.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did the GMO Sage and Sour,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It was originally called his gym shoes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause this stuff stinks.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has like that BO from the Chem D.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some Finos of that and some came out
lemony, some came out chemi.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a little diversity with them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like, I like the fact that you
didn't pick a super dominant male either.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, this is all, all flavors
represented in a sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes when you use a male that has a
Jack in it or something that's really
[SPEAKER_06]: dominant, it makes the whole progeny,
whatever you put it on smell and tastes
[SPEAKER_06]: like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, not the Mac one, but like if you
were to reverse any of the other Macs that
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen, they have a lot of that
turpiniline and limonene and yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Mac one amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Josh D, you know, that's the
original OG, but those I did some legend
[SPEAKER_06]: and I did some of the Josh D and they all
came out great.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no more loud seeds right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll, we'll, you know, we'll see what
happens with loud seeds in the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have James loud genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can get that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get green light genetics is my
collab with the flowers that's available
[SPEAKER_06]: on seeds here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the collab that I'm doing with Adam is
going to be available on seeds here now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Technically it's a safe for this long
purchase.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the GMO sage and sour super fire,
and there's ones that kind of the lean
[SPEAKER_06]: towards the sage, but the ones that will
lean towards the GMO that have that
[SPEAKER_06]: structure and that BO armpit, you know,
funk.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys for having me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you guys are going to continue on
forever.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's an after, after, after.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an after, after, after, after party.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
