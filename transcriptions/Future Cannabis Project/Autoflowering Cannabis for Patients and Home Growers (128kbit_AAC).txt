[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny because a lot of people really
discount autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think that they're low yielding and
they're not good for the breeding scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to tell you that autoflowers are
great for a very particular kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fantastic for patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fantastic for people with mobility
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're wonderful for folks who live where
we live, where we start to get the rains
[SPEAKER_01]: there the last week of September,
the first week of October, and our eight
[SPEAKER_01]: week blooming flowers are just getting
finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the mold rolls in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with an autoflower, you can pop a
seed on June 1 and harvest on September 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're well ahead of the weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might need to plant twice as many.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea that you can get done without
your plants molding is a huge win.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most people may understand that autos
finish faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't mean the best application
for autos are readily apparent to
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like to hear you both starting
with you, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: How will autos influence cannabis growing
in horticulture going forward?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let me give two different answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The book, as you indicated, is really an
introductory book.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to say it's a book for your sister
and your brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a book for your Uncle Bob and Aunt
Sally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a book for a professional grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm convinced that autoflower cannabis is
going to change the general population's
[SPEAKER_02]: attitude about cannabis because it's the
next tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once in a lifetime, I'm 70 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only happened to me once.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once in a lifetime, a new plant is
introduced to the general horticultural
[SPEAKER_02]: gardening public.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last time it happened, it was the snap
pea.
[SPEAKER_02]: They took over the pea world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every gardener grows snap peas a
couple of times during their career and
[SPEAKER_02]: probably every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's going to happen,
I think, to these autofowers because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're so easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their quality has risen so high as a
result of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the first answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second answer is this is a plant which
you can grow on a deck, which you can grow
[SPEAKER_02]: outside in a garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow it in a perennial bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow it in a pot in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's something that is accessible
to all growers now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just people who have big farms or a
big greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because they don't have a photo
period, it means that people who live in
[SPEAKER_02]: northern climates like Alaska,
where on September 21st your plant finally
[SPEAKER_02]: gets the darkness that it needs to set
flower, you also get a frost that night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, for those who do
professionally grow, here's a plant which
[SPEAKER_02]: you can use to interspace between your
plants as they veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same thing, your plants as they
flower, you just put them in.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care what the light is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can give them 20, 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to flower based on their
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can use your spare space.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a dream for the entire
horticultural world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Seth, I know you're coming from a
little different direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff and I share that we're very
interested in home growers and patient
[SPEAKER_01]: growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing I wanted to hit on was
how appropriate these are for patients and
[SPEAKER_01]: for people with lower mobility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like Jeff mentioned, these are
very compact plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: These pretty much top out at around three,
three and a half feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, you don't have to do
the reaching and they're not hard to break
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the patient can stand up and look all
around them for mold instead of trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: work with some of these nine footers where
they're just impossible to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're beautiful and I love them and I
want to toke them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're all caged and difficult to
work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something that folks who are
living in an apartment, who are growing in
[SPEAKER_01]: a tent can grow four of these together
with no sweat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even need to scrawl them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you're a patient, they're so
easy to use and always going to flower in
[SPEAKER_01]: a particular time frame and be ready to go
that it really opens up the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's not leave the impression that
these are little teeny baby flowers
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're little teeny plants,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are some I've seen colors
that are 80 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll have 10 of these colas on a
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are not the lowrider that you
remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are a totally new plant ready for
prime time.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the book, I stress that from the
perspective of an amateur growing these
[SPEAKER_02]: things, they don't really like to be
repotted all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always tell people to grow them in
the original container.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started out with three gallon containers
because I thought the plants were cute and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's something they call it now
super auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really the same thing,
but different soil structure and different
[SPEAKER_02]: soil amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now I'm telling people five gallons
is good, that ubiquitous hardware bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: But seven gallons is even better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you put the seed right in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't even start them in a,
because I think if they are stressed,
[SPEAKER_02]: they will flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the worst thing you can have is
something that flowers when it's just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, oh no, what did I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're not cheap seeds,
although you can grow your own seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: they become cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's disappointing when they're five
inches tall.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually did that for my first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can admit to making that mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first tray last year, I still like my
idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put them in root riot plugs,
which I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when I find when I propagate right
into soil, it's a lot more difficult to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep the seed in a moist environment,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The top of the soil dries up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It dries out really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas those root riots, while they are
soil, and so I'll put the seed in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: let it pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as I've got like, you know,
firmly established coddled and leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I go ahead and I put it in before the
roots are coming out the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they do make some cute little plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I saw a little plant growing in a
thimble with a, you know, it had a
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful little head on it about that
big.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was such a sexy little thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was just, yeah, kind of thing
you put on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And go, hey, look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody goes, ooh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had a tray of these, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a tray of these and I let them sit
too long in the tray before I,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said, you know, that same week,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I let them sit to there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had a tray of very expensive,
beautiful eight inch auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each one had this gorgeous big nug on
top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, the yield per weight was
incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yield per $15 seed was not,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm growing my own and still paying $15
a gram, which is like not a win,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they made awesome gifts to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you give somebody a small plant
with this fully mature bud and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, here you go, snip it off,
like let it dry for a couple of days and
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and actually, you know, I know we're
getting out of order here, but keeping in
[SPEAKER_02]: my idea that this is the next tomato,
I'm convinced that in the next future few
[SPEAKER_02]: years, you're going to be able to walk
into Whole Foods or wherever at Christmas
[SPEAKER_02]: time and they're going to have a little
shelf and it's going to have 30 little
[SPEAKER_02]: auto flower plants sitting there that look
like little Christmas trees that are
[SPEAKER_02]: decorated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at Easter time, you're going to
have plants with that little green plastic
[SPEAKER_02]: crap around the base of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants are unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are so much fun to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just cannot, you can, I'm peeing in my
pants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, careful there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to bring the conversation back
to medical, which obviously I keep
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing this conversation back to you
because those are the people I work with a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're going to keep going with you,
Jeff, and then we'll jump back to Seth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of medical, Jeff, I'd like you
to speak a bit to the ease of growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've heard you talk about how you can
actually do too much, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would like to hear that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Seth, would you pick up,
since you are analytically breeding these
[SPEAKER_01]: to help with particular ailments,
I'd like to hear from you how the breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: of auto flowers can be so targeted because
they're so quick to cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Jeff, let's start with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, these are unbelievable plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I can compare it to is
America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marigold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read a garden column in the newspaper up
at Anchorage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And marigolds are the one plant I say,
you've got to plant something or you're
[SPEAKER_02]: not a real gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you plant a marigold and you can have
your kid do it with you because it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: only seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You stick the seed in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a sunflower seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's certain seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just put them in the ground and you
walk away.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't do anything and they grow well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow the way they're supposed to
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what happens with these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put too much fertilizer in the
soil, don't put any fertilizer the first
[SPEAKER_02]: time you grow it because you may not need
it ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to watch these plants very
carefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow so quickly that when the white
fly or whatever decides to hit it,
[SPEAKER_02]: all of a sudden it's gone through the
stage where the right kind of juice is,
[SPEAKER_02]: wait a minute, what happened to my plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the same plant anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the insect moves on.
[SPEAKER_02]: These things don't need a lot of care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you've got to keep an eye out for
mildew and the kinds of things that you
[SPEAKER_02]: normally do, but they grow so quickly that
if you push them too much, they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to grow well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I do to mine to start,
when I buy a seed from somebody I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know whether it's going to be any good,
I put the mycorrhizal fungi on it and that
[SPEAKER_02]: is all I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally, I've never had to fertilize
any of my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they grow so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you who grow indoors,
especially in tents, you don't really have
[SPEAKER_01]: enough time to screw them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's fantastic, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had never heard your example,
Jeff, about the plant growing through the
[SPEAKER_01]: stage of life that appealed to any
particular pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first round I did, I've got no mold
issues, no pest issues, and where I live
[SPEAKER_01]: on Vashon Island, we don't have that much
pests, but we always get mold,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just that their life cycle is so
short, a lot of that stuff doesn't have a
[SPEAKER_01]: time to take over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've been bred to get rid of the
mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know the people that grow new breed
seeds, that's what they were looking for,
[SPEAKER_02]: mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get rid of that mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of being able to use these plants
for different medical conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: I always defer to Dr. Ethan Russo,
who is somewhere out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to speak to exactly what
type of compounds are going to help for
[SPEAKER_00]: particular ailments.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we know is that all of these different
compounds are very useful and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out exactly how to triangulate and
make use of those compounds and get them
[SPEAKER_00]: into plants in a way that's useful for
patients and for people across the world
[SPEAKER_00]: is really our goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, unless you live in Alaska where you
like to have six plants, three of which
[SPEAKER_02]: are allowed to be in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always tell people, don't treat this
like broccoli, where you plant it all at
[SPEAKER_02]: once.
[SPEAKER_02]: You stagger it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't mean you wait for the crop to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every two weeks or every week,
you put in a couple of more seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when the regulator comes to your
house, you go, no, I only got three in
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget the fact that I got 50 pounds of
drying weed over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they really are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything you say, again, emphasizes the
idea that, boy, this is something that a
[SPEAKER_02]: home gardener would.
[SPEAKER_02]: People grow heirloom tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mary, next door neighbor, she's famous
because she's got the Oregon summer
[SPEAKER_02]: spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And George, next door, is famous because
his are plum tomatoes that make the best
[SPEAKER_02]: sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they give them away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the same thing that's going to
happen with these auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the colors on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the landscape capability.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the capabilities on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be landscape plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be a plant that everybody
accepts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to get rid of that stigma.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the plant that's going to
carry us over the line, I'm convinced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And help the big plants as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like what you said, too,
about neighbors sharing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if we all have got plant limits,
we're limited by our variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like tomatoes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grow tomatoes at home, you're still
going to end up buying tomatoes at the
[SPEAKER_01]: store.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like commercial tomato growers
are all hosed because we're all growing at
[SPEAKER_01]: home tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You buy the ones at the store so you get
the seeds so you can grow them yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is another great idea because
neighbors can grow different varieties and
[SPEAKER_01]: trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it creates increased community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody gets to try more weed,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a win as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So last year at the Alaska State Fair,
they actually, in Kenai, they had a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis entry thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm convinced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every state fair in the country is going
to have an auto flower cannabis contest.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the best thing that ever happened
to our industry because it's going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: Mom and Pop and Uncle Bob and Aunt Sally,
who normally would be against it,
[SPEAKER_02]: into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we really need so we can
get the taxes out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amen.
Thank you.
