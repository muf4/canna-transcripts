[SPEAKER_00]: When Dr. Piamelli called me weeks ago
about this potential conference and the
[SPEAKER_00]: involvement of the law school here at UCI,
he told me it was going to be on Friday
[SPEAKER_00]: afternoon in May 5th at 4 o'clock in the
afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cinco de Mayo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally said to Dr. Piamelli,
are you crazy, doctor?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really didn't believe him that we would
draw this audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big round for yourself for being here
this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have to share a comment about the
congressman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dana and I have known each other for
probably 20, 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the flip side of Dana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Conservative, Republican he is,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the progressive Democrat that served
in the state senate from here in of all
[SPEAKER_00]: places.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Orange County, 1998 to 06.
[SPEAKER_00]: The county was a little more conservative
at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I share that because we're an interesting
dynamic on this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We disagree on most major policy issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the nature of the beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on this particular issue, he's been a
leader his entire elected life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I struggled with these issues as a
progressive Democrat in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, some of you may remember
now, unfortunately, he's no longer with
[SPEAKER_00]: us, Senator John Vasconcelos who was one
of the leading advocates for both
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal marijuana as well as the
legalization of recreational marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: back at a time when everyone scoffed at
him in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he really, through his own
determination, his own passion,
[SPEAKER_00]: really opened the door to where we are
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sat right behind me on the senate
floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talked to me a lot as a progressive
Democrat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kept needling me, of course,
about Orange County.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's interesting that Dana has been,
as a conservative Republican, a passionate
[SPEAKER_00]: leader in this area for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, a progressive Democrat, struggled with
this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to confess where I am today as
one of many who share the same views as
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the folks who have already spoken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Dr. Piemeli has focused solely on
the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm a strong supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to credit my daughter who
actually did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing how daughters can affect dads
and get them to change their mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my daughter, in fact, did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of you in this room know her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to credit her because she
started dad's evolution as I was taught by
[SPEAKER_00]: a younger generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only going to share a couple comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're a little behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to turn the podium over to some
of our remaining speakers for a little
[SPEAKER_00]: extra time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am going to share another part of
this that we feel here at UCI is now
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary in the evolution of all issues
surrounding the use of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether recreational or medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something new as follows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time there's a major industry that
emerges on the scene and grows
[SPEAKER_00]: exponentially, and everyone who observes
it, advocate or foe, knows that it will be
[SPEAKER_00]: in due time a massive industry involving
so many different elements in society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know with cannabis when we now
have venture capital funds that invest in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry, you have major law firms
that practice in this area, you have many
[SPEAKER_00]: of the very established organizations in
society gravitating to this growing
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we feel at UCI is a missing but
critical part of all of that puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll like this particularly,
Laurie, given what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is to create the nation's first
academic-based interdisciplinary cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: research institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to note, as the congressman was
walking back up, he and I have worked on a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of issues over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way politics should work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll disagree on major issues,
but on those we agree on, we work
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was applauding the creation of that
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the early stages, but I want to
be very specific with everyone about what
[SPEAKER_00]: that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it may be different than some of
the advocates that may be here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something very unique about an
academic-based interdisciplinary
[SPEAKER_00]: institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Academic-based is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means it's tied to no ideology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tied to no specific position in
science or business or law or art or
[SPEAKER_00]: communication, psychology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It bases its positions solely on academic
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has always been critical in mature
societies to ensure that we move forward
[SPEAKER_00]: based upon independent research that is as
free as humanly possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of outside influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, I said interdisciplinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a number of centers around the
country in research institutions that
[SPEAKER_00]: focus in on one area of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be the medicinal impact,
such as Dr. Piemeli's great work that is
[SPEAKER_00]: known around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a new and growing industry,
it needs interdisciplinary analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means the law must grow in complement
with the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means the theories of business must
adjust to the new reality of a new
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means the financial industry must
adjust with it and adjust to an industry
[SPEAKER_00]: that is only growing and is only going to
grow bigger and more established as we
[SPEAKER_00]: move forward as a society.
[SPEAKER_00]: The academic-based interdisciplinary
institute is frankly the only way to fill
[SPEAKER_00]: that void.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we already have the involvement in
setting up this institute at UCI,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, led, and frankly it was his
concept, by the great Dr. Piemeli.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the law school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were some who advised me when I
went to our dean, I think some of you in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room have heard of him before,
Dean Erwin Chemerinsky, that there might
[SPEAKER_00]: be some concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sat down with the dean and I said,
here's the concept, and he said,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, that's long overdue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Dean Chemerinsky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have already been in communications
with a number of the other schools on
[SPEAKER_00]: campus, from the business side to the
engineering side to the information
[SPEAKER_00]: computer science side to the art side to
the communication side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You name it, we've touched upon as many as
possible with more to go, including,
[SPEAKER_00]: for those who are familiar with UCI,
the Applied Innovation Center,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is on the backside of the campus and
that really is designed to bring the
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific and other research here on
campus out into the marketplace in a far
[SPEAKER_00]: easier fashion than in the past when it
comes to an academic university setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you bring all those pieces together and
it will be the first in the nation that
[SPEAKER_00]: is, again, I stress academic-based
interdisciplinary institute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to share one last thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our hope is to do many symposium and
conference in addition to the great
[SPEAKER_00]: research, develop model policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The institute will never add advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others can take its work and advocate,
but it can't advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would compromise its independence.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are in the process of creating a large
and diverse advisory board, but I also
[SPEAKER_00]: want to stress, it's an advisory board.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those who are unfamiliar with
academic-based institute, it can only be
[SPEAKER_00]: governed by the academics because that's
the only way to protect its independence
[SPEAKER_00]: on the research that it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the advisory board certainly will be
made up of experts throughout and
[SPEAKER_00]: different perspectives of this growing
industry so that the academics have that
[SPEAKER_00]: input, can consider that input,
but again, all research will be
[SPEAKER_00]: independent.
[SPEAKER_00]: More to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will be, by the way, at the
reception later.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a UCI-related reception,
but I know there'll be some folks at the
[SPEAKER_00]: back of the room and out in the hallway as
we end today that will have the invites
[SPEAKER_00]: and the maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the congressman will be there as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're happy to answer questions at the
reception as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
