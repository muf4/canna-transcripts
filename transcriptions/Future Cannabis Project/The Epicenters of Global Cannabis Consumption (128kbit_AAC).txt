[SPEAKER_00]: I say Barcelona is the new Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it literally, the epicenter of
grow and the whole social scene and the
[SPEAKER_00]: culture of Europe, and correct me if I'm
wrong, I really feel it's coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like Amsterdam almost feels like
the tourist trap compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: experiential in Barcelona, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much stuff going on in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all these tiers, whether it's the
coffee shops or it's medical or if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: the CBD grows or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all this, you know, it's
burgeoning right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a feel in Barcelona that used
to have in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I haven't been to Amsterdam for a long
time, but I did live there for a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: years, 20 years ago, and it was a magical
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think Amsterdam had like 400 coffee
shops and now they have maybe,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe only 200 because what happened was
in Holland, specifically the Christian
[SPEAKER_02]: conservatives, which is the actual name of
the party that came in power.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, which sounds really dread in a lot
of ways, but not a bad part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have to play them down,
but the thing that they do is they try
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting off the tail and so the head,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is what, from my understanding,
they were trying to, okay, all the local
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to help people understand, we should
back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually just got back from Canifest in
Prague, which, you know, we started
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about Barcelona, which Spannabis I
would say is the top, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Spannabis and you have Mary Jane,
you have Canifest, but I stopped by in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you spent some time there working
with the high times crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spent some time in Berlin before going to
Prague, but Amsterdam, yeah, with about
[SPEAKER_00]: half the coffee shops shutting down in the
last three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it really is a different,
I still love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have to say, I still,
Amsterdam, Holland is a phenomenal,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the Netherlands I am a huge fan of,
but you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not like it's kind of lost some
of the magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's lost a little shine and, and,
and what's, what's really unfortunate is
[SPEAKER_02]: that it hasn't, it really hasn't,
because it's been everyone, there's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's such a misconception that pots legal
in Holland, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, there's a five gram possession
law.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But growing is not legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Selling is only quasi legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to cross the threshold of the
coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like America.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we start, all these States started
legalizing, but our feds never did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Canada just, just crushed us with
the federal, with the, with the pub coast
[SPEAKER_02]: federally, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what's happened to Amsterdam
is it, or Holland in general is they,
[SPEAKER_02]: they've never really, the, the weed thing
has just been, it's, it's hard to explain
[SPEAKER_02]: how that culturally like, like happens in
Holland where, where pot use is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: lower in Holland than a lot of other
countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other places where it's, where it's
illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you, it's still stigmatized.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't like in the West coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you go to a work party, you have beer,
you smoke a joint, you're at a work party.
[SPEAKER_02]: You still smoke a joint at a work party.
[SPEAKER_02]: You Holland, you still can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still stigmatized, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, which is, which is ironic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all these other places,
like, so for example, Berlin, right in
[SPEAKER_02]: Berlin, you can go and you can smoke a
joint right at the outside cafe and
[SPEAKER_02]: nobody's going to say nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually smoked joints inside posh
restaurants, in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you ask, it's like, it's like 10 at
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be only 30 customers there or
whatever, but it's like a nice restaurant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't mention the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I w I almost want to, but I won't,
but, but I won't, I won't, but it is
[SPEAKER_00]: Berlin is definitely to your point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it feels more, it feels more,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it feels, it feels more legal in
Berlin that it almost does actually in
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon where it's totally legal because
smoking, you can't smoke publicly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's another caveat in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't smoke outside in public in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have such a smoking culture already,
already that you, that smoking anything
[SPEAKER_02]: outside you just is, is almost allowed,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just smoking outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what Europeans do with their coffee,
with their beer and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tradition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have all these areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Germany is now taking over the game
because they legalize medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spain has got the whole underground thing
like Amsterdam even never quite had or,
[SPEAKER_02]: or, or comparable, you know, Switzerland,
you know, Switzerland, Switzerland is
[SPEAKER_02]: selling, Switzerland is selling CBD,
but just at the bodega at the kiosk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get the CBR, the blood,
the high amount, the pre rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything is coming online right now
with Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a shame that Holland didn't parlay,
you know, you know, I don't think it's too
[SPEAKER_02]: late, but, but in one way it is because
they're a small market, so they could
[SPEAKER_02]: parlay whatever they want, but they'd have
to be really, really smart and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, well, we're going to take these
greenhouses that were made for tulips.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, cause they can grow a lot of,
a lot of shit inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you fly in, you're tripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just seeing all of these
greenhouses and high tech, not,
[SPEAKER_00]: not your mediocre group, old school,
what we know on the west coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to dykes and greenhouses,
the Dutch have got us, uh, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: like they, they, they live underwater.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got to figure out how to keep out at
the sea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they live in a super cold,
rainy ass climate where they need to learn
[SPEAKER_02]: how to grow shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they, but they, they import a ton of
food to Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they switch that up a little bit
and, and, and, and concentrated cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they still could be in the game,
but right now they're not, they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: really in the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like Germany or Spain or even
Switzerland is now or in Prague.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's where we have these
cultural epicenters that are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up in mainland Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, I think it's not a coincidence
that Berlin's kind of become this hotspot
[SPEAKER_00]: epicenter now more so electronica and the
EDM scene was where God's, but now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just becoming more of a hip spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the hipsters are gravitating towards
Berlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you look at to your point,
the cannabis scene there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's only medical now, but there's
some, the Hoff and some of the other guys
[SPEAKER_00]: are actually putting a big effort into
moving things further to the legalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a hotspot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same, same with Prague.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Prague, interesting one of,
in, in Europe, I think it's odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of talk about cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one didn't get bombed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one did.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one didn't, you know, they kind of
reference what happened, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: world war, post-war war, cold war.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Prague, it's a, they're a little more
timid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little more because of the cold
war.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that it's not like Barcelona
where you walk down the street and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having said that, they very much have
a culture and a little bit of an epicenter
[SPEAKER_00]: of their own there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prague's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then actually I spent a lot of time in
Slovenia and you know, so the capital of
[SPEAKER_02]: Slovenia is Ljubljana.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could go smoke weed in a lot of bars
in, in, in Ljubljana.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you go right there and it's just
like Ljubljana is like a baby Prague,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the Balkans are opening up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you go down to Croatia, you have to
be, you have to be more careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are kind of like, they kind of
definitely have that, that Eastern
[SPEAKER_02]: European kind of like this authority,
this, there's this authority that will get
[SPEAKER_02]: you, whether it's a, a real or perceived
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sense that in Tel Aviv as much as,
I mean, I quickly tapped into the
[SPEAKER_00]: underground scene in Tel Aviv and,
and, and we'll admit that there was
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption going on in public spaces and
at the right cafes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still, there's still definitely
this seven million people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a medical program.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only 30,000 people on the medical
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet some of the figures are showing up to
20% of the populace consumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, this is something needs to
change here from a political landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's just like here where we've
got 64% of the population in the U S that
[SPEAKER_00]: are pro cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now to some point or another,
about 40% of the states have legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what does it, what does it take to get
to that true watershed for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Canada, like you said, they flip
Trudeau came in on it, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Canada was just like, all right,
I think the UN's credibility on the drug
[SPEAKER_02]: treaty is just being, is being decimated
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that is really the key to
the, I think that's really the key to the,
[SPEAKER_02]: to the issue is like, or to the,
to this issue is that we don't think about
[SPEAKER_02]: this UN treaty as, as, as, as America,
as a folks from the United States,
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are like, oh, what about the UN
treaty?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, what about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't, we, oh, we got to legalize all
the UN tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we don't even know what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't even care.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not on our radar, but you go,
but you go over to Europe and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: like, oh, we cannot, legalize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have this, but there is a UN
Geneva treaty that says we cannot,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're like, what are you talking
about?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just legalize, see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically Spain gets away with a lot
of stuff now compared comparably speaking
[SPEAKER_00]: to some of those mainland countries we're
speaking of in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like Spain and Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we, I think we're just talking
about as Portugal fully decriminalizes all
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then goes on top of that, we're
launching a medical program for cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, that is such a forward thinking
compared to the rest of to write a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff here, a bit more stringent side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the European union, obviously UK
exempt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in their own space.
[SPEAKER_02]: People just want control.
[SPEAKER_02]: The authority wants control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're going to have their control
no matter what.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if, and if it's not pot,
it's going to be something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they, you know, and that's one thing
that that's why you have all this quasi
[SPEAKER_02]: legality is because, because of the UN
treaties and because of these,
[SPEAKER_02]: these, these mores of society,
or if you will, uh, you can't,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got to do it like a background,
like wink, wink style.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just how Europe has rolled.
[SPEAKER_02]: For, uh, for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, but that all being said,
the wave is so strong and the whole UN
[SPEAKER_02]: thing, uh, UN treaty is being,
is being questioned at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, uh, and it's falling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you add, just as we went to 62%
legalization after a relatively short
[SPEAKER_02]: period of time, what fit 20 years ago,
we were maybe at 38, 35.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's maybe, and, uh, you look at the
stats in the eighties was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the same thing is happening for,
uh, Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that wave is coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's happening right now in Europe
and they're going to be every,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, uh, country is going to have their own
respective real market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's only a matter of like,
you know, five years ish before the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If Europe's just, it's tumbled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did a, uh, an article on the
legalization and still wrote for six
[SPEAKER_00]: years, moonlighting and every once in a
while pick up the pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just did an article for a hero grow
magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, on the legalization of Canada,
it's exactly what I was talking about is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, yeah, it's one thing for Canada
to be the first G seven country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, purgway was the first,
was the first country respectfully,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that more so being a third world
country for a place like Canada to
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize and people were like,
well, what does that really mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what's the big one?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, okay, we're talking about
it from a Canadian domestic scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have 36.5 million, but they have 3
million less people in that entire country
[SPEAKER_00]: than California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is kind of when you look,
it's not so much about the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at, they are the second largest
country in the world, only behind Russia.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I try to explain to people in,
in this article, it's the export game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said everywhere I go, there's crops on,
there's Canadian crops on the ground in
[SPEAKER_00]: South America, specifically Columbia is
very dominant in Portugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they have plants in quarantine in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've run into them in Germany,
Switzerland, trying to scale their wheat,
[SPEAKER_02]: the growing in Southern Europe to sell it
to Northern Europe right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they know if you have a grow in Germany
or wherever, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to be more expensive than if
you have a growing in Greece or Macedonia
[SPEAKER_02]: or Italy or Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Italy and Spain are ridiculously
inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't understand some of the East
Slovenia and Eastern European company is
[SPEAKER_02]: probably more expensive to live in or at
least some areas of it than Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and people understand the whole
demographics of the world are changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, and so, uh, uh, and so like,
if you like Bosnia, if you go grow in
[SPEAKER_02]: Bosnia, I don't think, I don't know if
anyone's doing that yet, but Bosnia,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything is like Bosnia is got a lower
standard of living and lower, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: lower, uh, higher, uh, lower, uh,
like, like, like, like salary versus a
[SPEAKER_02]: standard of living.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, um, then China, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wouldn't, we wouldn't, we wouldn't,
that's kind of our intuitive to some
[SPEAKER_02]: folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically what I'm saying is how,
how Canada is like, goes to, goes to
[SPEAKER_02]: Columbia to scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the Europeans are going to Southern
Europe to scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, and that's great for these,
like Greece is Greece is they're getting
[SPEAKER_02]: ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to a guy, a big guy out of Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, but I think it's great that these
guys, I mean, you think about it and I
[SPEAKER_00]: discussed that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, you know, Georgia, the first
former Soviet Union Republic country,
[SPEAKER_00]: they started a medical program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned Germany, Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're, they're just,
it's, it's this pivotal shift where you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have 45 countries around the
world that have either one legalized or
[SPEAKER_00]: two decriminalized weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to your point, I think the UN and,
and, and several of these groups need to
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize on global scale, you can't
continue to chastise and suppress this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause at the end of the day, it's a
miracle plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was, you know, kind of cliche
to say that, but it's very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a threat on the textile industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a threat on the farm industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a threat on the recreational alcohol,
tobacco industry to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what other plant, what other matter
out there exists that can cover off on all
[SPEAKER_00]: those basis?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing like Jack used to say,
I don't, what'd he say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he said, I'm not, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp will save the planet, but it's the
only thing that can.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, and that's the thing about the
Southern, uh, European countries is that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're, uh, they're, they're,
they're gearing up to export all their
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff and it's not even legal in their own
country.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're finding this, this like,
well, we're going to grow, we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: export, but yet it's not legal,
legal here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we've, we've seen examples like
that around, around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise that's, um, you know,
a hot topic that came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's a bit of confusion around
the legalization of CBD maybe being
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped to schedule five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we learned from the DEA,
not from, from the FDA that approved that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that that was only applicable to one
specific company, GW out of England.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: GW Pharmaceuticals, the largest exporter
of medical cannabis is located in England
[SPEAKER_00]: where they didn't until, uh, well now as
of November one, the parliament just
[SPEAKER_00]: passed it, but as of November one now have
a medical program.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't even have a medical program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got, they got GW.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, Jamaica, not even two
months ago, Jamaica, their first medical
[SPEAKER_00]: crops were pulled down and sent to Canada
to your point, because that Canadians are
[SPEAKER_00]: smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the cost per pound or per kilo on
manufacturing indoor or even a light depth
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario versus outdoor and harnessing the
natural resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be surprised if they go to
Africa to eventually grow or they're,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know South Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying Northern above the Sahara.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't even be surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's even, I think I mentioned before,
but you know, talking to an LP in,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, during a grow up in Niagara falls and,
and they disclose that they have several
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred plants on the ground in Australia
and quarantine with the government for a
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 365 day quarantine on this plan
before they're allowed to drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that just saying that before they're
allowed to actually utilize them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of pisses me off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of pisses me off in one way,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you, you motherfuckers want to
capitalize on weed, but you ain't going to
[SPEAKER_02]: legalize it for your people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like bombaclat, you know,
step up, but they can't, they can't keep
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those veneers for too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just by doing that alone is actually a
step for them to eventually legalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia's an anomaly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing people, I try to explain
to people again is, is while it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: Commonwealth country, just like Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously they have the queen on their
paper on their, on their coins.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having said that, you know,
they are a little behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they are because of the fact that
there is such an influence from big pharma
[SPEAKER_00]: on parliament and specifically the prime
minister point to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very clinical down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got, you've got this Western
influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the wrong way in the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yet they still without the benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they answer to, to England in some
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it is, it's tough for some
markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fascinating, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never a dull moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're obviously in Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are some places you're
taking your show and we're stoked to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: part of it and be working with you because
again, you bring the right and you bring
[SPEAKER_00]: some flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring who I mean, Henry Rollins,
which one of the guys on my team is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: that guy's a great comedian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not no music.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Henry Rollins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Lance.
