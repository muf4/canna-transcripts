[SPEAKER_00]: I find a lot of benefits to just the oils
and the creams for pain, joint pain and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually retired in 2011 because of back
pain, and one of the things that really
[SPEAKER_00]: helped me was smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was so much pain that it hurt if I
sat down, it hurt if I stood up,
[SPEAKER_00]: it hurt if I moved, it didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was extremely helpful and allowed
me to function.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a daily basis and little by little I've
been able to kind of work my way back into
[SPEAKER_00]: training.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, and I'm the kind of person that
if I'm not doing martial arts,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm miserable, I get depressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need that as an outlet for me
physically and creatively and cannabis has
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed me to do that.
