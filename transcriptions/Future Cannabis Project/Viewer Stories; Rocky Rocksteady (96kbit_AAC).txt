[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, how y'all doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: We over here with Rocksteady Cannabis
Cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Rocky, aka Rocky Slick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm over here trying to talk about these
phenotypes that I have in this THC bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a video that was requested by
Future Cannabis Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I love what you guys do and I
just wanted to oblige what you guys asked
[SPEAKER_00]: for, you know what I mean, and what I
offered to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this right here is one phenotype of the
THC bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was actually a seed that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can tell, it's a seed over here
by, take a look at the stem, it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: huge and thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have these in 25 gallon plastic grow
bags with Dr. Earth dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple other things I use, you know,
I gotta say, man, organic is the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: go, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never find flavors and tastes in
just strong plants like you would
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere else with chemicals,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants have been trained and topped.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I do a lot of training,
man, you know, so I can get whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: want out of my can.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an urban organic no-till method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't have a mulch layer up right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're curious about some of
the nutrients that I use, I use a mixture
[SPEAKER_00]: of a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use fermented fruit fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the jar right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cantaloupe meat and organic honey
and raw unbleached sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you put it in that mason jar and you
let it do its thing for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for my nitrogen boost,
I use this Alaskan fish fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over there further down is gonna
be more of a pumping grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that for pH control, too,
for my water instead of using anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that for pH and, you know,
just for a quick added boost, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to feed your microbes,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also down here in the bottom, I got the
compost from Dr. Earth, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta say, this stuff is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see your plants blow up really,
really fast, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also use the dry amendments,
the Dr. Earth fruit fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato herb and vegetable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also use the flower grow,
which is like a 2, 9, 6 or something to
[SPEAKER_00]: that effect, but it's definitely for
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these plants need to be watered right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they need to, you know, when they're
thirsty, I let them tell me so that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can, you know, pull everything out of the
ground like they want to, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they've been up for a little
while now, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been putting them under supplemental
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this medication just came to me
out of nowhere this train, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually trying to get some power
cookies and some sherbert, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my friend tossed this to me kind of
accidentally.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, and it ended up being a blessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife has degenerative disc disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's 41 years old and sometimes can't
walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have four kids and this specific
strain, not only the cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, of course helps a lot,
but this specific strain really gives my
[SPEAKER_00]: wife quality of life, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have four boys and we wouldn't
be running around and doing what we had to
[SPEAKER_00]: do if it wasn't for this strain that just
was a blessing in disguise, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This other phenol I have over here is
definitely showing good traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's so thick, strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got to say this is like no
other strain I've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it does flower out, it's like you
can't trim it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to get Teflon coated nonstick
Fiskars to be able to trim and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: insane, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the dry sift and if you guys are
doing hash or dry sift or anything with
[SPEAKER_00]: this pressing it, this plant is built for
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when you light a joint of it,
it just catches on fire because there's so
[SPEAKER_00]: much resin and oil production inside of
the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is what I want to do,
really, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be my profession.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kind of starting out slow and
low, you know, and I really want to know
[SPEAKER_00]: what you guys think about what I'm doing
here, you know, and if you have any more
[SPEAKER_00]: questions or you guys want access to any
other genetics, I do have that and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: happy to oblige, especially with people
who have paved the way for us,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to show you guys this video
and give it to you with much respect and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with admiration as to what you
guys do because you guys showed me a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: too, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rock Steady Cannabis Cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
