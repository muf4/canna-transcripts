[SPEAKER_01]: Here though is with other terpene profiles
with weird OGs and chems and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that kind of stuff, but there's no
real reference in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So therefore I kind of just take it for
what it is versus like lemon or citrus,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess pine even to some extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's sharp enough just in those smells,
it's almost like you close your eyes and
[SPEAKER_01]: all of a sudden you're not smelling pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a crazy phenomenon that I see just
with these certain varieties where I
[SPEAKER_01]: already recognize that smell so heavily
from a different place that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: especially, I don't know, strange when I
smell it in pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't just smell like some other
type of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, but what were you saying about the
citrus?
[SPEAKER_03]: What you started saying before you moved
on to the pine?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an association to health and
vitality and vitamin C and you know all
[SPEAKER_05]: these things that like even smoke can
avoid depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess when I talk about the
citrus, you go into all the things of like
[SPEAKER_01]: that limonene or the citrus smells in
general making us more happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have this attraction to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But specifically what I'm talking about is
this phenomenon like there's a lot of weed
[SPEAKER_01]: out, especially like a lot of the more
dank smells that I'm really interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they all are like pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: People think about pot when they smell it
and there's a cool dank smell,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about these specific types of
weed and I see it a lot with orange where
[SPEAKER_01]: if you just close your eyes and you smell
it, you don't really smell weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You smell some crazy citrus experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know it's not an orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but there's enough variation within
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it takes 10 different citrus ones,
but then there's those ones that aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: like citrus weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like citrus citrus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just a crazy experience when
you close your eyes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It smells you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in the garden and I'm like,
I don't grow that plant, but I smelt it
[SPEAKER_05]: because it was so pungent in the air and
then it comes out in the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then furthermore, when it ties
in with this other thing that I don't we
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about it, but it's like there's these
certain varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw it with the sour tangy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got it like the HP 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is older strain that we used to mess
with a couple like diesels over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do this where it's this lingering
mouth coating throat coating flavor that
[SPEAKER_01]: lasts and it's especially crazy and not
all strains do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of ones taste like weed when yeah,
it could smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the greatest pot whether it's
somebody else's or mine and it smells
[SPEAKER_01]: really good and when you smoke it tastes
like weed and then there's other weed and
[SPEAKER_01]: you smell it and then you smoke it and it
tastes and smells and whatever the
[SPEAKER_01]: experience of smoking it's of that of
whatever you smelled before it was being
[SPEAKER_01]: burned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're tasting and smelling all in the
experience of yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, you're putting me on the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain's fried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know depending on there's just so
many ways that could go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing this dog shit strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm looking for is this certain
phenol of my cultivar where when I walk by
[SPEAKER_00]: it you smelled it's like nose curling like
disgusting like you could taste dog shit
[SPEAKER_00]: in the air like it's just like this is
disgusting and to the point that it even
[SPEAKER_00]: tricks me and I'll look at my shoe and
it's my plant and I'm breeding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm breeding for that and it smells like
dog shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a hundred percent and the nastiest
plant the nastiest dog shit nose curling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can taste that shit in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you're like, oh, that's the
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the ultimate diet that I'm like,
that's the one the one that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I started breeding with,
you know, and then we started breeding a
[SPEAKER_00]: high CBGA variety of that starting from
dog shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I really don't know at this point if
it's how I'm getting like four three to
[SPEAKER_00]: four percent CBGA whether it's some
interaction between the bacteria and the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungus and the plants or it's my my
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the the light manipulation or the
full spectrum lighting the whatever I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing with the lighting or or or it's the
genetics, you know, or a combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to figure that out,
which is kind of like searching for like
[SPEAKER_00]: three needles and at once in a haystack.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a tornado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, while I'm going while while it's my
production facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm doing like research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only am I pushing the edge on my
production facility, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, on a bunch of other levels with
soil and and you know, JDOM living,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever full spectrum lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, I'm like looking for
these needles in the haystacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I'm doing production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm doing research while I'm doing
production, which is kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really like writing and a dangerous
edge, you know, because yeah, because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of backed off of the research
last year and put the seeds aside,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, those seeds aside, you know,
just so I could focus on them and just
[SPEAKER_00]: survive, you know, through compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way I could have the opportunity
to pick that project back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was like, all right,
this is just too much going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't I'm going to I'm going to blow
this project and even and whatever I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just didn't, you know,
because I would have to do tons of testing
[SPEAKER_00]: to test for the CBGA when, you know,
we were getting like three, four percent
[SPEAKER_00]: at a week like nine, eight, nine in like
three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still there like two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through all my test results because
I wasn't looking for it at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I went back through all my test
results and I saw it in all of my test
[SPEAKER_00]: results of that cultivar that I'd been
running.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I was like, oh, well, that's what
I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've been breeding for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just didn't know I was breeding for that
until I figured out because one day I was
[SPEAKER_00]: in my bar and I was in my office and I was
like, it was just nagging at me like,
[SPEAKER_00]: go look at the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like and I was like, OK, my wife
really needed me to do some paper
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, and I was like,
I got to pull it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need that paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I just have to look at
this, you know, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just it's talking telling me to
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's like four percent CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I called the lab and was talking
to them about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, OK, that's the she was like,
that's insanely high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you normally it's like under one
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like it was like three point eight
percent, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like 17 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like 17 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, three point something three
point eight percent CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was like, whoa, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I went back looking through all my
tests, saw that it was reoccurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I tried to do some more experiments,
didn't have enough money to do all the
[SPEAKER_00]: testing that I would need to do on on,
you know, how many seeds I pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to test each plant at week
five, six, seven, eight, nine and then
[SPEAKER_00]: have clones and cuttings of each one of
those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's say in the metro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was like, well, yeah,
I just don't have, you know, in Sonoma
[SPEAKER_00]: County is not really making it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just like, no, you're like,
can I just have this?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, no, you're like,
well, I just like I was already doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, no, you know, so you're just
kind of like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only doing what you were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing more until, you know, they give
you your use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm waiting for them to three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have a three year anniversary
party party that I didn't get my use
[SPEAKER_00]: permit yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a great party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, yay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I call it the Sonoma Triangle,
where use permits go to disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to smoke to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sad but true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard of the Bermuda Triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've got the Sonoma Triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, where my use permit is like
disappeared somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so, yeah, that's the script you've
heard.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're complete.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're close.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're working on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we talked with our planner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's close because my wife is like,
yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, my wife's on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's really good at crawling up
everybody's ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's she I called.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you are a proctologist,
baby man, because that's what you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be to get shit done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So so, yeah, that's how I grow
proctologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she's very thorough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, and generally people are wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to do it yourself and and
represent yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trust your instincts and and just do
what you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't like the answer somebody
gives you, it's everything's like the DMV.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you go to the next person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the world, the world is like the DMV.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't like that, everybody's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half everybody's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what your lawyers and doctors,
everybody's flailing or winging it on some
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like, you know, you go to the next
person.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the prerequisite before you go hang
out at the DMV for a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because because because perception
is everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing is what it seems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our strengths are our weaknesses and
our weaknesses are our strengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like sometimes on the garden,
that means you don't do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the hardest thing to do is nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I call it the no till nothing
style, because, you know, the hardest
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to do is nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times it's just human nature to
want to impose our will and fuck shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just like, you know, so we feel
useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We create a fire so we can put it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like then it's just like that downward
spiral, you know, it's like flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself down a toilet, you know,
just, you know, like, don't go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like chill, you know, and just like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it just naturally, you know,
organically like happen, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's that's what are your thoughts
on the flower that he grew?
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't grow that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I thought you did grow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is epic.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was your seven year old.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's the five year old.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is epic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't want to miss some AFGOO.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you call it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was up at the Humboldt conference and I
shared a jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is top notch.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have any interest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were there last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk about expanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like really condensed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was when you only have so much time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you need to get the job done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the cup is so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many just, you know,
it's hard to really focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the regenerative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're, you know, here we're just
there so much, you know, it's hard to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've sat in the same ten by ten.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he doesn't even know there's an
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's just he's just stuck here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your soul in place.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's stoned.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't leave.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, so Nicholas, who's five, they have
their own pots.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they do whatever the hell they want in
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is literally free for all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is really do you just give them
like full like I'm going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, the seven year old in veg is
like, actually, I want to chop and drop.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, that's what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, well, that's the season.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he learned a hard lesson.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he literally is crying.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like, oh, I killed it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's done for the year.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but he's seven and he's learning
that, you know, and it's like,
[SPEAKER_05]: oh, that's what we grow in the garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that those experiences.
[SPEAKER_05]: You said this was a little brother who's a
raccoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you said that was the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this was gift.
[SPEAKER_05]: The seeds were given.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gifted to me from a young man who's doing
beautiful names named Dujon, who is also
[SPEAKER_05]: at the Humboldt Conference.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is like coming full circle,
closing the loops.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is on purpose.
[SPEAKER_05]: I met up with people at the Humboldt
Conference that were like, we're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: share some genetics and see how it
changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're what are the genetics?
[SPEAKER_05]: My understanding, it's it's her loopy
fruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me a sec.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can look at my phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll actually know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold on a sec.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay for phones.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate them and they're so useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so he was interested in people growing
it out in different microclimates to see
[SPEAKER_03]: how it expresses itself differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dujon gets the reality that there's stuff
going on in the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you also understand that actually
if you have the life around just the
[SPEAKER_05]: rhizosphere, just around the roots,
you don't have to have it in everything,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it will grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you can have a pot if that's all
you got.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can put that life back in that pot
and it will do special things like it's
[SPEAKER_05]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so my kids have that understanding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we play with the pots.
[SPEAKER_05]: We experiment.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't they don't they know it's a
garden, but they call it the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like my seven year old really inspiring.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes me want to like, dude,
it's how we grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm training my son to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, you know, have them plant their
own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've been honestly afraid to
enter the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on a personal level, on your personal,
you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's like legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Opposed to like my license.
[SPEAKER_00]: My kids are not allowed in my greenhouses
or whatever, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you used to like five years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a change, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, no, not on record.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm definitely not admitting that I
had.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you were not really ever supposed to
have your kids legally in.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we give people?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not saying it's a problem,
but I wouldn't necessarily want to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, go on record saying that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course not.
[SPEAKER_00]: My kids running around in my greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would never do that to my
children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside in the sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God, in the sunshine, running
through cannabis plants with terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loving on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, by the way, here's a tomato.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like some carrots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick some South African ground cherries
and some potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually what I grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we also get some kale over there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, grow it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my kids are learning about patience and
the plants are teaching them about that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we got the.
[SPEAKER_05]: I only know that because a plant taught
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's literally how it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just I got something else to
share, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Listen up.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a whole other world out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the headlamp.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can really see stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Kindle or the television or the iPad
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hook up a microscope to the TV and
I'm showing them their plants and the soil
[SPEAKER_05]: and the life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I need one of those microscopes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's this big.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this microscopic creature,
dude, it's big.
[SPEAKER_05]: Better than it's so crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's this thing called a micro
arthropod.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's on the screen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it looks like Godzilla walking through
Tokyo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Claws.
[SPEAKER_05]: Friggin pinchers and shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fungus is going like, I can't move.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been in a garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that actually tells you how your
plants are growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's so epic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you if you haven't looked through a
microscope at your soil, it'll blow your
[SPEAKER_05]: mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sun bolt grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that is that Johnson sun bolt?
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is sunshine.
[SPEAKER_05]: But grown on the central coast in living
soil, pushing that this this minty anise
[SPEAKER_05]: fennel terpene.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you were talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So talk about the fennel.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the fennel has this terpene,
the smell, this flavor.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and it's that smell when you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that smell when you're at like a an
Indian restaurant and there's that little
[SPEAKER_05]: bowl of mints and you're like,
I'm not quite sure what those are,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I'm still a little hungry.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and you have it and it hits you
with that licorice, but it's also minty.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a plant that literally just grows
on the roadside and it pumps out seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's happy to grow anywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Mullins different, but it's an
amazing plant to fennel smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's healing.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just putting the puzzle pieces
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the microbes in your soil don't have
those puzzle pieces to work with,
[SPEAKER_05]: it can't change the picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's literally just adding biodiversity,
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Adding to your biome, building your biome,
adding to diversity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can do that on site.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can encourage that growth for pennies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Without animals, just through plants,
just through plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just you learn to work with it in a
little different way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it starts to really group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you don't need to like necessarily,
you know, haul manures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to haul them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the work part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chop and drop, cover cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: How was I done with my tomatoes this year?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, you guys got hit with a frost.
[SPEAKER_05]: I go like this snip, crush, crush,
crush, break up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Done.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I put compost and mulch over the
top of that and I let it just mellow over
[SPEAKER_05]: winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do so much work over the winter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's when your soil is really doing
the work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they put in that punch in the
spring.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you're not loving on your soil
all year long, especially in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you really realize and get that,
that's an important step in your process.
[SPEAKER_05]: I go on vacation with my kids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's stretches of time where I'm
like, all right, I'll close the gate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're like, we'll see you when I get
back.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've got the rest of the team already
working in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's confidence.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if there's a weird temperature
spike or a weird chill in the air,
[SPEAKER_05]: the microbes literally keep the soil
warmer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I know that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like your compost pile heats up to 100.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll catch fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait, what caught fire?
[SPEAKER_05]: The party of life literally caught this
shit on fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can't even see them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that powerful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you just kind of work with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just getting the team running and
all on the same page.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what were you saying specifically
about the fennel?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you were talking about cutting it
down, and then that kind of mulch it.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so you're taking that input.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're processing it through.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first of all, starting point is you
have a lot of fennel growing on your
[SPEAKER_03]: property.
No.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a small grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a big, beautiful community.
Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like even like you and I were
talking, it's like my garden is too small
[SPEAKER_05]: to feed my community.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I work with other farmers to help them
understand how they can grow strawberries
[SPEAKER_05]: and hundreds of acres in the Santa Maria
Valley in a healthier way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I'm helping to feed my community.
[SPEAKER_05]: See what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: It shifts it just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it changes the program.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like literally, he's got a program.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now he's got life as part of that
program.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just took some time and to work
with people and help them understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And cannabis is like the
[SPEAKER_05]: conductor at the orchestra.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it changes the music depending on how
many pieces are in front of you to work
[SPEAKER_05]: with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it sits there.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I take my seed, I take a handful of
where that seed is going to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I take it and I put intent into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I take it and I put it in water
and get the water in it.
It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: These microbes are 70% water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wake everybody up and I soak my seeds in
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: My seeds are literally sucking in where
they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you basically can take your seeds
and go out in the forest and get some leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: mold soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, see, but my grow is all those things
put in, stacked and shirmed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I take that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's no transition.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no shock.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like everybody sends out their little poor
pictures of root porn, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: on Instagram or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, those poor little babies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you're exposing to something that
that's not how it's grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It changes it versus, oh, I know what to
do here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those genetics run and they've got all
the team with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's where that orchestra,
all those players in front of them,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you're missing.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the timing of it all.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got to spend time to know the
timing of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like kung fu right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some kung fu right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the timing is everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Microbes, the kung fu.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they are like you write you because I
can be like, hey, this person overwatered,
[SPEAKER_05]: which meant they sent that environment
into an anaerobic state.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, fermentation is powerful and your
plants will use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you don't want your roots like that
because those, those microbes that go
[SPEAKER_05]: anaerobic, they literally, they fucking
fart alcohol and burn your stuff off.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's excrement is all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we breathe in oxygen, XL carbon
dioxide.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, okay, I'm going to take in
all this good and pump out poison.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's how they grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a simple thing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But most people don't think it's a big
deal because they don't understand why it
[SPEAKER_05]: hurts your plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ripping them out of where they're
literally the, it's called the
[SPEAKER_05]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just coding with life.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coded with life from too much water
and you drown it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've seen that plant, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like it got drowned.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what happens because they
breathe the soil breeze.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like you saying my plant grows in
the Amazon, the diversity, the life,
[SPEAKER_05]: the layers, the depth, the water,
the disc, the bird song, the, the storm or
[SPEAKER_05]: the, the dust from the planes of Africa
being lifted up across the Atlantic and
[SPEAKER_05]: coming down as minerals across.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how they get fertilized.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, what?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, that's what the plant wants to
do.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how it grows.
[SPEAKER_05]: That changes things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can start small because the
microbes are even smaller.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can literally start small.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you have a system to do that
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I was saying, yeah,
I've got, that's what it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's products out there too,
that are starting to really turn the
[SPEAKER_05]: corner to understand that.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, it's not about NPK.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, if you want to help your plants,
the first thing to change your growth,
[SPEAKER_05]: stop using nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just think of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: How would that change how you grow?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you didn't use any nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean like out of a bottle?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so easy to get nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only if you've got the rest of the team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of like dead grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go and like use like weed rack and use
like a month old dead grass to turn into
[SPEAKER_00]: like a JLF and like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, which is, but we were kept from
that knowledge because like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient companies don't want you to know
how easy it is to make nutrients out of,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to make liquid nutrients out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're making it plant available.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're taking what you got and turning
it into what you need.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, we've been doing that for,
I haven't been doing it anaerobically,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've been doing it, you know,
no till style.
[SPEAKER_03]: So talk about some stuff you do
anaerobically versus aerobically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, like real fast anaerobic is just a
category, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what do you prefer?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's really all it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that preference changes what you
promote.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why I like lactobacilli is so
important because it can work in that
[SPEAKER_05]: middle grounds and actually it produces an
enzyme that kills the bad guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So literally it's like, if you're having a
problem where it's leaning towards and you
[SPEAKER_05]: can see it, like you can literally look at
a soil sample and I can tell your plants
[SPEAKER_05]: drowning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Before the plant is drowning because those
creatures that like that anaerobic
[SPEAKER_05]: environment, they start to multiply and
you can see, you can see them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that point you're going,
okay, we're overwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's an anaerobic environment
that is created because there's not proper
[SPEAKER_00]: drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's different than creating an
anaerobic environment to cultivate
[SPEAKER_00]: specific bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, from, from the plant to feed to
the plant, which is kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: completeness completeness of, you know,
using like a JDOM liquid fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, you know, made from,
in my instance, I used cannabis leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's the methodology is that a
plant, no, not what you got, but what the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about you know, the plant only needs,
you know, what's already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's connecting its own loop.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's both, it's basically both.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, there's just like, it's just like
Kung Fu.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like different styles of Kung
Fu.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that one is better than the other
or they don't all work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when they do, we fight, you,
you, you learn, you know, so it's not like
[SPEAKER_00]: a competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a friendly, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get in a flow where you are
going hard, but it's easy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but it is an evolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where in your process are you doing things
anaerobically versus aerobically?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I start out with collecting the members
of the team that live in the area.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's going to different habitats.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to the healthiest undisturbed
left alone.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, like that's where you find what grows
there on that smallest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but you're not, you know,
if you're, if you're not sealing them,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they're not cultivating
anaerobically, you know, cause there's
[SPEAKER_00]: air.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you collect them and then you can
take those and you'll know it because
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll stink like crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, like there's something primal
where you're like, that is not healthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't go there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've done that, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You flip a tarp or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's that dark shit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that's, I think that comes
back to perception is everything because
[SPEAKER_00]: in some cultures, you know, they,
they like stinky stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe Americans don't, you know,
but Koreans, you know, the KNF,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are not afraid of, like when I,
I mentioned, I mentioned certain,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, JDOM style, you know,
uh, uh, uh, you know, applications and
[SPEAKER_00]: people get like weirded out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like durian?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like durian?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It smells like shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Durian is a fruit from like the
Philippines, Indonesia.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like things that smell like shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I grow dog shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's horrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love, I love things that smell like
shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you put it in your mouth and it's
like custardy sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it, it is the biggest shift of
perspective because you go, everything I
[SPEAKER_05]: say is saying that this is not healthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yet there's something to it too,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And you, you experience it anew.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's really kind of a weird
experience, but it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, on, on cycling or on, on, on using,
on using cannabis, health, healthy or sick
[SPEAKER_01]: to, uh, to make products for further
cannabis growing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, definitely using it in the,
in the compost pile, um, and chipping,
[SPEAKER_01]: chipping stocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love chip.
[SPEAKER_01]: We chip like we'll cut a field.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll cut all the product on the field or
the greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything left.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've run through the chipper and that's
our, you know, and that's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the one like that I really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you got to like condense the
material down, you know, somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, like for things to take a while to
break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the thing is like this,
we're doing a lot of chipper work,
[SPEAKER_01]: sudden oak death.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like what I'm saying is that the,
uh, cause that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sudden oak death is, uh, I live with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a 10 oak forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, so is, is, is there a negative
effect on the cannabis plant by using oak
[SPEAKER_01]: that was downed that died due to sudden
oak?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I understand how it could,
that's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's where I'm going with this.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm taking, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking all the, and some of it didn't
die a sudden note, but I'm just going
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using like, uh, a pile of chips that,
you know, was run through a chipper from
[SPEAKER_00]: the electric company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they left like 20 yards of chips
from my property.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, like something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are oak dominant piles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, uh, uh, fur oak, redwood.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know like the percentages or
anything in the pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's predominantly 10 oak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say 80% 75% 10 oak easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be more 80% 10 oak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe a couple of Madrones,
literally very few Madrones down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what, what like I've found is that if I
can use stuff that's been downed five,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10, 15 years, run it through the chipper,
I need way less nitrogen in order to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the pile cooking and let the rain hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it breaks down really nice,
a lot more fungally down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like duff at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's duffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the wood chips get all, um,
you know, just inoculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll dig into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll harvest the spots that are just like
thick with like a white, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal hypey where they're like,
they're just like, like just decomposing
[SPEAKER_00]: at this one layer, you know, quicker than
like up here, you know, they're just it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just eating it at that one layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, I've seen that so much
in chip piles where we have these like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what I guess is like ecto, but they strand
like where these were the, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: where it starts webbing together,
but it's in dense pockets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a pile and it's chipped out,
especially if it was like really rotten
[SPEAKER_01]: when it went in and it's already super
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of fines coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could get a bit wet, like a one or two
heavy rains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get some water into the piles,
trying to keep the spot piles low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see it that the webs run through
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's weird is that they don't run
consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: They run maybe light at first as they're
building up, but then into these heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: pockets and those like just inoculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't know what happens,
but like, yeah, they just like go into
[SPEAKER_00]: like a ball and just like, yeah,
eat everything and then go from there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So after we read Jeff Lowenfeld's book,
uh, the teaming with fungi, um,
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah, Jeff's book.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so in towards the end of the book,
it teaches you about where to find,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, fungal hypotheria in the wild,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we found out that, you know,
like, uh, long-term, uh, full-term outdoor
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis plants are like really beneficial
to, uh, you know, a fungal dominant,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, association with your bacteria
mix in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, my neighbor was basically the one
who gave us the book to read was like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, we can go find these like whole
pockets of, of dense, uh, mycorrhizae in
[SPEAKER_07]: the forest.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all just like right there next to
where broken, uh, oak trees are like
[SPEAKER_07]: falling on the ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, we literally just went off in the
woods a little bit and like right where
[SPEAKER_07]: you would see where big old branches had
fallen down or trees had fallen down.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could like push over like the top,
like decrepit layer of what was bark.
[SPEAKER_07]: And stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's just like full, just dense
pockets of it where the, I, I assume where
[SPEAKER_07]: all that comes from is the microbes and
the fungus and the mycelium are eating the
[SPEAKER_07]: wood tissue inside of the log or whatever
that's fallen down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, that's where, um, that's where
I personally experienced like finding it
[SPEAKER_07]: in the wild in, in old growth forest that
hasn't been disturbed for at least 60
[SPEAKER_07]: years, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was just cool to find,
you know, right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're saying, uh, talking about like,
wait, the, uh, specifically, you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You were saying specifically how,
uh, you know, with the tan oaks,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, like if it's,
if it's, if I've been, I've been wondering
[SPEAKER_00]: that myself, if it's like dangerous or not
to use the tan oaks, but so I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to out-compete whatever,
whatever's there that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, I just, I don't see how there's,
there's any like con, there's no concern
[SPEAKER_01]: to me in growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe if I was raising, if I was
trading, if I was raising little tan oaks,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd all of a sudden be like, should I be
using this as my soil component?
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, I just see it as something
that's available and works way sooner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had, for instance, we have this big
pile that we're working with that's for
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant and it's more like 20 years down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it was already booked and run with
dozers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, um, you know, a waste in
making a pond a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've been working this fur pile
and I'm like, okay, there's stuff in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also have like in different spots,
these, uh, like 50, 60, 70 year old furs,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, that they, that they dropped and they
couldn't get out at the time or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have access to them and I'm more
okay with thinking about using that stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like fresh fur just doesn't work in
our situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think, I think it's too acidic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got like a lot of, I don't know
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of anti-microbials
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just by the nature of all the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't have much for,
um, in that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's predominantly tan oak, which,
and I've been wondering that is this
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to, you know, get some virus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided that probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked the lab, I asked one of the labs
and he thought it was fine too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was concerned about heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said that it's waterborne,
but I watched how it spread on my
[SPEAKER_01]: property.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the water is the carrier that brings
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For, for my, my property was chainsaws PG
&E.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we want, we watched it come in on the
power lines and spread through our forest
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, they told us afterwards when I
asked them, yeah, they, they, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that happen too with PG&E come
in and they're just carrying it on their
[SPEAKER_00]: trucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their chainsaws have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been working in it all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in their pant cuffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either coming in on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard, hard to, hard to hide
from it at this point point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have, I see mountains just
dying up, you know, up where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_00]: My neighbor's hill is just like browning
out, but by me, it's not so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I must say where I'm at,
it doesn't seem so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're kind of, like what, maybe because
we're actually working with the forest
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and letting it breathe, you know,
maybe because we're letting it breathe
[SPEAKER_00]: just as simple because I'm cutting so many
trees down or that fault, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, all right, you know, it's like,
you know, you gotta, I live in a,
[SPEAKER_00]: like wherever you're standing and there's
no tree, there were 10, 10 oak trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can verify this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, that's how thick it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have, it's northeast and west
facing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fight for space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fight trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: For light and flat space, I have to like,
you know, fight for it with like a
[SPEAKER_00]: chainsaw and an excavator, you know,
to keep my spaces, my light and my flat
[SPEAKER_00]: or, or not even flat, but just whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it, if it's oak dominant,
then I would say you use that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feed my, I've been predominantly,
uh, using like 10 oak, uh, chips,
[SPEAKER_00]: high fungal 10 oak chips as my base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm using, um, I have this a
hundred year old wisteria patch that's
[SPEAKER_00]: mulching this a hundred year old wisteria
leaves for a hundred years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll be gathering up 10 oak
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll gather up rotten, anything I can
find.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's high fungal, rotten, even like
different color.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go for like different, uh,
like a yellow fungus on the redwoods,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the redwood duff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing old yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it trying to grow old yellow and
get it to pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to get morels to pop in
my, my, uh, my beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I inoculated with them some morels.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll take a minute to pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's still early to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I was really just, yeah,
I thought that would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Giant morels popping up under your
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have shiitake mushrooms that pop up in
the cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: This right here is the flower that we were
talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is Nick's Loopy Fruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, right on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, thank you for sharing it with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, nice.

it really for me is like taking you guys
[SPEAKER_05]: and hanging out in the garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate sharing some flower,
hearing some stories, understanding a
[SPEAKER_05]: different rhythm.

[SPEAKER_05]: And it's being beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, I like to dry toke first so it
kind of sets your palette.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really kind of get that flavor before you
hit it with the heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So would you pass it around if you guys
would like to?
[SPEAKER_05]: But like, they're... Oh, it's sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
