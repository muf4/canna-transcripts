[SPEAKER_01]: this is a wonderful event By the way,
thank you Eric and Joey for putting this

[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Wade laughter and I don't have
a permit in Nevada County our local
[SPEAKER_01]: ordinance doesn't allow me to and There's
been many days lately when I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: really happy about that actually Because
the people I know who are trying to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this in the legal system are really having
a lot of trouble I I'm I'm a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I'm a big fan of access for all and I
first came into cannabis because I have
[SPEAKER_01]: glaucoma that was back in the mid 90s and
Long story short.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've spent a lot of time looking at
the different versions of cannabis The and
[SPEAKER_01]: the effects that those types of cannabis
have on people and their well-being So,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, I have a few stories, but I'm really
looking forward to hearing what Brian Has
[SPEAKER_01]: to say so I'll pass the mic back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you Anyway, this this is an event
for you guys to talk I'm just helping to
[SPEAKER_04]: deliver the message, but I'm glad to share
some stories, too But I feel honored to be
[SPEAKER_04]: amongst all these guys here and they've
definitely been on the front line Gary
[SPEAKER_04]: let's let's start with you since you got
to get going No, Brian.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry Let's let's talk about I should know
that my name is Brian anyway Tell us a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit what drew you to Nevada County
and then also what made you stay and Tell
[SPEAKER_04]: us some of the reasons that you think it's
a good place to grow cannabis All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well just like Wade said I'd like to say
thank you to the organizers of the event
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty awesome event.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I started growing back in 1981
Up in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went up there to some family friends
were building the house and turned out
[SPEAKER_00]: They were growing some really good weed
and I was right out of high school So I
[SPEAKER_00]: did that and learned did that on the north
coast Mendocino Humboldt Sonoma County
[SPEAKER_00]: during the 80s came here in 88 bought my
land in 91 and built a house and raised a
[SPEAKER_00]: family and have been building houses and
growing weed all along and Nevada County
[SPEAKER_00]: has come a long way It's been an amazing
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of really intellectual
people really artsy artsy people creative
[SPEAKER_00]: people and so the I felt like what really
drew me here was the people and the Yuba
[SPEAKER_00]: River and Just the whole vibe of the place
was like like going home as a kid to some
[SPEAKER_00]: fantasy place but growing weed Was not
always easy like in the 80s and 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was huge, you know task forces
trying to chase us down and and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: hiding from helicopters we did all that
and you know lots of folks got arrested
[SPEAKER_00]: and and and Helped helped us get to where
we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a time in Nevada County when
there were posters like at mother truckers
[SPEAKER_00]: and the post office in North San Juan that
were like turn in your neighbors for a
[SPEAKER_00]: $5,000 reward and That was literally a
thing right right up into the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know from personal experience because
like I know folks that got um got Narked
[SPEAKER_00]: on like that and for $5,000 like,
you know, you would have paid those guys
[SPEAKER_00]: five times that to not turn you in You
know like please right, you know But that
[SPEAKER_00]: was a thing and people would fly around
and they'd look for grows and then they'd
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd collect their their reward But
that's like one of the negative things
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a lot more positive things on
the ridge here especially the San Juan
[SPEAKER_00]: Ridge because People there was a really
tight Community and we took care of each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was always you know people that were
in need that would have a Donation jar but
[SPEAKER_00]: the gas station and that jar was always
full like people were always putting fives
[SPEAKER_00]: and tens and twenties in it because Like,
you know, you could feel for these people
[SPEAKER_00]: you probably knew them and if you didn't
know them, you know You knew they were
[SPEAKER_00]: good people because they lived here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So A lot of good stories about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like here's a big one in in the 70s this
school on Oak Tree Road burned down and So
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of growers and local folks with
some money built rebuilt the school just
[SPEAKER_00]: rebuilt it right and But like in the state
of California, you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that when the school board got
involved They're like wait, you can't just
[SPEAKER_00]: rebuild this school but they had they had
rebuilt this school and but the union got
[SPEAKER_00]: involved and all kinds of folks got
involved and and so Another local just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of got disgruntled and burned it down
back down and And let the state rebuild it
[SPEAKER_00]: so that school that cute little school
over there on oak trees oak tree campus
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the story there, but it was the it
was the growers money that helped keep
[SPEAKER_00]: this this Ridge and our whole community
alive and well economically and just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know helping out one another Yeah,
I mean I don't want to ramble on but
[SPEAKER_00]: that's my story for 41 years in the trade
and and oh wait a Really important thing
[SPEAKER_00]: came along like we we always Anticipated
that at some point some y'all would come
[SPEAKER_00]: along and help us build this community
that we envision like this strong thriving
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community and my wife Barbara was
going to start going to these meetings
[SPEAKER_00]: down at them and at the Haven underground
in Nevada City and they were starting out
[SPEAKER_00]: as like what became the Nevada County
Cannabis Alliance and these were the
[SPEAKER_00]: people we were waiting for I'd like to
tell this story because it was so touching
[SPEAKER_00]: like we were like Barbara came home She's
like, hey, you wouldn't believe what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about We're talking about like
starting an ordinance here in Nevada
[SPEAKER_00]: County that allows us to grow,
you know, like out in the open And we had
[SPEAKER_00]: been already like we had the you know,
we had a script We were sorted we were
[SPEAKER_00]: making the rounds of the at the clubs in
Sacramento We were we thought that was
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of quasi-legal and it felt legal,
but it wasn't really legal But but um,
[SPEAKER_00]: so when we start hearing what these folks
are talking about we started getting
[SPEAKER_00]: involved and helped create what became the
Nevada County Cannabis Alliance and
[SPEAKER_00]: without the Nevada County Cannabis
Alliance We never would have gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: through the whole writing of the ordinance
and we wouldn't be sitting here today
[SPEAKER_00]: having this event probably Like that's the
story of my farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were lucky enough to be like one of the
first farms We took the the transition
[SPEAKER_00]: permit when we only could have a thousand
square feet a thousand square feet cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're sitting here, right,
you know and smaller and And 25 plants
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pretty hard to make a living on 25
plants in a thousand square feet Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know so but we took it because like if
we didn't take it we were afraid they'd
[SPEAKER_00]: take it away and then and then and then
we'd be back in a no-ban or a total ban
[SPEAKER_00]: community like it was for a little while
so but it was through a lot of strong
[SPEAKER_00]: activism through Nevada County Cannabis
Alliance and folks like Wade laughter here
[SPEAKER_00]: and Gary and all of us kind of stepping to
the front and and putting our faces on the
[SPEAKER_00]: line because like you know for all those
years we couldn't be out front but now we
[SPEAKER_00]: felt like it was important that people in
the community see that we were you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: their neighbors like I was also a
contractor so Chances are I made it built
[SPEAKER_00]: your house and I coached soccer with the
kids and I might have coached your kids
[SPEAKER_00]: soccer You know, and so like I'm I
couldn't be that bad, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, yeah, I also grow cannabis,
you know, oh you want to buy some Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it turns out that you know that
probably a lot of people suspected that
[SPEAKER_00]: all along but it felt it felt really good
to be able to finally like come Walk down
[SPEAKER_00]: Broad Street in the parade and say yeah,
I'm a cannabis farmer Yeah, so I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to ramble on but thanks for your
attention you guys I got a girl go home
[SPEAKER_00]: and pull tarps because I've got I've got
that going on Yeah, so this is og cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: farming at its best, but I love you guys
and Thanks bread Brian thanks for giving
[SPEAKER_04]: us some story.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was awesome Thanks, Nevada County
Cannabis Alliance to we definitely need to
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've helped push this along here in our
community Hey, if anyone knows Alan from
[SPEAKER_04]: obsolete genetics, he's supposed to be on
this panel, too And I saw him earlier
[SPEAKER_04]: today, but then I couldn't find him when
it got close to time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if anyone sees him Bring him on over
Otherwise, I'm gonna pass this on to Gary
[SPEAKER_04]: and say same Same format, you know,
tell us some stories Tell us why you love
[SPEAKER_04]: Nevada County how you got here Tell us
some of your Humboldt story too,
[SPEAKER_04]: because that's gonna be fun, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, take it Hi, I'm Gary Sabanya I
Thought I'd start maybe at the beginning
[SPEAKER_02]: like when would I did I first plant a
cannabis seed?
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember now I had to try hard I was 15
and a half years old in 1970 in Ventura
[SPEAKER_02]: County And I think everything we grew was
male and we threw it in a bag and smoked
[SPEAKER_02]: it and it got us more stone Than anything
that we had had so far up to that point at
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 years old But when I went to college I
moved to Humboldt County where I met my
[SPEAKER_02]: lovely wife and Felicia back here And we
grew a little bit of weed there we lived
[SPEAKER_02]: close to town We had a greenhouse with
maybe you know, I think a huge crop for us
[SPEAKER_02]: back then was 15 pounds of weed And our
daughter was born there And we decided we
[SPEAKER_02]: were moving out of Humboldt County because
we didn't want our kids to grow up in a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis society And we moved in Nevada
County So just think about the irony of
[SPEAKER_02]: that sometimes we were a little naive and
So the first few years we lived here we
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't doing anything with cannabis But
as you know things would happen we needed
[SPEAKER_02]: some personal stash and planted our own
from seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We brought with us But that's so that's
just a background Of where we came from
[SPEAKER_02]: Now our 32 year old son works in the
industry as our partner on the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what we were thinking But So
we have a now a 2500 square foot license
[SPEAKER_02]: in the county and I have to double what
Brian said about just all the hard work of
[SPEAKER_02]: many people here and I mean Wade and Diana
and we were all working for several years
[SPEAKER_02]: to get to the point we're at now just Just
to where we could take a deep breath and
[SPEAKER_02]: not worry about the sheriff coming down
our road every day I mean that was my
[SPEAKER_02]: incentive was to get rid of that anxiety,
you know, we have different anxieties now
[SPEAKER_02]: But but it's definitely a lot better than
it was Let's see, what was the others
[SPEAKER_02]: other?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anecdote I thought about to back in
Humboldt when we were growing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was just bagweed I mean we planted
walking and Guerrero and seeds that you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, we had left over for years And a
friend of mine knew someone who imported
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani hash into Humboldt County on
fishing boats And he used to pluck seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: out of this hash for years So a friend
asked me anyone try these Afghani seeds is
[SPEAKER_02]: like what is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I had no idea what it was And
the rest is history I mean several years
[SPEAKER_02]: later that all came to Humboldt County and
we are where we are now because of those
[SPEAKER_02]: people who went around the world And found
those strains and brought those seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So have to thank them but again back to
the Cannabis Alliance and the whole thing
[SPEAKER_02]: with the county So many people work so
hard and stuck their faces like out on the
[SPEAKER_02]: line I mean, I think we were both in the
front page of the paper a couple of times
[SPEAKER_02]: right talking to the board all and I have
to give credit to those people.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just a I couldn't even name all
there's like a lot of people that worked
[SPEAKER_02]: hard so I'm glad we are where we are
today, and this is wonderful to see you
[SPEAKER_02]: folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna pass it off to Wade Thank you
Gary Well I'm kind of a rookie in this
[SPEAKER_01]: lineup I started growing in 1996 And I
lived in San Francisco at that point in my
[SPEAKER_01]: life Started growing for my own needs
pretty quickly realized the scale I was
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it was not worth doing and After a
series of steps ended up in a small
[SPEAKER_01]: warehouse in the South of Market area of
San Francisco and worked there for five
[SPEAKER_01]: years And then in 2010 Monica and I
started Monica's my wife here and partner
[SPEAKER_01]: and hero of all sorts of wonderful We
started talking about we wanted to get out
[SPEAKER_01]: of San Francisco and Because we had a lot
of friends up in the Mendocino Humboldt
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went up there and looked around and Not
unlike Gary's sense of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it seemed like it was a one-trick
Pony kind of town if you will that the
[SPEAKER_01]: only thing that was really happening there
a lot of beautiful people But cannabis was
[SPEAKER_01]: all that was going on but meantime here in
Nevada County I think the first time she
[SPEAKER_01]: brought me up here was to the Wild and
Scenic Film Festival, and I was really
[SPEAKER_01]: struck by the kind of people that I saw
and I Was struck by the idea that there
[SPEAKER_01]: were three different live theater groups
with their own performance space in a town
[SPEAKER_01]: of 5,000 people In very few towns in
California of 5,000 people have one
[SPEAKER_01]: theater group, but Nevada City has three
So it told me there was something really
[SPEAKER_01]: special going on here and We came here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bought we rented a place into the
spring of 2011 found our beautiful little
[SPEAKER_01]: farm in the fall there and took possession
in September of 2011 so like I said I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly new to the county, but I have
really come to love this place and the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are here and Yes, I want to
call out the Cannabis Alliance and the
[SPEAKER_01]: work that the Cannabis Alliance has done
But even more specifically I want to call
[SPEAKER_01]: out each of you A thing that has really
bugged me a lot lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sort of straying off of off topic here
is the idea that the court decision known
[SPEAKER_01]: as Roe versus Wade might be getting
overturned by a Supreme Court and it seems
[SPEAKER_01]: impossible to me, but it sounds like
that's what's happening and I'm sure
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of people who feel like
making signs and marching down the street
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe even burning down buildings But I
were to really encourage everyone of you
[SPEAKER_01]: to register to vote if you are not already
registered to vote and vote as Soon as the
[SPEAKER_01]: elections happen vote if everybody in this
country votes We can overturn and make law
[SPEAKER_01]: that protects the privacy of a woman and
her right to choose how her life is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to unfold I Really think this is an
important thing not just for women for all
[SPEAKER_01]: of us, but especially for women.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous that we've come to this
And the only real power that we as
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis people or as human beings in this
country the only real power any of us have
[SPEAKER_01]: is the vote and if enough of us vote we
can make a difference and I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you how to vote just get out and vote
and I'm going to stop there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's politics, and I'm sorry for
straying off, but I really think this is
[SPEAKER_01]: important and if you can part of how
Nevada County came to have the ordinance
[SPEAKER_01]: it does Is if you remember back in 2016 at
January of 2016 the board of supervisors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Created a they passed an urgency emergency
ordinance didn't know there was such a
[SPEAKER_01]: thing but After the vote it became law
right then no period for public review.
[SPEAKER_01]: No nothing and it basically prohibited all
cannabis businesses in Nevada County and
[SPEAKER_01]: We made enough of a noise that they said
okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll put it on the ballot And we were
fortunate that election that was when
[SPEAKER_01]: Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton were
running against each other so a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people voted for that reason a lot of
people voted because The people who became
[SPEAKER_01]: the Nevada County Cannabis Alliance
registered almost 4,000 new voters in
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevada County that year and a lot of those
people turned out and voted and we changed
[SPEAKER_01]: this county with the one power that we
actually have and so Again I I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: stop there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just say this I love the plant I love
what we've done so far in Nevada County
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're trying to change the ordinance
to allow more license types more events
[SPEAKER_01]: like this and again the one power we all
have is the vote and Even if you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: think the system works even if you think
the Democrats are messed up even more than
[SPEAKER_01]: the Republicans or the Republican whatever
You know I don't care about your trip Just
[SPEAKER_01]: vote Because I think if enough of us do
that we'll get the kind of government.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want instead of the circus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had lately Wow,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay I'll close by this I care a lot about
CBD Harlequin House of Harlequin is the
[SPEAKER_01]: business that Monica and I've created with
our partner It's an education platform We
[SPEAKER_01]: want to help people understand about the
benefits the cannabis can offer not just
[SPEAKER_01]: for health but also for economy and for
the well-being of a community like what we
[SPEAKER_01]: have going on right here in Nevada County
and increasingly across Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: California and It is my sense that And I'm
sure I'm slanted this way because of
[SPEAKER_01]: Harlequin Harlequin is a plant I
discovered back in 2008 2009 turned out to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a real special plant got it out to as
many people to as many places as possible
[SPEAKER_01]: for a number of years Since then I've
really been focused on versions of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that are helpful for conditions
like epilepsy childhood epilepsy And I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to say if any of you know Silas a
little boy who has seized for years Silas
[SPEAKER_01]: has been free of seizures since September
which is a really Big deal because he used
[SPEAKER_01]: to have hundreds of seizures a day and now
he has been free of seizures for Going on
[SPEAKER_01]: eight months nine months Yeah,
he's going to school It's a really
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful transformation the whole family
is doing well And I know for a fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis kept that little boy alive To get
to the point that he is now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that cannabis is involved in
him not seizing anymore because I know
[SPEAKER_01]: people Who grew out of having seizures as
children when they entered puberty and
[SPEAKER_01]: became adults?
[SPEAKER_01]: They no longer was seizing that might be
what's happening for Silas But when he was
[SPEAKER_01]: seven and eight years old his parents were
told he wouldn't live to be the age of ten
[SPEAKER_01]: So they should get ready for that and he
is now 13 or 14 years old going to high
[SPEAKER_01]: school Having a normal life the family is
having a normal life.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is huge and that's a small part of
what cannabis can do in the lives of All
[SPEAKER_01]: of us actually I really think that
Cannabis is an essential Nutrient that
[SPEAKER_01]: used to be in our diet because our farm
animals ate it and it was on our farms And
[SPEAKER_01]: it was in our food chain, but not for the
last few generations And I think that what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing here in Nevada County is
getting that going again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're making we're normalizing cannabis
and Helping people understand that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not a dangerous bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually is good and helps us feel good
so I Don't know I think I'm done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll pass it on Thank You Wade you're a
treasure, buddy We're so lucky to have you
[SPEAKER_04]: in our community way Thank you so much
Want to introduce Alan to everybody Alan
[SPEAKER_04]: is owner and founder of obsolete genetics

[SPEAKER_07]: can touch on that Alan Originally for the
Bay Area Got my start a little closer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so got my start in cannabis Because
I like smoking this was maybe just out of
[SPEAKER_07]: high school This was before any kind of
outdoor growing that we knew about This
[SPEAKER_07]: was before indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of my friends had this crazy idea
Let's scale the poles at the parking lot
[SPEAKER_07]: and we'll steal the lights off the parking
lot poles and try and grow cannabis and
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn, it worked, you know So and shortly
after that a couple years later Berkeley
[SPEAKER_07]: indoor garden started up and then we
started having access to actual grow
[SPEAKER_07]: lights and and General hydroponics or you
know, that was about it at the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I Came sorry If anybody can't hear just
raise a hand and I'll speak a little
[SPEAKER_07]: louder or something I've been like 50 dabs
deep so you have to excuse me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Everybody I go walk by they're like
bro.
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta have a dab come over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So which Love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But so anyways, yeah, I came up to this
region originally because I had a
[SPEAKER_07]: four-wheel-drive company and The trails
are up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyways that went from that to
restaurant industry had a barbecue
[SPEAKER_07]: restaurant in town here and None of it was
fulfilling and it wasn't my passion.
[SPEAKER_07]: My calling was I'm actually third
generation of growers out of humble and
[SPEAKER_07]: shelter Cove area and So once I was up
here I was like fell into a good group of
[SPEAKER_07]: local people up here on the ridge They'd
all grew outdoor and I was like,
[SPEAKER_07]: wow, like I've only done indoor and I
didn't know you can grow these giant
[SPEAKER_07]: plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was a long time ago, so but I became
a grower and the passion of loving the
[SPEAKER_07]: plant and I My early history of breeding
was that I my stepfather was a grower and
[SPEAKER_07]: humble I asked for some seeds he gave me
seeds and Then the next year I didn't save
[SPEAKER_07]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't make seeds So I went back and I
said Dean I need some more seeds and he
[SPEAKER_07]: slaps me upside the head and he's all bro
Don't you know that you just have to just
[SPEAKER_07]: make seeds and you can keep growing
everything
[SPEAKER_07]: Next year he showed me how to make seeds
and that was in 1983.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've made seeds for myself and friends
since 1983 pretty much exclusive and You
[SPEAKER_07]: know, this has opened a lot of doors
cannabis is a lot of great people a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: shady people in it too, but I'm really
blessed that I was able to turn this into
[SPEAKER_07]: a way of life and Recently becoming the
director of genetics at a really big
[SPEAKER_07]: company I never saw myself as a cannabis
grower being able to have a 401k But as of
[SPEAKER_07]: this week, I have a 401k, which I don't
even know what it means But you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: I have one now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Yeah, it's definitely good but so the
point being is that you know This is a
[SPEAKER_07]: maturing industry and and we go through
the growing pains obviously through this,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know people We had it good for a long
time and with legalization, it's made it
[SPEAKER_07]: pretty difficult, but I believe there's
still a lot of Opportunity and if you do a
[SPEAKER_07]: good job and you focus inward on yourself
and do the best that you can do For the
[SPEAKER_07]: plant and the plant gives back.
[SPEAKER_07]: So That's a little bit about my history.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Thank you, thank you Thanks,
Alan has awesome little intro Definitely,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know she goes the show you put your
mind to it and you concentrate on
[SPEAKER_04]: something you stick with it and You get
somewhere Let's take it to be a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: more specific about growing and genetics
and and you know details like we talked
[SPEAKER_04]: about how great our community is and Not
to take away from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's also a really important part of why
we're all here but let's talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: about the weather and the growing season
and and what it's like in in some other
[SPEAKER_04]: reasons regions because it sounds Like
everybody all of us have grown in
[SPEAKER_04]: different areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean I've grown on the Central Coast
I've grown in Mendocino County and you
[SPEAKER_04]: know for me, Nevada County is like it's a
breath of fresh air It's like perfect
[SPEAKER_04]: amount of moisture perfect amount of
dryness, you know, yeah the season could
[SPEAKER_04]: be a little bit longer That would be
great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But on the other hand compared to all the
other regions in the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cherry so You know,
one of the things I really love is the
[SPEAKER_04]: fact that We get these long beautiful
Falls so I'll just pass it down the line
[SPEAKER_04]: and everybody just say a couple things of
why they love to grow here and and compare
[SPEAKER_04]: it to maybe some of the other places you
grow you grew and why it seems like
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone's growing here right now,
so What brought you back and keeps you
[SPEAKER_04]: here?
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the best things about growing here
is the Yuba River So if no one here has
[SPEAKER_07]: been to the Yuba River, you got to check
it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of the most beautiful places on
earth Other than that the climate here is
[SPEAKER_07]: it's it's like growing grapes in Napa,
you know, we have a Special micro climate
[SPEAKER_07]: here that just produces incredible
cannabis The weather and late season.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't even know if we have rain
anymore until like December so you don't
[SPEAKER_07]: have to worry about rain and molds and
things like that doesn't seem for at least
[SPEAKER_07]: the last ten years, but Yeah, the
community here that's that grew and Just
[SPEAKER_07]: this this is this country's is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I'm here to grow cannabis
Speaking of micro climates we live on a
[SPEAKER_02]: north slope or they it's actually got a
nickname of little Siberia to the old
[SPEAKER_02]: timers around here So we actually have we
do have problems with powdery mildew that
[SPEAKER_02]: I never used to have when I lived on a
hill where the air drilled away,
[SPEAKER_02]: but in general it is it's just a Perfect
climate and I think it's just gonna get
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree one of the things that's
really lovely about cannabis and really
[SPEAKER_01]: diving into the genetics of cannabis is
Genetics from a place like Afghanistan
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's high elevation and they get ten
inches of rain a year are gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: different They're gonna act differently in
your garden than genetics from place like
[SPEAKER_01]: the cloud forests of Colombia For example
that could tolerate a lot of moisture that
[SPEAKER_01]: like you'd find on the coast of Indocino
Well, what's beautiful about Nevada County
[SPEAKER_01]: to me is depending on what part of the
county you're in you can get completely
[SPEAKER_01]: different Elevations our farm our little
four acre farm where we've done a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: good work over the years Is it about a
thousand meters above sea level and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's places in Nevada County that are
you know a hundred feet above sea level
[SPEAKER_01]: and You're gonna have really different
growing seasons really different
[SPEAKER_01]: Opportunities in those different places
and In my specific case one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited about living in Nevada
County is we were fortunate and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: smart enough to buy a good soil because
there's a lot of good dirt in this county
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you take care of your soil and you
feed it and you know for years our garden
[SPEAKER_01]: got compost and certain Korean natural
farming type amendments and water Never
[SPEAKER_01]: anything on the plant surfaces itself
because we were making medicine We wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to make sure that there was high quality
material free of any contaminants and
[SPEAKER_01]: meantime again The elevation the length of
the season the dryness of the summer the
[SPEAKER_01]: heat in the day the coolness of the nights
Cannabis is very happy here That's my
[SPEAKER_01]: experience and that makes me happy because
I love the plant and when you see them
[SPEAKER_01]: flourish.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful sight
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of breeding way that I know that
you've done a recent project with the guys
[SPEAKER_04]: at Humboldt season I noticed Ben just
walked over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tell us a little bit about tell us a
little bit about that project and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's that's a wonderful thing that's
happened here a couple of years ago a
[SPEAKER_01]: mutual friend between Ben and I said that
you know, you should really consider doing
[SPEAKER_01]: something with these guys and so we sent
over four different cuttings of things
[SPEAKER_01]: that I was working on in the summer of
2018 I think it was and Ben took them in
[SPEAKER_01]: and grew them out and Mothered them and
Then meantime, yeah, we talked about what
[SPEAKER_01]: was going to happen what male we might use
to good and I my interest for years has
[SPEAKER_01]: been primarily CBD and what's called the
minor cannabinoids if you will so Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: we ended up with three different lines
that are almost guaranteed to be
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively high and CBD not much THC at
all and there will be other cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's going to be some really
interesting terpenes and some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, so And I love the model of Humboldt
seed company of getting genetics out to
[SPEAKER_01]: people and let them find the things That
are special for them because we're all
[SPEAKER_01]: different you can take the same plant and
offer it to different people and you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: get different responses to that plant
because our systems are different our
[SPEAKER_01]: needs are different we respond differently
to the cannabis plant and it's my sense
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's important to give people the
opportunity to grow their own and find
[SPEAKER_01]: something that really turns You on really
gets gets your boat going and I got to say
[SPEAKER_01]: if if you're looking for things that are
going to get you high CBD trifecta is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably not the one you're looking for
but if you're looking for something that
[SPEAKER_01]: might help you feel good Help your joints
not ache help your digestion work better
[SPEAKER_01]: help you sleep better at night all of
those things are definitely possible in
[SPEAKER_01]: those mix of seeds and I'm really excited
and pleased that Ben has done all of that
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's It's always been my goal if
you look at what happened with harlequin
[SPEAKER_01]: it was about give it away to as many
people as possible Same thing is happening
[SPEAKER_01]: with the seeds thankfully I'm learning how
to do business And Ben is selling them for
[SPEAKER_01]: us, which is really special.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to say you know after all these
years of giving it away And and the goal
[SPEAKER_01]: there all along was to give it away,
so I'm excited by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to hearing reports
That's awesome Wade.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to hear that you're monetizing
your love for the plant and it's getting
[SPEAKER_04]: back to you and when I heard that you were
working with Ben and Humboldt seeds it
[SPEAKER_04]: made me feel good because I know it's two
great members of the community and just
[SPEAKER_04]: two really class acts and That's one of
the things I love about cannabis is it
[SPEAKER_04]: brings people together gives us
opportunities to collaborate That's one of
[SPEAKER_04]: my favorite things right now is to be able
to collaborate with other people that are
[SPEAKER_04]: like-minded grow genetics and have like a
plan like not just throwing some weed out
[SPEAKER_04]: there and growing it and hope we're gonna
make some money But like with intention
[SPEAKER_04]: and like hey How's this idea sound like
let's grow this strain and do this with it
[SPEAKER_04]: and make this product with it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's gonna help this group of people
and it's gonna be great for this this and
[SPEAKER_04]: this and that's what's pretty awesome
about this plant Thanks for embracing it
[SPEAKER_04]: So Gary I wanted to get a little bit
specific on on your genetics and situation
[SPEAKER_04]: you spoke that you're on the north face
and you know, that's that's makes things a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit more challenging and you know,
we're all faced with different issues when
[SPEAKER_04]: we grow and You know tell us a little bit
what you've learned about genetics and
[SPEAKER_04]: like what works for you and what doesn't
work being on the north face and like
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, like how's that effect when you
start and when you finish and things like
[SPEAKER_04]: that?
[SPEAKER_02]: On our farm we tend to not be in a hurry
to plant I mean, it's like when you see
[SPEAKER_02]: people buying Tomatoes here putting them
out in the first of May It happens every
[SPEAKER_02]: year the people who sell tomato plants do
a really good business in May and June
[SPEAKER_02]: With with the second or third.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's true second or third wave of
tomatoes, but So I usually don't put any
[SPEAKER_02]: full term plan out until about the first
of June I know a lot of people do earlier
[SPEAKER_02]: than that, but that seems to work for us
Every year is just so different here in
[SPEAKER_02]: the fall to you talk about the dry falls I
mean we've had those and we've also had
[SPEAKER_02]: rain knock everything down in August and
So we've gotten really really creative
[SPEAKER_02]: with support.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure everybody out there understands
what I mean And we've started growing
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller we used to grow gigantic plants
and you know being on a ladder when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: 65 working on your plants just doesn't
work So so being compact really working on
[SPEAKER_02]: pruning all that stuff is so important and
we all know that I'm talking preaching to
[SPEAKER_02]: the choir so That's about all I can say
about that Genetics and like everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: else we're trying new stuff all the time I
mean all these folks at this event here
[SPEAKER_02]: the people from finest I didn't see purple
city genetics, but they're great humble
[SPEAKER_02]: seed company is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've tried a little bit from everybody
and It just it's such an evolving thing it
[SPEAKER_02]: in the market is so fickle so just having
all those options out there for people and
[SPEAKER_02]: Working towards what really works on your
own farm is all you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it's a it's a education every year
for me, so Thank you to breeders and
[SPEAKER_02]: people coming up with those genetics that
we can have such great stuff to try now,
[SPEAKER_04]: so Gary this is Alan Alan has a strain
that finishes in 43 days you guys might
[SPEAKER_04]: want to talk Actually though the next
thing I was gonna get to is actually Tell
[SPEAKER_04]: us a little bit about some of the new
strains you're working on Tell us you know
[SPEAKER_04]: your what like really gave you your like
boost into you know people really knowing
[SPEAKER_04]: who obsolete genetics was and and like
gave you your like You know the genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: they like push you into the you know big
big time so to speak So genetics for me
[SPEAKER_07]: have always been like what what I just I
Wanted to always smoke like what I grow
[SPEAKER_07]: and what I breed and a lot of times like
the market dictated something else for
[SPEAKER_07]: many years everybody wanted just like og
gas and I was more into like fruity
[SPEAKER_07]: strains and things that are like sipping
wine or something and So for the very
[SPEAKER_07]: beginning of when I was breeding it wasn't
really successful because everybody they
[SPEAKER_07]: wanted that this was before extracts came
along Extracts came along and changed the
[SPEAKER_07]: game, but the fuel was all that anybody OG
sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it And there was so much That
people were breeding that were all
[SPEAKER_07]: homogenous that were the same and it just
it's it's like taking all the colors on
[SPEAKER_07]: the palette and just wiping them together
and that's what they came up with and a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of breeders that's all they had was
just another copy of another copy of
[SPEAKER_07]: another copy so I Tended to go a different
direction for what I wanted not what
[SPEAKER_07]: everyone else wanted Luckily though that
came around and changed I did a strain
[SPEAKER_07]: called alien Kush some years back,
which was this Las Vegas purple Kush to
[SPEAKER_07]: this Afghani strain that I had got from a
friend who brother came back from
[SPEAKER_07]: Afghanistan and had a handful of seeds and
and They're just a land race Afghan I
[SPEAKER_07]: crossed to this Las Vegas purple cushion
at the time on the forums on the forum
[SPEAKER_07]: boards online There hadn't had no one had
seen anything that had as much frost that
[SPEAKER_07]: early on And that kind of literally just
lit the fire under my ass as being
[SPEAKER_07]: somebody that had something different and
new and fresh Other than that what really
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of pushed me further up into I don't
know how to say it but the orange cookies
[SPEAKER_07]: basically Became famous because of the
jungle boys who are a big grower out of
[SPEAKER_07]: Los Angeles and they were doing a lot of
promotions and we had this opening night
[SPEAKER_07]: where we did an orange cookie tasting and
this was the first time we'd seen like
[SPEAKER_07]: people like lined up for blocks long in
downtown LA to come to this This tasting
[SPEAKER_07]: because it was so hyped online.
[SPEAKER_07]: So What began after that is like this
height almost like I can't say all
[SPEAKER_07]: breeders But a lot of breeders were just
chasing the next thing that people wanted
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's I don't think it was necessarily
something that they were passionate about
[SPEAKER_07]: it was just more of like a money grab so
to speak because when the price of
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis started to crash a lot of people
stopped growing cannabis and jumped into
[SPEAKER_07]: The extract game like they're all of a
sudden now we have millions of extractors
[SPEAKER_07]: You know everybody converted from being a
grower to an extractor and then from that
[SPEAKER_07]: that market got flooded and then the next
thing was everybody became seed breeders
[SPEAKER_07]: and So you had a lot of people that were
buying a pack of seeds from a breeder
[SPEAKER_07]: doesn't matter what breeder but now That
one pack of seeds has created a brand new
[SPEAKER_07]: company and so they really didn't do a lot
of their own work They furthered someone
[SPEAKER_07]: else's work and that's where I say that
everything became Homogeneous because they
[SPEAKER_07]: were using the same shit that everybody
else was using It's tough now and if you
[SPEAKER_07]: really want to make a living you almost
have to find yourself Chasing what it is
[SPEAKER_07]: the market wants currently.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's purple rock hard Smells like gelato.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's the only thing that sells
right now So if you're on at the mercy of
[SPEAKER_07]: the market and you're not vertically
integrated you have to chase what that in
[SPEAKER_07]: flavor is that's dictated by people in New
York or you know some rap star or
[SPEAKER_07]: something so but I Still do what I like to
do because I just hate falling into just
[SPEAKER_07]: doing the same thing that everybody else
wants to do I do flavors that are people
[SPEAKER_07]: like oh That's that's like Jack or
something like yeah, but I like it,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know So that's why I do it because
it's what I like and what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to smoke and I just like flavors
too like I probably have 200 jars of fresh
[SPEAKER_07]: wheat at home all different flavors and
And it never gets old every day with
[SPEAKER_07]: dinner popping in different jars like
sipping wine, you know That's what
[SPEAKER_07]: genetics are to me is like the the variety
and and stuff that you know, obviously is
[SPEAKER_07]: different I do like the new stuff that
everybody likes the gelato purple stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it's pleasing, but it gets boring.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty much What genetics are to
me as far as you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on currently?
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to work for STEEZY and gonna be
doing their entire palette of genetics I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: excited because I don't have to fall into
just one category to breed for or to feed
[SPEAKER_07]: a hunt for so they have a They want
anything and everything as long as it's
[SPEAKER_07]: good so it it's it's nice to be able to
finally break out of these these like
[SPEAKER_07]: lanes that you have to stay in to be a
super successful breeder these days and
[SPEAKER_07]: and just chasing that one flavor and by
the time a lot of people get this flavor
[SPEAKER_07]: it changes and then you're you're behind
the gun again, so I Think that the flavors
[SPEAKER_07]: are the spice of life and I'm not gonna
find myself just hunting one thing because
[SPEAKER_07]: Some rap star says that's what everybody
should be smoking
[SPEAKER_04]: Gelato That's funny I was just thinking
when he was talking that I was gonna bring
[SPEAKER_04]: up that you know, and I think gelato is a
great strain There's some great things
[SPEAKER_04]: about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I'm seeing right now in cannabis
is like Everyone's complaining that things
[SPEAKER_04]: aren't selling and the prices are down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people are like changing the way that
they grow to a cheaper way and maybe using
[SPEAKER_04]: not as good ingredients and And now what
we have right now is a huge amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: mediocrity So like how many people can
grow a gelato cross with Athena and then
[SPEAKER_04]: wonder why it doesn't sell Let's mix it up
a little people So just recently I had the
[SPEAKER_07]: pleasure of judging flowers at the ego
clash which meant that I had to smoke 30
[SPEAKER_07]: joints within an hour and judge this stuff
and It was brutal, but it got to the point
[SPEAKER_07]: where you know, we everyone that was
judging also had entered I could not pick
[SPEAKER_07]: out my own weed because I grew for what
the market was demanding some lemon cherry
[SPEAKER_07]: gelato Every of all 30 there was only one
that stood out different Everything else
[SPEAKER_07]: was some kind of a gelato.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like one big Pool that everybody
just threw their butts in and that all
[SPEAKER_07]: came out The same like we sat around the
table and like could you recognize your
[SPEAKER_07]: weed and like none of us could it was all
the same So there's definitely a need for
[SPEAKER_04]: some something to change Yep, so if you're
looking for a quick easy scheme growing
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you are even just want to have
longevity in cannabis you got to really
[SPEAKER_04]: think outside the box you got to mix it up
you got a you know, the thing that all the
[SPEAKER_04]: gentlemen here are just saying that really
resonates is that they're doing it for
[SPEAKER_04]: their love for the love of the plant and
They're doing it for the right reasons
[SPEAKER_04]: like like Alan was saying like there's
these guys who breed to try to like get
[SPEAKER_04]: ahead of the curve and And think that what
are people gonna like next year,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know sure as a business You got to
have that in mind but on the other hand if
[SPEAKER_04]: you really love cannabis and you really
want To like take it to the next level you
[SPEAKER_04]: got to diversify yourself and not
necessarily Do what you think that clout
[SPEAKER_04]: is and do what you thinks right and go
with your heart so, you know follow follow
[SPEAKER_04]: your passion and You know, I think the
people right now who are struggling in
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis are probably the ones who are the
most passionate about it It makes it hard,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I think if everybody just you know
sticks sticks with it Don't let it bring
[SPEAKER_04]: you down because push comes to shove
Someday if people are gonna realize that
[SPEAKER_04]: you know the difference between craft
cannabis is gonna be like the difference
[SPEAKER_04]: between Budweiser and craft beers,
so I'm not a huge beer drinker So I'm not
[SPEAKER_04]: even sure if that analogy is great But I
think there is I think there is a big
[SPEAKER_04]: differentiation and I think that when when
that you know when people realize the
[SPEAKER_04]: difference between A good beer and you
know, of course like it opens some minds
[SPEAKER_04]: and cannabis right now the way the way I
see it is You know, it's such a new
[SPEAKER_04]: industry and it's so new to like the
public and people walk into dispensary and
[SPEAKER_04]: they're just like What I can go buy
cannabis on the shelf and there's all
[SPEAKER_04]: these cannabis products and it's just kind
of like so wild that they're not quite In
[SPEAKER_04]: the mindset where they are like when they
go grocery shopping.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I feel like that's one of the Things I
personally want as one of my missions and
[SPEAKER_04]: if you know who I am, you know You know,
I like I'm pretty true to it is like
[SPEAKER_04]: convincing people that using the right
ingredients growing organically It is like
[SPEAKER_04]: really important because number one it
brings out what the plant has to offer
[SPEAKER_04]: number two It's better for the environment
number three.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not supporting Some you know huge
chemical industry that is going to be the
[SPEAKER_04]: downfall of our planet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So You know be mindful of your purchases
and be mindful of how you grow So I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: want to talk too much because I'm a
moderator.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Let's let's pass the mic and other
things I was thinking about on my list of
[SPEAKER_04]: questions If you were to pick another
place other than Nevada County to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: where would that be and why?
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably Rogue River or Humboldt somewhere
Yeah, just north anywhere north.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like south.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like north I'm gonna decline to state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna stay right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've got it made here Yeah,
I tend to go with Gary I traveled the
[SPEAKER_01]: world quite a bit when I was younger and
This is a special spot if I had to be
[SPEAKER_01]: something else might be Spain Because they
have a pretty good cannabis thing going
[SPEAKER_01]: and some really beautiful people But yeah,
I'm kind of with Gary this is this is the
[SPEAKER_07]: winner for me Right here in Nevada County
Well, I guess it's unanimous Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're all pretty blessed and
whatever it was that attracted us all to
[SPEAKER_04]: this great area and great community,
you know We're lucky we're blessed and it
[SPEAKER_04]: seems like everyone feels like they're
putting roots in and I think long-term
[SPEAKER_04]: Nevada County is gonna make make a serious
impression on California kind of how Napa
[SPEAKER_04]: and Sonoma did in the wine thing,
you know I feel like we're the underdog
[SPEAKER_04]: because people think of outdoor cannabis
and they think of Humboldt and Mendocino
[SPEAKER_04]: until they see our flowers and then they
like whoa so You know, I'm not sure if
[SPEAKER_04]: anybody else has anything they would like
to talk about But I feel like we've
[SPEAKER_04]: covered a lot and we've got a great bunch
of people here growing in Nevada County.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel honored Yeah, that's a good great
idea Alan let's open up the Field to some
[SPEAKER_04]: questions anybody out there have a
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to show throw at any of these
gentlemen
[SPEAKER_04]: Time oil, yeah, I have some I Mean for
botrytis I think you know One of the most
[SPEAKER_04]: important things you could do early on is
getting a really good microbial population
[SPEAKER_04]: in the soil Regalia is our great product
to prevent it Armory is also has like six
[SPEAKER_04]: or seven species of Baxillus
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not familiar with that one,
but
[SPEAKER_04]: Time oil isn't necessarily a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just got to be careful that it because
it could be phytotoxic it could cause
[SPEAKER_04]: phytotoxicity so Yeah, I was gonna say
even like the first week of flower Get an
[SPEAKER_04]: application in keep the rate low so you
don't have it on there the oil on there
[SPEAKER_04]: like in the hot Sun just Turning into a
magnifying glass making it you know worse
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the moisture is definitely always a
challenge Yeah Yeah The other thing is do
[SPEAKER_04]: a little research you know there's some
strains that are more botrytis resistant
[SPEAKER_04]: than others Because you know I've seen
I've seen in the same garden one strain
[SPEAKER_04]: have it and one not so That's one of my
suggestions you guys have any luck
[SPEAKER_07]: A friend of mine up here his good friend
that he went to college with his director
[SPEAKER_07]: of operations We're at a park at a
barbecue, and I brought some nuggets,
[SPEAKER_07]: and he's like oh my god.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to show these to Jay so He told us
he said Jay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got this guy that does genetics,
so they vetted me came looked at my
[SPEAKER_07]: history and and Came at me with a good
offer so shrine group yeah All
[SPEAKER_07]: right probably have my genetics in there
very soon Goes to show flowers opens doors
[SPEAKER_04]: go ahead sir
[SPEAKER_07]: So the orange was an old-school it was
called orange juice it came out of
[SPEAKER_07]: Garberville my mom was a bartender in
Garberville and my stepfather was a
[SPEAKER_07]: gorilla grower up in that area and In high
school I went there, and I said you know I
[SPEAKER_07]: need some I need some seeds Dean that was
my stepfather and he gave me these Orange
[SPEAKER_07]: juice seeds and then so which I think is
probably California orange bud Or what
[SPEAKER_07]: became California orange, but that was I
think orange, but was pretty prevalent in
[SPEAKER_07]: humble in that period so I had those seeds
for years and years and years and then I
[SPEAKER_07]: got the forum Girl Scout cookies and at
the time I was like wow this is some great
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff you know so one thing led to another
I popped some of the the orange juice bud
[SPEAKER_07]: seeds and and I had a few strains at the
time and I put that on the the Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_07]: cookies and Man it turned out phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know it's just one of those things it
was kind of an accident, but it I mean it
[SPEAKER_07]: was It was an accident, but it wasn't an
accident I don't know how to explain that
[SPEAKER_07]: you know like it turned out because a lot
of times You can put two good things
[SPEAKER_07]: together and think that they're gonna
create magic and they don't they just
[SPEAKER_07]: don't and then that's like having you know
Two ugly people that have a beautiful baby
[SPEAKER_07]: or like vice versa you know two hot people
come together and the baby's but ugly you
[SPEAKER_07]: know like and no grandma ever says like oh
that kid's ugly they're always like oh my
[SPEAKER_07]: grandkids the greatest kid in the world so
But anyway, so Yeah, that was orange
[SPEAKER_07]: cookies In a nutshell so to speak So
obviously you had intention for what it to
[SPEAKER_04]: be but you know when you breed you never
know what the outcome is and That's that's
[SPEAKER_04]: one of the things that keeps us all going
is like the excitement of it all As far as
[SPEAKER_07]: breeding that goes like yeah You don't
know the outcome, but in years and years
[SPEAKER_07]: of experience you can start estimating
what the outcome will be closer and closer
[SPEAKER_07]: so It is it's it's kind of art,
and it's also kind of science,
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's a little bit luck There's
heartache and tears like especially if you
[SPEAKER_07]: start doing feminized pollen The the
success rates low at first and you spend
[SPEAKER_07]: months like flowering things out and then
wow you get no seeds out of it so and it's
[SPEAKER_07]: it's a Room filled with you know 40
different plants, and there's not enough
[SPEAKER_07]: to make a pound of anything so you you Go
broke real fast trying to be a breeder But
[SPEAKER_07]: you know and it just take it was a big
leap of faith because I did flowers to you
[SPEAKER_07]: know like most people in the White market
now they started somewhere whatever we do
[SPEAKER_07]: we all did we grew flowers and out in the
field in the greenhouse indoor to put a
[SPEAKER_07]: roof over our head and our meal on the
table But it was a it was pretty scary
[SPEAKER_07]: when I decided to stop growing flower and
just do seed only and I'm glad I did it
[SPEAKER_07]: because It just opens so many more
flavors, and that's really what I love
[SPEAKER_07]: about the plant in the first place is just
being able to Understand it better through
[SPEAKER_07]: this breeding process and seeing how the
the progeny come out from What you think
[SPEAKER_07]: is going to be good and then when it
doesn't come out you just have these high
[SPEAKER_07]: hopes And you're like why didn't it work?
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I go the opposite direction and
reverse this one or try some different
[SPEAKER_07]: pollen, but it it takes years of watching
the plant and and doing a having a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: failure to breed in order to figure out
what really works and and What will be
[SPEAKER_07]: desirable not only for you, but hopefully
the the community accepts it well,
[SPEAKER_01]: too Wanted to add on what Alan was saying
just a minute ago about what works for you
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think that's part of how you
find something unique It's not just that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's different than the other things that
you've experienced Or looked at or played
[SPEAKER_01]: with but that it like for me There's been
I don't know half dozen times in my
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding where a specific plant Really
called out to me really spoke to me loud
[SPEAKER_01]: and clear pay attention work with me And I
think that's some of what Alan's referring
[SPEAKER_01]: to that there's something within you that
responds to that plant And I do think
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a back-and-forth communication if
we are open to it and I think Nevada
[SPEAKER_01]: County is the kind of place where folks
are open to that kind of conversation
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was gonna say that sparked a word
that popped into my mind the intuition of
[SPEAKER_04]: a grower and of a breeder and Like having
that connection with a plant is a pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: special thing and not everybody has that
but if you do have that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's Pretty amazing feeling when you have
that connection and and when things work
[SPEAKER_04]: out how you expected it Any other
questions out there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, let's let's all give a just quick
couple seconds about that Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously everybody always wants to have
that, you know conversation with people I
[SPEAKER_04]: really love og strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love sour diesel OG's definitely like
something that really resonated with me
[SPEAKER_04]: always and still does in fact I'm growing
a bunch of og this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like the world we need to bring og
back There's no disrespect to gelato,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we've got to break it up a little bit
And then way back I used to grow a couple
[SPEAKER_04]: strains that took a really long time and I
haven't grown them in a long time But I've
[SPEAKER_04]: been really getting the urge the DS.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if anybody remembers that it
was Colombian Hayes people called it the
[SPEAKER_04]: dog shit or the dreadlock strain and it
took a it took like 10-12 weeks to flower
[SPEAKER_04]: but it had a super unique nose like really
pungent and And then I at the same time
[SPEAKER_04]: when I was growing that strain I grew the
cough which is the nl5 crossed with the
[SPEAKER_04]: Hayes and that took around the same amount
of time and Amazing flower like it was
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty popular in this area for a little
while Some of us people have been around a
[SPEAKER_04]: little while remember the days of the
cough You know used to be able to like
[SPEAKER_04]: grow a plant in a 15 gallon pot and it
would take you know three months four
[SPEAKER_04]: months to grow at four months,
I guess and But you know you get so much
[SPEAKER_04]: flower and back then it was like so unique
and there wasn't a whole lot of people
[SPEAKER_04]: growing Hayes's then and So I feel like I
need to get back to some of those things
[SPEAKER_04]: I've definitely experimented with all
kinds of stuff growing lots of cookies
[SPEAKER_04]: lots of gelato skittles and all those
things and they're fun, but OG and Hayes's
[SPEAKER_04]: are definitely something that reaches
Something special in a bone inside of me
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd say the the one thing that marked me
For life was Malawi gold, which is a was a
[SPEAKER_07]: African land race that took 145 days
indoor to flower It looked terrible,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it got you so freaking high it was
that it was like being on the verge of
[SPEAKER_07]: starting a mushroom trip and It had this
really distinctive grated carrot smell
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than that the the chem-dog D when it
first came to Northern, California just
[SPEAKER_07]: like rock It's like most potent shit ever
and smell like some old bum sock or
[SPEAKER_07]: something but The worst the description of
the strain the better it is to smoke so
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah, those are my two I've got some
older cherry pie, and I just love the
[SPEAKER_02]: cherry pie man That's just got to the
turps on that just are just like I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: eat it So I keep that one going and then
I'm a sucker for old-school blue dream I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean blue dream just the way It grows you
know it's just seems spindly and like
[SPEAKER_02]: you're thinking well I'm gonna pull those
plants and the next thing you know they're
[SPEAKER_02]: just ginormous And it's just a great
smoke, too, so those are mine,
[SPEAKER_01]: too Well back in the days when I smoked
flower I Had a cultivar called genius that
[SPEAKER_01]: was pretty popular, and I enjoyed smoking
it and it was very intense High experience
[SPEAKER_01]: down in the Bay Area like you Alan Then
started working with what's now known as
[SPEAKER_01]: the pre-98 Baba Kush And then when I
started making hash seriously Tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: make a living growing sour diesel indoors
because it makes such great hash Glossy
[SPEAKER_01]: black beautiful anyway So nowadays yeah,
I all of the the currently popular flower
[SPEAKER_01]: types I mostly again look for the
extractions and the The hash or rosin
[SPEAKER_01]: that's made from them, and I don't have a
specific particular fully favorite flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: there I recently tried some strawberry
banana Rosin that was very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also like the fruity things and long
answer here, but I'm A chatty guy
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously I like the CBD strains Harlequin
for tonight one Maddy Hayes AC DC some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the others don't try and grow AC DC in
Nevada County It's not good here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much better on the Mendocino Coast
Tell me this though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a cross that's AC DC and Blueberry
from DJ short he calls it rosaberry,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I thought that one grows great here,
but it's just a it's a half-and-half cross
[SPEAKER_04]: so Those sound very interesting gentlemen
anybody else have any questions
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure we'll share Yes, sir
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a hundred percent organic always as as
most people know about me I own vital
[SPEAKER_04]: garden supply, so I recommend using arse
fertilizers I'll pass the mic down the
[SPEAKER_04]: line so I don't look like I'm doing too
much of a commercial here I Use a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: vital earth products, but I also use a lot
of other stuff too No bad chemicals,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I do like some of the production stuff
is done with rockwool and salts just
[SPEAKER_07]: because it's just it's Brainless simple it
works, and it's just for productions not
[SPEAKER_07]: for smoking or anything like that Yeah,
I if there's a way to grow I've been I've
[SPEAKER_07]: done it like bury a body in the ground and
bear grow over that I've done it like you
[SPEAKER_07]: know my grandfather used to bury a dead
cat and a dog Doberman venture and an
[SPEAKER_07]: apple tree grew like crazy, so I figured
it's got to work, so We're totally organic
[SPEAKER_02]: here, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We plant in the ground our foothill soil
are you from up here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah up here it you know our soil mostly
came from decomposed granite So if you
[SPEAKER_02]: just don't add organic matter or a good
compost to it In a couple of years you've
[SPEAKER_02]: got like sand so I always Organic compost
every year I top dress with that and I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know if you guys sell us or not But
there's a compressed chicken pellet that
[SPEAKER_02]: Stutzman makes two three four something
like that sort of low potency,
[SPEAKER_02]: but Yeah, very similar, but but low you
know not heavy on the fertilizer at all
[SPEAKER_02]: just just what they need and What else do
we use up here?
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a oyster shell lime and soft rock
phosphate
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm no longer a production farmer
it's what I'm going to say is a lot easier
[SPEAKER_01]: to achieve but Because I have always grown
cannabis for making medicine I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: make my own inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to buy things because Like
one of my favorite lines is what does
[SPEAKER_01]: inert ingredients mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right you're going to spray that on a
plant that you're going to make oil from
[SPEAKER_01]: and give it to a child no, so I do a lot I
Lactobacillus cultures KNF IMO one and two
[SPEAKER_01]: is mostly what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't gotten into three and four yet
Because I get such good results with those
[SPEAKER_01]: And those and again the soil here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have red clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no longer red It's dark dark
beautiful brown soil in our garden because
[SPEAKER_01]: for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've just added layers of compost and
mulch Occasional worm castings cover crops
[SPEAKER_01]: top and drop more mulch that kind of thing
making a lasagna bed Where when you take a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and plug it into a spot in the
ground?
[SPEAKER_01]: Its roots will find this the layer in the
soil that works for that plant And then
[SPEAKER_01]: they take off and they they will literally
make a net That ends up a net of roots in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil that ends up being as big as the
plant is above the soil and so For years,
[SPEAKER_01]: we haven't tilled our garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just do the things I just described and
so once in a while will add Azomite You
[SPEAKER_01]: know to supplement some minor minerals
that our soil is somewhat deficient in a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil tests several times say our our
particular soil is
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's a wrap.
[SPEAKER_04]: They say the best fertilizer is the
farmer's shadow
