[SPEAKER_05]: I was really fascinated by the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just threw down about five sentences
on pest management this morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you made reference to a couple of
different ferments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wonder if you would take the time to
review with me those ferments,
[SPEAKER_05]: what specifically you were doing as these
ferments.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe if you feel like you've got the
bandwidth and time to dig in a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: to what is the thinking in your approach
in using these preparations for pest
[SPEAKER_05]: management.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not actually ferments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the first little caveat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Korean natural farming is all about
fermentation and collecting indigenous
[SPEAKER_02]: microorganisms from your forest floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Master Cho created this farming system,
and it works really well, but it is very
[SPEAKER_02]: much a system that you need all the pieces
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also for human health as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the things in KNF are meant to keep
your body healthy as well as your food
[SPEAKER_02]: crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I love putting it on my
plants, because it's really nice to use
[SPEAKER_02]: something in your crops and your farm that
you're using on your body as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just a really beautiful synergy to
it that I just respond really well to.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only caveat to that is there are no
pesticides because you wouldn't put a
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticide in your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of goes against traditional
Korean natural farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Master Cho's son came along and he took
his dad's work and he said, this is
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for some areas, there needs to be
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he started taking industrial,
and I could be a little bit off on this
[SPEAKER_02]: because the Jadam book that I have is in
Spanish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought the wrong one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is Master Cho's book the One Straw
Revolution?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's a different person.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's amazing too, but he's more of like a
do nothing farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some similar ideologies to it,
but different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Master Cho's son created another type
of very low cost agricultural farming but
[SPEAKER_02]: more of a scaled up version, and it
includes pesticides, and it's Jadam,
[SPEAKER_02]: J-A-D-A-M.
[SPEAKER_02]: So KNF stands for Korean Natural Farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe Jadam has something that it
stands for as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also called extreme low cost
agriculture, something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be that in Korean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the Jadam, most of those processes I
don't really use.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does a lot of it's called JLF,
Jadam Liquid Fertilizer, where you pick
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever weeds you want, you toss them in
a bucket, you fill it with water,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you let it sit there and stagnate and
kind of rot for like six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very stinky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much if you farm, you've done it on
accident where you dump out a bucket and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like, oh god, that's horrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: What did I leave in that bucket six months
ago?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think those were weeds at one point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I don't really do that,
but the pesticide application that he does
[SPEAKER_02]: is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first part is a wetting agent at
JWA, Jadam Wetting Agent, and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: basically a castile soap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you're doing is you're really
making your own soap.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're using potassium hydroxide,
you use water, and you use canola oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gets extremely hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you go through the book, he gives you
the ratios.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have them off the top of my head,
but I can email them to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's almost like you're making
biodiesel.
[SPEAKER_05]: A little flavor of that going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically you have a little bit of
water, you add your potassium hydroxide,
[SPEAKER_02]: it gets hot, and then you start slowly
pouring in your canola oil, and then you
[SPEAKER_02]: use a paddle mixer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the thing with making soap normally is
that you're using a lye process to create
[SPEAKER_02]: the heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what this gentleman did was he said,
I want to be able to make a wetting agent,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I want to make it economical and I
want to make it that somebody can do
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And using lye is very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what can we do and how do we do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did over a hundred experiments to
get the ratios right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, it's all about the paddle
mixer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you take a cordless drill with a paint
paddle mixer, and you get down into it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you start stirring it, and it starts
getting hotter and hotter and hotter,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it gets up to 180 degrees or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're sweating, it's kind of brutal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you take your paddle mixer out
when it gets to a certain consistency,
[SPEAKER_02]: like thick mayonnaise.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the wetting agent that you're
making.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, keep going, this is beautiful,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you take your paddle mixer out and
you let it set for about three days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over the course of three days,
the heat starts to dissipate and it gets
[SPEAKER_02]: thick and it turns into like a block of
soap, basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Floating on top of some water and
glycerin.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's solid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is like solid all the way through.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not solid-solid, but it's like,
you know, it's like lard, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like lard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you add the rest of your water to
turn it into a liquid soap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just basically add your water and
you stir it and you stir it and you let it
[SPEAKER_02]: set for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually it all dissolves and you
have this amazing, beautiful liquid soap
[SPEAKER_02]: that you can use as a soap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you also use it as a wetting agent for
the plants so that you can have your,
[SPEAKER_02]: your water tension is broken, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So your pesticides will stay on your leaf
surface better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we figured out that this thing,
I made a, I took a pickle barrel and I
[SPEAKER_02]: made about 48 gallons of liquid soap.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to ask.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't do things small.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figure if it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth doing at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cost was less than a dollar per
gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was just like, this is, I mean,
phenomenally economical.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is a soap one could use for
laundry, for example, or washing one's
[SPEAKER_05]: body.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's now my dish soap and my hand soap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put different essential oils in it for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have it as just, it's most of
it's still in the pickle barrel,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then I have a bunch of gallon reused
gallon jugs that I can siphon it into.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it goes out to the farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the specificity of actually making
your own wetting agent.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a specific question about the
wetting agent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it have, I know that some wetting
agents, for example, in mild dilution in
[SPEAKER_05]: water can be effective against small
bodied insects with no additional input,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a level of you using it in that
context as well as perhaps other materials
[SPEAKER_05]: that you might mix into a water solution
to make a spray.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and so it's exactly what you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, one of the guys that I've been
working with that, you know, we're trying
[SPEAKER_02]: different things and different farms and
different areas and coming back together
[SPEAKER_02]: with our data to see what's working,
what's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he used just the JWA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just the wetting agent with seawater at
full strength with ocean water,
[SPEAKER_02]: ocean water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're making me so happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ocean water is all your
micronutrients, all of your minerals,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, generally that's used at a one to 30
dilution, but he was just going full on
[SPEAKER_02]: ocean water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I, I'd have to look at my notes and
see what he did for the ratios of the JWA.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he found that that alone as a
preventative was effective enough that he
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't need to add anything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is prophylactic use basically
before, before insects become an issue
[SPEAKER_05]: before the pest is a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're, uh, and it, it occurs to me that
in addition to, um, some activity that is
[SPEAKER_05]: likely again, hard on a soft bodied
insects, there's something going on with
[SPEAKER_05]: stimulating the plants ability to deal
with pests potentially and, or making the
[SPEAKER_05]: plant less attractive to pests.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a fair statement as well?
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you say?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would imagine so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't actually know for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that would be, but I mean,
I can imagine that, yeah, if you're making
[SPEAKER_02]: the surface of the leaf, you know,
less attractive because yeah, there's soap
[SPEAKER_02]: on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's, it's going to be a more
difficult situation for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, one of the things I was going
towards in my question there is it's my
[SPEAKER_05]: understanding that plants that are
stressed due to overwatering, for example,
[SPEAKER_05]: put off a signature in a light frequency
that maybe we can't see, but.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thrips see really well when they're in
their life stage of flying about,
[SPEAKER_05]: they see this blow.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's that's gravy train right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so part of, part of the approach that
I've taken in pest management and part of
[SPEAKER_05]: why I'm interested in this conversation
with you is, uh, it seems really clear to
[SPEAKER_05]: me that a lot, what we're doing is,
is enhancing the plants ability to deal
[SPEAKER_05]: with these creatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then our allies in the garden,
other plant bugs, that might love these
[SPEAKER_05]: bugs for food there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are there to help us, but it's so
anytime that you are taking an approach
[SPEAKER_05]: of, I'm just going to kill everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've really set yourself back a long
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is 100% correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when a plant is stressed or sick,
it sends out a signal that is visible to
[SPEAKER_02]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they'll continue to put out the
pheromones that this is the one we're
[SPEAKER_02]: eating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we think is happening is that it
has to do with the fact that sick plants
[SPEAKER_02]: have a hard time building their cellulose
layers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it gets thinner, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's thinner, it's actually putting
out a different signature of, of
[SPEAKER_02]: wavelength of color and light that we
don't necessarily notice, but the bugs are
[SPEAKER_02]: very drawn to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it's, it's, I mean, it's really
fascinating stuff when you get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the basics, what I was talking
about earlier too, was that, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: ideally, you have a plant that is strong
enough that it fends it off without any of
[SPEAKER_02]: this extra stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, that comes down into soil health
and that comes into the base of Korean
[SPEAKER_02]: natural farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's this whole 80 20 principle and
everything that we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you put into one thing can be 80% of
the difference of, of what that,
[SPEAKER_02]: of, of what am I trying to say?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's a, so if you take like
Korean natural farming and take it as a
[SPEAKER_02]: system, so 100%, there's one part of it
that is going to be 80% of the,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, the, the aspect that you see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one part of your entire system has 80%
of the effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the case of Korean natural farming,
if you do one thing in Korean natural
[SPEAKER_02]: farming and only one thing, if you only
do, um, like an OHN, which is like my
[SPEAKER_02]: second favorite, my favorite input.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Oriental Herbal Nutrient, fabulous for
human health.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: OHN Oriental Herbal Nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's basically a tincture that's
comprised of angelica, garlic,
[SPEAKER_02]: ginger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk a little slower or nutrient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so angelica, garlic, ginger,
cinnamon, and, um, what am I missing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Licorice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes three months to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do a fermentation of that one first.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the one you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ferment for a week first, and then you
start tincturing it with vodka and you end
[SPEAKER_02]: up with this warm, amazing, um,
liquor that is just like, I take about a
[SPEAKER_02]: half an ounce a day if I'm getting sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise I just take a little sip off of
it every now and then, but it's also your
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of your, your immune booster for your
plants as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I love that and it's a great
product, but that, as well as all the
[SPEAKER_02]: other ferments and all the other extracts
and all the other components that you do,
[SPEAKER_02]: that only makes up about 20% of what's
effective in KNF.
[SPEAKER_02]: 80% of the efficacy of this system is the
indigenous microorganisms that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting and adding to your soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the thing everybody does last.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the hardest ones to nail
correctly, but once you get it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just, like, I mean, I had a lemon
cucumber that I pulled over 200 cucumbers
[SPEAKER_02]: off of this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're prolific plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but this was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like, this is absolutely nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: After two years of treating my soil with
IMO, it was, I mean, the tomatoes were,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was, it was insane how much food went
to waste on my garden because I couldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: get to it to harvest it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so indigenous microorganisms,
um, I call those inoculations.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not, I'm not reformally trained in all
this, but I, a lot of it just made sense
[SPEAKER_05]: to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I do is, uh, cook some white
rice, put it in a wooden box.
[SPEAKER_05]: And specifically as it applies to
cannabis, for example, if I have a whole
[SPEAKER_05]: row of cuttings, if I'm doing a production
garden, for example, and I've got a whole
[SPEAKER_05]: row of cuttings, they're all the same
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you look at them, typically they're
not all the same, even though they are the
[SPEAKER_05]: same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them, clearly usually are doing
better than others.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I usually do is I would go to one
of the ones that's really flourishing and
[SPEAKER_05]: basically take an inoculation,
a cultivation of what's going on in the
[SPEAKER_05]: biology of the soil right underneath that
specific plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then spread that to the other
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do see benefit from that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that basically what you're talking
about?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is a version of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: A version of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A version of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the idea of, and we've totally
gotten off subject of pesticides,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get back to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, well this, the health of the plants,
the health of the plants and the soil
[SPEAKER_05]: really contributes to that pest management
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is like, you know, the basics.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have the healthy plant,
you don't need the pesticides as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can use it as a preventative now
and then when you think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you don't have infestations,
it's easier to just avoid that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so when you're going out into the
forest and you start like lifting up the
[SPEAKER_02]: litter and you start looking, you'll
eventually start finding areas that are
[SPEAKER_02]: really rich in mycelium.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll see all that white, beautiful
running, you know, mycelium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where you want to set your,
that same box, exactly what you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: there, but put it there instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after anywhere from, and this is where
it starts getting a little like touchy
[SPEAKER_02]: after anywhere from like five days to 13
days, depending on your weather and
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity and where it is and all of that,
it'll culture that whole box.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get all these beautiful colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get colors, but a lot of the white
fluffy is what you're really wanting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we always have color in ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always a little bit of orange and
a little bit of yellow and a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: green and a little bit of this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you take that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you want to do is you want to
create a shelf stable product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to add it one to one with
brown, with sugar, ideally demerara or raw
[SPEAKER_02]: sugar, but brown sugar works fine too.
[SPEAKER_05]: One to one by weight.
[SPEAKER_05]: As versus molasses that's on sulfur,
for example, molasses is not good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why is we're not looking
for a sugar content on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking for the, what the sugar does
is it actually draws all the water out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you've done is through the
osmotic pressure of the sugar,
[SPEAKER_02]: removing the water, the microbes then are
basically dehydrated and they go dormant
[SPEAKER_05]: and shelf stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're shelf stable for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you have all of those indigenous
microorganisms that were thriving in that
[SPEAKER_02]: area, in that condition with that
temperature and that humidity and that
[SPEAKER_02]: time of year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have now encapsulated them on your
shelf to be utilized when you need to
[SPEAKER_02]: later.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the sugar you're going about equal
amounts, one to one volume wise,
[SPEAKER_02]: by weight, by weight, by weight,
not volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what you, what you're really
going after is doing this from a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: different spaces.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the lot on the land.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: On your land, every season, ideally 500
feet elevation above where you're growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd have to go to somebody else's land
to pull that one off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, I don't, I mean, what I love
about this approach that what you just
[SPEAKER_05]: described is you are capturing the biology
that is working on your land that is
[SPEAKER_05]: flourishing on your soil in the,
in the soil you have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it seems to me you're, you're
basically helping nature to bridge into
[SPEAKER_05]: your garden or any place you're using this
preparation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause a lot of times our garden soils are
very heavy on the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're usually in fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been, you know, disturbed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got, you know, primary growth,
but not a lot of like secondary or
[SPEAKER_02]: tertiary growth going on because we don't
do it in the forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're taking that fungally
dominant forest litter, which we know is
[SPEAKER_02]: so rich in humic acid and just all that
great stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And whatever the biology is that's living
in there at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then if you have, you know,
a bunch of different IMO to collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm a one is when it's with the rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: IMO two is when you add it to the brown
sugar and then you make something called
[SPEAKER_02]: IMO three.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you do a third and then you can go four
and then you can go five as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And number three, you're taking a bunch of
your different twos.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would take something from my spring
collection, something from my summer
[SPEAKER_02]: collection, something from fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've yet to pull off a winter one,
but someday I will.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll have that in there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, if you have, you know,
as your collection builds, you can start
[SPEAKER_02]: using more and more and more of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you're inoculating a carbon and
carbohydrate source.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're using wood chips and a grain
usually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're making a bigger pile and you're
keeping it low in heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not composting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to keep it below 130 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're flipping it a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're turning it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll see that that fungal mycelium
starts interweaving all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now you have, what's called IMO
two, three, pardon me, which also can be
[SPEAKER_02]: stored longer term once it's finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's now encapsulating all of those
different fungal collections that you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not just one kind that's dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got a huge diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you take that to your garden and
you spread that out and you can,
[SPEAKER_02]: your IMO four is the same thing,
but then you're adding soil from your
[SPEAKER_02]: garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's the biology is really ready
for exactly the soil that it's going to go
[SPEAKER_02]: into.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can do IMO five, which is
adding a nitrogen source.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can add that to a manure or
something and you can make it go much
[SPEAKER_02]: further.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what the idea here, right,
is you've added all this diversity to the
[SPEAKER_02]: garden soils, which means that no matter
what's going on in the weather and the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground, you have some type of fungal
microbe that is super duper happy in those
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions, which means your soil is
always going to be fungally dominant,
[SPEAKER_02]: which means that all of the crops that we
grow, except for the brassicas,
[SPEAKER_02]: prefer a fungally dominant soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your weeds die back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have, I mean, I've had crazy like
bindweed that gets covered in powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew climbing up like a cucumber,
which should have powdery mildew and
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like no problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had grasses that are really,
really difficult to deal with usually that
[SPEAKER_02]: will sprout and then just like fall over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that implies that some plants don't
like that environment and they happen to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a lot of the ones you don't want.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and it really has to, again,
coming back to nature, when you see a
[SPEAKER_02]: disturbed area, the first things to go
there and be really happy in that area are
[SPEAKER_02]: your grasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are plants that prefer
bacterially dominant soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the food crops that we eat and our
cannabis and our trees and all of this
[SPEAKER_02]: prefer a fungally dominant soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're, they don't, you know,
the two of them together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you start getting your fungal
dominance up your weeds, just,
[SPEAKER_02]: they just don't do well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't communicate as well with the
fungi like in a forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have less weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got less problems with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, brassicas are different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have an area now that's like my
brassicas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a brassica area that I don't treat
with any of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You use manures there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't use anything there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of ignore it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the best brassica grower, honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it, but it's just like,
I'm like, huh, I actually pulled off some
[SPEAKER_02]: really good cauliflower for the first time
ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so you have your indigenous
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got already a stronger,
healthier plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now all of that being said, um,
when you talk with like Chris Trump,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's just like, well, that's all you
really need.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need the, you know, the
pesticides because you don't have those
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing with cannabis that often other
farmers don't understand and why we see
[SPEAKER_02]: all these hemp fields, you know,
declining and not doing well is because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're thinking of it like a normal plant
where, you know, okay, if I have corn,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got cornea worm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's basically all I really have to
think about and deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I've got cabbage, it's a cabbage
looper, maybe some aphids, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything loves cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like every bug in the world loves
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it eats a plant, it's going to eat weed
and it's going to be really happy there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we get into this problem of sometimes,
you know, having healthy soil is not
[SPEAKER_02]: enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then what do we do?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we love the idea of putting out
beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love the idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: The green lacewing cards are phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes care of the majority of your
pests, but you know, now you invite all
[SPEAKER_02]: your friends over from the Dempure
Collective and everybody walks through
[SPEAKER_02]: without thinking about the fact that they,
you know, walked in their own garden that
[SPEAKER_02]: morning and now everybody has all the bugs
that everybody else has.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely a thing that happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, you know, I love the idea that,
or the ability that I have now to show off
[SPEAKER_02]: my farm, but I also do recognize the fact
that, you know, more than likely that's
[SPEAKER_02]: where a lot of our pest problems come
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other farms have this amazing cutting of
this crazy cultivar that everybody wants
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm going to gift it to you,
but I didn't scope it and it's got russet
[SPEAKER_02]: mites.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now you have russet mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have russet mites.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You love to share bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you do when you figure out that
you're like, oh, shoot, I wasn't scouting
[SPEAKER_02]: properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't pay attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I have russet mites and I can see
them with my visible eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we have a serious problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't afford to cut down my cash
crop and burn it and start over because my
[SPEAKER_02]: season doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is when pesticides come in,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is when your traditional farmer turns
to Eagle 20 or avid or fluoromite or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever the other crazy gnarly chemicals
are because they can't afford to do
[SPEAKER_02]: anything else or so they think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do we as natural farmers do when
we're at this problem?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, a lot of people just,
they're like, oh, I bought 500 million
[SPEAKER_02]: ladybugs and releasing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all flew away in three days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the ones that stayed pooped all
over my weed and now I can't sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where we kind of really got
deep into the JDOM and into like,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's got to be better solutions and
there has to be ways that we can do this
[SPEAKER_02]: economically.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some products that are available
that work really well, but they're just,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're ridiculously expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the JWA we talked about, that's your
writing agent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does work pretty well on its own
somewhat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like for the soft body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the aphids, you know,
but the hop aphid or the, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: what might be the hop aphid or the
cannabis aphid, whichever varietal it is
[SPEAKER_02]: now, that particular one just breeds so
damn fast that even as you're killing it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's hard to keep ahead of it with
just JWA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we bring in the other two
solutions that I love.
[SPEAKER_02]: So JDOM sulfur solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's made similarly to the wedding agent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, it does work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have the, that's usually made
with lime to create the heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with the sulfur that you buy
on the market nowadays is that because of
[SPEAKER_02]: the process that is used, it takes it from
its elemental sulfur farm into,
[SPEAKER_02]: if I'm understanding correctly,
and again, it's in Spanish, so I might be
[SPEAKER_02]: totally butchering the translations,
but if I'm understanding correctly,
[SPEAKER_02]: the process that it goes through,
that industrial ag uses to create these
[SPEAKER_02]: wettable sulfur powders and these liquid
sulfur agents, right, changes the form of
[SPEAKER_02]: sulfur.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it actually can cause resistance in
pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you have superbugs that are
resistant to your sulfur because
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunately, as cannabis growers,
most of us don't have horticultural
[SPEAKER_02]: backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not trained in how to use these
products correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't use them at the right ratios or
the right timeframes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, just like what we saw
with spider mites in the late 90s,
[SPEAKER_02]: early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're breeding bugs that are resistant to
the tolls we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy spider mites that were like next to
impossible to get rid of, which is why the
[SPEAKER_02]: fluoromite of the world got really
popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this sulfur solution, it's not doing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're creating, you're doing it yourself
and and it's using, oh my gosh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm totally blanking on the recipe now
because I've only done it once.
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate, and this is the information's
out there, right online.
[SPEAKER_02]: The recipe is there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, this is the JDAM sulfur
solution.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: J.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: J.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: J.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: JDAM sulfur.
[SPEAKER_05]: So J.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: J.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the great thing about all of this
stuff is that like, you know, you use it
[SPEAKER_02]: at such dilution dilute ratios that you
can make it once and and then it's shelf
[SPEAKER_02]: stable forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, like I said, like, why not make 50
gallons of wetting agent?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you'll use it eventually and it
doesn't go bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So JDAM sulfur, same thing like you use it
at very dilute ratios.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's it's it just it works super well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm loving it super well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of the fact that it stays in
its elemental form somewhat, as far as I
[SPEAKER_02]: understand, the bugs are not able to
create the resistance to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day, if you have a heavy
infestation, an hour before sunset is the
[SPEAKER_02]: time that's I think that the book says
that you can use it any time you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, I'm not going to spray anything on
my plants in the heat of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's just it's going to be problematic
and it's going to dry up super fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I might as well spray it when the sun's
going down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enough light that I can see enough
humidity in the air that it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: dissipate too fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I mean, we I didn't do it every
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did every other day for two weeks,
which was probably a bit of overkill.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I saw no stress in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no phytotoxicity going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest of mites that we had were I
actually didn't do it with just the JWA
[SPEAKER_02]: and JS.
[SPEAKER_02]: I added the JHS, which is the third
component.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so that's JDAM herbal solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, JHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one that you can get really
creative with.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a hundred.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another book out there called A
Hundred Herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's the other JDAM book.
[SPEAKER_02]: The JDAM book is orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is green and is impossible to
find.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he lists the hundred herbs that he
recommends for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them happen to be herbs that are
like in Korea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I can't get Korean pasque flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really wanting to use that anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Jerusalem artichoke was like I
mean, just it's easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy to process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's I mean, this this whole the way
you do this super, super simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're putting it in a pressure cooker or
a crock pot and you're just basically
[SPEAKER_02]: cooking it for eight hours on high heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you end up with is all those
chemical compounds that have been
[SPEAKER_02]: extracted out into your water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're adding it to your other
solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just this amazing trifecta of I
mean, we had a hemp cultivator in Colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: that used a garlic, I think, JHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a fan of that one, but because
probably because I like garlic and why
[SPEAKER_02]: would I waste it on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but you can do it with like hot
peppers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it with garlic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it with ginkgo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ginkgo leaves, the Jerusalem
artichoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we went off script and used
California Bay Laurel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do need to talk with Chris because
he says that I have something wrong in my
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also know that Korea doesn't have
California Bay laurels.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have laurel trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this wasn't something that they had
access to to to trial out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but I might be missing something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll find out soon what that is.
[SPEAKER_05]: This person, Chris, his last name was Hunt
Trump Trump.
[SPEAKER_02]: No relation.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he has a bunch of YouTube videos on
how to make the Korean natural farming
[SPEAKER_02]: inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nuances and there are really key
aspects that are missing in those videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched them all and like did this for a
year and was just like, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it totally wrong?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it was good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you would view the JHS damn book,
the orange one you mentioned, as sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: the authoritative description of these
various preparations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, the only thing he's missing in
that book, as far as I know so far,
[SPEAKER_02]: is he does not mention personal protective
gear, PPE.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're you know, so the first time
we started doing we open the potassium
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroxide and it like kind of,
you know, has some dust and we're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, we have goggles and we have gloves
and we have, you know, hoodies and long
[SPEAKER_02]: sleeves, but we didn't think about a dust
mask.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it became really apparent in about 10
seconds that we had to go get a dust mask.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the same thing with the JADAM sulfur.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't tell you, like, you know,
really gear yourself up because the stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: gets hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is noxious.
[SPEAKER_02]: These aren't pleasant things to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the JHS also, that was my first one
with JADAM was the herbal solution that I
[SPEAKER_02]: did myself out of the Bayloral.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the interesting thing, I did a bunch of
research first and I'm like, there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: compound called eugenol that's contained
in cloves and in Bayloral.
[SPEAKER_02]: And clove is one of the compounds that is
recommended in the JADAM book.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, OK, well, if the eugenol is
the actual property that is pesticidal,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's in our Baylorals as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be about the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I picked a ton of leaves and I put them
in the crack pot and I weighted it down
[SPEAKER_02]: with these rocks and I let it cook.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was inside the house.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a bad choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: After about 20 minutes, you could not go
inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the very air would like just set off
all the mucous membranes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my nose was running, my eyes were
watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: It worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much worse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like really highly concentrated Bayloral
smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you take those leaves and crush
them, it's a very strong, almost mentholy
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very strong smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the eugenol.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now imagine that you took four
pounds of these leaves and started cooking
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I decided I was like, this isn't going
to fly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to move this thing outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got my extension cord and my pressure
cooker is an instant pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's electric.
[SPEAKER_02]: They work great, don't they?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to buy a new one because this one's
fairly ruined now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I picked it up and I took it outside
and I set it down and the little steam
[SPEAKER_02]: vent bit and one little tiny drip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had only been in there for maybe
half an hour, landed right there on my
[SPEAKER_02]: cheek.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just plug this in and you know,
and it's outside now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started trying to plug the pot back
in and I was trying to push the buttons
[SPEAKER_02]: and all of a sudden I was like,
oh my God, it's burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh my God, it's really
burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to drop everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not from temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not from heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to, from the essential oils that
were in that bay leaf that were now
[SPEAKER_02]: extracted into the water that just flipped
up out of the little steam vent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was my first like, yeah,
protective gear is going to be really
[SPEAKER_02]: essential.
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't land in your eye.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm super grateful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I dropped everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like washed my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: I washed my face again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I started thinking about,
oh my God, okay, this was oil based.
[SPEAKER_02]: So should I get the baking soda or the
baking powder or do I grab a cucumber or
[SPEAKER_02]: is it milk?
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point I was like getting a
little distressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't quite think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just ended up like using tech new,
I think it was and washing it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that seemed to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good at cutting oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the closest thing in my bathroom
that I could think of to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, but it was interesting because you
know, half an hour was all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now after eight hours, it's pretty
potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pulling the rocks out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at this point I'm, I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've have like my respirator and I've got
big, huge kitchen gloves on and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the protective eyeglasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which have holes in the bottom of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I guess they want you to not fog up
or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm sitting there like,
okay, I'm totally ready this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started pouring it into the jars
because this is another one that's shelf
[SPEAKER_02]: stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you pour it all the way up and you seal
it while it's really hot, it'll self seal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to pressure cook it or hot
water bath it or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can, you know, use it much
later down the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm pouring it in and it's just like,
I was having the worst time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the scent was so strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, it was like absolutely burning
my eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, it was, I was very impressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point I was like, okay,
this what, I don't even know if this is
[SPEAKER_02]: right or not, but this is an impressive,
like if I was a bug, I would not want that
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere near me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So great story about how important
personal protective beer can be.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: At least one more, if you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really appreciating this information.
[SPEAKER_05]: The JWA, as a wetting agent, I'm
imagining, you know, you've made 50
[SPEAKER_05]: gallons of this soap.
[SPEAKER_05]: You only need, what, a teaspoon of it in a
gallon?
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of drops in a gallon to make a
spray?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there seems to be, there's a,
in the Jadam book, he actually talks about
[SPEAKER_02]: infestation rates and dilution rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're just using it as a wetting
agent preventatively, it's very dilute.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I believe it's like somewhere the
one to 100 or one to 50.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, like an ounce to a gallon,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even that much.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, maybe about that much,
I guess, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be 128 to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just doing that math too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh, so it might even be less
than the one to 100.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, but as a prophylactic,
I could see it being pretty small.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very little.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as you increase in pest pressure and
infestation, his recommended dosage goes
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the same thing with the JHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we found, so the first time I tried it,
I didn't have the JWA yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I had was JHS and I just tried it on
my infested brassicas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some type of aphid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not good at aphid ID.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know that it's the fuzzy looking
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was covering my kale.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was super bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, all right, well,
let's check this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to start it at a very dilute
ratio because having known what that
[SPEAKER_02]: splatter was like, I just don't think I
need a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did it at one to 100.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, I mean, it was very
impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had about a 60% mortality with one
spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I came back the next day and I was
like, that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's see, let's, you know,
crank it up a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think the next one I did was a
one to 50 ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also had spider mites at that time
on my violas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the JHS without the JWA.
[SPEAKER_02]: No JWA.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't use any wetting agent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't use the Jamsul for none of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the second spray at the one to 50
on the aphids killed everything it
[SPEAKER_02]: touched.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was some aphids that was,
it was a curly kale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were like, some of them were
tucked up in it and didn't do anything to
[SPEAKER_02]: those ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, it was just, it was,
it was really crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The spider mites on the violas,
it didn't work on those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it maybe did a little bit,
but not so significantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so effective as it was with the
aphids.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at that point then a friend was coming
over and we're like, let's make JWA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And neither, neither of us had done it
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're like, we're going to make like,
you know, a hundred gallons.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to take 50 with him and I'll
have my 50 here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when that was done, I went back and
tried that with the JHS on the spider
[SPEAKER_02]: mites again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was something happened again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I don't know if I'm super
impressed with that yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point, then we were talking
with Tina who was, who was adding J S the
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamsul for, and she had recitamides and
all she had was the Jamsul for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started communicating and she was
like, okay, I'm going to make the JWA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to make the JHS and I'm
going to do it with garlic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's what I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think she did chili peppers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so she did the three of them and
together within, I think it was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was a very short period of time,
like two weeks, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was just like, we have full
eradication.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is like, it's, it's killing
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another friend of ours was also doing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did the California Bay Laurel JHS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Ginkgo, but I don't really recall
for sure if he used that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the JS and the JWA, he used them
at much higher concentrations than we had
[SPEAKER_02]: done and found that his plants didn't
suffer at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, he had pretty much eradication
of the, of the recitamides.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is so spectacular for something you
can make on your farm and pennies per
[SPEAKER_02]: gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, once it's diluted, it's,
I mean, it's just, it's phenomenally
[SPEAKER_02]: economical.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love that it is the, you know,
that you're not going to have to be
[SPEAKER_05]: concerned about residual breakdown
products that you might with some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: store bought products that you might think
are going to be a better answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really, I'm really struck by the,
the description you've given me this
[SPEAKER_05]: evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me too, like a big part of it is
especially with cannabis in California and
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of the States, the testing is so
regulated that like, I might buy something
[SPEAKER_02]: that says that it's, you know,
clove oil and Rosemary and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: all these wonderful little natural things,
but then they slide pyrethrins in because
[SPEAKER_02]: it works really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they maybe they're like, Oh,
it's, maybe you don't know that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: chrysanthemum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you read it and you think you're
okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe they just don't even say it on
the label.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I'm making it myself, I know
what's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know exactly if I know the plant and if
I know the, what I'm extracting,
[SPEAKER_02]: what I'm extracting out of it,
I know that I can use eugenol because
[SPEAKER_02]: clove oil is acceptable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that I'm good to go on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oleander.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know what the active
ingredient that's pesticidal in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I chrysanthemum is one of them that is
recommended.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I cannot use that because I know
that's pyrethrin and I know that's
[SPEAKER_02]: restricted.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you know what your restrictions are
and you, you know, go through these herbs
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know that like capsaicin is your
effective ingredient in hot peppers,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that that's okay to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this becomes something that I have full
control over everything I'm doing on my
[SPEAKER_02]: farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making it myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no secondary guesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: People like, how do you know you're going
to pass pesticides?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I know, I know because I made it
and if I didn't put it in it, it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really love also that you, uh,
in, in taking on using these preparations,
[SPEAKER_05]: you first started off with crops that
maybe not so valuable to you as starting
[SPEAKER_05]: right off with your cannabis, uh,
which, um, much respect for the wisdom of
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I am, uh, grateful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, I'm going to find out more about JDM
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, like I said, I'd like to educate
myself a little more fully on the things
[SPEAKER_05]: that I've already been doing in some ways,
mostly because for myself, I, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: like I said, I've done some reading,
but really in sitting in the garden and
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to understand what I'm seeing and
what's going on there, I keep coming back
[SPEAKER_05]: to their, the, that the plants that are
here can provide the answers to the
[SPEAKER_05]: problems or questions that I have is
simply me being open to them telling me
[SPEAKER_05]: what to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you, it's all funny to go there,
but it does happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I 100% agree that there's the,
there's a, you know, I mean, like you can
[SPEAKER_02]: teach processes to people, but you can't
teach that communication.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't teach.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's funny to me to meet people
that, you know, they're like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I can't tell what's wrong with that
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, you can't tell that that's a
zinc deficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, I just, you know,
I mean, I, you see all the marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: magazines now that have all the pictures
of things that I'm like, Oh, that was your
[SPEAKER_02]: ad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't see the pH imbalance that's
showing with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, it's just rampant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen, there's no farming industry out
there where like people don't know what
[SPEAKER_03]: they're doing the way that there is with
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of it is that there,
there isn't that communication.
[SPEAKER_02]: There isn't that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like, you know, if you're a really
good weed farmer, you're out there like
[SPEAKER_02]: just chilling with your plants all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just, you see the things that are
there so much faster and you're in,
[SPEAKER_02]: and again, like, I don't know for me,
just taking it to that spirituality level
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's like you're outside where it's
meant to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're, you're in this space where
there's, there is poly culture and there
[SPEAKER_02]: are those other things going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes they're indicator plants
where you're just like, Ooh, you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: look good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that you're a delicate little,
whatever you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you're not looking good,
you guys are probably not feeling so good
[SPEAKER_02]: either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I know how to treat everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that one of the things you
mentioned is a concept of banker plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Love that whole principle as a way of just
being aware.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's, I've come to realize that
actually there's plants that one can use
[SPEAKER_05]: to see what the state of the soil is,
moisture content in the soil, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_05]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: In addition to the benefits that can
happen for cover cropping or all of the
[SPEAKER_05]: other reasons to have other plants in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if that made any sense at
all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, it did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to know which ones they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't feel like we have much
trouble with moisture content.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've just got great soil that deals with
things really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, like things that would show
wilting first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a friend who has a nursery,
a commercial nursery, gifted me some seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: recently.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I am ashamed to say that I don't
remember what he called them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he says that they really like being in
the shade of a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And meantime, they will droop,
do that droop thing before your cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: plants do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because by the time your cannabis plants
are drooping, you've gone a little too
[SPEAKER_05]: long.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not happy about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've hurt the roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, you can water them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll perk right back up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anticipating the needs without having
to, you know, every four times a day,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're down on your hands and knees
digging in the dirt, making sure
[SPEAKER_05]: everything's still good because it's
really hot today.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a breeze.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have to say, honestly, part of what
I'm loving about this, not just the
[SPEAKER_05]: decrease in the cost and the knowing what
you've got that you're putting on your
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's just the involvement,
the extent to which you're there gathering
[SPEAKER_05]: those bay leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're there measuring out those various
materials you're putting into this mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're there holding that variable speed
drill, running this paddle mixer,
[SPEAKER_05]: dealing with the smell and knowing that
what you're doing is going to be enhancing
[SPEAKER_05]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to me, this is where intention comes
into our work and the importance of who
[SPEAKER_05]: you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the integrity you bring to what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got to say, that's so lovely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at you tying that whole conversation
into one of the key words of today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love and intention.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was talking about intention in
their own groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
