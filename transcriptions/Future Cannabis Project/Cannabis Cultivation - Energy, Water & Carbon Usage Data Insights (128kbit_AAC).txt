[SPEAKER_06]: So the first poll we had was do we think
that greenhouses are using less energy
[SPEAKER_06]: than indoor cultivation facilities and we
see that a That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about just slightly over half.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so The next one that we're gonna
have is about light Higher lighting watts
[SPEAKER_06]: per square foot correlates to higher PPFD
higher light received by the the plant
[SPEAKER_06]: canopy and The last one more light equals
more yield greater yield Okay,
[SPEAKER_06]: about two-thirds disagree with that one,
oh no 70 70 percent, okay Thanks for
[SPEAKER_06]: coming and I'm gonna let Nick introduce
himself and just take it away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that okay?
[SPEAKER_08]: That was quite the setup because it sounds
like I have all the answers which I do not
[SPEAKER_08]: In these questions, of course,
it's all it's all dependent right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are these greenhouses etc,
etc?
[SPEAKER_08]: So the data I'm going to present is a set
of data.
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't necessarily represent
everything But it is based off of a
[SPEAKER_08]: minimum of one year's worth of 15-minute
electrical electric interval data monthly
[SPEAKER_08]: fossil fuel consumption if they consume
fossil fuel and a year's worth of
[SPEAKER_08]: production data in terms of dry usable
products So it's a decent data set.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll start with that So how much energy is
used in cannabis cultivation facilities is
[SPEAKER_08]: the first question I ask and so this is a
plot of What we have found in a recent
[SPEAKER_08]: study So, what do we see annual energy
consumption along the bottom the x-axis
[SPEAKER_08]: and that's all fuels Annual production on
the y-axis and then again, that's dry
[SPEAKER_08]: usable product and we see wow really tight
correlation here right R squared at 0.96
[SPEAKER_08]: people familiar with R squared values what
that essentially means it basically means
[SPEAKER_08]: that the Dependent variable how much
production you make is incredibly tied to
[SPEAKER_08]: how much fuel you consume So the 0.96
means that there's an extremely strong
[SPEAKER_08]: correlation between these two things So
maybe that's not too exciting or profound
[SPEAKER_08]: in and of itself Until you consider that
this data set includes indoor mixed light
[SPEAKER_08]: brand new construction retrofit a couple
thousand Square feet up to over 30,000
[SPEAKER_08]: square feet fossil fuel heat electric heat
and vertical stacking so all of that is
[SPEAKER_08]: represented in this data set and yet we
still have this incredibly tight
[SPEAKER_08]: correlation between Total energy
consumption and total facility
[SPEAKER_08]: productivity that to me is pretty
interesting and not necessarily what we
[SPEAKER_08]: expected going into this So what is
driving that energy use Well, we find that
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a pretty strong correlation
between the lighting power density and the
[SPEAKER_08]: total fuel consumption on the y-axis So we
go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so lighting power density is driving
consumption of energy to an extent at
[SPEAKER_08]: these facilities All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what's what's the deal with lighting
power density?
[SPEAKER_08]: How does that impact production?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is odd Why is our production
going down as our flower room lighting
[SPEAKER_08]: power density goes up?
[SPEAKER_08]: What we are finding here That is not
reflected But we know from the project
[SPEAKER_08]: details is the facilities with higher
lighting power densities had the fixtures
[SPEAKER_08]: mounted way up high So they had to mount
way more fixtures in order to get the PPFD
[SPEAKER_08]: that they're looking for at the canopy the
facilities with the lower lighting power
[SPEAKER_08]: densities Not only did they have lower
overall annual energy use but they had
[SPEAKER_08]: better more consistent PPFD I say better
more uniform PPFD across the canopy So
[SPEAKER_08]: again not something that we would have
necessarily expected to see here But
[SPEAKER_08]: lighting power density PPFD they're
related, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_08]: The poll says no people didn't think so
and That is reflected in the data as well,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So lighting power density and PPFD not
related again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's how you're mounting these fixtures So
right away this tells me that we've got
[SPEAKER_08]: some issues in terms of lighting design in
these facilities There's something we can
[SPEAKER_08]: do right off the bat just by changing the
layout of the existing fixtures to improve
[SPEAKER_08]: the light delivery in these facilities But
PPFD and production those are related,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Surely there's a correlation between PPFD
that everybody wants so badly and
[SPEAKER_08]: production No, there isn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: What the what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, you can see that we've got PPFD
values down around 700 and those
[SPEAKER_08]: facilities are still producing on the
order of 350 grams per square foot of
[SPEAKER_08]: flowering canopy Then we have facilities
all the way out at what is that like 1100
[SPEAKER_08]: PPFD that are making About half of that,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So what is this?
[SPEAKER_08]: What do we learn here?
[SPEAKER_08]: What does this tell us?
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it mean that PPFD is not important?
[SPEAKER_08]: No It means that it's not everything
exactly, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So what remains if it's if it's not PPFD
What else is it?
[SPEAKER_08]: What remains?
[SPEAKER_08]: What is what is driving the production in
these facilities?
[SPEAKER_08]: If I hear them, yeah, we are co2 What else
did you say Nadia co2 temperature?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah genetics Yep, how about just
cultivator skill?
[SPEAKER_08]: Right because we saw multiple facilities
in this data set that were all but
[SPEAKER_08]: identical on paper HVAC systems basically
the same lightings basically the same PPFD
[SPEAKER_08]: is basically the same One one facilities
literally producing double the output of
[SPEAKER_08]: the other facility So to me there's a lot
to be learned in terms of best practices
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivation techniques And then what are
those strains specific?
[SPEAKER_08]: impacts on energy and energy efficiency So
this is food for thought, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: This doesn't necessarily give us all the
answers and it's definitely not something
[SPEAKER_08]: that we could extrapolate out nationally
to every single facility But this is a
[SPEAKER_08]: solid data set that we have, you know,
very carefully reviewed and analyzed and
[SPEAKER_08]: there's not much to interpret here You
know, this is not based off of modeling.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just straight-up utility data and
production data So, how is the energy used
[SPEAKER_08]: this one's gonna be fun I think Indoor
what percent of indoor energy Use do you
[SPEAKER_08]: think is associated with lighting
horticultural lighting just yell out some
[SPEAKER_08]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I Didn't hear any of us I heard 40 60 All
right What about that That seems like a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot doesn't it we were surprised by this.
[SPEAKER_08]: This was more than we had anticipated for
these facilities Natural gas use really
[SPEAKER_08]: quite low that's a little bit influenced
by the fact that some of these facilities
[SPEAKER_08]: are all electric heat But nonetheless
large component they're associated with
[SPEAKER_08]: the lighting So again, how can we ignore
lighting as an element of facility
[SPEAKER_08]: efficiency?
[SPEAKER_08]: When it's responsible for around 70% of
the total energy consumption And this is
[SPEAKER_08]: one of the things that we use we're
talking to cultivators to go look You may
[SPEAKER_08]: or may not be into LED just yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: But how can we not at least have the
conversation?
[SPEAKER_08]: With this sort of result.
[SPEAKER_08]: What about greenhouses?
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody want to take some guesses?
[SPEAKER_08]: On what the split of energy consumption in
a greenhouse might be?
[SPEAKER_08]: HVAC How about this so substantially less
energy use to lighting right because we're
[SPEAKER_08]: supplementing natural light and A heck of
a lot more energy use on the heating in
[SPEAKER_08]: the fuel side So that first question that
we asked which was our greenhouses
[SPEAKER_08]: substantially more efficient or do they
use substantially less energy than indoor?
[SPEAKER_08]: Not in this data set what we found in this
data set was when you consider All fuels
[SPEAKER_08]: they are within about 10% of each other in
terms of total energy use And also
[SPEAKER_08]: relative to production because we're kind
of looking at everything relative to
[SPEAKER_08]: production as a metric to normalize to So
this is not necessarily agree with a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: of the national literature on the subject
But again, this is not speculative.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is very straightforward simple data
and analysis that we've done here So this
[SPEAKER_08]: for this data set, you know, we are
extremely Confident that these are the
[SPEAKER_08]: numbers and again, this helps us focus on
well, what do we look at?
[SPEAKER_08]: What are we trying to do at a given
facility?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we trying to impact its carbon
footprint?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we trying to reduce energy?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're trying to save energy costs because
while natural gas might be a big
[SPEAKER_08]: percentage of your cost of your
consumption In this particular location at
[SPEAKER_08]: least it's a fraction of their operating
costs They're still spending way more on
[SPEAKER_08]: electricity than they are on fuel So a
little food for thought as we proceed In
[SPEAKER_08]: terms of what is the data actually showing
us and how do we improve our understanding
[SPEAKER_08]: of these facilities?
[SPEAKER_08]: And in my opinion, it's through more data,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't really figure out what's going on
here until we look more carefully until we
[SPEAKER_08]: get more data And as Derek said,
you know, the power score was extremely
[SPEAKER_08]: helpful as we reviewed this data set And
the more data that we can get into power
[SPEAKER_08]: score the more that people are publishing
and sharing this data We can really start
[SPEAKER_08]: to understand what is going on these
facilities and how do we better optimize
[SPEAKER_08]: these facilities?
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is a picture from my daughter's
theater last year We did Alice in
[SPEAKER_08]: Wonderland and I just thought it was a
pretty picture to end with so I'll leave
[SPEAKER_08]: it right there Thank you
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, thanks Nick, so we're gonna
have one more poll now for Brian's
[SPEAKER_06]: presentation, but I was wrong I thought
that more light equals more yield So if
[SPEAKER_06]: you were wrong about any of those,
I would encourage you to stand up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, please anybody I know that some
of you are wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on join join us.
[SPEAKER_06]: You learned something Yeah, okay All
right.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the next poll So what do you think
is a bigger factor in the climate impact
[SPEAKER_06]: of cultivation?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it the amount of energy used in a
cultivation facility or is it the
[SPEAKER_06]: electrical grid mix and the fuels that
they choose to use on site?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's looking at about 80 20 so 80% of
folks are Choosing that the grid mix and
[SPEAKER_06]: the fuels that you choose are gonna make a
bigger impact on your climate footprint of
[SPEAKER_06]: a facility So with that, I'm gonna have
Brian join us and have his presentation
[SPEAKER_06]: brought up
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank You Gretchen Brian jungers senior
manager at e source, which is a Boulder,
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado company used to be part of Rocky
Mountain Institute back in the 1980s and
[SPEAKER_05]: 90s and then spun off and we've been our
own entity since then but we really focus
[SPEAKER_05]: on utilities and their customers and
energy efficiency demand side management
[SPEAKER_05]: Renewables and distribute energy
resources.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm gonna quickly blaze through a
little bit history on The data and the
[SPEAKER_05]: analysis of energy and climate impacts
some of the backlash from that talk about
[SPEAKER_05]: the elephant in the room Evan Mills as
John Morris mentioned earlier I get into
[SPEAKER_05]: him a little bit and then talk about on
the aggregate what what's going on In the
[SPEAKER_05]: public record, what do we know or think we
kind of know about the overall total
[SPEAKER_05]: impacts of this industry and give you some
key takeaways from my perspective So who
[SPEAKER_05]: read up and smoke the 2012 study back in
the day?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a good number of people it was
really groundbreaking because there wasn't
[SPEAKER_05]: anything in you know, the The intellectual
literature on this industry yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had been behind closed doors black
market and Evan Mills And and Scott's
[SPEAKER_05]: Robbie came out and did a detailed careful
analysis based on a very limited amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: actual monitored data from These
residential grow facilities in Mendocino
[SPEAKER_05]: County and they came up with these numbers
Which there was a lot of pushback from the
[SPEAKER_05]: regulated industry saying these numbers
are inflated.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not representative But the reality
is that no one actually came and
[SPEAKER_05]: replicated their study, you know down to
the to the line item and so they were
[SPEAKER_05]: never really refuted and this It was
intended as a call to action to say hey,
[SPEAKER_05]: we need to regulate this industry We need
to have policies in place.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the energy efficiency is incentivized.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to help growers be as efficient as
possible So it was a fairly Benign noble
[SPEAKER_05]: intention to start but it led to this
really kind of crazy media frenzy,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Did everybody see that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Three of these these are real Headline
articles and three of these are from the
[SPEAKER_05]: last six months So this is not by any
means over and almost every article that
[SPEAKER_05]: comes out quote seven Mills and his 2012
study And they also often refer to the
[SPEAKER_05]: fact that the city of Denver About three
or four percent of Denver's energy use is
[SPEAKER_05]: for the cannabis industry And so I wanted
to dig into that a little bit But first I
[SPEAKER_05]: wanted to let you all know Mills is not
done.
[SPEAKER_05]: He recently sent out a draft of a chapter
that he intends to publish in a book about
[SPEAKER_05]: policy or a collection of papers and I Got
news for y'all.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not any better than his 2012 study.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, it's much worse He does not do
any new detailed engineering analysis or
[SPEAKER_05]: energy analysis He points to other
analyses including one that I assisted
[SPEAKER_05]: with from new frontier data and our AI
saying that they're not rigorous enough
[SPEAKER_05]: that they lack intellectual rigor he
essentially says that greenhouses are just
[SPEAKER_05]: as bad as Fully indoor grows and and that
all growing should be done outdoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are optimizing the suboptimal And that
it's it's outdoor cultivation or bust.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing else is really acceptable I have
lots of issues with this and I could talk
[SPEAKER_05]: for half the day about every issue I have
with this but essentially Evan is is
[SPEAKER_05]: becoming something of a sensationalist
with with this piece in particular.
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't really give any Consideration
of industrial conventional agriculture as
[SPEAKER_05]: a baseline He only compares to residential
and commercial building use not to
[SPEAKER_05]: industrial which industrial and
conventional ag are much better benchmarks
[SPEAKER_05]: and baselines to consider And that's just
the tip of the iceberg.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's there's a bunch more but I'm gonna
move on So yeah, there's lots of reasons
[SPEAKER_05]: why we're All doing this why we're looking
at indoor agriculture and control
[SPEAKER_05]: environment agriculture and why we care if
if there weren't good reasons to do it
[SPEAKER_05]: There wouldn't be an industry and we
wouldn't be investing all these efforts.
[SPEAKER_05]: So It's kind of silly of him to do this
because he's not taking a lot of feedback
[SPEAKER_05]: and improving his analysis He's just kind
of doubling down on a somewhat limited
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective and I don't think he knows
very much about agriculture unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_05]: so Let's look at Denver.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Denver three to four percent Of energy
use in the city of Denver is going to the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis industry, but this is the retail
facilities This is processing extraction
[SPEAKER_05]: like the whole nine yards, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you've been to Colorado if you live
in Colorado, you know that it's not just
[SPEAKER_05]: Coloradans that are consuming cannabis in
Colorado, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean when I've talked to folks there
something like half of the sales and some
[SPEAKER_05]: of these facilities are for out-of-state
folks So it's a lot of cannabis tourism
[SPEAKER_05]: and and as you know, the United States
changes their their policies This is
[SPEAKER_05]: probably going to change but they've
published a lot of their energy use data
[SPEAKER_05]: and also the production data and sales
data and so I went and compared Mills
[SPEAKER_05]: efficiency production efficiency numbers
to what I think the production
[SPEAKER_05]: efficiencies actually are in Denver and
Mills would have said that you could only
[SPEAKER_05]: produce about a hundred thousand pounds in
Denver Based on how much energy like the
[SPEAKER_05]: upper end energy use I have in that range
But the actual sales are like almost three
[SPEAKER_05]: times that so people are obviously more
efficient and the data that Denver has
[SPEAKER_05]: shows that growers are becoming more
efficient over time Now if we drive up the
[SPEAKER_05]: road from Denver to Boulder Nick did a
great job at already talking about this So
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not gonna belabor the point,
but I mostly just wanted to look at the
[SPEAKER_05]: carbon Intensity of the growing happening
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they report a little over a hundred
pounds co2 per square foot of cultivated
[SPEAKER_05]: space at Boulder County So that is largely
because it is a lot of coal in the grid
[SPEAKER_05]: mix there in Colorado Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was part of a study with ICF that we
did on behalf of the government in British
[SPEAKER_05]: Columbia and We found numbers were very
different Brad Queen did a DSM evaluation
[SPEAKER_05]: on behalf of County of Boulder Some folks
have probably seen this one of I think the
[SPEAKER_05]: most interesting thing that came away from
that study was simply that a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: growers are not getting any sort of signal
back from their energy use because they
[SPEAKER_05]: are master metered and then They're not
sub meter.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you aren't measuring what you're
doing There's no way you're gonna be able
[SPEAKER_05]: to really effectively and consistently
improve upon that So just getting folks
[SPEAKER_05]: metered and having the energy use data
coming back to them huge step in the right
[SPEAKER_05]: direction, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But from the the BC study that I was part
of with ICF What we found was really
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting is that the Canadian cannabis
growers were less efficient Whether it was
[SPEAKER_05]: warehouse or greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were less efficient than the US
growers and we had data from Well over a
[SPEAKER_05]: dozen different data sets and facilities
from all over the world We had data from
[SPEAKER_05]: Europe data from North America US Canada
So across the board on average the US
[SPEAKER_05]: growers are more efficient, but the
climate impacts were much lower in BC And
[SPEAKER_05]: it's simply because it's mostly hydro,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So they don't have any coal in their mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even though they're less energy
efficient their climate impact is lower.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Yeah, if you guess that you're the most
the amount of energy you use is Has a
[SPEAKER_05]: bigger impact on your climate footprint
than where you're located largely.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not the case And so we actually
found that the greenhouses Had higher co2
[SPEAKER_05]: impact than the all indoor warehouses in
BC so You know in that climate and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: mostly because the the climate impact is
natural gas driven, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because the heating from these
greenhouses is really making up a
[SPEAKER_05]: significant portion of that of that
climate impact So just want to encourage
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone to go out and read the best paper
Practice guides if you haven't already
[SPEAKER_05]: they're free.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're available on the website.
[SPEAKER_05]: I participated in the lighting technology
But tack to produce the lighting guide and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's great and I hope that we can get out
to more growers in the future So a few
[SPEAKER_05]: takeaways You know, I think the only way
we're really going to be able to fight
[SPEAKER_05]: negative press Like what came out
following MML study is to do our own very
[SPEAKER_05]: critical analysis and publish it and get
it out there we can't just hope that it'll
[SPEAKER_05]: go away because it's Hasn't gone away and
I think it may actually even get worse
[SPEAKER_05]: over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Yeah, if anybody wants to publish any
studies with me, let me know reach out
[SPEAKER_05]: happy to yeah good AC triple E Let's do
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you
[SPEAKER_06]: So the 20% of the room that guessed energy
consumption is a greater contributor to
[SPEAKER_06]: climate impact, please stand dance No
one's standing and dancing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like they want audience
participation, but they don't want to
[SPEAKER_06]: participate so Alright, this is our next
one six gallons of water per plant per day
[SPEAKER_06]: is a good rule of thumb to run with This
is a number that's been said to me in many
[SPEAKER_06]: places, so I'm just curious who thinks
it's good Where did six come from?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fine nobody's gonna have to dance
with this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right I'm gonna welcome Ted to the
podium now
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone my name is Ted Grantham I'm a
professor at UC Berkeley coming from the
[SPEAKER_07]: Department of Environmental Sciences
policy and management I'm a bit of an
[SPEAKER_07]: outlier here and that I don't work on
energy I work on water and to date I've
[SPEAKER_07]: mostly been focused on outdoor not not
indoor water use but I'm super excited to
[SPEAKER_07]: be working with New Frontier and REI on a
water report that I think will address
[SPEAKER_07]: both the indoor and outdoor aspects of
cannabis cultivation I think another area
[SPEAKER_07]: that we have in common is an awareness
that the lack of data and lack of good
[SPEAKER_07]: data has been an enormous barrier to our
understanding of cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_07]: systems generally and also a barrier to
good policy and that's really the approach
[SPEAKER_07]: that I'm coming from as a research
scientist at UC Berkeley and Can share a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit about what we're doing at the
UC Berkeley Cannabis Research Center and
[SPEAKER_07]: then tell you a little bit about our water
work specifically So about two years ago a
[SPEAKER_07]: group of faculty at on campus met who were
interested in cannabis and this included
[SPEAKER_07]: anthropologists and wildlife biologists,
hydrologists, land use scientists,
[SPEAKER_07]: lawyers and we recognized that there was a
real need for better peer-reviewed
[SPEAKER_07]: scholarship around cannabis given the
importance of this of this crop to the
[SPEAKER_07]: economy all of the policy debates
happening around cannabis and to the
[SPEAKER_07]: potential environmental impacts and so we
realized that by working together we could
[SPEAKER_07]: really help advance some of the underlying
science to address these needs and our
[SPEAKER_07]: approach really builds on not just you
know pure research but also as engagement
[SPEAKER_07]: so we work through UC's Cooperative
Extension Network to work with farmers,
[SPEAKER_07]: policymakers, regulators, other academic
entities to really create a space for
[SPEAKER_07]: dialogue among growers, among industry and
other interest groups So our focus is
[SPEAKER_07]: quite a bit different I think than some of
the other UC research centers that have
[SPEAKER_07]: focused on cannabis and that we're really
interested in understanding and studying
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis as an agricultural system not as
a drug or a medicine so we don't focus on
[SPEAKER_07]: the medical and public health aspects of
cannabis in California rather we focus on
[SPEAKER_07]: things like agricultural production
practices, environmental impacts,
[SPEAKER_07]: the policy setting and really the
community level social impacts of cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: production which today has largely focused
on the North Coast but we've been
[SPEAKER_07]: expanding our footprint to other parts of
the state In terms of our water work the
[SPEAKER_07]: story is actually a little bit similar to
the story that Brian mentioned and that
[SPEAKER_07]: some of the concerns over water use have
really been I think sensationalized in the
[SPEAKER_07]: media and there hasn't really been great
science to support our understanding of
[SPEAKER_07]: how water use by cannabis primarily
outdoor cannabis growers could be
[SPEAKER_07]: affecting the environment There have been
there's a lot of anecdotal evidence from
[SPEAKER_07]: raids on trespass grows or illegal grows
from different parts of the state of poor
[SPEAKER_07]: water management practices Here on your
left you see a kind of a pump perched
[SPEAKER_07]: precariously over a stream diverting water
directly from a stream the photo on your
[SPEAKER_07]: right shows a stream that's been sort of
dug out and kind of diverted into a large
[SPEAKER_07]: pond that's supplying a farm and so when
enforcement agencies and the media witness
[SPEAKER_07]: practices like these it rightfully does
raise alarm bells but the question remains
[SPEAKER_07]: how reflective are these practices of the
broader grower community and these are
[SPEAKER_07]: really the questions that we wanted to
address And we have some really basic
[SPEAKER_07]: questions right and and it's pretty
remarkable to us when we kind of looked at
[SPEAKER_07]: the literature that these questions
haven't been answered You know,
[SPEAKER_07]: where do cannabis growers get their water
and how much water they using?
[SPEAKER_07]: Fortunately through You know the passage
of prop 64 and some of the regulatory
[SPEAKER_07]: programs that have been developed to
develop a legal cannabis market we're
[SPEAKER_07]: actually getting new data from growers on
their water use and the results that I'll
[SPEAKER_07]: be showing today are from a data set that
Was developed through a regional
[SPEAKER_07]: regulatory program that started in in 2016
and basically reflects data from Grower
[SPEAKER_07]: community in this region in in the twenty
six seventeen year and these data include
[SPEAKER_07]: information from about a thousand farms
and includes information like the size of
[SPEAKER_07]: the cultivation area the type of the
cultivation area whether that's fully
[SPEAKER_07]: outdoor mixed light or indoor and Includes
water sourcing input to storage and water
[SPEAKER_07]: applied applied to plants So our first
question where our cannabis farmers
[SPEAKER_07]: getting their water They rely on a variety
of sources including groundwater wells
[SPEAKER_07]: streams springs and and some rainwater
catchment and we look at the the relative
[SPEAKER_07]: proportion of of use we see that the vast
majority of Farmers are relying on on
[SPEAKER_07]: wells and let me just kind of walk you
through focus on the gray lines first So
[SPEAKER_07]: this represents about 60% of all growers
in the region are using wells and this
[SPEAKER_07]: dark line Part of it means that those
those users are using more than more than
[SPEAKER_07]: other other sources in addition in
addition to wells So a lot of growers are
[SPEAKER_07]: only using wells as their as their water
supply.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have You know a fair number of
Farmers using surface water supplies like
[SPEAKER_07]: springs or sorry like like rivers and
streams to meet their needs Fewer using
[SPEAKER_07]: rain catchments and this off-site
basically represents You know things like
[SPEAKER_07]: water trucking or municipal water supplies
And so this was a absolutely a surprise to
[SPEAKER_07]: us.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there was an assumption certainly
by the kind of regulator community that
[SPEAKER_07]: Growers were primarily relying on surface
water diversions, which is which is really
[SPEAKER_07]: Huge concern and given that where these
grows are they tend to be concentrated in
[SPEAKER_07]: watersheds that support sensitive species
like endangered salmon And so that's
[SPEAKER_07]: really one of them the major environmental
concerns driving policy in this region So
[SPEAKER_07]: the second question How much water is
actually being used?
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's really only one other study
that's been focused on outdoor Cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: water use and this is a study by Scott
Bauer back in 2016 and yeah, this was
[SPEAKER_07]: absolutely I think a good faith effort to
Think about what cannabis water demands
[SPEAKER_07]: might mean in the context of water
availability and thinking about potential
[SPEAKER_07]: impacts to stream flow in these sensitive
species that we that we care about and
[SPEAKER_07]: They use this, you know at the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is well before legalization Getting
access to data was very difficult.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they they did communicate with some
some farmer associations To come up with
[SPEAKER_07]: some a rough estimate of cannabis use and
that's where this Six gallons per day per
[SPEAKER_07]: plant Estimate over over the hundred and
fifty days of the growing season came and
[SPEAKER_07]: so they basically use this this This water
use estimate applied it to the number of
[SPEAKER_07]: plants They viewed on through aerial
imagery analysis and then scaled that up
[SPEAKER_07]: to the watershed To estimate the total
demand of cannabis in a watershed relative
[SPEAKER_07]: to supplies and they study these little
watersheds in Here in different parts of
[SPEAKER_07]: the of the state So through this analysis
of of these these about a thousand reports
[SPEAKER_07]: we get a much more nuanced picture of of
water use Apologizes a little bit
[SPEAKER_07]: difficult to seize but let's first start
with water use overall and first of all
[SPEAKER_07]: what we see is there's a strong seasonal
pattern in in water demand and Just if
[SPEAKER_07]: you're curious these this shows liters of
water.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is basically Scaled to the median
farm size, which is about a quarter of an
[SPEAKER_07]: acre in in the region but the pattern is
really what I want to highlight here
[SPEAKER_07]: because that initial estimate of cannabis
water use just Relied basically estimated
[SPEAKER_07]: a constant demand from the start of the
growing season to the end of the growing
[SPEAKER_07]: season The water extraction profile for
users that rely on perennial sources like
[SPEAKER_07]: groundwater Largely explains this this
this trend that we see here, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are the majority of users that
are using groundwater basically are
[SPEAKER_07]: pumping water on demand to meet to meet
their needs in Contrast growers that rely
[SPEAKER_07]: on seasonal sources like like Springs
where you know flows may either cease
[SPEAKER_07]: entirely or became become quite low or
less reliable They tend to be pumping
[SPEAKER_07]: water kind of year year round and the
reason they're pumping water in the winter
[SPEAKER_07]: is because they're moving that water into
storage to use later in the growing season
[SPEAKER_07]: and For those subset of growers that
actually had large water storage
[SPEAKER_07]: capacities like ponds They had a
completely inverted pattern of water use
[SPEAKER_07]: where they're basically getting all of
their water in the winter months filling
[SPEAKER_07]: up those ponds and have very low demands
in In the growing season in the summer now
[SPEAKER_07]: This has really important policy
implications because under the current
[SPEAKER_07]: state water board regulations any outdoor
grower Is actually prohibited from taking
[SPEAKER_07]: water from streams in the summer months?
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're a grower who relies on
Streams, you're either gonna need to build
[SPEAKER_07]: storage To to meet your growing season
demands or put in a well and wells
[SPEAKER_07]: groundwater generally not regulated by By
the war by the water board into their
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis policy So we ask the question do
Cannabis growers in this data set at least
[SPEAKER_07]: have enough storage on site to meet their
growing season demands In other words,
[SPEAKER_07]: can they comply with these forbearance
requirements?
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we see is that the vast majority
do not and so this basically again shows
[SPEAKER_07]: that That for these growers that have rely
on seasonal sources, they're gonna they're
[SPEAKER_07]: gonna need to either build a pond which is
Can be you know, very cost prohibitive
[SPEAKER_07]: They're gonna have to move on to
groundwater and which has its own
[SPEAKER_07]: challenges or they're gonna have to drop
out of the of the permitted system So just
[SPEAKER_07]: to summarize this is just really a brief
snapshot of some of our water research and
[SPEAKER_07]: our research portfolio broadly But through
this work we found that wells were the
[SPEAKER_07]: most common source of outdoor for outdoor
outdoor mix like cannabis cultivation in
[SPEAKER_07]: the region The amount and timing of water
really depends on your water source on the
[SPEAKER_07]: in the amount of water storage capacity
available And that we found that most
[SPEAKER_07]: farms had insufficient storage to meet
state permitting requirements Which could
[SPEAKER_07]: be a really important barrier to
compliance for growers that are attempting
[SPEAKER_07]: to enter the the legal the legal system
That's all I have today next time I'll
[SPEAKER_07]: tell you about our wildlife studies We're
doing some wildlife camera trapping and
[SPEAKER_07]: looking at how wildlife use Basically acts
use use farms and around farms.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a cool photo that I'd like to
share.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I'm just gonna do a couple
summary remarks and then we're gonna open
[SPEAKER_06]: it up to Q&A we learned about energy we
learned about carbon and we learned a bit
[SPEAKER_06]: about water and All three of those things
are going to be better supported By the
[SPEAKER_06]: new developments that we're doing for
power score.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to remind folks from the
speeches we heard from Nick that power
[SPEAKER_06]: score was used as a baseline for
comparison for his Boulder County
[SPEAKER_06]: assessment Brian has been involved in
helping improve power score and we really
[SPEAKER_06]: hope to see an increased use of utility
programming's utility programs using power
[SPEAKER_06]: score to get the benefit while being able
to trust the data integrity and accuracy
[SPEAKER_06]: and then Ted mentioned how the cannabis
water report is a collaboration between
[SPEAKER_06]: Berkeley and RII and then also that we are
going to be using information from these
[SPEAKER_06]: studies and the water related information
To be putting into power score as a
[SPEAKER_06]: baseline so that we can make a baseline
for water And then lastly as I mentioned
[SPEAKER_06]: yesterday, we're gonna be pulling in
carbon shadowing for the actual energy
[SPEAKER_06]: sources that people use To the point that
Brian made about mixes so that we can
[SPEAKER_06]: actually understand What's the carbon
intensity of these different facilities
[SPEAKER_06]: based off of the fuel sources that they
use the mix of their grid?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the choices that they make inside
the facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I invite folks to pepper us with
questions I have some that I could ask but
[SPEAKER_06]: I really prefer to get them started out
here Don't all jump down at once I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: Corinne Good morning Thanks, Nick for that
presentation that you showed on energy I
[SPEAKER_04]: wonder with the greenhouses though in the
data set That you had was that can you
[SPEAKER_04]: talk a little bit about the geographical
distribution of the data set that you had
[SPEAKER_04]: was that all up in the You know the north
any in the south Yes, so it was all
[SPEAKER_08]: climate zone five B a which one's the dry
one somebody knows You that's not right
[SPEAKER_08]: you made that up Whichever the dry one is
five a I don't know it was all five a and
[SPEAKER_08]: an important thing I did not I pointed out
how there was a lot of variety amongst
[SPEAKER_08]: those facilities There was one commonality
which is that they were all HID lighting
[SPEAKER_08]: there was not an LED amongst them That was
a mix between HPS and CMH, but that is a
[SPEAKER_08]: important I think detail that I left out
Also, you are the first to see that data
[SPEAKER_08]: outside of the reviewers in Boulder
County.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're all very special There's a
follow-up question from the Slido how does
[SPEAKER_06]: energy compare between sealed and
ventilated greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_08]: So more we see more HVAC use in the sealed
greenhouses You know they have full-blown
[SPEAKER_08]: HVAC systems and not only they're dealing
with The loads from the lighting but
[SPEAKER_08]: there's the you know, the solar radiation
that's helping increase the heat in that
[SPEAKER_08]: space as well So, you know lighting loads
are quite similar that they're both using
[SPEAKER_08]: Within this sample all of the mixed light
facilities were using some form of
[SPEAKER_08]: Threshold control to turn the lights on
and off energy use was pretty similar on
[SPEAKER_08]: the lighting side HVAC use was definitely
higher for those sealed facilities
[SPEAKER_02]: Nineteen facilities Yeah, so I wanted to
ask about what you know as far as energy
[SPEAKER_02]: Reporting and gathering data like what are
some of the challenges of scaling that up?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some of it's been self-reported,
but you know, how do we how do we do that
[SPEAKER_02]: accurately at scale?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure I mean, I think that's a lot of
attention of the power score is for enough
[SPEAKER_05]: folks to adopt it and it become a standard
and then it helps to set the framework for
[SPEAKER_05]: how energy is reported and You know and in
what format and so that we can compare
[SPEAKER_05]: directly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that there's any other
Standard out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean individual utilities have a am I
data and they're collecting data obviously
[SPEAKER_05]: but outside of that There's not a lot of
standardization The issue for me is the
[SPEAKER_00]: standardization in other words,
you're you're tying it all back to either
[SPEAKER_00]: high pressure sodium And you're not going
back to what Mother Nature is doing
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors It would seem to me you'd want to
look at what the when you're comparing
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs or anything else What's outdoors what
what is and it's not just PPFD in the
[SPEAKER_00]: power range that plants are looking for
And we're the guards to standardization of
[SPEAKER_00]: using indoor agriculture as a way to then
upscale cannabis When you look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: almond that's using one pound of water per
almond so when you look at six pounds per
[SPEAKER_00]: For our cannabis, I mean six gallons per
cannabis I think we we need to also look
[SPEAKER_00]: at standardization of where we start to do
the measurements And then the slide with
[SPEAKER_00]: regards to the amount of yield going down
these are Cessation beams these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: shut down when there's too much there So
putting more light on it does is not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it grow plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you go 18 hours of light?
[SPEAKER_00]: It what part of the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the question is how do you determine
the standards from which you?
[SPEAKER_00]: From which you be able to make these
measurements because they're all over the
[SPEAKER_06]: place depending on who's presenting Well a
baseline has to be drawn somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we can all agree There's baselines
that we need for outdoor growing there's
[SPEAKER_06]: baselines that we need for some of the
great awesome stuff that Ted was
[SPEAKER_06]: presenting on how are people getting water
how are they storing it when are they
[SPEAKER_06]: using it and Those are folks that are
using a resource brought to us by the
[SPEAKER_06]: earth How people choose to light is not
necessarily what I think we're trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: talk about in this panel and so I think
what I'd love for Anyone to comment on is
[SPEAKER_06]: like how do you make a baseline?
[SPEAKER_06]: For an industry that in some opinions is
unbaselineable
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been asked this question many times
over the years and I I think that you
[SPEAKER_05]: simply start with what people are doing to
the extent that folks are sharing and we
[SPEAKER_05]: have we can have some confidence in the
data you see what people are doing right
[SPEAKER_05]: now and You look at the range.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the low end.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the high end You know set an
average and then start to try to ratchet
[SPEAKER_05]: it down But the problem is so much data
wasn't collected for a very long time for
[SPEAKER_05]: legal reasons and then isn't collected or
reported now for proprietary reasons and
[SPEAKER_05]: so Having faith in the data that's
available.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really limits our ability to set a
baseline or even talk about setting a
[SPEAKER_05]: baseline.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll jump in on that one as well
because we're doing a baseline study in
[SPEAKER_08]: Massachusetts right now Commissioner Doyle
I need to catch up with you at some point
[SPEAKER_08]: wherever you're hiding back there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes And it's it's really challenging,
you know because there is so No facility
[SPEAKER_08]: no two facilities I've ever been in are
alike.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all a little bit different,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's just a lot of ways to skin the
cat as I like to say all that matters is
[SPEAKER_08]: there's one more dead cat So it's it's
very difficult to set baselines But within
[SPEAKER_08]: that effort to try to figure out what
people are currently doing we are finding
[SPEAKER_08]: there are certain systems or certain parts
of the process that there is a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: consistency and it is Reasonably
comfortable to say okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is standard practice for this
technical Technology in this phase of
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivation but like veg lighting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's you know, is it t5s?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it single ended metal halide is it LED
and we see a wide variety of lighting
[SPEAKER_08]: technologies for that So it's more
difficult to say this is standard practice
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks very much one question that came up
when I first started foray into doing the
[SPEAKER_06]: literature review of the available studies
and what is the baseline how could you
[SPEAKER_06]: compare X to Y whether it's HPS to LED or
something else and one of the things that
[SPEAKER_06]: I found with the first studies was the
smud studies done with seven leaves and
[SPEAKER_06]: Amplified farms I think and both of them
the first one didn't control for strain
[SPEAKER_06]: and then the second one tried to Tried to
at least sort of correlate these ranges of
[SPEAKER_06]: energy and production based off of strain
type and then I started learning more and
[SPEAKER_06]: basically learned that even strain name
doesn't really mean anything and genetics
[SPEAKER_06]: and You could have green crack in one
place green crack in another.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're totally different plants Different
genetics so having it controlled by strain
[SPEAKER_06]: wouldn't be accurate So I just wanted to
open that can of worms.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any way to control by?
[SPEAKER_06]: Plant so that you're actually comparing
apples to apples We're just starting a
[SPEAKER_08]: study of that very thing with a cultivator
who runs his facility like a lab and is
[SPEAKER_08]: one of the only and maybe the only
Cultivator I've run into that dedicates a
[SPEAKER_08]: room to a strain.
[SPEAKER_08]: So everywhere else I've ever been they
have a mix of strains in a flower room and
[SPEAKER_08]: that pretty much precludes the ability to
figure out How the strain might impact
[SPEAKER_08]: energy consumption?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let you know when we're done if it
worked or not Yeah, and I'll say exactly
[SPEAKER_05]: the same thing the folks that are really
really controlled facilities and they have
[SPEAKER_05]: they're tracking very carefully genotype
phenotype chemo type and And they can
[SPEAKER_05]: report on all of that, you know to a very
precise Ability that's when you can start
[SPEAKER_05]: to actually work back to a
standardization.
[SPEAKER_07]: I Just want to make one one one comment on
With respect to to water and that and this
[SPEAKER_07]: is a broadly with water and energy that
it's incredibly It's still very difficult
[SPEAKER_07]: for the research community, you know
university researchers to actually Do
[SPEAKER_07]: these types of studies where one might
look at?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know the various responses of
particular strains or cultivation
[SPEAKER_07]: strategies to variation in energy or water
applications We're still prohibited from
[SPEAKER_07]: actually working with the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still considered a federal one
schedule one drug And we risk our
[SPEAKER_07]: university funding if we even come,
you know, basically in contact with with
[SPEAKER_07]: the plant So I just wanted to mention that
we're still a long way away in the
[SPEAKER_07]: research community You know publicly
funded research community from being able
[SPEAKER_07]: to ask these, you know ask these relevant
relevant questions So it's really going to
[SPEAKER_07]: depend I think on partnerships with
industry at least for the foreseeable
[SPEAKER_07]: future To to get these these data that are
that are so important So this is a
[SPEAKER_03]: question directed to you Ted I think that
I heard you say that there's not
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation on wells for farms and I'm just
sort of surprised about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a regulation on the number of
wells or how deep they go Could you speak
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit more to that if I'm?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so this is Yeah, one of the
Fascinating aspects of California water
[SPEAKER_07]: management and water law and that we have
you know this this this Strong distinction
[SPEAKER_07]: between the way that we regulate surface
water and regulate groundwater and only
[SPEAKER_07]: surface water is really under the purview
of Regulation under this by the state by
[SPEAKER_07]: the state water board And you know
groundwater historically has been entirely
[SPEAKER_07]: unregulated There has been some recent
Policy changes that there's a law passed
[SPEAKER_07]: during the height of the last drought
called the sustainable groundwater
[SPEAKER_07]: management act that did bring some
groundwater into regulation in the in the
[SPEAKER_07]: water policy there there is a provision
that if It could if it can be shown that
[SPEAKER_07]: you know groundwater wells are are sort of
hydrologically connected to surface water
[SPEAKER_07]: Then they can be sort of considered to be
under the authority or jurisdiction of the
[SPEAKER_07]: of the of the state But that generally you
know, there's not really any evidence that
[SPEAKER_07]: the state is Hungry to exercise that that
jurisdiction at this point.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean there's really trying to to tackle
the the the surface water issue,
[SPEAKER_06]: so All right, I think we're out of do you
want one more?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, all right here I I've been a little
bit concerned with the whole format of how
[SPEAKER_01]: this is being presented and let me give
you an example the terminologies of
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption or use of water seems to be
Interchangeable as far as it's been used
[SPEAKER_01]: Here and that's decidedly not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me give you a very clear example if
you had an old-time Mill operation that
[SPEAKER_01]: had a water wheel and he's diverting a
stream over his wheel and that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: he's getting his power to Is he using
water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess he is but he's not consuming
water and I think generally the idea is is
[SPEAKER_01]: that if you Are able to return the water
in the same quality that You took it in
[SPEAKER_01]: then it's not consumed So the real
question I think usually is how much water
[SPEAKER_01]: you consuming not how much water you're
using now in plants The obvious thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: that they consume very little the the they
use a lot for transpiration and The
[SPEAKER_01]: question is is what's the significance of
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Transpiration as far as water use versus
water consumption and then that gets
[SPEAKER_01]: integrated back into your climate control
your dehumanization whether you're
[SPEAKER_01]: Reutilizing that water whether it's in
some way been contaminated or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that and until we get more precise
Usage of words and definitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the data will not have much
significance No, that's a great point and
[SPEAKER_07]: I completely agree there's an important
distinction between applied water and
[SPEAKER_07]: consumptive use of plants I think In a lot
of agricultural crops there is a
[SPEAKER_07]: substantial fraction of water that's
applied to the crops that is not lost
[SPEAKER_07]: through about the Transpiration and that
could potentially return to the
[SPEAKER_07]: environment with respect to outdoor
cannabis cultivation The practices that
[SPEAKER_07]: we've seen has primarily been very high
efficiency drip irrigation is sort of the
[SPEAKER_07]: is the is the standard where we don't
really see any evidence of You know sort
[SPEAKER_07]: of substantial return flows or you know
not much of that water You know is ending
[SPEAKER_07]: up back in back in the environment at
least not to You know not in any way that
[SPEAKER_07]: we could actually measure and detect a
response and say the stream from which
[SPEAKER_07]: these these waters are being are being
drawn So I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a need to get to bring sort of
more refinement and nuance to our
[SPEAKER_07]: understanding of crop water water
consumptive use And those those dynamics
[SPEAKER_07]: were not we're not there yet But I would
say for cannabis at least from our
[SPEAKER_07]: experience and outdoor grows We have I
think looking at applied water is a pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: good proxy for for consumptive use Thank
you everyone for your questions Just again
[SPEAKER_06]: another little plug.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've done a lot of improvements to the
water side of power score And we'd love
[SPEAKER_06]: anybody with water stakeholders feedback
on that in terms of what are we asking?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we asking the right questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we going to get the right information
that you would want to know so?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all and I think what's the next
thing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful, thank you Juan Carlos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, let's give a hand to the panel
You You You You You
