[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Brandon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with Athena one of the founders We're
gonna be bringing on jungle boys pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: quick here What we're gonna be doing is
we're gonna be we had a post a week ago
[SPEAKER_00]: that went over the difference between BDC
and Media you see so what I did was I
[SPEAKER_00]: called Ivan and he had a lot to say about
it and I wanted to bring him in and
[SPEAKER_00]: curious So obviously we did that post last
week the difference between BDC and
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintaining EC and your media and that's
why we kind of got this whole thing
[SPEAKER_00]: started But I wanted to start off and talk
about your guys's New facility that you
[SPEAKER_00]: got coming online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's cut ahead Yeah What how many
lights like how many rooms like what do
[SPEAKER_00]: you how'd you guys set it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys feel comfortable talking about
it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure I'll I'll let roach give the rundown
since he's our project manager over there
[SPEAKER_03]: That would give you a little bit of run
down of cut a hey and where we're at on it
[SPEAKER_02]: right now Yes, it kind of is basically
two-story facility It's got eight
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering rooms ranging from about 70 to
80 lights and a 260 light veg and genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: holding area mother area So fully
recirculating runoff Clean it sanitize it
[SPEAKER_02]: and then refeed it back in through the
Netflix It's definitely the most
[SPEAKER_02]: Technological facility we've built yet
Excited to get plants in it for sure So is
[SPEAKER_00]: that recirculating new for California?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that active yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not active yet I think it's 2021 I
believe where it's Department of Fish and
[SPEAKER_02]: Wildlife or the water board or both of
those two or requiring all cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities to be Recycling their runoff
and not just dumping everything down the
[SPEAKER_02]: drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah 2021 no, it's got eight rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many lights in each room?
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 to 80 Okay Now I go through a lot of
your facilities, you know through the
[SPEAKER_00]: factory and different different facilities
like that They seem to have a similar
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of rooms Based on how many weeks
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you so you guys plan on taking one room
down a week?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's kind of the goal With the
eight rooms basically a pull down a room
[SPEAKER_02]: every week be kind of a smooth smooth kind
of schedule Transition nice Cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well good job on that I saw what two weeks
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't posted that nutrient room is
probably the prettiest nutrient room I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever seen so good job roach Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's let's get into the questions The
first question, you know, we want to go
[SPEAKER_00]: over that post that Athena did a week ago
What the difference between feed EC and EC
[SPEAKER_00]: in your media?
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as that would be a runoff as well
Can you talk about and give us an insight
[SPEAKER_00]: on how you guys your SOP?
[SPEAKER_03]: On that and what you guys do Yeah,
so there's two different ways to look at
[SPEAKER_03]: it you can look at it I'm trying to make
it in a I'm trying to when I speak I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to speak in growers terms I'm not
trying to make it too complicated for
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody So if you look at there's two
ways to water your plants, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say you have a rock wall cube,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take a six inch cube.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example You can you can water it and
each time you water it you can get runoff,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So think of it every time that you're
watering that cube You're resetting that
[SPEAKER_03]: cube Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I'm doing a 3.0 EC and I'm getting
runoff That cube that the EC inside the
[SPEAKER_03]: cube is not building as much Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah now the way that we do it And I'm
gonna say this is the right way because
[SPEAKER_03]: we've done it both ways and both ways work
really good with it, right is You can
[SPEAKER_03]: stack that cube.
[SPEAKER_03]: So imagine you take a little tiny watering
Throughout the day and you're giving them
[SPEAKER_03]: short tiny bursts of water in 8 ml 10 ml 7
ml Whatever your drippers rating is is
[SPEAKER_03]: what we do, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So imagine In a 12-hour flowering After
the lights come on the first hour now
[SPEAKER_03]: every hour we're giving up tiny little
bursts of water All that's happening is
[SPEAKER_03]: now we're stacking that nutrient inside
the cube.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now that we see that we originally fed
Now a couple weeks later that 3.0 EC is a
[SPEAKER_03]: 5.0 EC a 6.0 EC, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing that you have to be careful
with is now when you start hitting those
[SPEAKER_03]: dry backs, right and the plant starts
drying out, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not any water and there's not a
lot of water inside that cube,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you're eating on that really fine
line of burning your plants, right and Not
[SPEAKER_03]: having enough water for your plants to
cook up But once we get amazing results
[SPEAKER_03]: doing that right you can really sit there
You can stress the plan out you can see
[SPEAKER_03]: you can see things happen that you've
never seen happen before You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, we feel That not one way is better
than the other necessarily, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like if you have people that are
not as experienced and not there every
[SPEAKER_03]: single day and watching everything and
have monitoring on every single cube and
[SPEAKER_03]: and and You know, you're you have someone
at your facility 24 hours a day feeding
[SPEAKER_03]: with a little bit of runoff is a lot safer
You know, I don't want people to take this
[SPEAKER_03]: and everybody go run out and start putting
you know a 7.0 EC inside their cube
[SPEAKER_03]: because the jungle boys told us to do it,
you know We're not telling people to run
[SPEAKER_03]: out do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just sharing what we do So what ends
up happening is if we put a feeding chart
[SPEAKER_03]: out there and we say hey start out at a
2.0 EC Right, and you almost start feeding
[SPEAKER_03]: at 2.0 EC and they have a bunch of runoff
and they Come to us and they're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, it's not enough food for our plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you guys are setting us up with
failure our plants are turning yellow
[SPEAKER_03]: There's I hate feeding charts,
you know, you know, I've always said this,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's one first off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all strange specific, you know,
some strains eat a lot more than others
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so for us we try to give a
general guideline And if you're if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: giving your plants a bunch of runoff,
you know And you have a heavy eating
[SPEAKER_03]: strain of 3.0 EC a flank and take all day
long No issue 3.0 to 3.5 EC with a high
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of runoff because that's what your
media is maintaining Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem, you know But then there's also
the flip side of that right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's take a strain like strawberry
shortcake, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Strawberry shortcake we would never feed a
3.0 EC to it just doesn't it doesn't it
[SPEAKER_03]: won't take it up It won't eat it,
you know, so there's always that small
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of strings that no matter what you
tell someone to feed It's going to be too
[SPEAKER_03]: much and then there you take something
like Topanga or Wi-Fi 43 or strain that
[SPEAKER_03]: eats a lot and you tell someone to give it
a 2.0 EC They're going to come to you and
[SPEAKER_03]: be like it wasn't enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't give my plants enough You know,
so that's why when you train companies
[SPEAKER_03]: that are featured it's just a baseline
It's to get you to where you need to be
[SPEAKER_03]: but depending on your runoff And depending
on how you're stacking your your cubes in
[SPEAKER_03]: your watering That's what tells you
whether or not you should be feeding high
[SPEAKER_03]: or low, you know And of course,
we don't go down in a whole nother rabbit
[SPEAKER_03]: hole, but then there's there's a whole
nother There's some other stuff that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: playing with feeding way higher than that
and doing a lot more dry backs But you
[SPEAKER_03]: really have to be on your game,
you know, it's like I always tell people,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know You go to the batting page and
someone throws a softball at you you hit
[SPEAKER_03]: it you're like I'm the man, you know,
someone throws a hundred miles of fastball
[SPEAKER_03]: at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like I suck You know and that's
what happens when you stacking these
[SPEAKER_03]: feedings and you start pulling back
waterings You know, you can easily destroy
[SPEAKER_03]: a crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can easily fry a crop You know,
but if you're on the game and you know
[SPEAKER_03]: what you're doing You know, you're gonna
hit numbers and you're gonna you're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: see things that you're gonna see,
you know THC levels and try to see that
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff just go through the roof You know,
you know, it's a very funny money and we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't want to go and put some food cart
out there And so they guys start stacking
[SPEAKER_03]: the food at a 3.0 EC You know,
I'm getting too much build up and locking
[SPEAKER_00]: everything out Yeah, 100% because they're
because their runoff is not sufficient You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, I was over at the factory what a
week ago roach and I saw that all your
[SPEAKER_00]: tanks were at a 2 EC now understanding
that the genetics are getting affected by
[SPEAKER_00]: the EC value differently are your water
Shot volumes changing based on genetic to
[SPEAKER_00]: build EC higher or lower based on genetics
in that room while you're feeding a 2 EC
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so usually we're not really thinking
the runtime to alter the EC in the block
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll adjust adjust how long the dry down
period is You could use a longer runtime
[SPEAKER_02]: and that would Therefore give the plant
more runoff and then lower the EC or you
[SPEAKER_02]: could use a shorter runtime If you're
really trying to stack that EC to where
[SPEAKER_02]: you get no runoff and then that goes back
to the stacking technique But you got
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, you guys aren't changing your
runtimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just changing the frequencies Yeah,
the time is Now now given that the factory
[SPEAKER_00]: was wanted to running at a 2 EC baseline
for pretty much all its flower rooms Don't
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on genetic of that room is
depending on how you're gonna monitor that
[SPEAKER_00]: how high that EC value goes in that block
Depending on that genetic while using a 2
[SPEAKER_00]: EC, you know, cuz that's the thing You're
not feeding a genetic more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just monitoring that rate
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's really the only real reason
we're able to do that is because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: substrate monitoring that we have,
you know If we didn't have the Rockwell
[SPEAKER_02]: monitoring and the EC and the water
content, it would be you know a full-time
[SPEAKER_02]: job for several people to be checking
runoffs on all these on all these rooms
[SPEAKER_02]: and strengths, but having it in like
[SPEAKER_00]: Now do you like do you have an optimum
root zone temperature and does that equate
[SPEAKER_00]: to relative?
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature of the room at all based on
the room temperature or what you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean root flow temperatures for sure
relative to what the room is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean if the rooms warmer I mean you're
gonna be warmer, but it also goes into
[SPEAKER_02]: what your What your what your feed is what
your feed temperature is what your
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients are coming into the planet You
know if you have like a really long run
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's up in your crawl space and it's a
hundred and twenty degrees in your crawl
[SPEAKER_02]: space and then your PVC is therefore
heated up and your nutrients is therefore
[SPEAKER_02]: Raise your room temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: Like on these buildouts that we do as well
Do you try to watch it or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You like to see a certain number?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like to see it not go over a
certain number?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just kind of you know, I mean
anything over 80 definitely isn't good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, but we're not we're we air
conditioner our irrigation room,
[SPEAKER_02]: so our water stays about like 67 degrees
Anyways, yeah 70 to 73 74 75 So our waters
[SPEAKER_00]: are really getting too hot ever I
personally realize it's I Don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on water temp that much at my grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to see it go over 78 Yeah,
yeah other than that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's pretty but that was one of the
questions that we had gotten No,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, I mean if you're if you're on a
small scale and you can you know Really
[SPEAKER_03]: dial in your water temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you'd see a little bit of a
difference, you know But the biggest
[SPEAKER_03]: difference you're gonna see is not letting
it get too warm You know, I've seen large
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities and you know a couple people
that just had this issue recently Or like
[SPEAKER_03]: Roach was saying and they they ran all
their pipes up in the addict and now
[SPEAKER_03]: they're at it gets 120 degrees during
summertime and they're having all these
[SPEAKER_03]: issues Yeah, I've done that before So when
we're talking about blended compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: pro I know you guys were flowering some
rooms over at 58 on blended And then I
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely I know that the the the nursery
is all using blended, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is what's your thoughts about the
comparison?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when would you use blended as far
as you know compared to pro on a Grow
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, I mean it honestly just comes down
to what our employees are comfortable
[SPEAKER_03]: using We have we have both of them right
and Some guys like mixing, you know a
[SPEAKER_03]: two-part right out of the bag and some
guys just feel more comfortable mixing a
[SPEAKER_03]: bottle, you know For us if the guys are
really good at what they do and they've
[SPEAKER_03]: been doing it for a really long time You
know, and they've worked under us for
[SPEAKER_03]: years, you know guys been working With us
ten plus years, you know We have a grower
[SPEAKER_03]: that grows amazing cannabis says listen I
feel comfortable with this and I like what
[SPEAKER_03]: I do and I'm used to it And this is my
rhythm and this is my routine and this is
[SPEAKER_03]: what I like to do You know, you know I
think that it just comes down to the
[SPEAKER_03]: grower, you know budget wise too,
you know, I know they're not there's not a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of difference money wise, you know
when my Yeah, it's all it really comes
[SPEAKER_00]: down to you know Now this is a question
that we get all the time, you know Do you
[SPEAKER_00]: ever sometimes I'll be talking to people
like yeah, you know, this is how I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: drawn into some road transit, you know And
they're like, come on, bro Like they're
[SPEAKER_00]: adding other shit in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know they're adding something
they're got to be adding some sweet or an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic input or this or that I mean to be
honest we spent years and years and years
[SPEAKER_03]: Adding a lot of shit to the to the
reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean there was there was one
time We were adding 16 parts all liquids
[SPEAKER_03]: all liquids, you know, we've been through
it all, you know I mean we've no one has
[SPEAKER_03]: done more side-by-side comparison and I'm
talking real side-by-side I'm talking
[SPEAKER_03]: taking thousands of light I'm taking
multiple rooms and doing multiple
[SPEAKER_03]: side-by-side comparison with the same
trains under the same lights You know what
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Same room same room same everything,
you know, this isn't some one row You know
[SPEAKER_03]: things might look a little bit better
because it gets a little bit light light
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm talking taking full 60 light rooms
and doing full side by side, you know
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple come over and over and over Yeah,
and every time we would take something out
[SPEAKER_03]: and we would take something out and we
would take something out And then when we
[SPEAKER_03]: get to the very end to the real base of it
what we really needed we'd always have the
[SPEAKER_03]: best results Sure, there was one time that
we had a great run, you know That was this
[SPEAKER_03]: mythical run that everything lined up and
all the stars lined up, you know But at
[SPEAKER_03]: the end of the day, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean I just think they just
brought some dosie killer in there right
[SPEAKER_03]: now I was just like this is fucking
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean Fucking fire,
you know You know nothing at it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we had a claim you know,
and that's it, you know, there's You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we really We've kind of eliminated all
that, you know I think I think seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys are focusing more on your driving
Box and your dry, you know your dry box to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase that that terpene content and
that THC verse Thinking that an organic
[SPEAKER_00]: input of some sort is going to do it for
you because if you were to talk to me
[SPEAKER_00]: three years ago and Knowing what I thought
I knew back then I would say hey you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to add an organic input to get the turk
container and but the more that I had kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of adjusted to just going with core grow
or core bloom Cleanse the more I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: whoa, like this is where it's on so My
ghost you guys use any Mike us with your
[SPEAKER_00]: clones anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that you know a few years ago you
did Are you guys using?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah We we did for a really long time,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it might shave off a day or two,
you know, it's just being real You know
[SPEAKER_03]: what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like anyone made really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, yeah that Michael Jordan stuff
was fire, you know But at the end of the
[SPEAKER_03]: day Shaving off a day or two, you know
what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've already seen the benefit for the
work and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it really a day or two?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to get the dry back perfectly,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're not seeing it We're not
going from 14 days to 7 days because if it
[SPEAKER_03]: was 14 days to 7 days, we'd be using that
shit Yeah, you know, but at the end of the
[SPEAKER_03]: day, you know, if someone's using
something and they liked it We're not
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna tell them not to use it You know
what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I use I use caps venues for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was my go-to I'll still pull it out for
this day if we're having issues and do a
[SPEAKER_03]: four-year trip Yeah, you know,
it's like it's like magic in a bottle
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but do I use it every single day and
my grow, you know, do I soak every single
[SPEAKER_03]: cube with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't You know, but if I see some
something going on that I don't like well
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big one, you know IPM,
so what's the SOP?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the secret?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I mean you got how many facilities
you have eight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine nine nine facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many lights right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands Close to 4,000 lights I mean,
yeah close to 4,000 lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you most people you got to be like,
bro You got to be using botanical max
[SPEAKER_00]: venerate fucking you got to use this you
got to use that You know, what's what's
[SPEAKER_00]: your IPM regimen?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your program?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean IPM is our go-to You know,
that's our go-to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what it's what we've used for a long
time, you know And we've been trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: get it out to the to the public for a long
Do you know this Brandon?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been telling you like dude,
we need to get this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to get this out We need to get
this out Yeah, you know But it's it just
[SPEAKER_03]: comes down to it goes to the same thing
You know I tell people if you're using
[SPEAKER_03]: something that works for you and you've
used it for a really long time You don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have issues stick to what works for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all we can tell you is what
works for us You know all we can say is
[SPEAKER_03]: hey listen, we run almost 4,000 lights in
LA Where we have to deal with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: issues, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: We got homeless people right outside the
door, you know and We play around with
[SPEAKER_03]: with heating the rooms a lot, you know
after each run As hot as we can get on,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and when I say as hot as we can
get them 150 degrees plus Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know because because that temperature
matters, you know If you if you really
[SPEAKER_03]: look at the chart and what actually starts
killing things, you know You got to get
[SPEAKER_03]: the rooms really hot, you know,
I mean we've gotten So hot before that we
[SPEAKER_03]: broke the sprinkler beds before You know
So you got to be careful, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm not talking getting your room to a
hundred degrees I'm talking about getting
[SPEAKER_03]: your room to a hundred and fifty degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the hottest?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like 150 on the floor 165 on the
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Yeah, so what we do for that and this
is a really good tip for any grower
[SPEAKER_03]: without plants that was with not without
there was no place
[SPEAKER_03]: In your room and now all the plants are
out, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything that was airborne any spores
or anything that that could have could
[SPEAKER_03]: have Gotten into your room at that point
is the time to heat treat your room as
[SPEAKER_03]: fast as you get the plants out of there as
fast as you can heat treat that room
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I say heat treat a hundred and
fifty degrees, there's a there's a number
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll I'll I'll come back and edit this And
get the exact number but we shoot for as
[SPEAKER_03]: high as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta remember at 120 it doesn't go as
like powdery mildew even if we don't you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, if we never have an issue we do this
we do this religiously at all of our
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities and the way we get this is we
set off our air conditioners we turn on
[SPEAKER_03]: our dehumidifiers because the
dehumidifiers make heat and we turn our
[SPEAKER_03]: lights up all of our lights up to 100% and
we let the room bake How long how long
[SPEAKER_03]: usually three hours three hours,
yeah Yeah, and the key is not doing it and
[SPEAKER_03]: going home and then coming back the next
day when you're when you're I mean We've
[SPEAKER_03]: literally had schedule 80 melt on the wall
because the room gets so hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah So on using the Athena IPM Look,
are you using are you using anything else
[SPEAKER_00]: then other than Athena IPM to?
[SPEAKER_03]: Spray No, not currently, you know,
I mean we'll we'll uh in our in our
[SPEAKER_03]: nursery We'll hit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll hit the moms with regalia every once
in a while You know as if not as a drench
[SPEAKER_03]: as a foliar, but our main go go to spray
is IPM That's our that's our go-to.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our you know, we you got to
remember It's a drench you have to drench
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants you you can't just go in the
room and Open the door up and spray a few
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sprayed my room.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to saturate The plants top the
bottom we get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get the stems we get those plants
should be dripping Yeah, two times a week,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean minimum is two times a week,
you know To be honest if you have a
[SPEAKER_03]: problem, you know If you're battling
something like p.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or might or something I'd hit it as often
as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd hit it sometimes twice in a twice in
the same day You know morning and later on
[SPEAKER_03]: in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean this is if you're battling
Something bad, you know, I mean we haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: battled anything in years, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we keep really clean sterile
facilities But if I came in here and I
[SPEAKER_03]: seen I mean, I don't remember the last
time I seen a spider mite, you know I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean, but if someone was like,
hey, we've seen some ice or something,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I go I go to war with them,
you know, and I'd get part, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but he treating With IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean really killer combo right there
Okay Cool yeah, that's not Very often when
[SPEAKER_00]: you talk to somebody at that scale and
they're saying hey, I use one thing So
[SPEAKER_00]: people are just probably like how's you
know, and I had the reason why is because
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the same reaction Yeah, when we were
when we were developing it and going over
[SPEAKER_00]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I brought I use one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Geez, I mean we'll bust out a sanity
2.0.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oxidate 2.0.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll bust it out We'll rotate every once
in a while, you know what I mean just for
[SPEAKER_03]: peace of mind So we're not using the same
thing over and over again, you know what I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, we'll use we'll use some
regalia on the moms just to boost their
[SPEAKER_03]: immune system early on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But are we spraying regalia in all the
rooms all the time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're doing IPM.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you know, I mean I think that it just
comes down to Like I said if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: spraying something in your facility And
you're not having any issues stick to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep going with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep going with it, you know, I Sop for
cloning, you know, that's probably you
[SPEAKER_00]: know Maybe what EC value you know,
what cubes are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you like to feed EC value in your
cubes?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you like to maintain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe possibly a drench initial drench you
see and yeah, what do you use?
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, so we have a What we call the
nursery, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a nursery crew that handles all
of our cuttings and our moms and all that
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff and This is all stuff that we've
done over the years and we've kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: refined it and we're all we all do the
same thing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have one major hub that puts out all
of our cuttings for us and all of our moms
[SPEAKER_03]: But each facility also does their own moms
and cuttings So imagine you need 10,000
[SPEAKER_03]: cuts a week, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: 7,000 of those cuttings come from our
nursery and then you're responsible for
[SPEAKER_03]: your Every location.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and that's how we run our locations,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because all of our genetics aren't in one
building So if we ever have an issue,
[SPEAKER_03]: right everything is protected.
[SPEAKER_03]: So each facility houses genetics,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say we had a fire or God forbid
anything happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: We somebody broke in and stole our
genetics, you know, which would be
[SPEAKER_03]: impossible to do You're talking about
thousands of lights, you know But at least
[SPEAKER_03]: we know we have them backed up somewhere
and they're not with some other random
[SPEAKER_03]: person that we don't know Or some tissue
culture lab that we don't know what they
[SPEAKER_03]: do behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we kind of protect all of our genetics
in house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah So Right, so when you when I knew
this question was gonna come up so I wrote
[SPEAKER_03]: it all down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So three mls grow a B Right two mls of Cal
Mag that gives you an EC 0.7 Okay pH of
[SPEAKER_03]: 5.5 5.7.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is taking your initial preso
Right, you get your clone tray.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get your individual cubes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're on a map, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We take that right three mls a three mls
B, right two mls Cal Mag, right pH of 5.5
[SPEAKER_03]: 5.7 we do 5.7, but I always say 5.5.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen if it's 5.4 to 5.8, you're fine
Yeah, but everyone likes know what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do it at 5.7 We played yeah,
yeah, we played around with lower pH is
[SPEAKER_03]: higher pH is We've had great results with
all of them 5.7 5.5 puts us right where we
[SPEAKER_03]: want to be at Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you've you've done Your initial
soaking you plugged your cuttings now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time to water them, right now They're
they're starting to bust.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's time to watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do you wait?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many days you usually I know it's all
different, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know usually unusual two weeks to
20 and 12 at 10 days to 20 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah 10 to 20 days depending on the
strength first watering First watering
[SPEAKER_00]: Five to ten five to ten five to ten.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, depending.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's you know, these ones dried out quick
They're busting roots fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just see them start coming out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't pull them out You know five
days, you know, but it's also We grow so
[SPEAKER_03]: many different varieties, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean you're talking hundreds and
hundreds of different strains,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are five days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are or you know, 10 days,
you know, yeah so clumpy is four to four
[SPEAKER_03]: and a half ml per gallon All right,
2.5 cal mag All right, that's get you an
[SPEAKER_03]: EC of 1.1 and then same thing ph 5.7.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay Okay, cool No cleans Say that again
no cleans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a reason why not using?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so we'll use plans as a dump,
you know, we'll dunk the cuttings and
[SPEAKER_03]: cleanse You know, we use it as a foliar,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and then after after they start
busting their roots then we'll add the
[SPEAKER_03]: claims to it Okay, you know and that's
just like I said, that's what the nursery
[SPEAKER_03]: feels comfortable doing You know and then
from there on out it gets plans all the
[SPEAKER_03]: moms get plans added to it But that's you
know, that's the guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we feel comfortable doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey I'm not gonna tell you with the
results that we get these guys are pumping
[SPEAKER_03]: up I'm talking, you know 6,000 cuts a week
10,000 cuts, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Per facility, you know, I'm not gonna tell
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Do something a little bit different
try to tweak this I tell that to a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people just yeah, but we We foliar with
plans all the time, you know, I was gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: think I guess that would be part of our
IPM to you know, we'll The only thing is
[SPEAKER_03]: you do have to you do have to use a lot of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's only downfall It's like how many ml
do you have off the top 300 and something
[SPEAKER_03]: mls.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like 300 and something Mls per
gallon, which is a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know So but it's also if you're
having an issue or you see something that
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't like it's a go-to You know start
hitting things with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it doesn't have any it's not
harsh on the plants Yeah, real real quick
[SPEAKER_03]: on When people are asking questions in the
comment, we'll try to get to some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: questions in the comment Cool if there's a
bunch of spam then Yeah, if you see any
[SPEAKER_00]: good ones shout them out and then we'll
just go over real quick So we got SLP for
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the VC value on that Co2
controllers and regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you feel comfortable talking about
what you're using in your rooms and yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: sure So we use big giant co2 tanks liquid
co2 And we have a company that comes and
[SPEAKER_03]: they fill our co2 so like we're at the
factory Right now for here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have like eight or nine giant co2 tanks
and That feeds each room.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're required to have a high co2 monitor
in every single room and From there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All we're doing is a simple co2 regulator
was it a Cat what a titan titan,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know Cheap titan regulator,
you know That's turning the co2 on and
[SPEAKER_03]: off, you know But but yeah liquid co2 We
used to use gas and we had issues with
[SPEAKER_03]: propane and the natural gas and then you
know Bottles are really hard to fill.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we use the service that does big huge
baths of liquid co2 What about controller
[SPEAKER_00]: wise?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you guys on the controller?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we used to use Sentinel which they
make the best controller where they stop
[SPEAKER_03]: making them for some reason out of the
blue They just stop making them Most of
[SPEAKER_03]: our facilities are second all we've been
running for years and we haven't had any
[SPEAKER_03]: issues Yeah, but that's new also,
you know, it's not it's not something that
[SPEAKER_03]: we've done in the past So cut a hay will
be all on that Okay Now any so you guys
[SPEAKER_03]: are using gross inch right now Yes,
and then So we've used gross dance at all
[SPEAKER_03]: of our facilities and then cut a hay
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Full full climate full full
monitoring Is there a reason why you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at doing that or Looking at making
that transition was it is more available
[SPEAKER_00]: more info.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you I?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mean just the flexibility we have at that
facility we can pretty much have every
[SPEAKER_02]: single solenoid in the building get a
different nutrient and or feed and or time
[SPEAKER_02]: per day like just the Full flexibility
that we have at that location compared to
[SPEAKER_02]: some of our other ones We've basically
taken like everything we've learned at
[SPEAKER_02]: these past eight facilities that we've
built nine facilities that we've built we
[SPEAKER_02]: put it all in the cut ahead, so Definitely
kind of like the top Technological one
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have with kind of the most Kind of
Tech fancy stuff you could say short
[SPEAKER_02]: short, you know full monitoring full
recirculation Yeah, everything on Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the masterpiece it's Roche's master
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's gonna be big,
you know, and then I Get a lot of this all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time Cal Mag with the proline
everyone's trying to Add Cal Mag to the
[SPEAKER_00]: proline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys ever ever add Cal Mag by using
Proline?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't know why no Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't I don't understand why someone
would do that You know, I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean Cal Mag Cal Mag Cal
Mag, you know People are trained and they
[SPEAKER_03]: get it instilled in their head,
you know, but all that stuff is built into
[SPEAKER_03]: the line You know We spent a lot of years
testing and sending shit off the labs and
[SPEAKER_03]: are being it going over and over and over
With it that line is figured out when you
[SPEAKER_03]: can ask Brandon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't let anything get by me Yeah,
nothing got by these facilities that
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't tested 100% and we went through
everything a million times and and and
[SPEAKER_03]: Trial and error did over and over again
before we took this is the one release it
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no one has spent more money than R&D
than we have I promise you that Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have retired a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, so now I'm glad we got that
other way because you're we're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: guys all the time trying to add Cal Mag to
the proline I'm like just don't ruin it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the ratios are perfect You got
to pay attention to your shop volumes and
[SPEAKER_00]: your EC and your media and how you're
gonna do that but as far as What it is
[SPEAKER_00]: just don't add anything to it and mess it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's kind of my So we're so we're
clear with everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's there's two lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a liquid line and there's a
Powderline the liquid line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you add tell me The proline the
powder line you do not out count make it's
[SPEAKER_03]: already built in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 100% Did you take down some
questions there's some good ones you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to So this is some questions that just
come up temp plus VPD in flower what Temp
[SPEAKER_00]: in which what do you like to run your your
temp in humidity and flower for VPD?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean we kind of just follow that VVD
chart right as long as we can we push it
[SPEAKER_03]: we push the VPD chart as long as we can
right so if you look at that chart,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it The way everybody builds
their facility is a little bit different,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: so if you look at that chart and 78
degrees and 69 percent humidity puts you
[SPEAKER_03]: right in that sweet spot and That's that
number you should stick for you know for
[SPEAKER_03]: us our temperatures are a little bit
warmer You know, we run our we run our
[SPEAKER_03]: room more warmer and more humid earlier on
veg and flour You know But you also you
[SPEAKER_03]: see other people and they have all these
humidifiers in their room and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to get as much Humidity in their
room as possible the way we build into the
[SPEAKER_03]: design rooms is we don't need to do that
Because we built it within the air
[SPEAKER_03]: conditioning system within the walls we
make it so our rooms can get humid when we
[SPEAKER_03]: want them to be humid And when we want to
pull out that humidity, we can pull all
[SPEAKER_03]: that humidity out, you know, so if I tell
somebody Hey, we run our rooms at 85
[SPEAKER_03]: degrees and 70 percent humidity early in
veg and flour And they're trying and
[SPEAKER_03]: trying and trying to get there and they
just can't get there and they're chasing
[SPEAKER_03]: those numbers You know, I'd rather see
somebody say hey I can get to that same
[SPEAKER_03]: sweet spot because if you look at the VPD
chart That's not the only number that gets
[SPEAKER_03]: you there You know, so maybe I'm at 78
Degrees and I'm at 65 percent humidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're doing we're actually doing the
same exact thing You know, so when people
[SPEAKER_03]: ask what your temperature is humidity It's
a great question because it's very
[SPEAKER_03]: important, you know But you might not be
able to get your temp in humidity where I
[SPEAKER_03]: can get my temp in humidity at and there's
nothing wrong with that You just need to
[SPEAKER_03]: look at the VPD chart.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to be right within that sweet
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, cool What we do you I know ideally
we don't like to spray indefinite Flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean with IPM, but what week do you go
up to?
[SPEAKER_00]: What week if you're on a we'll do two
different questions if you're on a
[SPEAKER_00]: maintenance program You don't have any
problems and using Athena IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you stop spraying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Athena IPM like week two Week two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, but hey listen if you're
like, hey I've seen problems pop up in the
[SPEAKER_03]: in the past and I've had issues I mean you
can spray that all the way, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no issues with testing or
anything, you know It's just you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: spray your plant flake flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody wants to do that You know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's are you gonna have residuals
and are you gonna pass testing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely You're gonna pass
testing, you know, I mean, you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna have any of you, you know But we
always say you got to find that sweet spot
[SPEAKER_03]: of when you can spray too You know and
same thing just because we say hey we stop
[SPEAKER_03]: as early as possible If you're having
issues, I'm not gonna tell you to stop
[SPEAKER_03]: spraying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah You know, I'm not gonna tell you
don't spray till week three You know You
[SPEAKER_00]: need to spray when you have a problem,
but ideally week two stop Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: ideally with anything, you know,
I mean you want you want to cut it off as
[SPEAKER_03]: early as possible You know and there's a
thing, you know plant count.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many plants do you have in your room?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your airflow?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's all that stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's guys I got a fray till
week six or seven in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not ideal you shouldn't have to do
that if you're on your plans You shouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do that if you're happy to do that
you need to be focusing on your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and fixing the problems there
before You know, yeah airflow has a little
[SPEAKER_03]: airflow is is very very very important
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so We'll hit them with the foliar
early in flower We don't hit them
[SPEAKER_03]: religiously because there's not always
times that we want to necessarily slow
[SPEAKER_03]: down the stretch Yeah, you know,
so if there's times where hey we over veg
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit the room wasn't ready This is
the thing is we never chop our rooms
[SPEAKER_03]: early, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have rooms that go 70 plus days,
you know, we don't we don't grow We don't
[SPEAKER_03]: flower based on hash, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not we don't have any rooms that
are dedicated to hatch Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we flower a room and that room is
gonna need to go 72 days The hash makers
[SPEAKER_03]: can come in at 65 days when they scope and
they say this is perfect They can come in
[SPEAKER_03]: at 65 days and take the plants out.
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest of the plants are gonna stay
inside the room We're not gonna go and
[SPEAKER_03]: talk some room at 50 days because it makes
the best blonde prettiest hash and then
[SPEAKER_03]: the same flowers end up on the shelf with
I think that's also important to know too,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know is We're taking these plants,
you know So if you have if you have plants
[SPEAKER_03]: that hey Maybe you took them over a week
because they just weren't done enough or
[SPEAKER_03]: you have one strain in there That needs to
go a little bit longer Then we'll hit them
[SPEAKER_03]: with some power outside to slow down the
stretch, you know, I mean everyone knows
[SPEAKER_03]: it's amazing stuff You hit them you hit
them in flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean it makes plants stack.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great stuff You know, it's a great
for you to act, you know But are we
[SPEAKER_03]: hitting every single room?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we hitting Alec push cake with it that
that stacks hard?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, are we hitting Mac with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we hitting some OGs that got over
vegged a little bit and I'm looking on
[SPEAKER_03]: like damn They should have went out of day
7 and not day 12 Yeah, we'll get them for
[SPEAKER_03]: sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Okay For me all that stuff I've
always been taught that Most of that stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: regalia RSI it always works better as a
foliar spray, you know as growers were
[SPEAKER_03]: lazy Of course, you want to just give it
to them in the roof and I have to deal
[SPEAKER_03]: with spraying But I've always been taught
and I've always seen with my own eyes that
[SPEAKER_03]: foliar spray foliar spraying these things
is You know, it's like me and your
[SPEAKER_03]: friends, you know, if it works,
you know, it hits them under what?
[SPEAKER_00]: So have you seen a difference in yield
From proto blended or you know or growth
[SPEAKER_03]: from proto blended at all in flower No,
you know and it comes down to the same
[SPEAKER_03]: thing, you know, it's it's It comes down
to the grower, you know, there's no we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't run now I can tell you this I have
seen a difference compared to other lines,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know when we did side-by-sides with
with Blended and pro line, you know our
[SPEAKER_03]: liquid line.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean it was we Seen incredible
differences quality wise yield wise but
[SPEAKER_03]: neck-to-neck head-to-head I mean,
they're very similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're both really clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: They both they both go and clean come out
clean, you know White ash, you know flush
[SPEAKER_03]: easily, you know But yeah, it's it's the I
can't say I see some huge difference,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know But there's also you know,
if somebody overfed their plants with the
[SPEAKER_03]: powder line And then underfed their plant
or gave the right amount with the liquid
[SPEAKER_03]: line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you're gonna have better
results Yeah, so I feel like when I see
[SPEAKER_03]: people test things right and they use a
new nature They're like I didn't work that
[SPEAKER_03]: good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have that good of results Well,
if you did the same exact thing you were
[SPEAKER_03]: doing with your own nutrient line You
know, of course you didn't have the same
[SPEAKER_03]: results because everything's a little bit
different There's different ratios and
[SPEAKER_03]: there's different numbers and plants
uptake things differently, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's like it's a good baseline You know
where to start, you know what your plants
[SPEAKER_03]: like but there's always that Little bit of
tweaking higher You know Let's talk to you
[SPEAKER_00]: too real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there I mean, do you do you adjust the
CO2 in your flower rooms at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as levels of parts per million or
do you equate CO2 levels of parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million to your feed EC at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: We just turn it down to 500 parts per
million like first day of week 7 that's
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty like we usually keep it right at
like 12 to 1500 parts per million and then
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking right at week 7 cut it down to 500
day 1 week 8 it's off Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I love it simple One other question I
seen in here is somebody asking us if we
[SPEAKER_03]: could do a clone feed chart Yeah,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we we we shared exactly what we do for
clones, but Athena would be more than
[SPEAKER_03]: happy for our customers to make a clone
feed chart because we want you guys to
[SPEAKER_03]: have the same success we're having For
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have it up by next week So towards
the 1500 parts per minute on the on the
[SPEAKER_00]: PPMs and then week 7 drop it to 500 parts
per million Yeah, I mean you can go in if
[SPEAKER_03]: you wanted to you can match your feedings
and and and do all that stuff You know
[SPEAKER_03]: what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we've done it before but 12 to
1500 seems to be the sweet spot and and
[SPEAKER_03]: another big thing that people always miss
out on is CO2 and bench CO2 early in
[SPEAKER_03]: flower, you know I mean one of the most
important things in the time that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna see the best growth with CO2 is
Early in veg and early in flower,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I mean it's 1500 you know,
I could gotta remember we're running our
[SPEAKER_03]: veg is really hot hot and humid You know,
and that's when CO2 works the best,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, so we'll get those I mean you I
mean, that's that's how we got the name
[SPEAKER_03]: the jungle boys You know you walk into one
of our rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking jungle in here, you know So
so you walk into our bedrooms you're
[SPEAKER_03]: sweating your glasses automatically I
can't even wear glasses inside the
[SPEAKER_03]: bedroom, you know, because you're they
automatically fuck you know and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: when That's when you see a that's when you
see that that that explosive growth isn't
[SPEAKER_03]: you're hitting them early in veg and early
in flower with CO2 nice Somebody asked
[SPEAKER_03]: your time really quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just write cure time and flush time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we flush for about two weeks or The
last two weeks of growth is when we're
[SPEAKER_03]: flushing our plants But we're also
monitoring the inside of our cubes and
[SPEAKER_03]: we're dropping our feedings So I mean we
can we can flush a plant and get it to a
[SPEAKER_03]: zero EC in a day or two You know,
but we also allow that plant to recover
[SPEAKER_03]: and take all that up You know and make
sure that there's nothing inside of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So The easy answer is two weeks of flush
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and then
[SPEAKER_03]: Slowly dropping EC value Slowly dropping
EC values as we pull our dry backs as
[SPEAKER_03]: we're drying the plants out more,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So later in flower you want to take that
water out of the plant You don't want a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of water in the plant later in
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you want to do higher dry backs Yes,
but you also got to be careful with doing
[SPEAKER_03]: dry backs later in flower because if
there's a bunch of nutrient inside that
[SPEAKER_03]: cube That's when you walk in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why'd my plants fry why they look like
shit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do I have all this burnt leaf on my
plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because inside of your cube had a high EC
and you were pulling it back and the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't water to uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah What spray are you using for our
foiler feeds or for sprays?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we don't really I mean if
anything, you know Back in the day you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys made The paint sprayer, what's that
company Graco a lot of money?
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys you guys I mean their revenue
when you guys first dropped the paint
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayer Crazy, I mean, I know I switched
from that, you know That system that was a
[SPEAKER_00]: game changer for sure yeah, but I Think
you guys were you the tram 50 right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah now we just have drams and all of our
facilities, you know, they cost as much as
[SPEAKER_03]: a fucking Honda Civic, you know,
they're expensive, you know every time I
[SPEAKER_03]: see one of them like damn I just bought a
Honda Civic right now, you know But you
[SPEAKER_03]: know the time that you save and the Being
able to have a hose that you can go
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout the whole facility like here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have it upstairs in the downstairs So
we have one upstairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't have three here, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have three here We have one in
the we have one of the vaginal humps one
[SPEAKER_03]: flower flower rooms downstairs and one far
over flower rooms upstairs So we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have an elevator here So we can't be
carrying those things up and down the
[SPEAKER_03]: stairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah We had another question here curing
process, you know, how long are you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: carrying flower for temps?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so So same thing that we've always
said 60 60 is what we shoot for in the
[SPEAKER_03]: drying room You know 60 degrees 60 percent
humidity, you know and depending on how
[SPEAKER_03]: the temperature And whether is outside and
and all that stuff 14 to 16 days the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants will sit inside there and hang You
know, so at that time that that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: start of the cure process, you know And
then from there they get pinned up in big
[SPEAKER_03]: bands, you know where they'll sit for
about 10 to 14 days Yes, yeah in bands,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and then from there they'll go
to the trimmers You know, so so total cure
[SPEAKER_03]: time is three to four weeks, you know
counting drying and when they go Into the
[SPEAKER_03]: bins, you know, which is plenty of time,
you know, you got to remember No one has
[SPEAKER_03]: done more testing than we have and no one
can tell you that those turpines start to
[SPEAKER_03]: degrade And anybody that tells you that a
long cure is better That's some bro
[SPEAKER_03]: science shit because I spend millions and
millions of dollars on testing and sending
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis to labs and telling me when is
the peak time for turpines and When once
[SPEAKER_03]: that cannabis is dry the Every single day
of those turpines to great So people say
[SPEAKER_03]: why don't you why don't you guys cure your
your your flower?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we don't want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like saying why don't you open a
banana and sit on a table and eat it three
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks later?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exactly it's the same exact thing
happen You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the testing tells us this all the time
because when we send a fresh flower That's
[SPEAKER_03]: just been cured and just been trimmed to
the lab and it's three percent turpines
[SPEAKER_03]: Right and then three weeks later.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one Percent turpines, you know,
it's degrading, you know, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I'm always I've been saying this for
years You know cannabis is like fresh
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I like my fruit fresh I don't
like my fruit You know four weeks later
[SPEAKER_03]: when it's been sitting in the bowl and
it's all rotted out and it's the same
[SPEAKER_00]: exact thing Ideally what how many weeks do
you like to see it on your shelf?
[SPEAKER_03]: I Mean, so let's take we we hung it in our
room that took about 14 days Right and
[SPEAKER_03]: then let's say seven to ten days by the
time it gets Bend up and trimmed up and
[SPEAKER_03]: processed and sent off to to the lab You
know, so from the time it's actually dried
[SPEAKER_03]: completely dried seven to fourteen days
Okay, and that's as fast as possible that
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean you you can't do any faster because
it has to be trimmed It has to be sent out
[SPEAKER_03]: for testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to wait for the test results Then
once you get the test results you package
[SPEAKER_03]: it you stick great you put it out in the
show That's as fast as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We might be able to save off a day or two
But with the legal market that's about as
[SPEAKER_00]: fast as you can get it out Yeah,
you seen that delay with testing probably
[SPEAKER_00]: about a week or so five days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, you know if Three days is
like a really fast turnaround for the lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: but five days is about where all the labs
are out right now Okay I think those are
[SPEAKER_00]: the main big ones, you know, yeah Real
quick I just read another one unknown
[SPEAKER_03]: profit.
[SPEAKER_03]: What up, bro EC and cocoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the maximum you suggest?
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you caught the beginning of this we
talked about it and we're gonna replay it
[SPEAKER_03]: it goes for this When we talk about cocoa
when we talk about Rockwell, they're both
[SPEAKER_03]: hydroponic mediums They're both very
similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only downfall fall about cocoa is you
on order to substrate There's not a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: tools out there like grow sense that'll
let you monitor the substrate so With
[SPEAKER_03]: cocoa if you're better off getting a
little bit of runoff with cocoa And with
[SPEAKER_03]: that as long as you're getting runoff you
can feed pretty hot, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking clones I'm not talking seed,
you know, of course seeds need less EC and
[SPEAKER_03]: you can feed them a lot less But I'm
talking an old clone that's been around
[SPEAKER_03]: forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most all of them can take a really high
You see, you know a 3.0 EC and cocoa no
[SPEAKER_03]: issues whatsoever You know, but you're
hitting that 3.0 in cocoa and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: letting your plants dry back a whole Lot
then you're gonna have a bunch of issues
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, that's why I'm saying make sure you
have runoff if you're if you're playing
[SPEAKER_00]: with higher EC and cocoa I Know it's a
little early, you know as far as the LEDs
[SPEAKER_00]: go You know, we've done a lot of testing
on him but How you feeling how you feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: about LEDs versus HPS on that front,
you know, I know it's kind Of off the
[SPEAKER_03]: topic, but I get I'm getting a lot of
yeah, I Mean, I'm stoked about the LEDs
[SPEAKER_03]: for the shorter plants You know so that
those short to medium plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm super stoked about them I think they
they they can they can hold their own,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know The far bigger plants that stack
all the way down and they grow bigger and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're I don't think the LED is where
it's out for us But if but we grow so many
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties that we could literally have
varieties that we just grow under LEDs You
[SPEAKER_03]: know, yeah, so a lot of our shorter and
medium sized plants All those plants are
[SPEAKER_03]: going into our LED rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just had we had a 77 light D e lux room
at Cudahy and we pulled those down We're
[SPEAKER_03]: putting up LEDs because we were stoked
with the results and we figured hey we can
[SPEAKER_03]: grow our shorter to medium plants here
Which we have a ton of you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's gonna be the plan for our LEDs
right now is we're gonna focus on our Our
[SPEAKER_03]: short and our medium plants will be
growing under LEDs Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's good to know and what do you
think?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do get a lot of inbound about double
stacking on flour What is your opinion on
[SPEAKER_00]: the efficiencies of double stacked flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: And would you guys ever think about doing
a double stack flower and why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've thought about it for sure I
mean there's been many a time that I've
[SPEAKER_03]: walked in a room like we should double
stack this room, you know It just becomes
[SPEAKER_03]: it comes down to quality Right when you
start having things that aren't in front
[SPEAKER_03]: of your face every single day things on
the top kind of get forgotten about Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's not right in front of your
face every single day So when you're doing
[SPEAKER_03]: it on such a large scale, you know If you
know I had a garage and I had you know
[SPEAKER_03]: eight lights and I was double stacking I'm
there every single day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working sure You know, but when you're
on a large scale and things get put on top
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're not in front of your face a
lot of times things get neglected,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, but If you're if you're if
you're going walk for a lot and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: growing a large plant and you're double
stacking and you're putting LED and LED
[SPEAKER_03]: but you could do the same thing with an
HPS plant grow a bigger plant and get you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, I have to see the numbers I still
haven't seen anything that fully convinces
[SPEAKER_03]: me quality wise that double stacking is
where it's at quality and quantity wise,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, but listen, I'm open to
anything, you know, like I'm not gonna say
[SPEAKER_03]: I would never do a double stack because
Next week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna do a double stack, you know,
I'm not saying I am but I probably will
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but right now I haven't seen
anything that says we need to go double
[SPEAKER_02]: stack Yeah, you know need to have the
facility for it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can't do a double stack in a 12
foot ceiling room I mean, it's just gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: make your life so hard Yeah It's pretty
much it Hey guys, I think that's how you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys doing good Appreciate everybody
coming on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're gonna we're gonna post this right so
everyone could know it's cool that this
[SPEAKER_00]: was Invaluable information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's big to you know for for a
cultivator, you know like you guys to be
[SPEAKER_00]: just giving this information out to the
masses is it's huge and I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that's why you're the jungle boys
and a lot of people respect that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I know that I have my life as
far as my business is my grows and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I've come a long way since
Since since I started following you many
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago and and just I know a lot of
people appreciate it and it means a lot So
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you very much Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys Thanks All right You
