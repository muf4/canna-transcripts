[SPEAKER_01]: A fair portion of what Shingle Hill,
my company, does is work with large pools
[SPEAKER_01]: of capital that are trying to figure out
how to play the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of them are looking at
investments they've already made that they
[SPEAKER_01]: believe to be relatively safe in the
industry, which for the most part the last
[SPEAKER_01]: year or two has been the Canadian
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as we've gotten to the point where
those guys are building out infrastructure
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're talking about what cannabis
can consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at the Canadian market
versus the Californian market and you
[SPEAKER_01]: think 35 million people in Canada and 39
million people in California, you can
[SPEAKER_01]: roughly get a sense of how big that market
ultimately will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call it a $7 billion, $8 billion annual
market in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you look at what they're actually
building out in the way of infrastructure
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're talking about the Canapes,
the Auroras, the Afrias, the Kronos
[SPEAKER_01]: cobbling together different groups,
Green Organic Dutchman, all these
[SPEAKER_01]: companies that are all still building out
because demand is still outpacing supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately you're going to hit a point
of equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plans these guys have,
if you actually look at it, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: blowing right past that equilibrium point.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going right to a point where
they're saying, we're going to do 900,000
[SPEAKER_01]: square feet of greenhouse or we're going
to do whatever, how many hectares or how
[SPEAKER_01]: many hundreds of thousands of square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you actually extrapolate that
back against what the size of the market
[SPEAKER_01]: is, they're building it out in a way that
can't be supported.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you talk to these CEOs,
they're like, oh, that's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to export.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're able to export in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, OK, to who?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's going to buy it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now they're talking about the
European market, which for the near term
[SPEAKER_01]: is probably viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany might be viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Portugal might be viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately Germany's got its own
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Portugal's got its own market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every one of the European countries will
have their own market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a stop gap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a short term proposition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're talking about some of the
Latin countries that are coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are talking in Canada about
exporting to Colombia.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I'll explain that to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of production is much lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a perfect growing climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 12 hours of sunshine every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 12 hours of darkness every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the perfect climate for flowering and
it's the perfect temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've got mountainous areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got lower areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's so many different
Appalachians that you can actually work
[SPEAKER_01]: from to say, OK, what do I want to grow
and where?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's deciding, do I want a coastal area
for my pinot noir grapes versus do I want
[SPEAKER_01]: open, warm weather for my chard?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same idea down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can produce stuff where your labor
cost is next to nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your energy cost is next to nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your access to perfect sunny days is next
to nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these Canadian companies are saying,
oh, we're going to be the producer for the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: What makes sense is finding a great
growing climate, producing an abundance
[SPEAKER_01]: there and then shipping from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When a global market emerges or even a
North American market, Canada is not
[SPEAKER_01]: supplying North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada is not supplying anything but maybe
regionally in Canada because they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have the ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody, literally nobody is going to be
growing indoors in four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're producing $2 a gram instead of 30
cents a gram in a super high tech
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse that's fully automated with
robotics attached to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the industry is moving
that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these guys that are building these
reeds to support indoor growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep telling them, OK, that's great for
the first couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have oversized returns on
your cap rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, can that guy stay in
business?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something right now that I
think people just aren't thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: is, what's the cost of production need to
be to be competitive in a global
[SPEAKER_01]: marketplace?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not going to be in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all we have to do is look at the cut
flower market in Carpinteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That all went to Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: The entire thing went to Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at the tomato market.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to talk to someone that
understands this, talk to Fife Symington
[SPEAKER_01]: from Copper State Farms in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fife undercut every one of his competitors
in tomatoes that he's producing in Cooley
[SPEAKER_01]: County, Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what he did, he came back and
bought those competitors, the greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_01]: and now is producing cannabis out of
Snowflake, Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a 30 acre facility that used to
be one of his competitors in tomatoes that
[SPEAKER_01]: he crushed by going to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that doesn't show you the migration
of the market, Mexico just announced that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're opening a market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been fielding calls nonstop the last
two weeks from the Mexican market saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: we really want to do something down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, granted, you've got to think about
the graft and corruption that exists in
[SPEAKER_01]: that country and the cartels and still the
stranglehold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might be some time before it goes in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're going to say, would you
prefer to be a cultivator of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: Sinaloa versus in Minnesota, it's not even
close.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no comparison.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really what I think people need
to realize that as migration happens
[SPEAKER_01]: towards greater legalization, it's all
going to be about the highest quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: lowest cost, just like any other
commodity.
It's all going to be about the highest
quality, lowest cost, just like any other commodity.
