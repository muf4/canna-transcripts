[SPEAKER_00]: We're all working independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one person controls this industry as
much as they think they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're all small participants that
combine, we make up a big tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just trying to figure out how do
you share technology?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you use what you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we make money off each other's
stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you had a varietal that had a
demand and I was allowed to license it
[SPEAKER_00]: through my nursery, then I could provide
it to cultivators that could then
[SPEAKER_00]: subsequently sell it, which is what I'm
doing with with Berners Crew, where we
[SPEAKER_00]: know that the lemonade line is everything
coming out of Martin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Martin has the 11 acre campus over in
Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that massive facility that was the old
naval base, the Safeway warehouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's all Martin's stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you met Martin when you were sitting
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it is what we found when we
went into it was virally contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we did the first, so the first
project we worked with on this was through
[SPEAKER_00]: Martin as the R&D because he said,
listen, let me work with the product
[SPEAKER_00]: because I can push it through my
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can move it on the end zone,
but I'm having problems with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go through and they say,
well, this is all virally contaminated,
[SPEAKER_00]: which a lot of the stuff coming from there
is virally contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so they scrub it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so then Martin runs side by side
trials to be able to say, what are we
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference between the two
cultivars is night and day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you'd be banging because it's got an
ultra loud signature and it's got a built
[SPEAKER_00]: in branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lemon, pine, salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and, and unlike a lot of the
mono-turp lemons, it holds it all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: through a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't flare off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has a sesquic combination,
the sesquiterpene combination,
[SPEAKER_00]: turps that don't flare up under heat,
more multi bonds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what gives you the enjoyment after
the first hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people that smoke bongs or vapes,
they have a different situation than those
[SPEAKER_00]: that actually burn it because the heat is
burning off that, that complexity as you
[SPEAKER_00]: go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're left with is only heavily
multi bond terpenes at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lemonade holds it through the
piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, just like, just like the perp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always wondered, you know, when I was,
we were moving perp like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there pre-perp when perp,
nobody wanted perp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wanted black little pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next thing you know, nobody wants anything
but black little pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so perp comes out and actually wipes
out most of the genetic diversity in a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you weren't moving perp,
you weren't moving weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what made perp perp was that there was
that blunt revolution that was occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the blunt was coming out in full form
and perp had a high sesquiterpene
[SPEAKER_00]: combination that allowed you to hold a
flavor all to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, cannabis was still being
flipped through the windows of cars more
[SPEAKER_00]: than through storefronts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you looked at the baggie,
it had a distinctive orangey, charity
[SPEAKER_00]: looking hair with a heavy purple tone,
but it was a bright light royal purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't the typical heavy perp of like a
purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it's related to purple Kush
genealogically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So purple Kush is the, all these perps
come through purple Kush as a progenator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we can track it genetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the link on the DNA line,
but it had a radically different quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of a mouth appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so lo and behold, it's recognizable in
a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It holds in a blunt and it's great
Kool-Aid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, most of the ghettos where
the stuff was pushing heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm from the hood on East coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so great Kool-Aid is what we all
drank.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have multi-flavored Kool-Aids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so lo and behold, grape is popular,
holds in a blunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recognizable in a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden you have this magic little
trifecta of things that come together that
[SPEAKER_00]: create a billion dollar variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's trying to put together those same
kind of combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now you have, you know,
the, the OG, but OG isn't going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere because OG has an incredible,
aside of branding, it has a exceptionally
[SPEAKER_00]: high impact because Amircine has the
anesthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also has an exceptional complexity
within the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas you go through it, people are
happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a good quality OG, and you
consume it pretty much, you really don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a high ceiling to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you smoke it, you get a very
similar effect and you're happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it's one of the OGs,
it's really not a diluted watered down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even, and even though the,
the, the old OGs, the originals were
[SPEAKER_00]: running around 17, 18% when you scope
them, because me and Josh were talking in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a Carpinteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, he came to the lecture I gave
in Carpinteria about genetic mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about two months ago, month and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it the seed to soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck I wanted to go to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scotty Cressive and Scotty Granola.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and so, and then you had,
then you had Steve Cantwell from the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the No-Tilt, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they asked me to come in to kind of
tie the package together and then to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: look, this is where you're going to go
with all these technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you come in with your supplemental
greenhouses and then you come in with the
[SPEAKER_00]: No-Tilt situation where you're getting
biological, because really the cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: production is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're able to get this biological
circle completed and Cantwell's doing
[SPEAKER_00]: killer in Vegas with his No-Tilt
operations, cause he's not losing any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the product and having to blow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got Scotty Granola doing your
predicated testing to say, listen,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I see microbial levels here,
I know problems are about to be present
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even though, and he's, he's one of
Elaine Ingham's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: disciples and Elaine says, you can't use
science to predict, but you kind of can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even though a true scientist won't
do that because scientists is study,
[SPEAKER_00]: not prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make some pretty good,
God damn predictions based off of the
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets you allow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll, and I like it because it
creates the warning situations and you
[SPEAKER_00]: got, you got, and Scott Sharp and he's a,
a intelligent guy who is involved most
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely with cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these people coming in aren't
involved in cannabis production,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, cannabis sourcing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aloe vera part is, what are you guys
using it for?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using it and we, I'm using aloe vera
in terms of wedding agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wedding agents.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were saying that maybe only test
for 17, 19%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the, but the effect is phenomenal
because what we know is that really I have
[SPEAKER_00]: a, I, I was messing around with gene from
a mean gene for medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me and Gina buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he lets me access his cherry line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's his, it's his, but I have the
lime males too, but I mean the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cherry that he uses in the lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, Hey, listen, here's the seed
stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't let it out because it's,
it's, it is my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll, it'll send somebody right into
my lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I said, sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll work with it and I'll use it as
progenitor stock for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pull out a cutting of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is just as cherry as one could
humanly hope for it comes out of like 11
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half, 12%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I found that it's perfect for people
that let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We enjoy, I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I like something with a little more
power to it, but in terms of the quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact it's just resonates, but it lets
me use it for my girlfriend and for my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddies that can't smoke high potency,
devastating cannabis because they're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the effect they want and not get
blasted off the top of his shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get it because the flavor profile is
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was talking to Josh, we met at
Carpinteria and we were talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I didn't know who he was when we first
met.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, we just meet each other and we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Numerics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started talking about old OGs and I
didn't know who he was at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, all my old OGs that I got from
Mandel from, you know, like late 90,
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, they're all coming in around,
you know, 17, 18 points.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, he said, my stuff is coming
in never over 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I've never hit over 20 with my
foundation stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have, and then I have,
I, and so we can, we can, we can tweak it
[SPEAKER_00]: because we can drive our humidity levels
far down and I can get a higher trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can also drive the plant more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on what lab I use,
I can make these numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I'm looking at it for a period of
time and I see the graph, I say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa, that's a panga cut that I picked up
from Mandel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that we call the SFV cut those
two lemon lime, the two bookends of what
[SPEAKER_00]: he thought OG were that he got probably
out of you guys at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ugly sister of them to panga.
[SPEAKER_02]: It never looked like the original.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it works killer for hybridization for
outdoor because it has a, it has a faster
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a faster trigger outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use it in breeding projects to
upgrade what we want is what we call fuel
[SPEAKER_00]: designations, but with a faster trigger
time, because if I can get the,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I can get the OG to come in around that
first week of October versus the third
[SPEAKER_00]: week of October, I'm killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I got two weeks to process and get
it into the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he and I were chatting about,
and he goes, yay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he gave me some of the stuff that he
had grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, Hey, this is all stuff for my,
my original stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, and I never get over 20 with
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started talking about all the,
all the swings because now we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at OGs that are in 32s, but that's all
self and selected out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's where you start to see such a
huge propensity for PM problems,
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenic issues, viral issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just keep it for breeding purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I keep it so we don't ever not have
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, because it's, it's, it's a
foundation line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can grow it all the way through,
but I have to work my ass off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to work my ass off to keep it super
healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to burn sulfur burners the first
week maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to do every fucking preventative you
could think of to finish that harvest off
[SPEAKER_02]: with an A1 type thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too much work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's and it doesn't make it profitable
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you make any mistakes at all,
I'm doing, I'm doing this old reservation
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been collecting skunk from around
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from the early eighties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the chunks and, and, and I want to see
the range and tones and they all got wiped
[SPEAKER_00]: out because there was no charcoal
filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used to run these hot operations
using ozone technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to get from hospitals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went into the hospital and said,
how do you guys clean up your shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said they use ozone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a company in Texas Sana's
there that was a commercial ozone company
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would bring in the ozone tech and I
would blow all my ducks and vents as I
[SPEAKER_00]: vented them out of these houses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you let the, if you let the
ozone in the room, it'd wipe out all the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You haven't, you haven't, you're
everything possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killer grass though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're one look awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and so we, we, we ended up wiping
out these skunk situations and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as a smoker, I'm, I'm getting bored,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm smoking everything on the
fucking planet, but I'm getting bored.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted something from the past that had
been selected as smoke for generations
[SPEAKER_00]: from people from other countries and then
put together these, these varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, how do I access it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started going into a cruise over in
Europe that the stock had left Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern California in the eighties and
went over to Europe for holding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was able to mine it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would ship it back to me from
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started doing some recovery
work for people that had old stock that
[SPEAKER_00]: they had kept forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were having pathogenic issues and
they couldn't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, listen, we, we don't want
to give it up, but we're going to lose the
[SPEAKER_00]: varietal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we give it to you, would you clean it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can play with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it started letting me get into
these scumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go set up to do a whole breeding
project and I get ready to do all my work.
