[SPEAKER_01]: And because PEMF is such a, becoming big
ag, we're really starting to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: our waterways and the way that we're,
what water runoff is happening now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a crop that can save the earth,
what's going on and how can we save our
[SPEAKER_01]: waterways specifically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Leighton, what's a big solution in this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, by the way, what Josh is talking
about is very simple to do on a large
[SPEAKER_00]: scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that crop residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to talk about water harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys all know about a cistern
connected to your gutters, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to collect water when it's
raining, but how do you get water on a
[SPEAKER_00]: large scale when it's the middle of
summer?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Driving in here, I saw a few upland bogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so it's just basically a pit where
there's a bunch of moisture that's
[SPEAKER_00]: collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so instead of connecting your gutter
from the cistern and then dumping it,
[SPEAKER_00]: create a bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that bog does is it holds water
long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's in the bog?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can go hugel, put in logs,
sticks, chips, and that will hold the
[SPEAKER_00]: water long-term and prevent it from
migrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key to water harvesting is slowing it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know what erosion is, and erosion
has to be avoided.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stripping the organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stripping the soil that you're trying
to hold onto.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can slow water down,
you can prevent erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all know what swales are.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a bioswale?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill it with logs, fill it with chips,
cover it with dirt, and plant it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's going to hold water long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots from the plants on top will
prevent that 100-year storm from washing
[SPEAKER_00]: it away, which is, again, erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to prevent that so that when
you're looking at water movement across
[SPEAKER_00]: your soils, those roots are critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go a little deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they build tilth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They help put organic matter back into the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put carbon, which feeds the
microbiome, the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these wonderful things are
happening, and guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That water can now infiltrate instead of
just running across the top because of
[SPEAKER_00]: that never-having soil bare, always having
roots to hold it together and to
[SPEAKER_00]: continuously build organic matter,
which, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stores moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take it a little deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Groundwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know what groundwater is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the old days, we all dug wells,
and those wells we used to feed our
[SPEAKER_00]: animals or water our animals and sometimes
for our own drinking water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does a well do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it actually gives the water a place
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you to see how well you're
doing, no pun intended, as far as building
[SPEAKER_00]: groundwater up around your property,
and during the summer, you'll see that
[SPEAKER_00]: there actually is water there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your bioswales, your upland bogs,
which are slowly releasing that water back
[SPEAKER_00]: into the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing it does is if you pull water
out of there, it helps to wick the water
[SPEAKER_00]: back into that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as an emergency situation, you've got a
drought going on and you need to water
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants, the more you pull out of
there, the more it'll come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're really giving yourself a lot of
options to allowing yourself to harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: water slowly from the soil in order to
water whatever you need, and this can be
[SPEAKER_00]: done on large scale or small scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I love ponds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate the restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I'm even talking about this is
because of Wendy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years ago, she told me what the state
of California did to her in trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a pond in, and I was horrified to hear
that she's not allowed to have fish in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has to have a bullfrog mitigation
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: No bullfrogs in the pond, or we're going
to come and pump it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you stop nature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are these people that are deciding
that they should control nature?
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of building a pond for all that
expense, get smart, build bogs,
[SPEAKER_00]: build swales, again, bioswales,
and store that water and slow it down so
[SPEAKER_00]: that in the summer you have it when you
need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm talking about.
