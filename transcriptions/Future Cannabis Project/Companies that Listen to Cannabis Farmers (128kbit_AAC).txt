[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a person that tries to get people
successful with your product and these are
[SPEAKER_00]: the things that I regularly see and So far
the only people the only people really
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been receptive to our feedback
has been grassroots fabric pots and
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable village Which is who sells the
blue mats no other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Agricultural I think Tyler is actually
watching right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what's up, Tyler?
[SPEAKER_00]: But um, you know grassroots has been great
They listen to the market and they make
[SPEAKER_00]: changes And and you know sustainable
village.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the people that sells blue mats
out in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do the same thing I've had a running
dialogue with Steve from blue mats for
[SPEAKER_00]: five six years now and they make updates
based on what we're seeing in the field
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, there's this resistance or
this like culture like was being said way
[SPEAKER_00]: at the beginning is you know, there's this
clashing of cultures and clashing of We're
[SPEAKER_00]: on this team or you're on the weed team
and so far zero tea brewer manufacturers
[SPEAKER_00]: have been receptive to our feedback zero
spray manufacturers have been receptive to
[SPEAKER_00]: our feedback and You know at some point
somebody will fill those niches,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, can you talk about some
iterative?
[SPEAKER_00]: Product development blue mat based on the
feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what did you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the Yeah, there's been a lot of
evolution with the blue mats, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the original systems used a lot of carrots
Which is the sensor part that functions it
[SPEAKER_00]: and it uses a lot of the distribution
drippers the downside of those It was a
[SPEAKER_00]: horrendous cost Because all those little
bits are the most expensive and the more
[SPEAKER_00]: carrots you put into a building the more
Opportunities for failure you had and we
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced that you know the first real
big facility we installed them in was
[SPEAKER_00]: About like 65,000 square feet and that was
before all the blue soak hose was really
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of dialed in and working well so I
stuck to the old tried-and-true and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: far too many carrots in a facility and it
on to be honest it didn't go well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I would have liked to see it
gone better and Unfortunately that
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator, you know doesn't say the
nicest things about the blue mat system
[SPEAKER_00]: still to this day and but you know working
with you know, the Steve and and James and
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael Michael's been really big over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sustainable village and you know,
we've Evolving how we install the systems
[SPEAKER_00]: and I feel like right now where we're at
like, you know The blue silk manifold
[SPEAKER_00]: system is working really well and there's
three or four different variations that
[SPEAKER_00]: are going out right now You know,
my personal is a little bit different than
[SPEAKER_00]: what they sell But you know now instead of
being you know ten thousand dollars for a
[SPEAKER_00]: four thousand square feet Building you're
down to like two to three thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's kind of doable but on the same
thing like, you know over at You know One
[SPEAKER_00]: of the farms both Kevin and I you know,
Kevin introduced us to they put it in You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, they put it on half the building to
prove concept And so it was I would say a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good trial because it was the you
know One side had it and one side didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: they all got the same treatment and the
side with the blue mats had 28% more
[SPEAKER_00]: flower You know, that's pretty remarkable
return on investment for a couple grand
[SPEAKER_00]: but still it's you know, it's You know,
we just it's it's really hard to convince
[SPEAKER_00]: these facilities to make the decisions
that will help them ultimately that's
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one of our biggest obstacles is You
know a lot of times so many other Bad
[SPEAKER_00]: things have happened that now when it's
time to make a call that will really
[SPEAKER_00]: really help you It's hard to pull trigger
