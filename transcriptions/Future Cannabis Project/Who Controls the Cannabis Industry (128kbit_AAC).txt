[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody in the cannabis space is your
enemy, is your competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all your allies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fight that we have right now is if the
people who built the cannabis industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: are from the industry get to participate
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: My perception of the enemy is Pfizer is
the enemy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's who gets to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're fighting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That my understanding of Prop 64,
a deeply imperfect regulatory document,
[SPEAKER_00]: was because people were ready to
decriminalize cannabis activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were ready for social justice,
and they wanted to preserve access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the things that we are
having to fight the hardest for,
[SPEAKER_00]: is for those core principles to still be a
part of this, while everybody's gone into
[SPEAKER_00]: the opposite reefer madness of like
corporate money insanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of like, how do I race fastest to burn
down all the houses around me so that I
[SPEAKER_00]: can be the first unicorn in the cannabis
space?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say all the time, the thing that
gets me out of bed in the morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have so little interest in one guy
making a billion dollars in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a hell of a lot of interest in
thousands of people making, having
[SPEAKER_00]: well-paying, highly skilled, technically
technical jobs, lab technicians,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, transporters, manufacturers,
reintroducing a viable middle class to
[SPEAKER_00]: American economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gets me out of bed in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because 20 years ago, I could live in New
York City and work at a bookstore
[SPEAKER_00]: part-time and be an artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was that reality, that economic
reality, has been eviscerated from the
[SPEAKER_00]: face of our planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I view the cannabis industry
as, is an opportunity to re-stabilize the
[SPEAKER_00]: economy in these much needed ways,
and to treat the pain and the suffering,
[SPEAKER_00]: the economic pain, the classist pain,
the racist pain of a nation that was built
[SPEAKER_00]: on suffering and exploitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are standing at the crossroads
being like, okay, so is this gonna be like
[SPEAKER_00]: a cure and a treatment for this suffering
of where we came from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it gonna be the next corporate
bullshit that's gonna go the same way as
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else and continue to add to the
suffering of the world?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the choice that we have to
make.
