[SPEAKER_00]: I still think you're going to see a huge
reduction initially in cultivars that are
[SPEAKER_00]: in the system because primarily nobody
really holds the same number of different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of varietals and produces the number
of different varietals as a craft culture
[SPEAKER_00]: does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a craft culture in its rounded
development of cannabis production,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll have big swaths of it moving into
commercial realm, but the people hold
[SPEAKER_00]: their own libraries of things they think
are trendy and things that they like
[SPEAKER_00]: historically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things that work for them
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that population, the majority of
those people, probably 95% of them total,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have a permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't allow them to work with that
population of plant anymore because those
[SPEAKER_00]: people can't enter the new system unless
they take their plants and have somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: in the nursery license it and start to
work those directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even then that's difficult because
there's tracking of monies that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you pay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately it'll be whatever's in the
hands of the people who have the permits
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have an intake period just like
Washington did where we'll take plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: over a two week period.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our inception point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We log every single plant we bring in the
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: We log all the seed stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: We log all the genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that begins our whole path for the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that we're supposed to work it
out as we go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no new stuff can just enter the system
unless you're getting it from some other
[SPEAKER_00]: legal entity where you can then say,
yes, I bought this plant from this place
[SPEAKER_00]: with its tracking number.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they're tracking numbers around
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much that the people who buy legal
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're at a store by July 1 and you
came to a legal cannabis store,
[SPEAKER_00]: you wouldn't be able to get a tray of
plants anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get six total.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each one of those has a tag on it that
identifies that it's a unique plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're talking about a tray of
clones, which you couldn't buy unless you
[SPEAKER_00]: had a permit, that'll be one single tag
for the whole hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a tray of clones is called a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say we have two trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 50 in each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we call the hundred batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could even have three trays and 33,
well, close.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it a 99 lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom, because they're going to
count them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't even like screw this one up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single plant has to be tracked in
this component.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're doing it as a hundred count.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you start having plants missing,
they want to know where they went to in
[SPEAKER_00]: the tracking.
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so regular people that have no
permits, just regular cannabis growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers can come into the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then right now they can still buy with
their 215.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can still buy legal what they can get
in their hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after July 1, it is six plants period
per person per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think and I don't even know that
they had to have an issues now in other
[SPEAKER_00]: states where they're having the law
enforcement teams come in and make
[SPEAKER_00]: repeated purchases through the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they arrested all the bud tenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the most successful shops in
Colorado and a very great way be like be
[SPEAKER_00]: like we'll use like say Berkeley patients
group as an example of something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: big and established.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if they came in and you sold
someone an ounce a couple times in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same day only an ounce each transaction,
but they came back multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not even to the same person every
time it was just different tenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they arrested 14 of them and gave
them felony drug traffic and charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's in Denver or one of the big,
you know, one big major Colorado cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tripped out because it was it was it
was a it's an interpretation of how they
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to serve on these type of
situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so ultimately, for dispensaries to be
careful, you know, they or storefronts
[SPEAKER_00]: now, you'd sell the six to the individual
and that's all they could take with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I wanted as a as a farm to be able
to buy this or meaning as like a nursery
[SPEAKER_00]: to buy it, I could go to a dispensary buy
six from a dispensary and then take it to
[SPEAKER_00]: my storefront and enter it legally into my
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we like as long as we can track
this movement of plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants can still make it through in the
fashion, but it's going to be really
[SPEAKER_00]: tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for most people, if they get caught
with anything, your neighbor doesn't like
[SPEAKER_00]: and they say, hey, you got the plants in
the backyard and the cops visit you and
[SPEAKER_00]: they make you cut down anything but six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, lo and behold, the the other 22 you
had with the ones you've been holding on
[SPEAKER_00]: to that really allowed you to have genetic
differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so no matter what, it's going to be
hard to get the same amount of varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: to this to the buyer that they're used to
because you're not going to have half the
[SPEAKER_00]: people I bet maybe 90% of 95% of the oil
blowers I talked to aren't going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: permitted either because everybody's
blowing oil and I got a spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm like, but you do you have a state
permit for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's it's kind of weird because
there's like a quasi belief that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: permitted because you're doing something
illegally and no one's arresting you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean you're permitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a second, it doesn't make a
difference what you believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have a number, it can't be
bought to a store.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do anything with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a farmer, if I don't have a tag on the
plant that matches, I can't give it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't give it to the distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't give it to the processor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't give it to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to track in a linear fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're going to have a radically
compressed group of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know, I mean, I know some guys got
some plants and doing their thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's no way that the big
operations, even if they diversified and
[SPEAKER_00]: acre at a time, would equal the number of
little producers in the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: California that used to produce cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking every neighborhood in
California had people growing out of
[SPEAKER_00]: garages and a lot of them doing damn good
job growing some really nice cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in different varieties because the
dispensaries took it from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they provided just those four or
five pounds per run of whatever it was
[SPEAKER_00]: they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was tens of thousands of them,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how can any any conglomerate
compete with that sheer quantity of
[SPEAKER_00]: people?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe you're going to get a
radically neck down amount of strains and
[SPEAKER_00]: availability initially until they can then
start to multiply what they want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: from there and reestablish the markets.
