[SPEAKER_06]: So this is all the early stuff like all
the nasty nasty nasties are coming down
[SPEAKER_06]: this week Yeah, they're very they're just
harvested or coming down this week This is
[SPEAKER_06]: that this is the outdoor crop this year,
this is some of the outdoor under nets no
[SPEAKER_06]: spray No, just full sign Just harvested
like this was starting the third week in
[SPEAKER_06]: September, you know second week of
September Somewhere along the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah First week hubbles came down first
week second week Pams and stuff started
[SPEAKER_06]: coming down dog dog beaches But yeah,
so you just I'm like there's no dog be
[SPEAKER_06]: tearing into one of those I mean you can
mutilate whatever you want brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's plenty of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just grabbed handful of something that
was It was there I'm Gonna break open that
[SPEAKER_06]: bud break it out and touch that sucker
There's a that's a Pam F2 this a DW's dog
[SPEAKER_06]: walker This is dog beach number.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's dog beach.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that dog beach number two?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's dog beach number three There are
different phenotypes from the same seed
[SPEAKER_06]: lot So those are the dog beach BX.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a back cross dog beach.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a Pam and a dog walker There's a
mega babe here.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's oh, there's the there's the gas
right here So those are the gases right
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're early gases.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like I said Bacon bacon bacon grease
and pandemic our extreme gas nastiness
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are looking I cannot those are my
seed releases for the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are gonna be Yeah, yeah,
yeah, so Yeah, do whatever you want to do
[SPEAKER_07]: man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just can help yourself with all your
whatever you want I brought this for you
[SPEAKER_06]: guys to play with So I also brought you
guys I didn't have a whole bunch of stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: packed up, but I brought some seeds
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah So there's a couple seed packs right
here for you, so I didn't have to really
[SPEAKER_02]: pop some of these Yes, and so what do you
think of the concept of just out here?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have autos and stuff that I just
want to keep throwing out here I was
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking of just like if we pop some seeds
do a little bit of supplemental lighting
[SPEAKER_02]: in the morning and at night just to keep
them in
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so So son so how much is your son
rotating?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean if you put it right here like now
it's in the shade What's your rationale
[SPEAKER_02]: for wanting to move it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it needs to be in the sunniest spot,
especially Going into the fall because
[SPEAKER_07]: we're losing Sun as as it as it goes So if
you have to move it over there or
[SPEAKER_07]: someplace else if this is gonna get shaded
out during the winter You want it in the
[SPEAKER_07]: hottest sunniest spot possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's your big rationale like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it, okay Would like five more feet
away from the wall be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay Yeah, okay Why not just put it right
where this one is and just move this one
[SPEAKER_02]: over one way or turn this one sideways?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like Legos, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you slide it over a few feet in a
different way, you know, but yeah throwing
[SPEAKER_06]: autos would be You know, it depends on the
way you want to do your your protection
[SPEAKER_06]: setup, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So like either a you want to do a
protection like you just want to isolate
[SPEAKER_07]: this one little thing We put a little
protection like over this thing,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is a good example.
[SPEAKER_07]: We should probably do Because it's small
and easy right now, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah So So shade is the enemy for the most
part, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they're too close together,
you're gonna get too much shade,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: so if they're too far apart they get more
but then again like your soil temperature
[SPEAKER_06]: and like Them being able to like,
you know commingle and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's less important because you're in
boxes But this particular thing,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, you're pretty much maxed out on
you know, three bigger plants This winter
[SPEAKER_06]: you could probably do four to six in here
double the amount because they'll only get
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah They won't have the size.
[SPEAKER_06]: They won't have the light even from see so
a you could do one thing you could go
[SPEAKER_06]: Directly seed get your seedlings started
put them out here Let them in the natural
[SPEAKER_06]: light and your seedlings will grow until
they're up to a little bit more maturity
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be like six to ten six to twelve
inches depending on it And then yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: and then they flower immediately they
don't you're already in that 12 So you
[SPEAKER_06]: don't have to add any extra light or any
of that stuff but if You want them to be
[SPEAKER_06]: bigger and you really want to want to do
that then adding the supplemental light
[SPEAKER_06]: But then you got to deal with the cold
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like auto flowers They don't like being
cold and they'll be really in LA.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but we'll still be like 40,
you know what I mean for a couple,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know in the night and stuff like that
I mean, it'll be 38 40, you know I mean
[SPEAKER_06]: autos are more prone to like stall out
when they're cold when their root systems
[SPEAKER_06]: are cold They do better when they're nice
and warm.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll be able to be planted In the in
the ground or in something big from the
[SPEAKER_06]: start and they're able to shoot up and use
the warmth in the season You can do autos.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just not going to be as as big
right, you know some might do okay
[SPEAKER_06]: depending on their lineage and where they
were put together but in general a Colder
[SPEAKER_06]: like root system is is a slower auto in a
lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll usually go a lot, you know I was
thinking the opposite of Peter to put the
[SPEAKER_06]: autos inside where they'll be doing Yeah,
I mean that's yeah you throw those under a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot Of light right you put an auto under
18 hours or 16 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just feel like it's a waste of the light
I mean we have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a two by four tent in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like we put two plants in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah That's just two little plants,
you know, but That's what you get yeah you
[SPEAKER_06]: either like usually autos for me if I'm
gonna run a bunch of autos I'll just run
[SPEAKER_06]: them in my veg area during with my regular
veg stuff if you're running inside stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: and you got that so they're just like In
the corner of the veg area because they're
[SPEAKER_06]: getting the veg light, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Taking up some space there and you're
getting budding plants in the veg space
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of the way that I use autos
or you plant them like late summer like
[SPEAKER_06]: June You know June July from seed,
you know what I mean August from seed and
[SPEAKER_06]: that way by the time October and November
get here They're ready, you know is this
[SPEAKER_07]: ground soft like to where we can like like
just stick this in The ground for a second
[SPEAKER_02]: just to kind of show it All right,
so wait everyone come over here for a
[SPEAKER_02]: second huddle up Tom your official
clapper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we get a Tom clap?
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect excellent clap Yeah, we can set it
up over there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this is show something, you know,
I mean if you want me to put it over on
[SPEAKER_07]: there I mean we could put it over the top
of those plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well for the purposes of the gamma Just
quick and easy is here What is how high
[SPEAKER_06]: can you go as high as you really want so I
brought the extra Yeah, I'll talk let me
[SPEAKER_06]: know Right,
[SPEAKER_06]: so Theoretically you can go Small in the
winter time The smaller is more doable
[SPEAKER_05]: because you're in the winter, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: This mosquito netting You can order in any
size almost from friggin any fabric store
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazon What have you sometimes?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me throw up a third one in the middle
just to make it nice and perfect We like
[SPEAKER_04]: perfect They're cheap we have an extra one
of these lying around too that we can use
[SPEAKER_04]: it dark like it's sitting right in there
Laura had suggested It would definitely
[SPEAKER_04]: keep bugs out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically like our enemy our moths That
Show up late evening and early morning
[SPEAKER_06]: They look for the scented they like sweet
plants, but they like all plants,
[SPEAKER_06]: but they're looking for that scent They
love the buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll lay there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll lay their eggs right on The little
the little bud points you can see them
[SPEAKER_06]: actually and I've got Pictures on my
Instagram with like a little egg on a
[SPEAKER_06]: little leaflet that the dude is left from
out the morning before But ultimately a
[SPEAKER_06]: bunch will hatch from their little egg sac
usually somewhere in The middle to lower
[SPEAKER_05]: range of the plant and they always make
their way north, you know You know what I
[SPEAKER_05]: mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you cut down your plants a lot of
time if you have bud worms and you hang
[SPEAKER_05]: them upside down Usually see the bud worms
up at the top, you know Hanging on the
[SPEAKER_05]: stems looking for the top because they're
always trying to make their way,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know up They like to hang out,
especially when they're really small
[SPEAKER_06]: causing the most damage inside the bud
along the stem you actually have to peel
[SPEAKER_06]: open the bud and Kind of look at the stem
to see if it's any discoloration Or
[SPEAKER_06]: anything like that if you don't see
because early on you won't see the
[SPEAKER_06]: droppings, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they're so small and they're
just getting started and they're almost
[SPEAKER_05]: Invisible to the naked eye if you're not
really looking for it, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so even one gets through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you done like Because they because the
eggs contain so many so if you if you
[SPEAKER_06]: catch so chances are right If you have if
you set up something like this and you
[SPEAKER_06]: throw it over And I got pictures as long
as you don't have any holes in it and it
[SPEAKER_06]: goes to the ground I usually throw some
dirt or a couple rocks on the underside to
[SPEAKER_06]: hold it nice and tight and pretty right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's nice and taut and a suit I grow
them without the I grow them without the
[SPEAKER_06]: the net Until they're right before they go
to bloom.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so you know how big so I can make
Chambers properties, you know is does this
[SPEAKER_04]: treatment plus the The what is a BT?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you don't need so so my whole thing is
I don't ever spray my flowers with
[SPEAKER_06]: anything period I don't if I put two
flowers on the table and I told you that
[SPEAKER_07]: this one was sprayed and this one was not
You probably would choose the one that
[SPEAKER_07]: wasn't sprayed with something first in
general, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just as a natural, you know, that's that's
what we want We don't want something
[SPEAKER_06]: that's been sprayed or toxified in some
way some of those back Here like BT is
[SPEAKER_06]: technically I guess they consider safe but
some of the bacteria is like spinosad and
[SPEAKER_06]: other things and BT for that for that
matter I don't know how much studies going
[SPEAKER_06]: on with Smoking it so it's not I would
never I'm saying sprayed up during veg.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah during so during veggies You're not
even alone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so they're there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the the bud worms aren't even present
during veg for the most part They're not
[SPEAKER_06]: showing up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were told you use it the second you see
any feces or any indication Yes,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're not allowed to use it later on
anyway Yeah, so so what I do is I send all
[SPEAKER_06]: my plants in to flower as healthy as
possible So before there's any sign about
[SPEAKER_06]: of anything that grown up you you can use
BT you can use spinosad You can use sulfur
[SPEAKER_06]: you can use a variety of things oils
different things will suffocate eggs and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that But just have you heard so
so Delano who we did the soil fundraiser
[SPEAKER_02]: for he mentioned cornstarch like diluted
in water And spray it on your plants
[SPEAKER_02]: because they hate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and then he also was talking about
paprika and cumin that they yeah Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: so it's so yeah, I always have people like
Use like cayenne pepper or paprika or
[SPEAKER_06]: those different types of peppers and you
can soak it in the water and make a little
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, but water is Prophylactic
exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the deal is is you you can spray
beforehand make sure they're healthy and
[SPEAKER_06]: ready to rock and roll for bloom But as
soon as they start going into bloom in my
[SPEAKER_06]: world, I'm done
[SPEAKER_06]: So you so for for $20 you can get one of
these bad boys at any size that you want
[SPEAKER_06]: you can take one of these Hoops right
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you have and I don't want any way
to say like oh, well, I have I have you
[SPEAKER_06]: know 10 foot 12 foot plants Well,
so do I I grow a lot of sativa's minor all
[SPEAKER_06]: nine foot 10 foot 12 foot as it is Let's
get a little couple couple.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want anyone to think you're only
growing exactly exactly Exactly,
[SPEAKER_06]: you can go three.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's put this in and take a look at it
Yeah, I have I have I have three of these
[SPEAKER_06]: across and kind of put together with no
there We got a jamming in cuz I got dirt
[SPEAKER_03]: on there didn't want to go in all the way
Yeah, basically time we can cut to size.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we love working with cut the size
right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom You're walking in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't we love working with PVC,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Super easy You make make sure you get the
bigger roll and you can go three four five
[SPEAKER_06]: at at my place.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got five or six deep right and you
fill that puppy up with your six and You
[SPEAKER_06]: you're touching the ceiling and everything
that the trick with this so it's downfall
[SPEAKER_06]: Is so it doesn't have a lot of downfalls.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, number one it rips easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a that's a problem You got to be
really careful when you're strapping it
[SPEAKER_06]: down or moving it because it does tear
easy You don't want any tears,
[SPEAKER_06]: but if you're in a heavy fog area This
will collect moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and we'll hold for a little bit You
won't have the caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just had the you don't Necessarily have
the mildew per se as long as it's like if
[SPEAKER_06]: like at my place, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: We have lots of heavy fog live near the
ocean comes through During that September
[SPEAKER_06]: that that late bud Finish it fills up with
a little bit of moisture But within an
[SPEAKER_06]: hour or two as soon as that Sun comes out,
it's all gone and it has no problem I have
[SPEAKER_06]: never had bud rot or powdery mildew
because of the net cause Ever it's never
[SPEAKER_06]: caused me a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: The one problem I had was when the buds
grew up in touch The net and then the net
[SPEAKER_06]: got wet and that area can get burned or
damaged But as long as you've got plenty
[SPEAKER_06]: of air and space, it's no problem That's
the only thing that I wouldn't recommend
[SPEAKER_06]: it if you're in a really wet or moist
area, but Arizona Nevada So Cal Nor Cal
[SPEAKER_02]: Any dryer so by the way, just quickly
you're you're in northern San Diego
[SPEAKER_02]: County.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay I'm an avocado country over
there and you said a lot of your friends
[SPEAKER_02]: who are growing at home this year saw
Caterpillar so at my place I mean,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure everywhere was kind of the pest.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have more caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like the top problem Okay,
okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So so by the time you're not alone bud
worms are the worst pest.
[SPEAKER_06]: They will decimate crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've lost Countless amounts of pounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've thrown hundreds of pounds in the
trash over the years trying to figure it
[SPEAKER_03]: out What are the fruit other fruiting
crops that you deal with?
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're less damaging to other things
like they chew up leaves and things but
[SPEAKER_06]: these particular ones are Bud worm like
like seekers they see This particular,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, they think that that one that we
want and because it's such a delicate
[SPEAKER_06]: plant and because they're inside on The
stem as soon as they start causing damage
[SPEAKER_06]: on the inside.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when the rot starts to happen It's
not it's not because of weather.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not because it's because of the
caterpillars causing damage That's
[SPEAKER_06]: oxidizing stuff's getting messed up.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're pooping in there There's lots of
bacteria and it just starts rotting the
[SPEAKER_06]: bud from the inside out So the only way to
do it is to stop them from being able to
[SPEAKER_06]: lay their eggs and I've got pictures of
moths Stuck up against the side here
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to get through there like I can't
go through is the desired size netting and
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah What is and is like if it was a
little open if you had a window screen,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You could use stuff like this if you had
to I like using this it's lighter.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, what is what is there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it a size difference is how do you how
do you so it's a mock size?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a regular it's mosquito netting
is what you know, I mean you Google
[SPEAKER_06]: mosquito netting or it or Fabric,
there's fabric meshes it like if you go to
[SPEAKER_04]: a Joanne fabrics about this is that do you
have like zero room for error?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a great method prophylactic But
you have zero room forever ever in case it
[SPEAKER_04]: like if one moth gets in you're in big
trouble No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, so so I've had One moth get through a
hole.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had a couple things and you see him
floating around on the inside of there's
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean or what and whatnot
and damage is so Minimalized it's not even
[SPEAKER_06]: funny And also if there if there's if you
what I found is I netted too late a couple
[SPEAKER_06]: times in years past, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So like I got him growing they started a
bud and like they had already had moths
[SPEAKER_06]: laid on him before I had netted I didn't
can get the net in time and the eggs
[SPEAKER_06]: hatched inside the inside the tent or
inside the little the little thing,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I think that like mating and pollen
ization and things like that is Is a
[SPEAKER_06]: factor watch and they didn't have in
Enough time to actually cause a problem
[SPEAKER_06]: because it was before and so I've never
had a problem Even if one snuck through
[SPEAKER_06]: you might have a section where you have a
little piece as long as you're But you can
[SPEAKER_06]: the cool thing is you see it in the
morning or the next day and you can catch
[SPEAKER_06]: them Yeah, can't go away.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, the idea is if you don't have
any holes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly Like next season you're
gonna be hyper vigilant as soon as you see
[SPEAKER_06]: if you see if you see droppings You're too
late.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your season's done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're already.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes so far behind It's not even fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know, so the the you have to
stop it before Also, we're also getting a
[SPEAKER_05]: dino light or a bug zapper light one of
those dino lights that zap different moths
[SPEAKER_04]: and things like that and get them Anywhere
also it was suggested that we get the that
[SPEAKER_06]: special corn Go up for them over there To
kill to kill the lure them as a lure,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know and It's not so doing that and
not being able to cover or would you'd
[SPEAKER_06]: still lose right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You would still there's too many moths in
our climate We don't we don't have freeze
[SPEAKER_04]: and the button don't have whether they're
too pungent like they're like they're
[SPEAKER_06]: caught They're way better than a piece of
corn You know what I mean, I mean they are
[SPEAKER_06]: cornea worms but the you know,
I don't know if there's a If there's a
[SPEAKER_06]: particular one in in general that prefers
the cannabis but I always call them the
[SPEAKER_06]: bud worm because that's that's What they
go after that's what they destroy big one.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where they come from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the way, it's Tyler which one should
I start on that's this morning that big
[SPEAKER_06]: green one in there Do you want something?
[SPEAKER_06]: Really tough like Nat you want some gas or
do you want some some food or something
[SPEAKER_06]: smooth and nice?
[SPEAKER_02]: How about something that's gonna make me
work not fucking off?
[SPEAKER_06]: okay, so then like My one of one of these
are gonna be your sativa leaning hybrids
[SPEAKER_04]: right here the dog beaches My jar or this
pan Dead worm dead and dying.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say hey fucking off my plants go with
number two or number three Pinch pinch one
[SPEAKER_06]: of those pinch one of those buds and check
out dog beach number two or number three
[SPEAKER_06]: drink.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good I got a yeah, I got a big cooler
in there man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate you greatly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, sir dog beach number two or
three Yeah, those are gonna be more sativa
[SPEAKER_06]: Leaning more on the more on the fruity
funky side pineapple and lemon and And so
[SPEAKER_02]: you so this is you cut this when?
[SPEAKER_06]: The dog beaches came down the second week
of September.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, right, you know like September
September 10th, September 9th,
[SPEAKER_05]: September 10th We're October 12th or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so about a month ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so we also just put yeah,
we're October 10th, so about exactly a
[SPEAKER_02]: month ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are all early finishing Yes,
and then what's late finishing that's
[SPEAKER_06]: still going the bacon grease.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah the real dog walker like my real,
you know, my real dog rocker crop the real
[SPEAKER_07]: crop of dog walker and How much what else
is out there and the pine tar Kush They're
[SPEAKER_07]: all still out and what are you growing
like in pots and no, man I do I mean I
[SPEAKER_03]: grow in everything tell you the truth,
but like You have the bubbly water I got
[SPEAKER_06]: your water During the summer we do I do
big outdoor crops in the ground Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, so what's your setup you're growing
in the ground Yeah for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grow in the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah I mean I have some stuff in pots like
the random The straggler clones and things
[SPEAKER_07]: that like don't make the cut or the ones
that I need to just give away or whatever
[SPEAKER_07]: That aren't gonna get put out but they
don't deserve the ground Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: every every year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're There's a couple of those
chambers that will go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you want to sit for the What
yourself they want to sit on the couch?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm gonna grab a seat right here I'm
gonna pick out a little DW right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna smoke right here Do some face
melting Whose little babies are these
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are me man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are my three man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was actually in the emergency room
last night man.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were playing Knights and My oldest
hit the middle child in the head with a
[SPEAKER_06]: golf club.
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't block it Although he had a
pillow and they were playing Knights and
[SPEAKER_06]: he missed it and sliced open the top of
his head Thank God.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was all it was all that happened Didn't
need stitches he needed yeah, we went to
[SPEAKER_06]: the hospital and they actually glued him
back together up there Sometimes they'll
[SPEAKER_04]: just dumb just use staples.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what they said They were usually
only using the head, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: but he had this hair type that allowed him
to glue it I'm like, thank God because
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that'll be better in terms of a
yeah, he's four and he doesn't want no
[SPEAKER_06]: staples in his head, you know You want him
to staple in your head buddy like he would
[SPEAKER_04]: know no So and this was the four-year-old.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about okay So you're and is this
like in your yard or where you so yeah for
[SPEAKER_02]: my for my home garden, okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah for my home garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have you know, so is it kind of
yeah, you're gonna have to send me some
[SPEAKER_06]: pictures Yeah, so I have a big I have a
big like I mean I got like Almost an acre
[SPEAKER_07]: little plot of where I live where I live
and like in the back area There's it's we
[SPEAKER_07]: call it the food forest and there's like
60 something different fruit trees back
[SPEAKER_07]: there on your property Yeah, I planted
them all I could I put in this word,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, I've been there This is year six
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when my when my son yeah The first
fruit trees you put in I had I had 30 year
[SPEAKER_06]: four 40 or so that I carried with me from
all my different homes in pots They were
[SPEAKER_06]: my traveling orchard until I could find
the place to plot them but they were like
[SPEAKER_06]: things like, you know, there's some
Hollywood plums and different rare
[SPEAKER_04]: tangerines like the 88-2 tangerine field
were these like did they come from other
[SPEAKER_04]: states?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, so I'm an orchard.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm an orchard specialist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a fruit tree guy So what I do is I go
and I do diagnoses on home fruit trees
[SPEAKER_06]: orchard orchard commercial orchards Home
orchards, we turn little spaces like this
[SPEAKER_06]: into productive like food forest areas
Like we put like five to six we could do
[SPEAKER_04]: trees That'll be our next step,
you know, like every month by the way that
[SPEAKER_04]: one via the fire the ficus and the little
bugle boy Yeah, yeah, yeah, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: usually a bush but it can be turned into a
small It's considered a small a large bush
[SPEAKER_06]: small so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah for sure Yeah, so like that's what
that's what I do with like fruit So we
[SPEAKER_06]: pick certain varieties that all ripen it
different times and grow in your area and
[SPEAKER_06]: we Take care of business so that you can
always kind of be pulling something from
[SPEAKER_06]: your from your orchard and then yeah in in
it in accordance with that lots of these
[SPEAKER_06]: people who have the Time and the money in
the space they like cannabis and they want
[SPEAKER_06]: to grow some of their own cannabis,
too So once they figure out that,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, we're friends on that on that
regard then they can usually get their You
[SPEAKER_06]: know garden set up with some of my
genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can see yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't So like I mean Some I do so
you come in selling them your fruit tree
[SPEAKER_02]: services and you walk out selling them
your seat your genetics Well, yeah in some
[SPEAKER_06]: cases, but it's but it's they get both
because it's like it's it's it's a thing
[SPEAKER_06]: so like my fruit thing is Like in the
fruit world like I I mean I teach
[SPEAKER_06]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do all kinds of funny stuff I'm the
fruit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm the fruit guy like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: My license plate doesn't say mr.
[SPEAKER_06]: Trees for nothing Yeah fruit yeah,
yeah, I know I know about all kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff You just mentioned a specific Plum
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a Hollywood plum.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but you it had like a number Oh,
that's the tangerine the 88-2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay So the tan like is that's like
who was that like bread at UC Davis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Can you talk about like what you've
seen in fruit breeding versus like your
[SPEAKER_02]: experiences in cannabis breeding?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so like every year I get a Shipment
of trees like a little bundle of like to
[SPEAKER_06]: test out or to test Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like you get ghost apple or that's who
Aries or like, you know nectar plums.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like like the whole apricot peach
Well, mostly after there's that yeah so
[SPEAKER_02]: many there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's the farmers market There's
apriums to like all these new hybrid
[SPEAKER_06]: fruits like apricot plum crosses and these
are pollen crosses So they're not so
[SPEAKER_02]: what's the explanation there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that be like if a dog and a person?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like had sex and have no no no no because
we're not related into so like peaches
[SPEAKER_06]: plums apricots Yeah nectarines are all
part of the same family.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this commercial breeding or all just
like individuals doing it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well in a commercial the ones that I'm
talking about are commercial like there's
[SPEAKER_06]: a there's a family like the Dave Wilson
nursery is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the ziger family does a lot of
things There's a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_06]: families that are commercial breeders that
create most of the modern fruit trees and
[SPEAKER_06]: grow all the traditional fruit trees that
Sell to all the nurseries around so all
[SPEAKER_06]: every time you go to like a nursery to buy
whatever, you know, all the fruit trees
[SPEAKER_06]: They stock there came from you know what I
mean, Dave Wilson nursery or Ellie Cook
[SPEAKER_04]: nursery So if they create a new fruit
hybrid will that make its way into the it
[SPEAKER_06]: does so the fun the difference between
fruit hybrids and cannabis hybrids is it
[SPEAKER_06]: takes like Somewhere between eight and ten
years eight and twelve years to create a
[SPEAKER_06]: new fruit variety to make sure that it's
good It takes you a long time because
[SPEAKER_06]: basically you're taking a you're taking a
plum a plum Flower, you know pollen and a
[SPEAKER_06]: peach flower and you're gonna take rub
those together and you're gonna group that
[SPEAKER_06]: fruits gonna grow You're gonna plant the
seed from that from that mother plant,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know fruit You're gonna grow out a
bunch of those and then out of that you do
[SPEAKER_06]: the Fino selection Which one turns out to
be delicious which one and this isn't all
[SPEAKER_06]: in the same season you plan This isn't all
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how long does it take a plum tree to
start fruit in?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's somewhere around it, you know five to
ten years depending on variety grafted To
[SPEAKER_04]: be aware of whose seeds they're using or
whatever because they're treading on
[SPEAKER_04]: someone's patented So yeah, they do a lot
of the patenting of their of their variety
[SPEAKER_06]: So they do a lot of those own so all those
like like the neck the neck the plum or
[SPEAKER_06]: the highly IP there They start happening
those.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah Which is cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like one of my favorite things is like the
blue Aries.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're they're just There to die for
plums and blue plums and cherries.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like it's like a plot.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a giant Organic friggin cherry
would like that cherry crunch and like
[SPEAKER_06]: that cherry texture with like the plum
Complexity and juice and like all that
[SPEAKER_06]: extra stuff the plumb ring and they hold
on the tree for a long friggin time
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to all the other stuff and then
can you breathe that Slightly in the
[SPEAKER_02]: direction of one or the other like if
you're like I like this It's a 50-50,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'd love it if it were like 80 So they
have so they so out of that seed lot when
[SPEAKER_06]: they made that initial cross right or
whatever out of that seed lot There's One
[SPEAKER_06]: that leans more this way.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's one that leans more this way and
then there are other varieties So there's
[SPEAKER_06]: like candy heart blueberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like a sugar twist.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's flavor punch There's all these
other varieties of blueberry and those are
[SPEAKER_02]: just variations in the grape world My mind
is blown by the cotton candy great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's fun idea my daughter's And I'm
like sitting there like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: this is really fucking good and that's
what they do They come out with these new
[SPEAKER_06]: cool varieties like the cool grape that
I'm growing this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of new is like The finger
great they're like these they look like
[SPEAKER_06]: little fingers long under long and skinny,
you know the lady finger Fingerling or I
[SPEAKER_06]: forget what they're called exactly,
but the finger grapes are pretty cool but
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, so like We all every one of those
types of trees Has a certain growth
[SPEAKER_06]: requirement certain amount of cold that it
needs every type of like a like a fig tree
[SPEAKER_06]: fruits on New growth or persimmon fruits
on only the new stuff that's grown out
[SPEAKER_06]: that year a peach fruits on last year's
growth You know and and that that second
[SPEAKER_06]: year growth is where your fruit is and
like apples fruit on spurs So you got to
[SPEAKER_06]: know which type of tree you're dealing
with and where the fruit production is
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna happen in order to not screw up your
season and like cut off your you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: your productivity and stuff like that,
but it's like more of a You know a
[SPEAKER_06]: lifelong thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be a year It's interesting
because it seems like those fruits are
[SPEAKER_02]: much more micro climate sensitive than
like if I took your seeds I could plant
[SPEAKER_02]: them in a bunch of micro climate like
Oregon Maine Down here in LA for sure
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor and it'd be like I know express
myself differently, but I will still make
[SPEAKER_07]: it Yeah, what's so hardiest fruit?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's tough, man Does cannabis count?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know lemons limes Grapefruits,
right are all pretty pretty tough those
[SPEAKER_06]: well origin fruits, you know pummelos,
you know, but a lemon couldn't grow in New
[SPEAKER_02]: England.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sorry Do you mean hearty by like that's
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: For their environment, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah those like so whenever I go
investigate an orchard like say somebody
[SPEAKER_06]: has a House has an orchard on the property
the person dies The house sits barren for
[SPEAKER_06]: a few years, you know, I mean they turn
off the water the orchard It just kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: runs downhill and then somebody buys the
house, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Then my phone rings and like yo,
we just bought this house.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got an orchard here Bunch of the
trees are sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you come help us?
[SPEAKER_02]: Trees are still alive.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just some of them are some of them
aren't when I get to this place 90% of the
[SPEAKER_06]: time The bears lime is alive Like a loquat
is alive, you know, there are certain
[SPEAKER_06]: trees that are always like, you know among
it all they're like Fuck and they're not
[SPEAKER_06]: happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like the microbes that can go
dormant Yeah, fruit trees don't survive
[SPEAKER_06]: unless they're cared for most of them
don't really I mean unless they're a wild
[SPEAKER_06]: fruit tree, but most of our modern
varieties They're gonna need you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're gonna need water.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're gonna need You know the
appropriate amount of cold or like
[SPEAKER_06]: chihuahuas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we've been we've been you know,
these are these are cultivated fruits Wow,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're really domesticated.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're very domesticated So I mean
you can plant things and not do a lot to
[SPEAKER_06]: them And that's what my whole trip is is
like set it up so that it is a natural
[SPEAKER_06]: natural system So that all you have to do
is just kind of be that that shadow kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of watching out and do a couple things So
what what are some of the things like on
[SPEAKER_02]: those properties?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, okay, I can save about 40% of
these trees What are you doing that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like are you just literally being like
let's turn the irrigation system back on
[SPEAKER_02]: but like yeah What are some other things
that you're typically doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, so we we look at like the
conditions like is it Are they desolate
[SPEAKER_06]: desert conditions?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, what are the soil temperatures
like what?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do they even have water there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it completely broken?
[SPEAKER_06]: How hard is it gonna be to remediate?
[SPEAKER_06]: But basically essentially it's get a bunch
of crap the It's gonna cover your ground
[SPEAKER_06]: put some clothes over your skin,
you know some sort of debris some mulch
[SPEAKER_06]: some plants some forest floor I call it
the forest floor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get a forest floor going and then we
need to turn the irrigation on and I
[SPEAKER_06]: usually You know, I usually recommend
like, you know a topical Spray type
[SPEAKER_06]: irrigation or some sprayers of some sort
so that we we complete the circle of life
[SPEAKER_06]: like rain falls from the sky like the
surface like drip emitters or or like a
[SPEAKER_02]: sprinkler sprinkler.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like sprinklers Are my my so so
during the drought and like the crisis and
[SPEAKER_06]: all these things like we all these
commercial orchards All these people
[SPEAKER_06]: shifted to drip right and they have these
little drip rings and stuff that go to
[SPEAKER_06]: tree rings or whatever I call those tree
killers.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: so In a perfect world like I have my my
thermometer and we can do a test and I'll
[SPEAKER_06]: show you when you when you shoot the
ground Right, like number one in nature
[SPEAKER_06]: where plants grow on their own and we're
not you know You'll always see a forest
[SPEAKER_06]: floor or a covering, you know some sort of
dust That regulates the temperature the
[SPEAKER_06]: moisture levels all those things the
nutritional the the life levels all those
[SPEAKER_06]: things are regulated by this forest
material of accumulation of stuff so when
[SPEAKER_06]: we have it all cleaned out like this or We
have that stuff and we're just using a
[SPEAKER_06]: drip emitter right next to that drip
emitter It's dripping and it's watering
[SPEAKER_06]: next to there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not as wet or it's dry Next it skips
places and then beyond it and in between
[SPEAKER_06]: it you're skipping places where the water
isn't evenly kind of coating and you think
[SPEAKER_06]: about like a rainstorm Right, she rains
everything gets wet for the most part You
[SPEAKER_06]: know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's raining where the tree is where the
tree is not and beyond and beyond and that
[SPEAKER_06]: is That's the trick in order to kind of
flush out the contaminants that have been
[SPEAKER_06]: collected on the surface Push down the the
fertilizers or animal poop to hydrate that
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff to keep that first layer You know
evenly moist so that when you scratch in
[SPEAKER_06]: the soil here It's moist and 75 degrees
and you scratch over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's moist and 75 degrees, but when it's
uncovered the temperature Fluctuates so
[SPEAKER_06]: drastically from like 60 to like 140 60 to
140 and nothing wants to live there
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing wants to live without that AC or
that irregularity and then there's no
[SPEAKER_06]: Nutritional elements or homes or anything
like that on the surface of the soil to
[SPEAKER_06]: protect any of those things that would be
You know wanting to live there which the
[SPEAKER_06]: plants need to get their nutrition To
cycle nutrients to kind of keep them
[SPEAKER_06]: together because they can't friggin move
So they need as many friends and family as
[SPEAKER_06]: they can you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Around them is best possible in order to
take care of business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Tom bringing the party to his
house That was always my power move is
[SPEAKER_02]: like why don't I just have everybody come
to my house and they don't even have to
[SPEAKER_06]: move I get to see all my friends Yeah,
yeah, and you're just you know and that's
[SPEAKER_06]: a plants world You know you're just trying
to accumulate as many cats over here that
[SPEAKER_06]: can help you out and do different things
and the only way that's gonna happen is if
[SPEAKER_06]: the soil temperatures don't jump around
like an SOB and there's material there
[SPEAKER_06]: that's gonna keep it moist and even and
There's food for fungi and you know that
[SPEAKER_06]: carbon is returned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we send Tom out there with the
thermometer?
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, we can we can test all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can play around but you know Tom in a
couple months, you'll be wearing some sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of like Tom will have his tools of the
trade ready to I mean these are these are
[SPEAKER_06]: soil probes my It tells me you know inches
and shovels I can take you know like other
[SPEAKER_04]: pests like to also like keep an eye out
for you know pests and worms that you
[SPEAKER_04]: might not and obviously there's a point
where like we had I had several very
[SPEAKER_06]: hungry praying mantises, but they didn't
do their job I'm okay with like beneficial
[SPEAKER_06]: predators More so like indoors.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll rely on them more so on an indoor
Environment like I'll rely on you more
[SPEAKER_06]: indoors, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I want you to be here in the outdoor
environment to help out on whatever I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: missing But there's no way to rely on that
like when people say order, you know
[SPEAKER_06]: Trichogamma or whatever the wasp is that
gets the worms and stuff I mean for
[SPEAKER_06]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, unless you're trying My questions
like what can you and it might do some
[SPEAKER_06]: good and I'm not saying it won't but if
you had a place to like trap them in a
[SPEAKER_06]: greenhouse or You can kind of ensure that
you don't have any of those Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: let me ask you do you ever do that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you ever like toss a wasp?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't so so Like I'll throw a praying
mantis or two Okay, I catch them at my
[SPEAKER_06]: house all the time if like early early in
veg if I have a Green house or a tent set
[SPEAKER_06]: up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll throw some ladybugs in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, it's not for like a
guarantee It's just just to increase that
[SPEAKER_06]: my my my help when I'm not my eyes aren't
on The game and like I said, I'm not gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: rely on that when it comes But I I like I
like using I like using oil sprays like
[SPEAKER_06]: there's like different, you know doctor
name doctors makes an oil where it's like
[SPEAKER_06]: peppermint and thyme and you know rosemary
and clove and it's like this little
[SPEAKER_06]: assortment that works pretty good and
actually Messes with cells.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's what I'm wondering.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's gotta be some homemade something
that like with a pepper There's like yes,
[SPEAKER_06]: but they don't like it sulfur does
everything like if I ever have like a
[SPEAKER_06]: problem Like if I have thrips thrips and
bud worms are my two biggest enemies,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Thrips are my enemies indoors bud worms
are my enemies outdoors, you know for the
[SPEAKER_07]: most part I don't really care so much
about the thrips outdoors because my
[SPEAKER_06]: plants are growing so healthfully and
everything's doing fine It's not the end
[SPEAKER_06]: of the world but indoors you can make
things, you know pissed off so like sulfur
[SPEAKER_06]: is one of my favorite things and you can
just use sulfur and it's tough and It's
[SPEAKER_06]: not the funnest to mix but it works really
good and as long as you're using it in Tom
[SPEAKER_06]: show them your sprayer you're good to go
but sulfur Oil, you know spinosad is fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that spinosan when you if you ever
use it in flower and stuff I know that
[SPEAKER_06]: it's it's probably I think it's on the ban
list for California still and it's because
[SPEAKER_06]: it can we've all agreed We're not spraying
anything during flower, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: but yeah, that's the thing but you can use
spinosad not in flower And it's a bacteria
[SPEAKER_06]: that kills thrips mites worms all chewing
insects and things like that So if you use
[SPEAKER_06]: it appropriately, I think that that one is
okay Sorry, Tom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is your thing a worm?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean But you just you just want to like
like I said, you just want to make sure
[SPEAKER_06]: that you're you're you're clean And if you
just did like a once-a-week oil spray,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know And then you change it maybe once
a week you did oil once a week You did
[SPEAKER_06]: some soap and then once we you could keep
everybody kind of at bay for the most part
[SPEAKER_06]: You can make garlic sprays.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can make pepper sprays.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do stuff like that But none of
that is gonna stop that Tom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like your collection of Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so these are the ones I took off my
tobacco plants Today so I want to see if
[SPEAKER_02]: they're I think this guy is the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's pretty damn close man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep little bud worm there I mean,
there's so many different mods and so many
[SPEAKER_06]: varieties, but then this one's darker and
they all will depending on what they eat
[SPEAKER_06]: Depending on what they eat.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll be different colors You know,
they can be different colors just by what
[SPEAKER_06]: they're you know how they're cycling or
where they're involved what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah I mean like you can have bright
orange and bright yellows and browns and
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all doing essentially the same
thing Yeah, this is us.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is you know, it's the it's I'm not an
etymologist corn corn earworm Mott Tom I
[SPEAKER_02]: was gonna leave these caterpillar with you
because you are so you're collecting them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's such a good host to the
caterpillars He's collected them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, those bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the actual word Grim Reaper for
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the He's the collector of
caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like the the fertility god for
caterpillars Yes But I swear to you man
[SPEAKER_06]: like a good friend of mine he's a This is
his second year growing and he only grows
[SPEAKER_06]: outdoor and my fingers are all sticky from
prying in through the buds Messing up your
[SPEAKER_06]: buds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah the first year he did not put up any
any nets and I kind of you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really push for him to put up the
nets cuz You won't really know unless you
[SPEAKER_06]: love you learn and you know I didn't want
to be like a dick, but I didn't want to be
[SPEAKER_06]: like, you know, like you have to do this
but this year he's like he got good enough
[SPEAKER_06]: and he did good enough last year he
learned and This year.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, all right.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do I do man?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do I stop these worms?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm all right, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what we do I told ready to listen
and he friggin and he set up These killer
[SPEAKER_06]: chambers man, and he like put these two
and he had ten foot pams in there that are
[SPEAKER_06]: just just Arms are just dangling in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like this never got touched with
anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like sitting there He's like,
I don't know how you do it trim and all
[SPEAKER_06]: this stuff and he had nothing last year He
was completely without spending money and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like all because of that Tom's
emotions have gone like the highest
[SPEAKER_02]: highest lowest lowest so Tom next year
when you have those 15 foot tall plants
[SPEAKER_02]: with massive Thor promise you dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I promise you I'm not even bullshitting
like if you will be overdue because you
[SPEAKER_02]: will appreciate it had we done this year
You wouldn't have appreciated it as much
[SPEAKER_06]: what I mean you have to go through it,
man You really have to get kicked in the
[SPEAKER_06]: friggin gut.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I did everybody has to I have a
feeling I have a funny feeling that even
[SPEAKER_04]: if we had gotten our IPM guy here when we
wanted to he wouldn't have done No,
[SPEAKER_04]: it might have even been too late.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah because I have a funny feeling that
we you know, I was as soon as you start
[SPEAKER_06]: seeing pom-poms and hairs start getting
thrown That's when I put up the net.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean even maybe even a week before that
that's what I'm saying So that you're a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit more proactive, but they
usually don't seek out those little tiny
[SPEAKER_06]: pom-poms They wait for you to get and we
don't go like okay week nine.
[SPEAKER_04]: They go up No, you do it by observation
observation and I never put them up before
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm ready to go in the flower because I've
put them up before Early and then they
[SPEAKER_06]: grow into the thing and then like trying
to redo it You couldn't get the net in
[SPEAKER_06]: time for the right size, you know,
you're like, oh shit I need six more feet
[SPEAKER_06]: and you're like then you can't get it You
know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you're missing time and things
are messed up and then you lose So if you
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah if you wait until like it's like You
like a two-story structure out here you
[SPEAKER_04]: know to just for a few days just really
just overnight to shoot this indoor To hit
[SPEAKER_04]: the bunny ranch grow in perump really
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was there Steve Cantwell's place and in
fact you were mentioning this if you look
[SPEAKER_04]: at he uses these pots he has this
beautiful Underbrush for the entire length
[SPEAKER_04]: of it is total consistency, even though
it's inside with the light Just what
[SPEAKER_04]: you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've we have to look at it again to see
exactly what that plant is But yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: no, I yeah anything that covers I don't
care if it's if it's living or if it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: little Getting back to the fruit trees so
when you are you you like start reviving
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you want to bring in that cover
layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you bringing in for like
someone's?
[SPEAKER_06]: Two-acre property that yeah, so it depends
on their budget Like what do you want to
[SPEAKER_06]: do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this property like surrounded by
big-ass trees that we can use?
[SPEAKER_06]: An issue what would you want to bring
bring in a few truckloads of some sort of
[SPEAKER_06]: bark chips that are quality, you know bark
chip mulch is a touchy Work because
[SPEAKER_06]: sometimes like mulch is like half compost
half bark or there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a good Yeah, it's like some
people get offended.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want I just want some chunks I want
some I want yeah, I want a variety of
[SPEAKER_06]: particle sizes Just a chopped up tree of
the bark for the carbon source.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want the bark.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I want I want that that bark
and that shredded material to actually
[SPEAKER_02]: Last a long time I thought but I thought
the bark doesn't absorb Water like the
[SPEAKER_06]: wood on the inside it will over a period
of time once once you walk through like So
[SPEAKER_06]: if you let like a nice little bark layer
of something that was a couple inches
[SPEAKER_06]: thick and you're watering it topically You
know the first thing we always do when we
[SPEAKER_06]: put out bark I always tell people go out
there and really over hydrate the area
[SPEAKER_06]: like so that we can saturate the bark
really well so that the bark can kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: absorb as much water as it can and then it
really start releasing into the ground and
[SPEAKER_06]: then once you do that like we start the
regulation train down the hill because
[SPEAKER_06]: It's covered properly.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not fluctuating in temperature It's
everything's kind of starting to work work
[SPEAKER_06]: where it is and the water is actually
getting through the bark and into the into
[SPEAKER_06]: the soil there So you start really
rejuvenate does the bark take longer to
[SPEAKER_02]: decompose to decompose than uh,
like the inner wood Yeah, I mean,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean it takes it I mean there's a
there's that sheath and it takes a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit of time and you can use the inner wood
you can use the outer wood and there's no
[SPEAKER_06]: magic thing like I wouldn't say by this
one particular bark, so we actually prefer
[SPEAKER_06]: a Multitude of different things.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what you're gonna ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't just want the bark You'd also
want some in inner wood.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah inner wood and I want leaves and I'd
want some twigs and I'd want some Some
[SPEAKER_06]: different things like that that were so
pretty much everything you would find on a
[SPEAKER_06]: forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly That's why I always take the
forest floor and pretty much we want to
[SPEAKER_06]: create a friggin forest floor and if you
and I always tell people to like if you
[SPEAKER_06]: have a tree like here and then like Six or
eight feet away from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have another tree, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to tell people to stop treating
the trees as they're individuals And start
[SPEAKER_06]: watering that entire space like it's one
living thing like care for the soil like
[SPEAKER_06]: it's one living thing And if you have a
problem watering where there's no plants
[SPEAKER_06]: or no trees put a plant there so that you
are forced to water this area so that you
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep that even moisture and temperature
level consistent so that over time your
[SPEAKER_06]: soul actually becomes alive And then once
it becomes alive you're stocked with dead
[SPEAKER_06]: bodies and moisture and all of a sudden
It's holding water water is traveling
[SPEAKER_06]: farther.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's absorbing more like a sponge and
you're using less you can back off on your
[SPEAKER_06]: water when you make your soil actually a
living thing instead of alive dead alive
[SPEAKER_06]: dead and you lose communication you lose
all these different benefits that you can
[SPEAKER_06]: have so it's like retraining people to
care for the ground first and then
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever trees we we have and whatever
trees we're gonna put in are gonna jump
[SPEAKER_06]: out of their skin because they're gonna be
able to To fall right into a good place
[SPEAKER_06]: where they want to be and then also
planting new trees Planting them high
[SPEAKER_06]: instead of planting them down in pits,
you know for the most part I mean,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's I'm a big I'm a big believer and
plant it high and it will and it will
[SPEAKER_06]: thrive and plant it low It won't grow and
if you look at any like tree that's
[SPEAKER_06]: growing a hundred feet near we can go out
there to that front tree I didn't see any
[SPEAKER_06]: of those trees out there, but they're big
giant trees We can look right where they
[SPEAKER_06]: meet the ground and you'll see two things
One it'll be up on a little bit of a mound
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of just slightly up in a mound and
two as soon as the trunk hits the ground
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see the main root crown of the soil
right at the surface of the soil will be
[SPEAKER_06]: busting up the side Walk it'll be right
there at the surface right where the trunk
[SPEAKER_06]: meets the ground and a lot of people will
plant a tree too deeply to where you'll
[SPEAKER_06]: have to Scratch next to the trunk of the
tree for a couple inches before you can
[SPEAKER_06]: find that main root hand and you got a
couple inches of bark that's under the
[SPEAKER_06]: ground or under the mulch and then that
bark becomes soft and you start rotting
[SPEAKER_06]: out that cambium and all kinds of problems
start right because of the bark itself
[SPEAKER_06]: isn't supposed to be under the ground that
way the root system is but once you start
[SPEAKER_06]: you're like a slow strangle a slow kill
and it can take Years it can take months,
[SPEAKER_06]: but you're you're really hurting your tree
on that level So a lot of people dig them
[SPEAKER_02]: in these big pits Well, so if you were on
a property wanting to plant a new tree,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd build an area up a little bit a
little bit I just wouldn't dig as deep of
[SPEAKER_06]: a hole is what I would do So I would dig a
I would however big the plant it root ball
[SPEAKER_06]: that I was planting I would dig it a
little bit more like an inch or two more
[SPEAKER_06]: shallow and I would dig it a lot wider So
because width is more important than
[SPEAKER_02]: depth, but like you're happy with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's better off there Than in another way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah the one thing that I would do like on
like one of those instead of just having a
[SPEAKER_06]: mound where the water and everything can
just run off in a way like you plant it up
[SPEAKER_06]: on on a little crown and then Three to
four feet from the trunk of the tree I
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of build a little bit of a basin or a
little bit of a berm just to kind of focus
[SPEAKER_06]: a little bit of that water at a young age
so that When it's a young plant you catch
[SPEAKER_06]: in that water and it's not running away
You got a little bit of a berm,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's actually sitting in a little
island like in that berm and you could
[SPEAKER_04]: fill I didn't put that in actually yeah a
gardener did not the regular gardener,
[SPEAKER_04]: but a guy who knows trees Lord brought
wrote over and there was a like a little
[SPEAKER_06]: note and over time after it'll wear down
and that's fine after it's done that Focus
[SPEAKER_04]: your water in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, as long as it's not a pit You know a
lot of things and and it that's perfect
[SPEAKER_06]: when you're up on the crown like that
That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like I said every time you see a tree.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like out out front there That's doing
really well at any park at any place
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll take notice like you'll notice that
those two things for sure and then that
[SPEAKER_06]: third thing is the cover on the ground Is
it in a forest floor situation?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a lawn?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some sort of regulation of the
temperature or it's extremely thick and
[SPEAKER_06]: Was allowed to get that way because there
once was something under it and then that
[SPEAKER_06]: canopy is now sheen that soil So it's okay
there and then they're able to kind of get
[SPEAKER_06]: away with murder You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, but that's like that's how that
gets to that point But it's really
[SPEAKER_06]: important like just planting your trees at
the right level And then actually caring
[SPEAKER_06]: for the environment around them as opposed
to them per se You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean first then you'll have a lot more
success and they'll start doing things
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you got to learn about your tree You
got to figure out what the hell kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: tree is when you should when you when you
should you prune it?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what what's gonna pick on it,
you know stuff like that but if you've got
[SPEAKER_06]: a healthy environment and you've got cover
and It's even temperatures aren't
[SPEAKER_06]: fluctuating around all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got organisms and mycorrhizaline
and all kinds of things that are
[SPEAKER_06]: protecting that tree and Actually sitting
on the roots around the rhizosphere things
[SPEAKER_06]: like that defending, you know pathogens
because they're able to and they have
[SPEAKER_06]: those things and then you have a whole
system of You know microbes that are on
[SPEAKER_06]: the surface of the soil taking up space So
that when that powdery mildew spore shows
[SPEAKER_06]: up or whatever shows up It's consumed by
the other organisms around it or it's not
[SPEAKER_06]: allowed to take purchase.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no vacancy and no sugar
[SPEAKER_06]: No vacancy and it's harder for it to do so
plus by having like a Microbial
[SPEAKER_06]: relationship and having all those
parameters set just in the soil level all
[SPEAKER_06]: of a sudden The plants getting the
nutrients that it needs at the right
[SPEAKER_06]: levels that it needs By the right
organisms feeding it instead of us trying
[SPEAKER_06]: to kind of cut through the system and then
the cell walls of those cells that build
[SPEAKER_06]: that friggin plant are harder stronger and
you know Almost impenetrable to to insects
[SPEAKER_06]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus it's cycling the sap So it's not
having an overabundance in nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is causing the sap suckers.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a million things that that'll just
like can you talk about that a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: like the sap going through the So what do
you call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: We like a not a vascular system,
but uh, it's uh, what do you call that?
[SPEAKER_06]: They call them sap tests basically.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like the xylem the cambium The
phloem all those all that stuff like that
[SPEAKER_06]: is is is just their vascular system of the
plant itself But so vascular would be the
[SPEAKER_06]: correct word to use.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's what I would that's what I
would use I mean, I'm that's what I was
[SPEAKER_06]: struggling for somebody I try to relate
things as much to us as possible so that
[SPEAKER_06]: we can kind of understand it because we
are all the same the only difference
[SPEAKER_06]: between system the only difference between
their their their Chlorophyll in our blood
[SPEAKER_06]: is the molecule iron and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're work.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are our brothers You know,
I mean really we're all doing the same
[SPEAKER_06]: thing have the same functions have the
same goals just in a slightly different,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, Slightly different things and
they protect us too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't they you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah with their what protect us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean without it so it's like The
sap tests like they do these sap tests
[SPEAKER_06]: commercially like you can test the sap
flow and things at different points in the
[SPEAKER_06]: plant and it will tell you the amount of
Nitrogen there's nitrate nitrogen a
[SPEAKER_06]: monoclonal nitrogen different things like
that and sugars and these other things and
[SPEAKER_06]: plants that are overfed especially like
chemical fertilizers or There's an
[SPEAKER_06]: abundance of nitrogen in the system.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't metabolize it quick enough So
they start storing stuff into their sap
[SPEAKER_06]: which makes their sap really rich and
really delectable to all kinds of sap
[SPEAKER_06]: sucking insects so you've got scale and
aphids and mites and all those things
[SPEAKER_06]: start coming to that plant because it's
it's it's over it's over abundant in these
[SPEAKER_06]: in these nitrogen and sugars that Are in
this plant, but that's why isn't that why
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis farmers like pump the nitrogen it
level it because they want that sap But
[SPEAKER_04]: they want to find that balance,
you know, so that's yeah, I think that's
[SPEAKER_06]: where they go wrong Honestly, I think that
that's where you go wrong as a fun as any
[SPEAKER_06]: farmer not just a cannabis farmer is
pumping it too hard because If you look at
[SPEAKER_06]: any natural system in the way that plants
are eating normally, they're not fed large
[SPEAKER_06]: amounts in short time Like fattening up a
calf it is different it is different But
[SPEAKER_06]: then with fattening up the calf you comes
other problems like can like certain
[SPEAKER_06]: chickens They can't get up because their
breasts are too big or like there's
[SPEAKER_06]: different things you'll you'll cost
yourself By doing it in that in that
[SPEAKER_06]: regard, you know Like any of those flowers
right there never had any type of
[SPEAKER_06]: fertilizer put on it It was planted in in
the food forest floor.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was some compost initially put out
And that's pretty much it I got water to
[SPEAKER_06]: the end, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm and there's donkey dicks and junk
you make you're not making teas not no,
[SPEAKER_06]: not really sometimes sometimes we'll do
like a little bit of calcium like a little
[SPEAKER_06]: calcium something I make WCA out of
eggshells, which is like Korean natural
[SPEAKER_06]: farming calcium.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just plant available calcium with
eggshells and vinegar I was gonna say you
[SPEAKER_02]: put it in vinegar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah vinegar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah for a couple days you you cook up the
eggshells And you brown them and then you
[SPEAKER_06]: mix it with vinegar at like a one to ten
ratio and then and then bubbles and then
[SPEAKER_02]: what eventually are you then sifting out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Solid material or you yeah, don't want to
pour the vinegar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I take I yeah You sift it out you
pour it into a little strainer or whatever
[SPEAKER_06]: you keep the liquid That's your that's
your calcium stuff and then the the
[SPEAKER_06]: eggshells always just go into the compost
powder into the garden Sorry, but the
[SPEAKER_06]: liquid is like mostly vinegar.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty much vinegar, but it has
extracted the calcium all out Of and
[SPEAKER_06]: change the molecule to make it in a plant
available form, but but you dilute that
[SPEAKER_06]: dilute that one to a thousand,
okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: So like yeah, so yeah, it's one to a
thousand and I even I even go a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: less in some cases just to be because I'm
not measuring it's like a squirt of
[SPEAKER_06]: vinegar, but it's so powerful that it's
and it's in its absolutely plant available
[SPEAKER_06]: like this so you can kind of you can fix
those so you do that frequently like I do
[SPEAKER_06]: that usually like In the beginning when
things are getting rolling and then right
[SPEAKER_06]: before I go in the flower usually I'll
give them a good good calcium,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and usually sometimes like a
couple applications or one big like I
[SPEAKER_06]: usually make up one big like trash can of
like seaweed and like Calcium and maybe
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll throw a handful of worm castings from
my worm bin You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Just make this like, you know gangster
little extract You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Literally it doesn't sit in there for more
than you know a few minutes and then I
[SPEAKER_06]: take That and I I start using that into
the garden and I usually do that like
[SPEAKER_06]: twice in the season I'll do it right
sometime in the beginning of the year and
[SPEAKER_06]: Then sometime right when I'm like in the
start of bloom or right before bloom.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no parameter on exactly what week
I'm gonna do it because every year is
[SPEAKER_06]: different especially on like the outdoor
thing and eggs just like eggs that you've
[SPEAKER_02]: eaten over the past month or two Yeah,
yeah, I eat organic eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I always cook them up and then like
crush them into The worm bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, once they pass through the worm
bin, you can kind of get some benefit that
[SPEAKER_06]: way But they're they'll last for years
just sitting in the soil or in those
[SPEAKER_02]: things unless they're getting Can you over
because I get so much leachate from my
[SPEAKER_02]: worms?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you overuse that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've burnt this shit out of my
plants So with my leachate like with my
[SPEAKER_06]: leachate I always like I mean I diluted I
diluted like one to a one to five hundred
[SPEAKER_06]: or one to a thousand I really don't use a
ton when I mix mine into something Because
[SPEAKER_06]: I always err on the side and a little more
aggressive because I yeah I know some
[SPEAKER_06]: people can be really and I've been
aggressive But I've also had some negative
[SPEAKER_06]: reactions from being too aggressive and
then using that too early in the worm bin
[SPEAKER_06]: cycle So if you just got a fresh worm in
right and you just made it like a month
[SPEAKER_06]: ago All that leachy that's coming out of
there or whatever the liquid that comes
[SPEAKER_06]: out of there It's really hot and it's much
more strong than usual So I so that's what
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been pouring and high doses on my
plants, but they look great Okay,
[SPEAKER_06]: good.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean that's not the end of all I
would I would get more out of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll slow it down And you shouldn't get
like tons coming out you don't need to
[SPEAKER_06]: water it every day my worm bin I water
like once a month Maybe in the hot months,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it stays why I would like miss the
top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah a little bit, but now I don't Yeah,
I don't I just covered in this it might if
[SPEAKER_06]: it mines in the shade and it's and it's
just it's basically just this big wagon
[SPEAKER_06]: that sits on center
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know the other ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there's no nightcrawlers,
but I know that there is that for a reason
[SPEAKER_06]: Nightcrawlers usually don't they're not
compost worms So they're they're they're
[SPEAKER_06]: not a little bit They're not as good at
composting I guess is the thing they're
[SPEAKER_06]: they usually hang out in the soil system
in this They're better as don't they come
[SPEAKER_02]: up at night.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah feed and then Yeah, but like I'm like
a breakdown like feeding on like the this
[SPEAKER_06]: kitchen scraps and like on a rapid pace
They're just not that's not their duties
[SPEAKER_06]: as much they're more soil dwellers.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, fortunately the black soldier fly
also found the worm bin So it's like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like tons of blood and the worms are
annoyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can tell they're like because
they're every they're just on yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're dominant they start sometimes the
ants will get in there and start attacking
[SPEAKER_06]: Attacking worms.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you can sprinkle some
diatomaceous earth in there and that'll
[SPEAKER_06]: help knock off the answer the top like war
But what I use also is my old mosquito
[SPEAKER_06]: nets from the hoops that I make are used
in my worm bin So I make my worm bin I
[SPEAKER_06]: line the bottom with a mosquito net and
then I put the stuff in and then I'd
[SPEAKER_06]: either wrap the top with the rest of the
mosquito net or put another mosquito net
[SPEAKER_06]: over the top How do you do it and then
they can't get in no flies.
[SPEAKER_06]: No ants.
[SPEAKER_06]: No nothing It's just they're completely
sealed in that and you're it can break How
[SPEAKER_04]: many plants are you at your place?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you wrap is it like like netting for
one or for a few or for?
[SPEAKER_06]: Depending on how large it depends.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like I do like what's the most plants
that are under one hoop?
[SPEAKER_02]: How about your neighbor let's throw your
neighbor under the bus my neighbors
[SPEAKER_06]: actually annoying I've got like a hundred
foot greenhouse It's all light depth and
[SPEAKER_06]: lit up at night.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like my backyard The last month's
just been like lit up which is I
[SPEAKER_06]: Understand it's all good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_06]: My house is big.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay How late do they keep the lights
on I was out there last night.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was 1130 at night.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you serious?
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're going for size, I don't know
what they're going for bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never talked to them, but uh Yeah,
so like, you know you in like the tall
[SPEAKER_06]: hoop right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've made them 12 by 12 like You know a 12
foot long, you know Not 12 foot wide but
[SPEAKER_06]: 12 12 foot long by a little bit wider than
that, you know Probably 10 foot wide,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can do anything from like a
whole bunch of little plants in pots a
[SPEAKER_06]: whole bunch of little plants in the ground
You can walk in there a couple of bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You do walk in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely You do so then you hold it down
big so we can walk inside Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: you get an extra flap way You get a little
extra so you can fold the flap over and
[SPEAKER_04]: then you put a rock on it How would you
set one of these up and then add some?
[SPEAKER_06]: Supplemental lighting like you couldn't
well you could with with that Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know you you you're pulling the
supplemental lighting when you go into
[SPEAKER_02]: flower anyway, so you don't need it You
don't need it when you're flowering right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So you wouldn't need to have like the new
one You wouldn't need to have you're doing
[SPEAKER_06]: it unless you really wanted extra
protection all the time from everything
[SPEAKER_06]: which net isn't bad all the time in the
winter you can have nets all the time
[SPEAKER_06]: because they're not gonna get as big right
you can you know that they're gonna stay
[SPEAKER_06]: pretty small and it's gonna be more cold
and stuff so you can get away with setting
[SPEAKER_06]: them up early, but Supplemental light then
you get like a like a couple of like two
[SPEAKER_06]: by fours or a couple of pieces of wood and
you You stick some of that and build a
[SPEAKER_06]: little the Sun on demand lights out here
Like two little cheap LEDs you can even
[SPEAKER_06]: probably get some solar like that's those
solar ones Yeah, cheese little things that
[SPEAKER_06]: would just light up a little bit and
that's you need a little bit, you know
[SPEAKER_06]: close to them and on them to keep them but
in the winter I really I don't ever do the
[SPEAKER_06]: supplemental I just I try To run them
inside like if you have if you have a
[SPEAKER_06]: little space inside then You plant a bunch
of seeds in the winter starting now This
[SPEAKER_06]: is when you know, you know I start doing
some of the winners looks and some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: looks at things you plant seeds now you
grow them up inside until they're like You
[SPEAKER_06]: know a foot tall maybe less eight inches a
foot tall Right before they sex you just
[SPEAKER_06]: take them outside and you put them and set
them up in there and then you can pull the
[SPEAKER_06]: sex or before you know, you can you can
clone them and sex them But I don't even
[SPEAKER_06]: do that I get them up to where they're
about ready to start showing maturity like
[SPEAKER_06]: they can kind You know, like you should
transplant them, you know, like fuck I
[SPEAKER_06]: should transplant this you're going
outside Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: So then they you you get your space back
and you can take those outside and then
[SPEAKER_06]: you They go in a flower and then you get
another six inches They'll double in size
[SPEAKER_06]: sometimes because they're gonna stretch,
you know a third to You know double
[SPEAKER_06]: depending on what you're growing and you
get a you know, you're getting a foot and
[SPEAKER_06]: a half tall Plant was a couple good
branches and then you don't have To have
[SPEAKER_06]: supplemental light other than like
starting them inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go from eight foot to foot now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Tom You're gonna go from having a
failed small home grow to having the the
[SPEAKER_02]: biggest operation of fire producing we do
that Yeah, and the thing is you get
[SPEAKER_06]: shipped to New York spray anything like
people like 90% of the friggin outdoor
[SPEAKER_06]: weed you're gonna smoke is got sprayed
with something You just bring it with
[SPEAKER_06]: something.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean bud worms are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how a lot of these get away
with my and it was so how Let's talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: like a but farm at scale and moths.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going like you got to spray them
Yeah, you don't you either got so much to
[SPEAKER_06]: lose and there's so much more they spray
What are they spraying a BT probably
[SPEAKER_06]: probably I don't flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, most people are Yeah, you have to
you don't have protection you have to but
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like scale I'm like the Hector's and
shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm sure That like I mean you're
you're gonna concede part of it and you're
[SPEAKER_06]: you're gonna have too many plants for the
population Right, but then you have lights
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that there would be good light
control like those dyna trap lights those
[SPEAKER_06]: electric lights You don't want them
hanging like right next to your plants to
[SPEAKER_06]: where it's gonna like Fiddle I don't think
that they would anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't think they would anyway But
they you start hanging them in the early
[SPEAKER_06]: spring as things are vegging and you start
killing all the population early So
[SPEAKER_06]: there's less breeding going on so by the
time you go into summer and you're Going
[SPEAKER_06]: in you're going into flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've already kind of den in the local
population in your zone I'm like not as
[SPEAKER_06]: much predicated breeding, you know all
this stuff going on that now you've got
[SPEAKER_06]: less to deal with and You can run it
through the through the cycles like over
[SPEAKER_06]: there and draw most of them to that
Instead of right here because they'll be
[SPEAKER_06]: drawn to that light towards your
neighbor's property And then you can kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of yeah exactly then you can kind of light
them up on that on that regard too so you
[SPEAKER_06]: don't have to do as much spraying and Have
like those lights like I bet you they I
[SPEAKER_06]: mean I've seen some that did they actually
had little towers with some zapper lights
[SPEAKER_06]: on and and things like I've seen some that
did I don't know what a lot of them Do do
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean here we don't have a lot of huge
hemp farms that I can go to and see you
[SPEAKER_06]: know There's more you know other places.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know this the East and you know,
Colorado and places like that So I don't
[SPEAKER_06]: see as many of the hemp hemp farms,
but man I know that like a lot of people
[SPEAKER_06]: in Humboldt use the Dyna traps for like
the big trees and you know a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: different types of So I have a question
for you Do you recommend mosquito netting
[SPEAKER_04]: for like large commercial grows?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean is it doable?
[SPEAKER_06]: So in Perump, Las Vegas and Arizona like
during like Cool season you can kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: get away with little little open hoops
like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a hunter and whatever You know
what I mean, and we've we've set up big
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean big big hoops like that
with that and you just order big big rolls
[SPEAKER_06]: and yeah, I mean it It works.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't last as long as some things and
it's easily torn So like you buy this big
[SPEAKER_06]: thing and you tear it a hole in there It's
like fuck you got to like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: you got to do some you know, but Yeah for
a cheap like way to like do it and then as
[SPEAKER_06]: long as you're reusing it for something
else Like I use it for my worm bins or I
[SPEAKER_06]: use it for blueberry coverage And once it
gets tore somewhere else, I change it to
[SPEAKER_06]: some other type of function You know,
I mean I try to use the shit out of it
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do you get mosquito netting in large
swaths of it?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get Well Amazon Amazon you can at
Home Depot, which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can't you cannot get it at Home
Depot You might be able to order it on a
[SPEAKER_06]: Home Depot online store and like order it
somewhere and they might be able to sell
[SPEAKER_06]: but I've never You can't go someplace and
actually buy it a fabric store.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like like Joanne fabric stores Like
this is what we have around here,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: They have it sometimes but Sometimes the
amount that I need or and what are they
[SPEAKER_02]: calling a mosquito?
[SPEAKER_06]: They're charged too much at those stores
Yeah, and they don't have that on hand,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, but I found that Amazon you can
order on Amazon You can order it from
[SPEAKER_04]: fabric stores like Joanne fabric Shouldn't
shouldn't hydro stores and those grocery
[SPEAKER_04]: shops have it because that's where I go to
get the net Yeah, they were smart.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know, honestly like it's really
weird Like I eat so the reason why I use
[SPEAKER_06]: the netting in the first place is I'm a
fruit tree guy, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm constantly I had we've constantly Over
here right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean we're constantly putting
stuff over like crops to protect them
[SPEAKER_06]: frost blankets Like blueberries are a big
thing where I use those for blueberry
[SPEAKER_06]: bushes.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're small We can build a little pvc
thing blueberries bird control like
[SPEAKER_06]: nobody's business.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically the birds are Swarming above.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah exactly and like peaches and like you
got you got you got You got June beetles
[SPEAKER_06]: attacking the figs and the soft flesh
fruits the peaches and the nectarines and
[SPEAKER_06]: this big old green, you know June bug
Beetles floating around the Japanese
[SPEAKER_06]: beetles or whatever There's all kinds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've always used stuff like this just
to cover fruit trees and stuff So like
[SPEAKER_06]: years ago, like I mean I planted the
greatest crop I've ever seen I was so
[SPEAKER_06]: proud it was like I don't know it's like
almost ten years ago or whatever and
[SPEAKER_06]: basically I Didn't get any of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It all was bud wormed to death And this is
at a point where you would have done it if
[SPEAKER_06]: it was a blueberry tree If I wouldn't I
didn't even think that I was like,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know I'll spray it with BT or I like
didn't think about the I Didn't have that
[SPEAKER_06]: problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never planted such a big crop the way
that I did outdoors and that was the first
[SPEAKER_06]: time that I really got kicked in the
stomach and I was like Everybody has to go
[SPEAKER_06]: through that you got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to be like and then I'm like
I'm gonna pull out the mosquito netting
[SPEAKER_06]: and I've never looked back ever every year
and you pull in you're pulling the I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: just trying to like to understand kind of
the time frame.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like kind of trying to go back in
time with the Negative tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah When I let you know that we have a
problem We it was probably too late.
[SPEAKER_04]: I even told him with the first text I go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I have a problem and I think the
entire caterpillar and took it off when I
[SPEAKER_02]: bet you you're what like week three
flower, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was maybe so that's my question to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like we're already two or three weeks
too late Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, so like I said before like
they're not really going After the really
[SPEAKER_06]: small flower and plants, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: They wait for them to get a little bit
more robust because the the stench is a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit more There's more for their
offspring to consume.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a place for them to hide I don't
know the exact reason of why but usually
[SPEAKER_06]: about Week as soon as you start getting
some substantial little pom-poms on there
[SPEAKER_06]: The second you can smell it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's when it's just that's when
that's when they're already ahead of you
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you got a week.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a week or two ahead of that You
know, so like I usually like June Like
[SPEAKER_06]: late June into like the first week of July
maybe, you know this year I was a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit later when you when do you plant I?
[SPEAKER_06]: Plant from inside and everything comes
outside when it's time like in in late May
[SPEAKER_06]: early June this things come out But by the
end of June and like the first two weeks
[SPEAKER_06]: of July Where we are like we already have
only like 15 hours of Sun like max in the
[SPEAKER_06]: summer You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like some of my stuff Will trigger earlier
than that like it's really light sensitive
[SPEAKER_06]: and trigger so I have to cover my stuff a
little bit earlier than some you know
[SPEAKER_06]: where I grew a bunch of stuff from my
buddy this year and all of this stuff like
[SPEAKER_06]: it's it's like still going because it you
know, it's so late, you know compared to
[SPEAKER_06]: my stuff, you know, so it's it just
depends on what you're growing but you
[SPEAKER_06]: want to get it like a Week or two before
you go into flower right when you're to
[SPEAKER_06]: usually right when I'm taking clones For
the for the select stuff that I'm want to
[SPEAKER_06]: look at the ones that have the best stem
rub The best ones or my mother plants that
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep every year anyway, you know,
I mean as soon as they grow up I always
[SPEAKER_06]: put those outside in the ground so they
can tap into the earth and regenerate I
[SPEAKER_06]: take clothes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I cover them the mothers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah In the corner back there a bogan via
the bogan via so don't those attract
[SPEAKER_04]: Aren't those don't those so they have a
bogan be a looper.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a different worm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay Another worm will have no interest no
interest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a different thing I believe
yeah, I think you guys are right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it is the cornworm where it's an
earworm It's a worm that wants to be
[SPEAKER_06]: inside of a bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an actual bud worm They'll get into
flowers or corn things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's where I would like roses
like like different types of things Like
[SPEAKER_06]: tight-budded areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where they they snuggle right up in
additional for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah Yeah, I mean they're yeah,
it's you're like cozy and all your food is
[SPEAKER_02]: right there in your most of most like my
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I remember the one where its head was
buried in the bud and its whole body was
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah Yeah, no, I know about those brother.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been through that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've sent through my dad You know
bummer for for them But him him and his
[SPEAKER_06]: little little covenant of group of people
that he lives with over there They got
[SPEAKER_06]: decimated this year with where and they
put up the net too late And I was telling
[SPEAKER_06]: him like you guys put up the friggin nets,
please put it down in Sandy They're an
[SPEAKER_06]: ocean beach.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and I was like And they put them up
too late and it was like It was like once
[SPEAKER_06]: it's too late.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too late.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, when it went bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so It's because it's been happening
for two weeks before exactly So that
[SPEAKER_04]: weekend when we found that that one
caterpillar Yeah, there was already 30 of
[SPEAKER_04]: them on no I know but it was so beautiful
the plants that like they were looking
[SPEAKER_04]: good Really there was a lot of happiness.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was so much So, you know they was
like and they thought that too though,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, that's what they're looking for
So the cannabis gods really fuck with your
[SPEAKER_04]: head is they make it like it's already?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you don't know you don't know it
yeah the way that I notice it like Nine
[SPEAKER_06]: times out of ten the way that I'll notice
it before anything if you don't see the
[SPEAKER_06]: droppings and it's early One of the little
leaflets that's coming out of the bud will
[SPEAKER_06]: be brown one little leaflet or one little
Area right there will just be slightly
[SPEAKER_06]: discolored and it's not even something
that's like whoa, that's messed up It's
[SPEAKER_06]: like it's just slightly different.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you open that up and then it's
completely rotten behind Is it is our new
[SPEAKER_04]: our new expressions coming in because
sometimes they'll look because they look
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah And sometimes that's just like maybe
the tricones have gone amber on there
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's something, you know,
maybe it just got hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really hot Maybe this leaf just got
burnt a little bit or but no as soon as
[SPEAKER_06]: you touch that leaf that thing will pull
right out of there and then you'll see you
[SPEAKER_06]: can your that bud will just Disintegrate
in your hand like a perfect looking bud
[SPEAKER_06]: will just like disintegrate you look
inside and it'll be all poop on the inside
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we did.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean one of your like Oh, it's too late
and and you're and you're too late.
[SPEAKER_06]: You really are I mean you can spray at
that point and save what you can but
[SPEAKER_06]: You're already sprayed that sucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean is where it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've all smoked that for years I mean,
I'm not you know, I'm not you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not better than some kind of but
that's been sprayed every once in a while
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I have the choice, it's gonna be as
clean as first That's right, you know
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know as it can be So while you
know, the key is keep it off of the plant
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't let the mosquito netting touch the
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give yourself some room Always make it a
little bigger than your plants and know
[SPEAKER_06]: that your plants are going to stretch So
don't build it to like your plant size and
[SPEAKER_06]: right in your flower And then they're
gonna stretch right into the son of a
[SPEAKER_06]: bitch always gives like how I buy So when
you say a little bit a little bigger you
[SPEAKER_04]: want a couple of yeah For sure,
yeah, always get a little more than you
[SPEAKER_06]: should and if you have a little extra on
the ground You got to throw a couple rocks
[SPEAKER_06]: on I always put soil on mine So it really
stays nice, you know or whatever but or
[SPEAKER_06]: mulch or whatever is you know on the
certain, you know But you want you want
[SPEAKER_06]: some extra lay on the ground to keep
rodents out because not only is it gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: keep bud worms up But you're gonna keep
squirrels.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're gonna keep rats.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're gonna keep rabbits You're gonna
keep all kinds of stuff on the ground
[SPEAKER_06]: traffic from coming in and chewing on your
stems or causing a ruckus And on a small
[SPEAKER_06]: scale, this is the way to do like that's
like you got six plants You can friggin
[SPEAKER_06]: protect the shit out of those six plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely like awesome, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's like resin stud stud is the
note that goes along with it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: so that way you're making hash that would
know that one that one's dad.
[SPEAKER_06]: The dad of that was a resin stud Oh got
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was a plant his daddy was what
came out of a big sort of big population I
[SPEAKER_06]: went through a bunch of plants with me and
my couple of my buddies and we pulled out
[SPEAKER_06]: this Mail that had visible resin dripping
all over him and had awesome stank and
[SPEAKER_06]: stickiness to him and then that mail hit a
bunch of my stuff and that's the That's
[SPEAKER_06]: that's just one of the things that's the
work.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's the what the orchard lady.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the bacon grease the bacon grease
Yeah, so there's yeah, so you've got two
[SPEAKER_02]: resin studs going there So bacon grease
wicked witch and sorry bacon grease is Pam
[SPEAKER_02]: one crossed with dosy dough So that's the
that's version sorry V2.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so Like everything that I do Goes
through parent every mail that I collect
[SPEAKER_06]: and find goes to Pam first Pam one first
because email Yeah, my female my Pam one
[SPEAKER_06]: lady every mail that I find always breeds
with Pam one in addition to everybody else
[SPEAKER_04]: stable That's your stable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah every male that's coming from
outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not a Pam.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not every mail that I select Yeah,
that's not a Pam.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's anything that I need to learn about
I breed the Pam one Because Pam one doing
[SPEAKER_06]: that I know Pam so yeah, it will tell me
everything that that mail does,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll tell me oh he passes structure or
he passes this this smell or he he gives
[SPEAKER_06]: frost or he changes the bud structure or
whatever cuz he'll tell me right away What
[SPEAKER_06]: the hell what the hell he does cuz I've
grown so many different types of Pam and
[SPEAKER_04]: so many different variables Why were you
drawn to that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Pam is an old bag seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm like Pam Anderson.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's like she's like a bag seed from
the late 90s early 2000s kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: old-school funky sativa stuff That I just
had collected and when I grew Pam's mother
[SPEAKER_06]: from that original seed She was really
special and she was awesome and she was
[SPEAKER_06]: heavy producing and I was like man I want
to keep this plant around for a little
[SPEAKER_06]: while so I kept it around for a little
while and then I Had it matter what
[SPEAKER_04]: environment you were in or did she's
tough.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's colorful.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's pretty she's heavy That's why you
like early life.
[SPEAKER_06]: So she's yeah, and I mean she does
everything that I need her to do It's the
[SPEAKER_04]: same story with this other breeder who
uses this black in everything Everybody
[SPEAKER_06]: has like this one thing that you know,
it's a purple Something that's that you
[SPEAKER_06]: know that you use that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, but But the way you're
describing it right now is that you use it
[SPEAKER_02]: because you know it so well So it teaches
you what the other thing is doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but then do you then eventually
cross the other thing with something?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not Pam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes always Oh, yeah, that's me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the test with Pam first.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not like fixated on Pam for
smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no You're using you love it,
but you're also using it so it can tell
[SPEAKER_06]: you she's my bar that I can yeah I can
tell she she's so strong like you're
[SPEAKER_06]: calibrated to her as yours everything that
she usually touches She dominates like in
[SPEAKER_06]: the genetic pool, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a dominator literally like literally
dominates it like it should turn
[SPEAKER_06]: everything like like to her morphological
character She really dominates over fruit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean she'll Really take over so if you
find something that dominates her that's
[SPEAKER_06]: something that I like And sometimes you
don't want something that dominates her
[SPEAKER_06]: right you want a male that like if you
want So say I want to cross this male with
[SPEAKER_06]: something that's not Pam That is perfect
like say say dog walker and I want to make
[SPEAKER_06]: dog walker exactly, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll cross this male and if this male
doesn't really do anything and Pam
[SPEAKER_06]: completely dominates this man and it's
pretty much that then maybe I'll use that
[SPEAKER_06]: male in that dog walker because Maybe the
dog walker will dominate it too and I'll
[SPEAKER_06]: get what I want quicker You know what I
mean to look at to mediate it kind of just
[SPEAKER_06]: depends on what you what you want I just
want to find out what the male does and
[SPEAKER_06]: then I can use them accordingly if I want
to use them So talk about something recent
[SPEAKER_06]: where you bacon grease that that's V this
nobody has this Okay, one other person a
[SPEAKER_06]: guy that lives in Jamaica my boy Rasta
Bob.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the only other person Has that
version that is v2?
[SPEAKER_06]: The v1 the real bacon grease is my you
have confidence of it doing well I wanted
[SPEAKER_06]: you to get something that was good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know I want you to have those
seeds are in good hands.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not worried about yeah, I got plans
Stakes are high, but it's just something
[SPEAKER_06]: that's just different that you can like,
you know, okay So in the breeding of this
[SPEAKER_06]: the Pam was the so the one I wanted the
bacon grease that I wanted to Create and
[SPEAKER_06]: call bacon grease was with my Pam 15.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and that same dad But that was the
byproduct of the project dad was the dosy
[SPEAKER_02]: dough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's the resin decks I went through
a bunch of plants and found a resin dad
[SPEAKER_06]: dosy dough and I wanted to know You know
what he did so but I wanted to breed him
[SPEAKER_06]: with my Pam 15 because my Pam 15 is this
crazy tall haze thing That's just a resin
[SPEAKER_06]: dripper and I wanted to give it a resin
male to this other resin thing But in
[SPEAKER_06]: doing that project I had to hit it to the
Pam one in order to Figure out kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: what she did and I grew a bunch of those
out and it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome as hell, too It's like hard
to tell the difference, but that's just a
[SPEAKER_06]: different mom than my traditional one So
it's version two and then version ones
[SPEAKER_02]: with the 15 But then once you know what
the dosy dough male does would you then
[SPEAKER_02]: cross it with for example a cherrygasm?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which you also now know what and for both
of these, you know what the males do Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can just apply what would happen
females as well that I want to do Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: I can apply it to whatever female that I
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah of something that's not Pam in our
example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like trial kush, a gator bait So
from this project you'll now Breed the
[SPEAKER_06]: dosy dough with like one of these other So
that dosy dough fathered a couple things
[SPEAKER_02]: that are going into testing this year And
what did Pam tell you about the dosy dough
[SPEAKER_02]: male?
[SPEAKER_06]: So that dosy dough male has a more upright
kush structure with more of my Cushy
[SPEAKER_06]: leaves, which is what I wanted which right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all in flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're still fruit fruit dominant But it
has sparkle it added resin and it added a
[SPEAKER_06]: little bit of the of a shorter stature
with more of like the branches are more
[SPEAKER_06]: upright instead of Christmas tree,
you know, it has this more I call it the
[SPEAKER_06]: kush a kush stature and has this more more
of a and that's the og kush version those
[SPEAKER_06]: dosy dough is the dosy dough 18 Because it
was greasy as hell I I was pushing it up
[SPEAKER_06]: against the Mosquito netting, you know
what I mean moving some stuff around and
[SPEAKER_06]: it's it left such a nasty smear on the
side when I when I pulled it aside And it
[SPEAKER_06]: was just greasy as fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man, that's greasy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like that's some greasy That's some
greasy, you know, like I was thinking
[SPEAKER_06]: about him.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was baking grease man That's what it is
an old baking grease is all white in the
[SPEAKER_06]: pan Just like just greasy and you know,
once you get it on there, you're never
[SPEAKER_06]: getting it off It were pretty much,
you know, it is what it is I just call it
[SPEAKER_06]: bacon grease that smell like bacon grease
or anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very floral very Spicy very I call
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I call it smoke shop like you walk into a
smoke shop and there's like incense and
[SPEAKER_06]: Funky things smelling and kind of this
musty dude with Bo and just this weird
[SPEAKER_06]: collection Yeah weird smoke shop kind of
smell very very very very good Okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: but so as a contrast This is the orchard
lady, which is also a PAM one cross with
[SPEAKER_02]: citrus farmer So what did the PAM one tell
you about the citrus farmer PAM one
[SPEAKER_02]: dominates that cross?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that's a submissive male.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, he's more so he added frost like a
mofo though so in the cactus fruit like
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a There's cactus fruit or cactus
cam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people call it cactus cam a bunch of
veteran groups grow it a couple people
[SPEAKER_06]: around town grow it there's several people
that have found Keepers in the cactus cam
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's just it looks kind of like the
Mac with the resin It really has got this
[SPEAKER_06]: grapefruit citrus sharpness with this Mac
kind of resin, you know profile But to the
[SPEAKER_06]: orchard lady, it it doesn't have that I
haven't found any of those Mac resin
[SPEAKER_06]: characteristics You've got the PAM
characteristics in there, which is purples
[SPEAKER_06]: and pinks and swirls of color and it's got
more of a sandy resin type like PAM and
[SPEAKER_06]: she's this really grapey Most of the
phenotypes are very great bubblegum and
[SPEAKER_06]: Sugary and colorful.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're really cool and the branches are
really stout like you don't need Caging
[SPEAKER_06]: and stuff for most of the orchard unless
you're gonna let it get 10 or 12 feet
[SPEAKER_06]: which they will and there's several people
that grew 10-foot Orchard ladies this
[SPEAKER_06]: year, which is killer But they are really
firm fibrous branches man, and it's full
[SPEAKER_06]: on like Candelabra You can but you should
do it early with the orchard lady because
[SPEAKER_06]: they firm up pretty but do you do you know
I don't do a lot Do you let your plants
[SPEAKER_06]: just do what they're gonna do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, unless they're like coming into
contact with danger like if they're in a
[SPEAKER_06]: smaller space and I need to Manipulate
them to keep them out of trouble then I
[SPEAKER_02]: will do so But it's like when valentina
was jumping up and down on the couch yet
[SPEAKER_02]: last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Outside over the concrete and I was
like let me I do a top right in the
[SPEAKER_06]: beginning and then usually the beginning
so like when they get like three or four
[SPEAKER_06]: leaf sets As soon as I get like six
inches, so you know, they got a couple of
[SPEAKER_06]: good leaf sets I'll top it then so you
have a nice low branching not too low
[SPEAKER_06]: because I don't want it branching on the
ground So, you know, I usually you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know six inches seven inches I'll do a
top right there and then I don't do
[SPEAKER_06]: another one and most of the strains that I
grow are really branchy strains any way,
[SPEAKER_06]: so just that one top just sends it on its
way to a Really nice and the height is
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever it's gonna whatever you want it
to be like the Pam and like the dog Once
[SPEAKER_04]: it gets say to 80, you know, you know,
I don't want any what how do you keep it
[SPEAKER_04]: from growing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Bend that sucker down just bed prune it or
bend it So I'm not if I'm a fan of both so
[SPEAKER_04]: but so like if you prune it aren't you
like?
[SPEAKER_04]: Creating a potential opening for something
to get like if you do if you do if you're
[SPEAKER_06]: pruning it I would say prune early don't
prune late because later you prune The
[SPEAKER_06]: less activities happen in with your plant
the less it's feeding itself the less it's
[SPEAKER_06]: doing the more Heal, you know,
the less it's gonna be able to take care
[SPEAKER_06]: of that wound.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got too much Well, once you're six
seven eight feet, that's too late You got
[SPEAKER_06]: a bandaid at that point, you know,
and you can bend it and you know to flop
[SPEAKER_06]: it or whatever No problem, man,
or weave it, you know I've put in I put in
[SPEAKER_06]: trellis nets way too late and fully made
it work You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, even if you you know,
it's not and they like a little bit of
[SPEAKER_06]: stress Yeah, but do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean I mean the best honestly the
best the best plants I think You know just
[SPEAKER_06]: like the best best people in this world
man.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't come from my perfect
situations, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know came from torment and struggle in
some way or not I don't say struggle your
[SPEAKER_06]: plants But like in some way you have to
work for what you have right, you know But
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you like if you're like
listening talking to people Reading if you
[SPEAKER_04]: don't have your hands on experience
people's beliefs You know like about
[SPEAKER_04]: philosophies about that are all over the
map, you know in terms of and so You know
[SPEAKER_04]: at the end of the day you kind of fun have
to find your own way Yeah, I think you
[SPEAKER_04]: have to yeah, because you can't listen to
everyone Is the rice just a desk again me
[SPEAKER_06]: gonna work for you all the time,
you know, what is the rice?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's my cheap little one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually there's cotton or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually use cotton or rice in there So
it works for like some KNFE microbes on
[SPEAKER_02]: the rice It's clean good organic rice,
you know Mycelium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, throw a bunch of that random stuff
for random seeds these cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: So which one would you recommend?
[SPEAKER_02]: Out here next because I think basically
with all we should just chop all like
[SPEAKER_02]: everything salvage down Yeah, salvage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're you're yeah, you're you're
you're hurting You don't want to like
[SPEAKER_06]: ingest anything that actually you know Has
molded or got a bunch of the stuff on
[SPEAKER_06]: there if you got a clean spot or a clean
bud that's not touch I think they're like
[SPEAKER_06]: just a and go for it But really you're
gonna have a meager situation The best
[SPEAKER_06]: thing to do is use that because it's a bio
accumulator.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all that good soil and all that Good
stuff that you put it fed into it,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at least inside of it, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can chop that up and use it as
mulch or throw it someplace or you know
[SPEAKER_02]: composted We should we should we should go
to Home Depot and get like a home Like
[SPEAKER_06]: composter no what you need to do those
don't work What you got to do like those
[SPEAKER_06]: little things?
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing with compost man is you got to
have like a you got to have at least a
[SPEAKER_06]: three by three three foot wide three foot
tall pile like mass right in order to
[SPEAKER_06]: generate enough heat to start cooking the
stuff to really do break it down and
[SPEAKER_06]: Sterilize all that good stuff but if you
only build it three foot tall and three
[SPEAKER_06]: foot wide then after like the first day or
two it runs out of steam and Stops cooking
[SPEAKER_06]: and then you get a half-ass pile that
never finishes and just kind of sits there
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's where everybody gives up,
you know in their in their compost pile so
[SPEAKER_06]: if you build it five foot tall and You
know three foot or five foot tall But what
[SPEAKER_06]: I do is I got three pallets or six pallets
from home Depot, right and I put one
[SPEAKER_06]: pallet on its side one pallet in the back
and one pallet on the side and create a
[SPEAKER_06]: little cubby and then I make an identical
one on this side, right and then you pile
[SPEAKER_06]: your stuff to the top of that,
you know pallets like four or four and a
[SPEAKER_06]: half feet or whatever and With one side
open the front side open Yeah with the
[SPEAKER_06]: front side open so you can kind of shovel
stuff in there whatever and you just pile
[SPEAKER_06]: it up as best you can as You go green or
you go brown brown and dead green and wet
[SPEAKER_06]: brown and dead green and wet So it's like
brown stuff wood and brown dead leaves
[SPEAKER_06]: brown dead stuff and then like green is
like green leaves or grass clippings or
[SPEAKER_06]: chicken manure stuff or whatever you're
using that's green and wet and you know
[SPEAKER_06]: and you do brown and Brown and green and
brown and green you soak all that down as
[SPEAKER_06]: you're building the pile and as long as
you get it five foot tall and You know
[SPEAKER_06]: that palette size wide it'll start cooking
and that thing will start frigging Just
[SPEAKER_06]: over the next two days or so.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll just heat up to like 160 180 140
somewhere in there depending on your time
[SPEAKER_06]: of year and it will just start cooking
that stuff and then you after two or three
[SPEAKER_06]: days then you take your your fork and you
frigging rotate it over into the next bin
[SPEAKER_06]: that you made and that's the sucky thing
about compost is because the only way to
[SPEAKER_06]: actually do it to where you're not getting
anaerobic crap and like stuff that you can
[SPEAKER_06]: jam your hand in and like Smear on your
face because it smells like good earth and
[SPEAKER_06]: is beautiful The only way to do it to do
it the right way those tumblers They don't
[SPEAKER_06]: have enough mass and you have to like add
stuff and they're always this sludge that
[SPEAKER_06]: like you never want To do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have those tumblers and they're actually
pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, do you have it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have huge ones?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you get enough mass and if you add
the compost starter drum is 55 gallons and
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a dual if you get them the big Yeah,
if you just have the small the small area
[SPEAKER_06]: it never heats up and I've been done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get so high That's why I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I've been to thousands of places and
like they have these things and they just
[SPEAKER_06]: they just never break down It's just this
nasty sludge where you don't want to like
[SPEAKER_06]: stick your hand in it If you don't want to
stick your hand in it then It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll bring some next time.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like my judge If you don't want to
jam your hand in it, then you're not doing
[SPEAKER_06]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I put it in all my pots.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the bomb But nine times out of ten
you need that mass and if you do it like
[SPEAKER_06]: that, it cooks really quick You can do it
in a matter of a few weeks What I thought
[SPEAKER_02]: we were talking about was just like
cutting it and just laying it on there But
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, you can do that too.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then it wouldn't thermophilically
Well, if you if you turned it into the
[SPEAKER_06]: soil you have to cull it It's not gonna
thermophilic add anything no matter what
[SPEAKER_06]: if you just cut it and lay it down It's
just gonna oxidize or break down if you
[SPEAKER_06]: just leave it on the surface then the Sun
will lose a lot of your nutrition You're
[SPEAKER_02]: saying that's okay, even though you just
got hammered with You it's okay no matter
[SPEAKER_06]: what because you're not you know,
you don't got nothing else you're Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you don't have anything left and you
know, those worms are just protein and
[SPEAKER_06]: vitamins and minerals and water anyway so
compost the shit out of them or bury them
[SPEAKER_06]: and throw them in the soil or Yeah,
chop it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be psyched to keep me work cuz I was
gonna you know, actually bring them Throw
[SPEAKER_02]: them in my composter at home.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah for sure, dude And then like I said,
you got all that good stuff that was in
[SPEAKER_06]: that soil I'm sure you guys use awesome
stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean they just loaded themselves up
with at least what and I would want to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep I'd want to keep the root systems
They're just plant right next to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you could so cut it at the base.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah And then we can all right so and then
like the bacon grease is that what we yeah
[SPEAKER_06]: I say bacon grease orchard lady.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean Hubble.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're all kind of they're all
different.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all different in their own way
Like a fruity easy plant would be orchard
[SPEAKER_06]: lady probably a really kind of a tasty
sweet fruity easy that you know orchard
[SPEAKER_06]: lady a more Like the Hubble and the Wicked
Witch will have a tiny bit of CBD on
[SPEAKER_06]: board.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you'll have some Yeah, yes,
sir family family tree seeds Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: so you'll have like You'll have a little
bit of CBD in that Wicked Witch Thanks Tom
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be that that CBD the 3d CBD is a
skunk case Afghan and then the Hubble's
[SPEAKER_06]: the flamingo Ringo so you'll get some
pinks Pink pistol action in that Hubble
[SPEAKER_06]: plus that Hubble's dog walker.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's gas with a little bit of this pink
CBD characteristic so you've Got you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: it dominates on the TAC so it gets you
wasted man And actually it has long carry
[SPEAKER_06]: because you have a little bit of CBD in
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You actually that's Hubble Hubble's the
one that people fall in love with all the
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the I Love Hubble man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a killer one They are the
they're the most they're like the honorary
[SPEAKER_06]: ones like to get going like they're the
ones that are like slower growth at the
[SPEAKER_06]: beginning You know what I mean,
but they're superior you get a good you
[SPEAKER_06]: get phenotype number one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I call it pheno one The Hubble that's a
good dog walker.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have listen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the f1 Well, yeah, but no you gotta
you gotta grow them and the phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll come out of that f1 You'll have a
couple different ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll have a CBD dominant one It'll have
CBD and like pink neon pink hairs and
[SPEAKER_06]: it'll be mostly CBD dominant, you know
We're one to one, you know a one to one
[SPEAKER_06]: and it'll have this funky papaya Grandma's
perfume smell to it and then like
[SPEAKER_06]: phenotype one is dog walker dominant,
which is the gas And like the chem resin
[SPEAKER_06]: and you get color sometimes you'll get
pink in there, too But you'll get this
[SPEAKER_06]: extra color, but that's the grease the gas
with a little bit of you know The the pink
[SPEAKER_06]: and a teeny bit of CBD is in there and
that's my favorite one to find it's like
[SPEAKER_06]: dog walker with a smidge of CBD and some
some color and it's like It's an excellent
[SPEAKER_06]: friggin plant man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent plant and then what should we
cut these right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I thought that was a part of what we
were doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's just get it done
[SPEAKER_04]: Like everything you like gases exotics and
oh geez, what is your personal like?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you my favorites gas man?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what it sounds like cuz your
voice go you get a little excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like gas Like that's the one thing like
the cool thing about Pam is she's not gas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like she is she's got tons of sentimental
She's really rare.
[SPEAKER_06]: She like phylosis garbage, but she tested
like kind of unique in the in the scale of
[SPEAKER_06]: things in their galaxy So that's why I've
kept her for so long.
[SPEAKER_06]: I work with her Which is funny,
but who knows what's real and what's not
[SPEAKER_06]: so I don't have any like like definitive
information on what she is or where she
[SPEAKER_06]: came from and the information that I did
get was like They're not there's not a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's rare, you know, so I was like,
okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's good to know Yeah,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I'm good with I'm good with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've kept her and she's she's tough.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's resilient.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's huge She's resonant.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's pretty she just doesn't have gas but
that's something that you're not that's
[SPEAKER_06]: not like so so what my whole Goal in life
is is like I need to put gas into Pam but
[SPEAKER_06]: but Pam dominates everything Which is like
my life's like someone like their parents
[SPEAKER_02]: and family know they have a certain type
and unlike the woman they marry is
[SPEAKER_02]: completely off type that's like you and So
like she is my type To force Pam to be
[SPEAKER_04]: something I enjoy the shit out of her but
like when she'll appreciate it once it but
[SPEAKER_06]: if I'm sick or if I had a choice and I can
get like I really I want to bring I want
[SPEAKER_02]: to bring I want to try to get the actual
Pam Anderson on And have you like I named
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I sent her a message on email or
like Instagram or something like years ago
[SPEAKER_06]: when I when I was Like I'm gonna name this
after you this this flower if you got a
[SPEAKER_06]: problem with it Let me know but this is
gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, yada yada, but like,
you know, obviously she's not gonna write
[SPEAKER_06]: back to me, but Yeah, you can't really be
like you got at least me.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are many roads to Pam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah One to you and like that's why most
of the time I call it Pam one because It
[SPEAKER_06]: keeps me out of legal trouble in case
she's like pissed off that I'm saying Pam
[SPEAKER_06]: Anderson all the time You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, so yeah You know, it is like Pam's
a common name, but she was the most
[SPEAKER_06]: gorgeous thing when she stands out in the
orchard I mean among other plants you were
[SPEAKER_06]: like what the fuck plan you do the she's
got this thing about earth It's something
[SPEAKER_02]: special with a guy with a girlfriend who's
looking back at the other girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, that's it No, I had a I had a
male that I called the Hoff But he turned
[SPEAKER_06]: out to really Pass really strong citrus
turps and I hate citrus turps like I hate
[SPEAKER_06]: the city like the citrus farmer male that
I got I pulled out the grape one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't want the citrus one I pulled out
this this great cough syrup thing,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: I pulled this weird, you know random one
from the GDP side particular but the
[SPEAKER_06]: citrus turps he passed tons everything in
touch he turned it to friggin orange like
[SPEAKER_06]: bright orange and like Some people like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't I don't I can't smoke the I can't
smoke orange weed, man I just have it
[SPEAKER_06]: doesn't do anything for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like yeah, I don't really like it
either But if anybody's got an orange we
[SPEAKER_06]: so that share with me like let me know
what I've never found Well, what's what's
[SPEAKER_02]: her peen would that be dominant in?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't I don't know what orange tangerine
like that that terpene is I mean limonene
[SPEAKER_06]: is, you know lemony I mean they got that
terpene in there and it's not lemon.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more orange I don't know name for
that turf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't know tip of my tongue,
but yeah, I don't know what the citrus
[SPEAKER_06]: citrus One is yeah, I mean, it's I think
it starts with an O Ozymene it could be
[SPEAKER_06]: could be Ozymene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Oh Tom by the way, if you're getting
more bubbly water, I would yeah I have one
[SPEAKER_06]: in here But yeah, like you can notice like
all the stuff that I cross Pam with a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of the time is like dog walker There's a
triangle cushion cam 91.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just ordered one of these I I ordered
the Amazon knockoff of the cam Co carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: water hose filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's why I use those bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, yeah for sure is like I think
I'd be happy having What I always have to
[SPEAKER_02]: do every day is I?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fill everything up that I'm gonna use the
next day cuz I want to let the water sit
[SPEAKER_02]: for 20.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's great, dude I do use those all
the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a there's 50 different
Manufacturers of the thing there's 10
[SPEAKER_02]: different people that make them clearly
sells because Amazon has the Amazon
[SPEAKER_02]: branded one Like my mic stands I have
every I have light stands their Amazon
[SPEAKER_02]: basics lights and it's interesting to
think that they just see what sells and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're like Let's make that let's make
that it's cheating man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way to do it though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess But no, that's that's like they're
a spider that lures brands into fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know they're like we're gonna buy that
on Amazon, you know, but I seriously went
[SPEAKER_06]: to camping stores I went to fabric stores
I went to every box store.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to every lumber store Nobody
friggin carries like a roll of that stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: and if anybody knows what place let me
know But I've I've went through hell over
[SPEAKER_06]: the last year So I just find it on Amazon
cuz like you can find shade cloth and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff Yeah, but not mosquito netting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: So weird, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: So weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you in Florida It's different.
[SPEAKER_06]: They probably have mosquito netting more
places there because they got mosquitoes,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know more prevalently Yeah,
didn't you say you I know it was Pedro
[SPEAKER_02]: this morning who said he has mosquitoes
down in Orange County and I was like
[SPEAKER_02]: really cuz I never see miss my house.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're 30 feet from their water
source So if you got water standing
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere, there's mosquitoes,
but do you notice that in LA there aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: really?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's not a lot of life in LA
mosquitoes need plants and soil No,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's amazing cuz I come from the East
Coast.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're like Every summer you're just like
my wife's from Rochester New York.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah It's like I couldn't believe that You
guys live like this No, it's not as bad
[SPEAKER_06]: here.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not as many but at my house,
man I mean I got tons of mosquitoes if I
[SPEAKER_06]: especially if I let drains and stuff fill
up, you know It's interesting when it
[SPEAKER_02]: rains here and just the life that explodes
like up in Topanga where it's just like
[SPEAKER_02]: arid vicious Ecosystem and then the rains
come in and like It's everything you think
[SPEAKER_06]: about like that though.
[SPEAKER_06]: You look at all the hillsides,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all covered with that Native
shrubbery right that shrubs and all those
[SPEAKER_06]: little dead plants and like the native
like stuff the native crap Basically,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's your soil regulator and that just
sits there with the what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Protects the biology gives it that buffer
zone and you look at any hillside and you
[SPEAKER_06]: drive on any freeway You look at any
hillside that we're not watering.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll never see bare ground It'll always
be like native shrubbery or like weeds or
[SPEAKER_06]: something will cover that land because
Mother Nature won't allow that to happen
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like as soon as it rains all that
biology has been temperature regulated And
[SPEAKER_06]: protected and it's just lying dormant wait
for the rain to happen So that happens
[SPEAKER_06]: like instantly because it's fully alive
and then you water it Evenly and
[SPEAKER_06]: temperatures and moisture levels are all
even and it shit just comes alive like
[SPEAKER_06]: this but death comes back no water and
then everybody goes dormant, but all that
[SPEAKER_06]: crap goes dormant and returns those
nutrients to the surface and protects
[SPEAKER_06]: everything until the next rain comes and
it's just trippy just When you just it's
[SPEAKER_06]: so weird you just you'll never see it and
the places you See bare ground and clear
[SPEAKER_06]: soil is like Australian outback and like
fucking Mojave Desert.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a lot of wild fennel and yeah But
everywhere I'll be covered with something
[SPEAKER_06]: whether it's weeds or sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, she doesn't allow that So let's
uh, you want to grab your yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you want to see that you want to see
a cool sheer You want to use the fun
[SPEAKER_06]: sheer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get let's do the cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's be right back.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll measure temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll Time we got all sorts of afternoon
activities Well, you got the vest on too
[SPEAKER_07]: and here squeeze that That's an F.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a Pam F2.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one is very similar to mama Very very
very very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: I you just handed it to me as I have like
wet Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, of course You got it,
you know molest that one a little bit cuz
[SPEAKER_06]: It's in the bag and it's fresh,
but it gets this weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets weird funkiness to she's got some
that's Got some cheese in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's got some fruit funny, you know,
so this was which one.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the Pam F2 That's that one right
there You know and you smell this one
[SPEAKER_06]: squeeze it yeah break one of those break
it So how long so you what's your like
[SPEAKER_02]: drying curing process Since you just
finished it with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I wouldn't call that finished.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say it's in process It's what we're
smoking because that's what we're smoking
[SPEAKER_06]: But I like to hang it pretty much full
plant hang, you know If there are seven
[SPEAKER_06]: footers, I got to cut it into three
sections because I can't hang You know
[SPEAKER_06]: seven eight footers like is easy with the
floor space and stuff So you got to cut it
[SPEAKER_06]: into like pieces a couple of pieces,
but fewer pieces the better I think
[SPEAKER_06]: keeping the bigger stems and stuff on
there's what I do and then I hang them I
[SPEAKER_06]: have a couple of big tents that sit empty
that I don't use anymore that I think what
[SPEAKER_06]: big tents they go old-fashioned like
they're like a Five by five a six by
[SPEAKER_06]: something just a couple old tents that I
just don't use anymore So I set them up
[SPEAKER_06]: about you know a month ago and I start
hanging stuff in the tents and they sit in
[SPEAKER_06]: there There's no fan.
[SPEAKER_06]: They sit open and then they're in a
temperature controlled room So like the
[SPEAKER_06]: room itself is like 60 68 degrees,
you know, it doesn't like it doesn't get
[SPEAKER_06]: fit I wish love to have it at 55,
you know and by the Sun, huh by the Sun
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I have a little little air
conditioning in this particular space It's
[SPEAKER_06]: nothing crazy and I can only get it to
about 68 degrees is like the coldest
[SPEAKER_06]: without causing a problem so that's where
they sit for Seven to ten days seven to
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, something like that depending on
the year if it's Santa Ana's like it was
[SPEAKER_06]: When those came down, I mean it was like
it was harder to keep it You know,
[SPEAKER_06]: the more leaves you keep on there the more
stuff you keep on there the more you can
[SPEAKER_06]: slow it down So I left more foliage on
there, you know during that time But yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're yeah seven to ten days are hanging
there and then they come out they go into
[SPEAKER_06]: bins big plastic bins and They kind of sit
there and the bins the tops don't go on
[SPEAKER_06]: the bins But they're on the bins,
you know, cuz it's kind of air can kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: get in there But then they kind of
rehydrate a little bit, you know by
[SPEAKER_06]: sitting in the bins for a little bit and
they're in that same room same temperature
[SPEAKER_06]: and then I start, you know when
everybody's asleep and I'm not too dead I
[SPEAKER_06]: go to trim jail and I I break out the trim
bins and I've set up all my stuff and I
[SPEAKER_06]: get the things going and we you know We go
to town and I usually trim for friggin
[SPEAKER_06]: months man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, and I don't trim very much I mean,
this is the most trim you'll ever see it
[SPEAKER_06]: and I just kind of like I even like half
trim part of it just to make them,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know not look all leafy in the bag,
you know, but I try to keep stuff on it
[SPEAKER_06]: through time because I can't get to it all
myself Yeah, you know as you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I have you know, all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I run all kinds of businesses I got kids I
got yeah I got to do it and so it takes me
[SPEAKER_06]: a while to get the trim stuff done.
[SPEAKER_04]: So but whatever you Are you what is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not like do you have a light?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not putting it out No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, so every summer I'll grow enough like
so last summer is like my seed summer I
[SPEAKER_06]: made all seed and all my stuff was in The
ground big plants for seed and that that
[SPEAKER_06]: stocks up my seed You know my coolers for
my seed and then that hurt my productivity
[SPEAKER_06]: for last year because it's 90% of my crop
was for seed and then I had to rely on my
[SPEAKER_06]: indoor crop, you know to pull my my smoke,
you know what I mean, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: so this year was the crop for Super
setting up the setting up the season and
[SPEAKER_06]: then now I'll go into seed and I'll do
seed through the rest of this season and
[SPEAKER_06]: then the winter and stuff like That I'll
go work on my seed stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically afterwards you're gonna keep
it on the vine for as long as possible
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and because we've seen that even
commercially people are getting into like
[SPEAKER_04]: selling it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah Yeah, the old the old silver dragon
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that I meant yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know I met that guy up in humble I
forget his name really cool character
[SPEAKER_06]: really nice Really radical dude and like
he started talking about that and then I
[SPEAKER_06]: started seeing I'm like, you know,
we talked About that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's really cool man.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really uh, we talk every once in a while
He came down to San Diego a couple times.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a he's a cool dude from the hill man
push back from people Yeah, people people
[SPEAKER_06]: don't like stems and they don't like
leaves like you're making me do your work.
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, that's not cool There's a couple
of us that appreciate that you know what I
[SPEAKER_06]: mean and that's that's that's where it
that's where it is I wouldn't base my
[SPEAKER_06]: whole thing on it, but Definitely is cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got look at that thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this is the Felco 820 wouldn't go
anywhere without it thing is a Thing is a
[SPEAKER_06]: beast I could yeah I always I always
wished for a daughter so that I could
[SPEAKER_06]: strap her boyfriend down and then take him
into the garage and just start hacking on
[SPEAKER_06]: friggin things, you know Cuz I can cut
through I mean I could cut through all
[SPEAKER_06]: this stuff I mean I could cut through this
trunk of this tree with one one swoop I
[SPEAKER_06]: mean it it'll go through three inches like
cheddar One of the coolest plants on
[SPEAKER_06]: planet Earth I mean planet tools on planet
Earth and it saves my life too because I
[SPEAKER_06]: do tons of pruning It's all push button
and I was gonna have to have surgeries and
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff and it and it completely
rehabilitated me Yeah, so check it out so
[SPEAKER_06]: You can shorten it down to small precise
rapid cut motion, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You want bigger cuts you can get it up to
lopper size right like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if you really want You have
precision control so you can just press it
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's got precision Control so you can
really be intricate just the same exact
[SPEAKER_06]: friggin tools my sidearm here Exactly,
except it don't take any strength,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is the best thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not cheap.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like too great But it is a robot arm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a and that's the battery.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a battery pack I can store two
batteries in here, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the cool thing about it is I can
charge this thing and like I Think I can
[SPEAKER_06]: get up to like, you know somewhere around
24 hours a constant use, you know Or close
[SPEAKER_06]: to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you know have more than half a day a
constant use like constant use It's
[SPEAKER_06]: totally your best friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my best friend I mean one charge
usually lasts me a couple days because a
[SPEAKER_06]: big tree that normally took me three hours
now takes me an hour and a half You know
[SPEAKER_06]: what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I cut my time in half only gets so far
open So is there a larger version?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's other versions, but once if it's
any bigger than this Then I have and I got
[SPEAKER_06]: my saws and chainsaws and other saws like
that that are there but like changing
[SPEAKER_06]: tools and stuff like I used to have to
change tools all the time because you
[SPEAKER_06]: can't cut stuff with this like that,
you know, so Save so much so let's let's
[SPEAKER_06]: let's give me the biggest one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's the biggest?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's let's cut it down so you can see it
in action Okay, let's see here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just get this cleaned up Shorten it
down so it's quicker You do any type of
[SPEAKER_06]: pruning or rose pruning or fruit tree
pruning or ganja pruning and you do a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of it save your life man use a They have
other ones that are a lot cheaper than
[SPEAKER_06]: this one that are like compressed air That
do a similar thing you can just pop in a
[SPEAKER_06]: little little whip it thing or whatever
Yeah, come in come go to town for a little
[SPEAKER_06]: while, you know, and they work pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean Sorry homeskill it Like a poodle
that got shaved right I'm gonna cut it
[SPEAKER_06]: down to the ground level because we want
to you know, utilize this right?
[SPEAKER_06]: One cut nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: See you later, brother You know,
that's the cambium there This is like your
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, this is your your cambium.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where we do lots of grafting and
stuff This is where we would split it and
[SPEAKER_06]: I would put you know I'd put something
into this bark if this was upside down
[SPEAKER_06]: This was the trunk of a tree and I cut the
head off of it and I wanted to actually
[SPEAKER_06]: graft this plant Talking like plums.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah citrus avocado Whatever you basically
cut off the say All right say that's a
[SPEAKER_07]: tree, right We cut his head off.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to make this a different tree and
this is a plum and I want to put a cherry
[SPEAKER_06]: on it You know you come up here you cut
its head.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's nice and cleans where you got a
good cambium layer and We'd take this
[SPEAKER_06]: sucker and we'll split the bark Just like
so kind of rock it in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give it a good press and then I can
actually Crack this off a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not the tool to use but I can do
it I've done it a million times super size
[SPEAKER_06]: knife and then you take a the plant that
you really want you're like, oh man,
[SPEAKER_06]: I want the I want this friggin TK on the
Friggin you make a little uh Got to be
[SPEAKER_06]: nice and clean and not be nice and sharp
Which is why you want to use your your
[SPEAKER_06]: grafting knife or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really nice Not the one that does
my digging but the idea is You expose
[SPEAKER_06]: About an inch and a half or so of the
cambium layer on this side and you can
[SPEAKER_06]: leave this back side here You make a
little bit better cut here But the idea
[SPEAKER_06]: since we're not talking about grafting and
then you slide this in just like a little
[SPEAKER_06]: pencil Gently tape it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep gently and Right and then on this side
you can see it like and if this was a
[SPEAKER_06]: fruit tree I'd slice this down a little
bit more really make it perfect But the
[SPEAKER_06]: idea is to break open that cambium layer
slightly Yeah You pop you pop it into the
[SPEAKER_06]: side into this cambium layer so that the
part you cut falls right in line with the
[SPEAKER_06]: other stuff then we take some tape or some
grafts and wax and we would tape that
[SPEAKER_06]: sucker up and Bang this thing would harden
off at the right time of year and would
[SPEAKER_06]: all of a sudden fuse and then this would
be your own tree of Whatever right you put
[SPEAKER_06]: in using this as the root stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how they graft all your fruits You
know, that's one of the ways they do it's
[SPEAKER_06]: called a bark graft.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd be like if you gave my If you put
like my brain onto a different body
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we had two different plants on one
tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like Thank you for the use of your
body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly Yeah, yeah now could you do this
with weed you can do this with weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never Stuff called grafting wax you
can use any wax honestly I use I've used
[SPEAKER_06]: candle wax where you just collide a candle
you're literally dripping wax on there and
[SPEAKER_06]: basically you're just sealing up all the
air holes and you want to tape this really
[SPEAKER_06]: good with some stretchy tape or a Grafting
tape or you can use electrical tape you
[SPEAKER_06]: use the various things But you're
basically gonna push this down as hard as
[SPEAKER_04]: you can to force it against itself What
about this that you want to close up all
[SPEAKER_04]: of that in?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so then you would you don't want to
put wax inside of any hole Okay,
[SPEAKER_06]: you want to smear it over the top so that
it doesn't like fall in there very easily
[SPEAKER_06]: So you keep it from falling in it's thick
wax and it you know You can kind of just
[SPEAKER_06]: smear it over the top so it doesn't fall
in you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you can use tape and it and it's an
art.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's that's part of the that's a part of
the skill You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like taking out a transmission or
whatever There's little tricks that dudes
[SPEAKER_06]: do that we can you know get away with
things that are like how the fuck did he
[SPEAKER_06]: do that?
[SPEAKER_06]: No wax down, but you don't want to jam wax
into the cup because that will Seal off
[SPEAKER_06]: the connection of where it needs to be
touching to fuse together So you want to
[SPEAKER_06]: cover it so air and water can kind of get
in there And you can use tape to do that
[SPEAKER_06]: you can use it just depends on what you
have on hand how good you are But that's
[SPEAKER_06]: that's a cool little side side track thing
on this grafting which is funny,
[SPEAKER_06]: but yeah You can technically do it with
cannabis I've never set up a plant which I
[SPEAKER_06]: meant to for years to just Set up a host
plant and Pam would be a good host plant
[SPEAKER_01]: for that And you can do it on another
species right like you could grab the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis on to Hops the same family right
so I don't know a hundred percent if it
[SPEAKER_06]: would be successful, but hops and cannabis
are related I don't know if it's closely
[SPEAKER_06]: enough related where we could actually
graft it, but they have to be in the same
[SPEAKER_06]: family They have to be like like prunus
Plums and peaches and so they're all a
[SPEAKER_06]: family of prunus you know so They have to
be in the same family citrus you can do it
[SPEAKER_06]: with citrus You can put an orange a lemon
on the grapefruit tangerine all in one
[SPEAKER_06]: tree and a little citrus salad graft And
they do that which is totally cool,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's all citrus.
[SPEAKER_06]: They all got to be relatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know Wait, so you could on like the
same base you could have like One arm
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a lemon grapefruit the next arms
tangerine one that orange as you know as
[SPEAKER_06]: many as you can support or success they
sell them and like four or five graphs
[SPEAKER_06]: already if you go to like a Just a retail
nursery and you're like I want a citrus
[SPEAKER_06]: salad tree or a fruit salad tree They call
fruit salad or citrus salad you know the
[SPEAKER_06]: citrus salad will have a lemon a lime and
orange a tangerine and like a grapefruit
[SPEAKER_06]: or some other type of Tangelo or some
random fruit, but you have like the
[SPEAKER_06]: staples plus one And you can buy that tree
for like 200 bucks in like a retail shop
[SPEAKER_06]: You know and plant as long as with graphs
Each branch is its own tree So each hat it
[SPEAKER_06]: has its own personality and own growth
habit and own like things that it wants to
[SPEAKER_06]: do So you have to keep them all equal size
because there's always going to be one I
[SPEAKER_06]: always say there's always one big brother
that wants to grow bigger and stronger and
[SPEAKER_06]: faster than the other two big brothers and
he'll dominate the other ones out of
[SPEAKER_06]: existence he'll take more of their food
their nutrients and then all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_06]: your graphs Start getting depleted and you
got this one thing that was really tough
[SPEAKER_06]: So you keep them pruned so that each graft
is about the same equal size mass And then
[SPEAKER_06]: they'll all play together and have a good
time So they just it's more of a like a
[SPEAKER_06]: talking concept and like I got this this
is really cool It's a pastime thing
[SPEAKER_06]: production it sucks Don't plant that tree
because you're doing all kinds of stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: and you got to prune it too much and your
production suffers And it's just like you
[SPEAKER_06]: know it's just it's a lot of work,
but it's very cool All right, so let's see
[SPEAKER_02]: you do this one
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had one on each arm, I know
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we can just leave this on top and
put it in here I would dig it in you know
[SPEAKER_06]: if you want to get its full maximum
benefit But then cover it or you cover it
[SPEAKER_06]: with mulch or you cover it because if you
just leave this on the surface the Sun
[SPEAKER_06]: will oxidize a lot of that nutrition And
you won't get its full benefit you'll get
[SPEAKER_06]: benefit, but you won't get it like you
know the full The full deal so however you
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of want To but I would dig it in
there and cover it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is our rebirth Yeah, I'm sorry,
dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry brother This is a lesson right
here he taught you man, that's You take
[SPEAKER_07]: from it for sure And then every year is a
new learning experience, bro Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna say right now we could cut
some of these up into smaller pieces,
[SPEAKER_06]: then we can just bury them later I always
make killer pokers out of you know a good
[SPEAKER_06]: stem or two man make some killer pokers or
those things I make a mic stand out of a
[SPEAKER_06]: few just like that Mendo dope.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a couple of those we got these two
Can Tom can Tom pull the I know I know I
[SPEAKER_06]: know I know you do it man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I know exactly how you feel brother
Tom let's do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: No bullet to the head You want me to take
it off for you you want this What you got
[SPEAKER_06]: see what you got here, I mean yeah,
you keep it so it doesn't fall in the dirt
[SPEAKER_07]: and get more dirty or whatever And I'll
give you this other top here I'll give you
[SPEAKER_07]: a couple of these tops you guys can kind
of sort through those tops up a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: better See if there's anything left in
there that one's toast Yeah, bang bang
[SPEAKER_06]: just cuz it's fun How much do those cost
they're like it's about two grand for this
[SPEAKER_06]: thing they're like Yeah, probably eighteen
hundred and change save up for that one
[SPEAKER_06]: you If you can get you can Yeah,
you can get you can get like I said before
[SPEAKER_06]: you can get the ones that are less
Expensive they're for like four or five
[SPEAKER_06]: hundred dollars
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, check this out check this out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what this says actually why
we're standing here, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let's see what it says Just for
grans, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably not bad, but let's just see
what it says.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this looks okay This looks pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you've been picking a
[SPEAKER_06]: 93 So above 85 110 on the outside of that
fabric pot right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got 110 right there Wow, how hot is it
outside right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: I Think it's less than 110.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's a lot less than 110.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like 70 degrees It's like 75 degrees,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So so if you can imagine like this sitting
in the Sun, it's 110, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not 110 throughout that whole
thing but everywhere where those surface
[SPEAKER_06]: roots are everywhere where that That most
action is there where the life is
[SPEAKER_06]: happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's above 85 degrees And when you
get above 85 degrees, most plants are like
[SPEAKER_06]: fuck that they start shutting down They
stop drinking water and then usually above
[SPEAKER_06]: 85 degrees the workers that live in the
soil the microbes and other things They
[SPEAKER_06]: don't live there or they don't want to
work anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they go to sleep They go if they die
they do that and then being uncovered
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way for any of those organisms
to really occupy and live there like
[SPEAKER_06]: efficiently.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's hungry he's hot and he's not
drinking water for most of the time that
[SPEAKER_06]: he's exceeds the The you know that 85 mark
and I mean they can they can do okay at 85
[SPEAKER_06]: degrees But once you start getting 110,
you know 99, I mean it's nothing wants to
[SPEAKER_06]: be over 100 degrees We don't want to work
in 100 degrees.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't want to work in 100 degrees
It's just that's that's just the nature of
[SPEAKER_06]: the bit So I always want to shoot what it
is and these are even the tan ones,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're shooting the outside of the tan
pots and those are supposed to reflect the
[SPEAKER_06]: heat which they do tremendously Compared
to the others that's still 109 degrees,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So but they need the Sun.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the idea is what do you do you cover
it?
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to have cover you have to have that
clothes over the skin to protect it so
[SPEAKER_06]: that at least has that buffer zone that
will drop and if you look at anything in
[SPEAKER_06]: earth that's actually covered with the
appropriate amount of Stuff it'll always
[SPEAKER_06]: be barren yard.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll always be about 60 to 60 to 85 but
it always Be about 75 degrees you go
[SPEAKER_06]: anywhere on earth, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's check this out.
[SPEAKER_06]: We you had this straw out here Move the
straw aside You're at 82 degrees Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean that's way better than let's do
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah Yeah, so that's that's that's correct
so then you're regulating better Can we
[SPEAKER_06]: check out and you're and you're below
you're below that 85, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean this like I said, it's below
that down low and other things but that's
[SPEAKER_06]: that it's this it's this if you feel the
soil if you reach down you can touch the
[SPEAKER_06]: soil and it's hotter and it's as hot as
your body or Warmer than it's got your
[SPEAKER_06]: soils got a fever and it's not functioning
to where it should be, you know And that's
[SPEAKER_06]: beautifully cool, right and it's sitting
in full Sun 81 degrees right now where it
[SPEAKER_06]: was a hundred hundred degrees on the
surface We're crushing it down below early
[SPEAKER_04]: on the bamboo I had up and they were
really thriving when they were within the
[SPEAKER_04]: BAM this bamboo structure I put up they
were getting plenty of Sun but also it was
[SPEAKER_04]: interspersed so the leaves were being
cooled and So is that something is that
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, was that you know, so when the
plants are young, they don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: mass They're not dropping a lot of shade
onto the canopy floor right under there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's more exposure It's more,
you know more apt to temperatures
[SPEAKER_06]: fluctuating So if you don't have a ton of
mulch or they're really young it'll get
[SPEAKER_06]: hotter quicker So having the bamboo
created more shade and more moisture was
[SPEAKER_06]: able to hang out there for longer And that
was that was totally fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so here's my other question out here
in the valley We reached 117.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was not.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah was not So I was in the same position
and I mean I didn't have any problems at
[SPEAKER_06]: all I mean granted I'm in the ground So
when you're in the ground and you're at
[SPEAKER_06]: 110 for a couple days The plants can
tolerate that as long as you put water out
[SPEAKER_06]: there and they're okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got cover.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're good The temperature it's 110
outside if you got cover on the ground,
[SPEAKER_06]: it'll still be below 85 degrees It'll
still be right in that habitable zone no
[SPEAKER_06]: matter what and that's the Beauty of it
all and you can go to the redwood forest
[SPEAKER_06]: or the Amazon or any place where plants
are growing and we're not Scratch aside
[SPEAKER_06]: the the forest floor and shoot the soil
and it will always be in that range 60 to
[SPEAKER_06]: 80 60 to 85 always that's where nature
regulates the temperature That's the magic
[SPEAKER_06]: zone, you know, and that's there's even a
book about it called like 59 degrees about
[SPEAKER_04]: the forest or something about the forest
So the plant will be able to respirate
[SPEAKER_04]: it'll be able to do all of that as long as
it's cooled down below And then every all
[SPEAKER_06]: the organisms and things that want to live
there will want to work and occupy and do
[SPEAKER_06]: that and you Don't want it too cool
because below that, you know below 60 you
[SPEAKER_02]: got a band.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah Nobody wants to work below it starts
getting cold They start shutting down and
[SPEAKER_06]: doing their thing if they could so it can
go on the reverse, but the insulation
[SPEAKER_06]: Keeps it from jumping around and keeps it
from going either way too far,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is really cool So that's the
importance of the of the mulch like
[SPEAKER_06]: firsthand like not having it and having it
you can see the difference in and What the
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature is, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that and that has a great effect on
everything So can we use that tool to just
[SPEAKER_02]: cut these big pieces up?
[SPEAKER_04]: You had one guy on who said that when it
got really hot he sort of was misting his
[SPEAKER_04]: plants a little bit Yeah, I would never
miss my plants during the heat of the day
[SPEAKER_06]: or after he did say that or after or
nobody said he did he said the myth he
[SPEAKER_04]: said he goes he Above them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like that's how you get powdery mildew
problems because you're increasing the
[SPEAKER_06]: drastic shifts in humidity and things,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you do it before someone who came
here, no It was on when you on your show
[SPEAKER_06]: and so it's like in Arizona I'm from
Arizona originally like my my grandparents
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody lives out.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's 120 degrees every day I mean,
it's just freaking miserable from May on
[SPEAKER_06]: you know what I mean, and they're misting
systems and things but the way you keep
[SPEAKER_06]: out of trouble is it's like early in the
morning like like late morning tops you
[SPEAKER_06]: can miss but as soon as you're at noon or
Afterwards and we're at that peak and the
[SPEAKER_06]: Sun is that it's crucial this point down
and it said and you're just especially
[SPEAKER_06]: you're just you're hurting yourself I
think I think you should I mean I'd rather
[SPEAKER_06]: water the ground which is still cause for
concern after that noon because of the
[SPEAKER_06]: moisture and stuff but I'd rather do that
than spray the plants themselves just
[SPEAKER_06]: because it's just such a drastic
fluctuation and that's kind of what
[SPEAKER_06]: happens but when it's over 110 degrees
anyway powdery mildew really can't live in
[SPEAKER_06]: those high temperatures anyway,
so it's kind of like You know,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's not the worst thing in the world
because at high high temperatures they
[SPEAKER_06]: tell you heat heat will kill the mildew
spore, you know above I think it's above
[SPEAKER_06]: 95 degrees or something will actually
start killing the mildew spores for a
[SPEAKER_06]: certain period of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're over 110 and you're missed in
mildew is not your problem but if it the
[SPEAKER_06]: next day and the day after aren't 110 and
it's in those ranges for mildew to take
[SPEAKER_06]: hold you've created, you know problem in
my opinion, you know that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you see any problems with any of the
crops or any of the people you've been
[SPEAKER_04]: working with that hit 115 or above?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's so the guys that had them in pots
like you there was there was an old an old
[SPEAKER_06]: friend of mine I call him I call him the
cool guy, but He he has bigger pots than
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they were like 30 gallon or
something They were uncovered and they
[SPEAKER_06]: were the fabric pots and during that heat
wave that the plants that were in there
[SPEAKER_06]: really drooped and suffered and all of the
Pistols started to turn and really had a
[SPEAKER_06]: bad effect on the plants themselves to the
point where they never came back out of it
[SPEAKER_06]: to where he had to harvest them early.
[SPEAKER_06]: The ones in the ground are going to be a
lot more resilient to the temperatures,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially if you have the mulch down.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't have the mulch down,
then you're in trouble.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to have a hard time in those
temperatures, but they can tolerate they
[SPEAKER_06]: don't like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just don't do much in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they if you can just get them to not
do anything as opposed to like get sick,
[SPEAKER_06]: then that's better than then you know what
I mean going downhill, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: so you just on those hot days you got to
make sure that they're well hydrated in
[SPEAKER_06]: the soil early or later that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom's yard is an example of like this
area, which is always in the shade and has
[SPEAKER_02]: the same irrigation is like your feet sink
into the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then over here, always hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like always hot and dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have like some spots mature.
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of runs down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it stays soft here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's totally hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just moved in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just trying to kill the
sprinklers on that side for deal with
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to kill the sprinklers and I have
to figure out which section does these and
[SPEAKER_04]: kill those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and but yeah, this is as hard as a
rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a little calcium.
[SPEAKER_06]: So get some get some of that calcium.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give us some calcium and give it some
microbes, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that stuff will come back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Calcium will loosen up the soil structure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will give a little bit of something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Calcium.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can try doing something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you know, feed it to raw milk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys eat eggs?
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to say look up Chris Trump,
man, learn how to make the WCA stuff that
[SPEAKER_06]: works good.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: So good job.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so let's chop up more of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much more satisfying than if we had to
cut all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a hand on my hip, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show me the shears we would have used.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are yours?
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine are mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would have been chopping with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time is like, yeah, you chop something in
here, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I got.
[SPEAKER_02]: That works.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't get very wide.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would have been problematic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, as soon as I got this, man,
I was having all kinds of problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: My shoulders and my wrist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't lift things out of the fridge
or pick up my kids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Doctors wanted to give me surgery.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, putting a layer of straw on
top of raised beds is something kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone does.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you ever just like I have so many.
[SPEAKER_06]: You use it in the garden, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I was going to say, I have so many
leaves that like, can you just put like
[SPEAKER_01]: what's wrong with a layer of leaves?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that equal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I feel like everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do people buy straw?
[SPEAKER_06]: People throw away what they should be
using on their land.
[SPEAKER_06]: So at my house, nothing leaves my land
like in the green bin.
[SPEAKER_06]: My green bin is always empty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I never put it on the street for
collection for anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: I take like all the leaves that come off
of the plants or the trees or the branches
[SPEAKER_06]: that I cut or the grass that's mowed or
any debris from the from the land.
[SPEAKER_06]: All either gets put on the ground is
mulch.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if it's nice leaves,
I always put out leaves at the end of the
[SPEAKER_06]: year.
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as everything drops, I'll rake up
a bunch of leaves and dump them in my
[SPEAKER_06]: orchard.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is magic, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's leaf.
[SPEAKER_06]: All that good leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: How come so many people with raised beds
don't just use the leaves around their
[SPEAKER_02]: yard?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because most people are afraid of the
diseases that come with the plants that
[SPEAKER_06]: they're using.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like if they got a bunch of leaves that
fell, they know it's cleaner, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they're not what they're worried
about.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the idea that I have in my mind is,
yeah, obviously you don't want to put a
[SPEAKER_06]: bunch of disease like directly on your
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But nature, nature is not standing right
over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like nature is not really picking and
choosing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in most cases, the good will always
outweigh the bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you got a good system, what I do
with my leaves is they're dry and then I
[SPEAKER_02]: let them totally dry out until I can snap
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then that's the perfect mulch in the
world, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't want to use eucalyptus
leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want to use straight pine
needles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mulberry?
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent food source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or magnolia.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, magnolia.
[SPEAKER_06]: Magnolia is not the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll work too.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're really dry, they're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're really wet, then you're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then even if they're crushed a little bit,
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: This morning was, Pedro this morning was
saying he's been collecting pine needles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, that's what I said,
because I had a pine forest growing up and
[SPEAKER_02]: like nothing else grew under the pine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So pines emit tannins through their
leaves, through their roots, through their
[SPEAKER_06]: needles, through everything that they
create.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there are these oils that kind of
discourage the growth of other plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I get you to get that right there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you plant underneath of a
eucalyptus or a pine tree or any of those
[SPEAKER_06]: things, it's a constant oil forest from
those trees that are segregating
[SPEAKER_06]: themselves off.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why you say you go to a pine
forest.
[SPEAKER_06]: You only see pine trees for the most part.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like other things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus they're really, really acidic.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like adding too many of them can throw
things out of balance.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's really the oils and the tannins
in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how about in a small quantity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Small quantity?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm OK with a small quantity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Less than, yeah, five percent or less.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like if you're starting to use that as
like your source all the time or like it's
[SPEAKER_06]: your main source, then hell no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't ever use pine needles like that or
eucalyptus leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: But once they are really dry and overly
dead and been around for a season or two
[SPEAKER_06]: sitting there, if you're going to store
it, then things lose their tannins and you
[SPEAKER_06]: can start using it to turn into carbon
that's usable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's where they're talking
about introducing it, probably.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're going to take it through a
process or something and then like do it
[SPEAKER_06]: in some way, then that's OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: But collecting it and using it as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I wouldn't do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's no good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But those are the two big ones that I
wouldn't use is eucalyptus leaves and pine
[SPEAKER_06]: needles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fact checking.
[SPEAKER_06]: But other than that, I mean, most things
are pretty, pretty good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And especially if it's good and dead and
it's been dead a long time, you're better
[SPEAKER_06]: off if you're going to do chop and drop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I do a lot of chop and drop where
you're dropping green stuff like this on
[SPEAKER_06]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to me about what you're seeing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is looking healthy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So some people say like the hollow stems
is like boron or other things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of my hollow stems are some of my
best plants, like in a lot of cases where
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll go through and I'll be like,
oh, you're the hollow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes they have like the most
terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, this isn't hollow down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just hollow on the.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's going to be a little hollow
where the sap is and it'll lose it,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, lose it over time, you know,
and sometimes they really harden up.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see all that sap that's kind of in
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like as I break this, everything in
there kind of collapses, too, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's it's it's not quite as hollow as
it kind of appears, but it is hollow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is nutrition in some way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, towards the end of the flower
cycle, it's using a lot of the minerals
[SPEAKER_06]: and the micro-minerals.
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that what's passing through there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's got it's sending a lot of
nutrition through the cambium around the
[SPEAKER_06]: outside layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom, I think you should get naked and roll
around in this bed before you go inside.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want me to chop this one?
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to save this one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Tom, what do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want me to do something with this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this can be chopped.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to step out of line there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so you wouldn't use one of those like
mulchers that you could buy at Home Depot
[SPEAKER_06]: and just like I would, but I'd mulch it
into a corner and let it sit for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Heck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, why actually?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why wouldn't you bury it in here like
you're doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: So in small scale, like if you're going to
chop and drop, like I wouldn't do a whole
[SPEAKER_06]: slew of just tons of just green stuff on
the ground, sometimes with like trees
[SPEAKER_06]: anyway, like the bark and those things
like the the raw wood.
[SPEAKER_06]: And things that aren't broken down.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't too much.
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't too much.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can till this in.
[SPEAKER_06]: This will turn into a comb and it's softer
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not necessarily like a tree would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we had like three times the amount
of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would try to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'd spread it out a little bit just
because sometimes the green stuff takes
[SPEAKER_06]: energy to break down.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're demanding resources,
sometimes it robs from other things,
[SPEAKER_06]: especially with barks and different things
that are too fresh.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll steal nitrogen and other nutrients
and things and to its process.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just letting it do its thing,
it'll be better off, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: satisfaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like when you're done doing a play
and you strike the set, there's a certain
[SPEAKER_04]: satisfaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear, like every every noise that like
like you'd be surprised.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody knows RoboCop.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a matter of fact, you could maybe sell
some of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, people should be purchasing
those.
[SPEAKER_06]: They should.
[SPEAKER_06]: They absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I go to all these nurseries.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are like, what the hell is that?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, man, it took me a while to
realize, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: These ones are almost two thousand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you want like an extra battery and like
all the funny stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're no joke.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get a smaller version for like
five hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom, now we're getting, you know,
somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not quite the same, but it is the
same.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's much better than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what's the brand?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this like Felco?
[SPEAKER_06]: Felco is the best man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_06]: Felco is the best.
[SPEAKER_06]: Swiss made.
[SPEAKER_06]: This thing right here is frigging
guaranteed for life.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason why it's also the best is
the reason why is like you can buy all
[SPEAKER_06]: these parts at a nursery, like every
blade, every screw, every piece of this
[SPEAKER_06]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Dewalt.
[SPEAKER_06]: They stock all the parts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone stock all the parts.
[SPEAKER_06]: So all you need to do is buy this once and
you can change the blade for 12 bucks and
[SPEAKER_06]: it's good for forever again.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Over and over again.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: They work way better than anything else.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've used everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the these are the best ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want any of these sweet compromise
buds for your compost at home?
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of my trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not lacking is stuff to put into my
compost.
[SPEAKER_06]: All my trim, everything that I take down,
all the stocks, all the leaves,
[SPEAKER_06]: all the crappy buds, all the trim that I
would make hash out of all that goes back
[SPEAKER_06]: into the orchard onto the floor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just goes to the forest floor because it's
all it's all the bio accumulated stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: from my orchard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, it's full of nutrition and that
just goes out to the mulch pile every
[SPEAKER_06]: year.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got a big trash bag full of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This purple started coming out at a
certain point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that was.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's that's what that plant was
going to do is going to give a little
[SPEAKER_06]: purple into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you were going to get a little bit of
color.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as the fall approached, you were going
to get a little.
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets worse and worse.
[SPEAKER_06]: The veining started happening,
which was cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would have been really pretty.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it still kind of is, but it really
would have been a nice, pretty thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's chop that one too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I could show you some frigging
beauties just sitting underneath the net,
[SPEAKER_06]: dude, just happy as can be, just some
beauties, you know, like it's like and
[SPEAKER_06]: beauty literally, literally looking at
Mars and like giving him the finger,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like no joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you get that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to bring the whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like making room like I just I don't want
to spray anything, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we started using those nets.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people don't like the nets.
[SPEAKER_06]: They think, you know, some people can't
put them up.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have the space too hard to go
in.
[SPEAKER_07]: No way, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's what Tom asks his wife
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is pretty much history as well,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, let's let's just start fresh.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's not even anything on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'll leave you with a bag or two of
that stuff over there so you won't you
[SPEAKER_06]: won't be lost 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Merry Christmas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Merry fucking Christmas.
[SPEAKER_06]: This will this like this taught you so
much.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, like seriously,
you're you're you've learned shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't even know you learn.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been you'll remember next year.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd be like, fuck man, this is how it's
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brother taught us that there's a cool tool
that we must have.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm all into forensics of any kind.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this has been forensically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you investigation discovery?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on it's on like 85 percent of the
time, courtesy of Laura.
[SPEAKER_04]: She loves them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think women get totally into like
it's like murder mystery after murder
[SPEAKER_02]: mystery after murder.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if she's like like plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's that one?
[SPEAKER_06]: Ninety seven inside one on four on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not I mean, I mean, that's like
that's livable temperatures.
[SPEAKER_06]: But being in such a small space,
plants are going to have a hard time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in the I mean, for the rest of the
year will be fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so yeah, perfect for the weather
warmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So so there's a real work both ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: But so there's a real ideal purpose for
these small cloth pots, like because they
[SPEAKER_04]: do tend to get hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it seems like they're not like
you don't want to keep your plant in there
[SPEAKER_04]: for very long because it's just too hot
and in the winter time, I think is a good
[SPEAKER_06]: time to use those personally because they
keep warmer than a plastic outside shell
[SPEAKER_06]: would write that plastic pot on the
outside is going to get cold no matter
[SPEAKER_06]: where you put it, no matter what.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could this be a starter environment?
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a great winter pot, in my opinion,
is like a starter winter pot.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can grow small plants in there easily
in the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I have squash and strawberries
growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you can.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not if they're good and people
pull lots.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you've been using it, my dad always
says best tool in the toolbox is the one
[SPEAKER_06]: that works for you, that you know how to
use.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some people, man, those are superstar
pots for that's fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you use?
[SPEAKER_06]: But personally, I use regular old pots
like regular old black plastic pots.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the two things that I use.
[SPEAKER_06]: Period.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what nurseries have been using for,
you know, hundreds, hundreds plus years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, it's just that it's nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you transplant appropriately,
then the root tips and all that stuff,
[SPEAKER_06]: all that stuff doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're just growing a healthy plant,
you're I mean, the outside of my pots are
[SPEAKER_06]: root tips and hairs and beautiful shit
when I pull them out of there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not it's not the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also the thing that I didn't like
about the fabric pots the most out of
[SPEAKER_06]: everything was transplanting them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you can't get them out of there
without kind of like ripping or doing
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff unless it's a Velcro one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are actually that's just those
are cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Velcro ones were cooler because I
was stoked on the Velcro versions because
[SPEAKER_06]: you can pop that out of there a lot
easier.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like I said, if it works for you,
it works for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that said, you can get a more amenable
environment in these larger, larger beds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's got good breathability.
[SPEAKER_06]: The larger situation, I think,
are way more better idea on that aspect
[SPEAKER_06]: because wood rots fabric you can kind of
get away with.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's lighter to set up and move.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm ready for the four by eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're not in the ground,
I believe I believe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, because then you're at four.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that you need the more space,
especially if you're growing with soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need a bigger battery.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bigger battery means you need a bigger
space to pull from.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to get hot and cook you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a big difference between having a
two by four and a four by four.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah, there is.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a bigger universe for the life.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just their squish.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just, yeah, you just don't have
enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you're living in mom's basement.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you have a, you have an end,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is mom's basement.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is better.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got your own place, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You got a little one bedroom, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're a little bit, you know what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, shoot though, if you don't have to
pay rent in mom's basement, you might be
[SPEAKER_06]: able to get away.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are benefits both ways,
but bigger is always better in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what the gray one is anyway.
116.
[SPEAKER_06]: Soil's moist in this.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's moist, but it's, that's, that's at 96
and wet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the soil is wet.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at 96.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the, even though that there's water in
here, the plant can't uptake it properly
[SPEAKER_06]: because of the temperatures.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of in hold mode to not,
you know, so that's in, it's too hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so, and you can also see the plant
itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: The leaves are taco like taco shells,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And when they taco up like that,
tomatoes are kind of, they do that anyway
[SPEAKER_06]: in the sun.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one of the defense mechanisms,
but all plants that kind of taco up like
[SPEAKER_06]: taco shells like that are trying to make
themselves smaller, minimize their
[SPEAKER_06]: exposure to the sun and try to drink any
dew that settles on the leaves,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, so they can funnel it to the,
to the roots.
[SPEAKER_06]: It means they're too hot or they need more
water.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are two, those are the two signs
classically.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you shoot it with a thermometer
and it's too hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see it's telling you that,
you know, just by the way that the leaves
[SPEAKER_06]: are cupping in that regard.
[SPEAKER_06]: So things that that tells you,
you know, but you don't even need one of
[SPEAKER_06]: these.
[SPEAKER_06]: All you need to do is go like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it's as hot as you are hot,
and then you need to figure out a way to
[SPEAKER_06]: just, just slow it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the winter, you want this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It actually kind of feels a little cooler.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's like, cause I have shade over
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in, and like I said, it works,
it works both ways to benefit and to
[SPEAKER_06]: detriment.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: It just depends.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a, it's a, you deploy it in the right
situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a star for you, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: But every, you set up one of these,
man, you'll get every Nug.
[SPEAKER_06]: Guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be ugly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, but Hey, you get every
Nug.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you set up a nice one like this,
you know, like I do, you can walk in there
[SPEAKER_06]: and just hang out with them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then like a night and stuff,
like no bugs are biting you and shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause you're in your freaking little,
little mosquito hut.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can, you can work in there and it's
safe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's clean and it's just, it's just
cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not, I mean, it's not super
expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any joke can do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: To be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, it's nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's makeshift, but it's totally
effective.
[SPEAKER_06]: It totally works.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, it's something like I bought
weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have real greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I oversee and cool commercial
operations.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we've, I've, I've had a hundred
lighters and then at home, I deploy
[SPEAKER_06]: freaking PGC five and mosquito netting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's good because it's got cover,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So this grass serves as your mulch.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is your cover zone.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a color.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not gonna, it's going to be a buffer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's at 84 degrees.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's below that mark.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's on the surface of the grass.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go under the grass, which we can't,
it'll be much cooler than that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The leaves aren't tackling, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not really tackling.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The flowers will.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's normal.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's normal.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll go through a blown period.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll shrivel up and set its seed and then
the nut and then you go where it should
[SPEAKER_06]: be.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where it should be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't, I don't love when, when air can
kind of swoop underneath of a root like
[SPEAKER_06]: this, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like having them at the surface is where
you want it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when air and stuff can kind of start
ripping through there and other places,
[SPEAKER_06]: I would always suggest add a little bit of
something just to cover that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what?
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bark chip, couple of leaves,
straw.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just don't pile it up on like crazy,
but just, just cover it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So air doesn't swoop underneath that
crown.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will live like this just fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'll see that nature just fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, it just eliminates a beacon for me
personally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll keep them extra healthy and you won't
have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we call it a wrap on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, look, look, look, look what is not
there anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sad, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: But we get to restart.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you get a start.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the fun part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that's all the dreams start again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a, there's a look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That soil is going to be humming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_06]: Throw some compost in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Turn that up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I get some compost from you?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's some like, you know,
like I said, like some people will freak
[SPEAKER_06]: out and be like, Oh, there's butritus in
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's, you know, it, you know,
but we haven't seen, I don't really worry
[SPEAKER_06]: about that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: You practice a good system.
[SPEAKER_06]: You put that down on the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you got healthy stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that, you know, I don't ever have
butritus at my house and I do that every
[SPEAKER_06]: year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Granted.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine's in a food forest and it's like in
the ground, but it's everywhere already as
[SPEAKER_06]: it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's our job to have good cell walls
and good practices to keep it from being
[SPEAKER_06]: able to penetrate, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So honestly, I don't think that you have
any issues there, but I'm sure there's
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody that'll be like, yo, Hey,
Oh, there'll definitely be some comment.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done, I've done this a million times.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is full, this is full on like proven,
you know, I mean over years of time and I,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: So do what you do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do what works for you, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I gotta say.
[SPEAKER_04]: I came out one night and shine the light
on the buds and it was like Christmas.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, it was, it was all crystals
and trichomes all across the bud and the
[SPEAKER_04]: leaves and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, I never thought I'd be able
to create this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen it many times in other people's
grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've visited so many grows, but I'd never.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's finally, I know, man,
I remember that feeling, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember I'm like, dude, I did this.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is better than all that stuff on the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, yeah, it's no, it's you can,
you can, you just gotta get to the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's these little things.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll just make you get to the,
to the very end.
[SPEAKER_04]: I called Peter.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I need help.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I'm in Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I told you what to do or what to
look for.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I looked for them and found them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here and check this out right here and
look at this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hang on a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me find you a good little bacon grease
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a couple of these that are coming on
right now here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me pull up one of these for you here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what else do you grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you grow other?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a, there's a, there's another
phenotype of dog leaves that isn't ready
[SPEAKER_06]: yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: That one's a nasty gas one right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you grow like peppers and.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grow everything, brother.
Everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I have, here's a couple,
here's a couple of those.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's a couple of tens right
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you know, there's a little part of my
little, you know, little thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you send that to him?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a couple of those little things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you can see part of those
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, there's a couple of those where
they just sitting up and you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: it just, they're just doing what they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's mosquito netting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's big.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like, that's easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's not, like you said,
man, there's a lot of ways of skinning a
[SPEAKER_06]: cat.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm a, I'm a fool.
I'm a fool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a farmer, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to put a door in one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you can't just did an overflap and you
just, you just flap it over and then you
[SPEAKER_06]: set a rock on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it'll pull it tight and you can just
open it right up, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anytime you want, or you can, I mean,
you can, you get creative, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can make them tall and skinny.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can make them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's, there's, it has to happen
because we get a lot of moths.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're, you're, the here is, it's
unbeatable.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're either going to spray your ass off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you're going to deploy preventative
measures.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is the type of solution that I
love.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hands on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't compensate for monitoring
everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, nothing does nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing's better than the farmer shadow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, you have to be,
you have to be present the love factor,
[SPEAKER_06]: the farmer presence.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's green.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the difference between,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who you haven't met.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why she hasn't come out.
[SPEAKER_04]: She has a good green thumb too,
but, but, um, she's accusing me of having
[SPEAKER_04]: one now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: You will now you got it, you know,
you got a chest full of stuff,
[SPEAKER_06]: man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to be in good shape.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said, you can deploy that for
everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I throw all kinds of crap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I set up these things for random
stuff all the time, like for all kinds of
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, oh shit, I'm gonna have to set up a
fucking hoop.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just set up a hoop and like that solves
the problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't have to worry about it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got too much to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got to say, I want to set up a small
worm bin too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's easy, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it was that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's super easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I know it's easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I don't think I need a tremendous
amount of compost so I can probably,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, you just use, you know,
you buy a good bag of compost.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do some compost extract.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was making teas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can make, I've been making, I got,
so I don't know if you've ever heard of
[SPEAKER_04]: organic organic's alive, but it was their
products and regimen that resulted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was following their regimen.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were looking good.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know those guys, they, they got their
stuff into Anderson's nursery down by me
[SPEAKER_06]: when they were just getting started.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like one of those new guys and he
was in there doing the rep and I was the,
[SPEAKER_06]: I was the manager at the time at the
nursery and they ended up bringing them in
[SPEAKER_07]: shortly thereafter.
[SPEAKER_04]: The big foot one day all excited and we
put that in.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the bomb.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm set them up for success.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was set up for a success.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: I make, I, you know, I do, uh,
I'm really raw.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, man, I do very little
feeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like to do too much and I just,
you know, you set them in motion and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the key.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the way, water those things because
their cups are going to get dry and we
[SPEAKER_02]: should try.
[SPEAKER_02]: So part of the reason why I was psyched to
kill everything was so we can start
[SPEAKER_02]: transplanting those things out of the solo
cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The chopper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, would there's some, but again,
we're still, we're putting them into the
[SPEAKER_04]: bags, but those are okay for winter time
going into fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're better off.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've passed the peak Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, heat season also known as the summer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys see those trees out there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: The big ones out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see how they were up on a mound.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking things right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time you can say it every time I can
say it without even looking.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: No matter what.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like always the case.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in nature, in the forest, that's the
tree that lives to be 200 or 300 or 3000
[SPEAKER_06]: or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's the one that was planted
amongst the others that was just in the
[SPEAKER_06]: right little hill.
[SPEAKER_06]: The right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a, um, liquid amber tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the one out front, the huge one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Liquid amber loses its leaves in the fog.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really colorful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, it's like our fall maple tree is our
lookalike, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a really invasive plant breaks up
everything and gets into the sewers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an awesome tree though, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a, it does so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great tree for like the middle of
the park and everything, but it's a crazy
[SPEAKER_06]: tree.
[SPEAKER_06]: They planted a bunch of these back in the
day, especially in LA and in San Diego for
[SPEAKER_06]: the color and they planted them on the
neighborhood roads.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you drive down the road and some
of these old ones, you see all these,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, cool, colorful things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And stuff, but yeah, man, they're just so,
their roots are insane.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that thing's gotta be, you know,
I mean, it's gotta be, I don't know when
[SPEAKER_06]: this house was built, but I'd say that
thing's a 70 year old tree.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably I'd say 60 years old,
70 years old, 60 years old, right around
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause they grow fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not really a ballpark.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many seeds are in here?
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, somewhere between seven and 15.
[SPEAKER_06]: So summer seven, summer 15, it just
depends on what I had left of certain
[SPEAKER_06]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put some into here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can, so basically all I do is I
take just like a short cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put a little bit of water in and I drop
the seeds in the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll float.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like 24 hour or 48, you know,
24 to 36 hours later, we can literally
[SPEAKER_02]: just put them right into soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's, that's the next stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those solo cups.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, those hubbles, those are like
something in those, in those jeans or
[SPEAKER_06]: making that thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like slow to grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you germinate them, germinate,
you know, germinate those ones because
[SPEAKER_06]: three or three might, two might not go.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just, they're honored.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like, got this weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're very selective.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the land race stuff, like it's a
land race trait where they don't want to
[SPEAKER_06]: grow right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to sit dormant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then sometimes those recessive traits
kind of pop up and you know, it's just a
[SPEAKER_04]: weird bad thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause when they take, they really,
they take, and I guess those are some of
[SPEAKER_06]: the best like unique plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll find is in that, in that hubble
stuff, something a little different that
[SPEAKER_06]: nobody does.
[SPEAKER_06]: So pop a bunch and then, but those are
also the shittiest germ rated seeds that
[SPEAKER_06]: I, that I had because those are the last
ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not that many.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just giving you guys something
that's really good that I knew would be
[SPEAKER_06]: good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get something sweet out of,
but there's not even anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have any of the banks anymore
cause they're all, that's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're working on the next generation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have, yeah, I have continued for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, no, like, like, cause I have,
I have plants that are, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: seven, eight, nine, 10 years old.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I have clones that I've kept for
years, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So always in my, like in the summer,
in the summer they come out cause they're
[SPEAKER_06]: old.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by coming out and going into the
ground, they can tap into the earth,
[SPEAKER_06]: fully regenerate and rejuvenate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like a lot of the old heads have
always said, well, if we take them
[SPEAKER_06]: outside, you can rejuvenate them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been just, I fully am a believer
in that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they rejuvenate them back to fricking
brand new.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll get these big, thick, healthy
branches and growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can take the clones off of
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then those would be your new moms for
the next season.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are your new moms that go inside.
[SPEAKER_06]: The what?
Seeds?
What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, so those are just the plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are just the plants for the mom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like those ones will go inside and then
over the winter time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically keeping carbon copies of that
mom for generation.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's always something alive because you
can't lose those because those are making,
[SPEAKER_06]: those are, those are, those are my
flagships.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then in the winter time when it's
cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause even a seed from that will express
itself slightly differently.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nothing that's just like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like me or you, if you have 50
kids, none of them are going to be you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tom, there's never going to be another Tom
Hines.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll be close, but none of them will be
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the, we'll never, you can,
you can get close, but you never get you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so you got that, you got the clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then in the winter times, when I do a
lot of like, like my seed tests and my
[SPEAKER_06]: quick looks, because it's all quick and
small and you can do things in like one
[SPEAKER_06]: gallon pots and two gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can kind of give them to all my
other friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can kind of go through a bunch of
stuff indoors and pick out the good guys
[SPEAKER_06]: that we think are going to be good guys to
put outside for the full season.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we run them full term.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when they're really awesome,
either those will get seeds or those will
[SPEAKER_06]: be whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's how they kind of get,
get vetted.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's always something going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I always have to look at stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I've got too many coolers of seeds
that I'll never get to no matter how much
[SPEAKER_06]: I do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: How many people I invest in like,
please do these ones for me and do these
[SPEAKER_06]: ones for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause you can't do it all.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you can't.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then until they can, till we,
you know, we, we really have cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: freedom.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way to, you know, to really do
it the way we need to.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, do you guys ever pick these?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm waiting for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's beyond right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this one, this one's, you could take
this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: One plan will be completely different
inside compared to outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: They express themselves completely
different.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, sometimes it's like,
wow, this is the greatest indoor thing in
[SPEAKER_06]: the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: You put it outside and it's like,
no, this is dog shit time.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should make sundry and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so you got, it's, you got to
have it all the way going.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to go to all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, should we wrap on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Tom clap, the Tom outro clap,
the intro and the outro clap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And definitely kill this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing is not going to do any good
besides bring pests in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically a plant that some dude was
growing at his house poorly that he was
[SPEAKER_02]: then like, let me put it in the middle of
all your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kill it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll cost you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's this time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember what this one is?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in the dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can cut this so we can use all
these things for new plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay. Okay.
