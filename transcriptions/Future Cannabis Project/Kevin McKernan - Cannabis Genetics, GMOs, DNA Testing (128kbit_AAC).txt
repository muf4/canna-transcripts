[SPEAKER_01]: This is Kevin McKernan, and I'm obsessed
with genomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lately, it's been cannabis genomics,
at least since probably nine years now,
[SPEAKER_01]: since 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Jason Wilson with the Curious
About Cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for tuning in once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm really, really stoked to have
on a guest I've been casually following
[SPEAKER_00]: for years, and I've been wanting to
connect with for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with Kevin McKernan with Medicinal
Genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much, Kevin, for being willing
to come on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've really enjoyed all the guests you've
had so far, so it's been a great podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that, and I look forward to
having you right in there with everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: else that I've been speaking with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about a topic
that I haven't touched in any other
[SPEAKER_00]: interview, primarily because it gets into
an area where there aren't a ton of people
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to talk about cannabis
genetics and genomics and microbiology
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin, for those listeners that maybe are
not familiar with you and your work,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you briefly describe some of your
academic and professional background
[SPEAKER_00]: leading up into your founding of Medicinal
Genomics and the work that you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started off my genomics career at the
Whited Institute back at MIT.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a center in Cambridge that was
sequencing the human genome and was part
[SPEAKER_01]: of an international effort to sequence the
human genome along with the Sanger Center
[SPEAKER_01]: and a few folks in Japan and Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was from 1996 to 2000, and I was
managing their research and development
[SPEAKER_01]: team there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We built a lot of the robotics that
automated the DNA purification and got the
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencing running there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2000, when that project was coming to a
close, I decided to spin out a few of the
[SPEAKER_01]: patents that we had acquired at the time
there into a company called Agincourt.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a private entity that was a DNA
sequencing provider for a lot of people in
[SPEAKER_01]: the pharmaceutical and healthcare space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also sold DNA purification tools
that help people extract DNA out of cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fast forward to 2011, seven years in that
timeframe, the company also built a DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencer known as a solid sequencer that
eventually went to market under applied
[SPEAKER_01]: biosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those in the sequencing field,
they probably know of maybe two companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that have had fairly large market shares
throughout the history of DNA sequencing,
[SPEAKER_01]: and ABI was the first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had all these Sanger sequencers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still in the market and they still
do their thing under the thermo name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's now Illumina, who's a very
large contender and arguably a larger
[SPEAKER_01]: entity now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were competing with Illumina with the
solid sequencer for a period of about five
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then around 2011, I decided to just do
something different and get out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and go into the plant genetics
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: We began sequencing cannabis genomes back
in 2011, flew over to Amsterdam and
[SPEAKER_01]: extracted a bunch of samples over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met Don and Aaron from DNA genetics and
Dave Watson and a bunch of other Robert
[SPEAKER_01]: Clark, a bunch of other folks showed me
around over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really didn't know what to do with it
at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just knew that genomics helped so many
other markets that was bound to help this
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had no idea what to do with the
information and how to turn it into a
[SPEAKER_01]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We explored a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say it was a very slow start with
medicinal genomics because we were a
[SPEAKER_01]: company that was embedded inside of a
clinical diagnostic company known as
[SPEAKER_01]: Cortigen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the company's efforts were
sequencing kids with epilepsy and
[SPEAKER_01]: mitochondrial disease and arguably a lot
of diseases that center around the ECS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although the people in the clinical
sequencing space probably don't know what
[SPEAKER_01]: the ECS is yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you've probably heard from many of the
guests you've had before, it's not really
[SPEAKER_01]: taught in medical school.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was an interesting business,
but a very challenging one because as
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance companies moved into the space
after the AMA, they didn't like this idea
[SPEAKER_01]: of sequencing for idiosyncratic diseases,
diseases we don't really understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to reimburse for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started raising people's deductibles
and making that type of sequencing very
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult for you to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when we decided to shift the
company fully into sequencing cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw, ironically, less headwinds,
regular headwinds in the cannabis space
[SPEAKER_01]: than in the clinical sequencing space.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that gives you any sense of the
background, I've wandered from research
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencing to clinical sequencing all the
way into what people might call
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always has DNA in the thread.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it about working with genetics and
studying DNA that really draws you in that
[SPEAKER_00]: you find really interesting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, personally, I like the fact that it
reveals how different everybody really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have this societal tendency to want to
group people into either races or sexes or
[SPEAKER_01]: these other large categories and treat the
entire population as one.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're learning from the human genome
projects, that is incredibly stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is very, very different and
unique and personalized medicine is
[SPEAKER_01]: clearly the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just taking time to fight the system,
to make the system aware of the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to have an algorithm to
apply to a population.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need to have physicians
actually speak to patients and ascertain
[SPEAKER_01]: that individual's needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has always been appealing to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I generally don't like one size fits all
principles.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just grotesque.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a tremendous amount of potential
in sequencing people's genomes and
[SPEAKER_01]: improving healthcare.
[SPEAKER_01]: That same story really resonates in
cannabis because you get involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis genomes and you realize they're
even more different than people are.
[SPEAKER_01]: This concept of a sativa or a hybrid or an
indica is garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad to hear you say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to change that, particularly if
you want the medical system to start to
[SPEAKER_01]: speak this language.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to prescribe green crack
to somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to want to know terpene
profiles, maybe even a genotype because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of dark pharmacology,
as you heard spoken about before.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chemotypes are great, but they only
measure maybe a dozen compounds and we
[SPEAKER_01]: know there's thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: The genomics is another cheap way of
getting at that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the other thing that's really
exciting about the genomics field is there
[SPEAKER_01]: probably isn't a field out there that's
moving at a faster pace.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you start looking at the cost of
clients and DNA sequencing, we've never
[SPEAKER_01]: seen anything like this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in the chip market where you hear
about Moore's law, Moore's law is slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually something that gets laughed
at in the sequencing space because we're
[SPEAKER_01]: always held back by the fact that the
chips aren't fast enough and the
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencers are moving at a faster pace
than the semiconductor improvements are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those fields that forces you
to learn about DNA storage and data
[SPEAKER_01]: storage information, whether that be in
DNA or not in DNA storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to learn about hard drives.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to learn about internet
bandwidth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to learn about chemistry required
to sequence these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get bored in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several things you've touched on
that spark passions inside of me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, like I mentioned before we started
the interview, part of my background is in
[SPEAKER_00]: IT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in chemistry labs that I've worked
in, a lot of times I end up becoming the
[SPEAKER_00]: technologist because I'm very interested
in the equipment as well and the idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing about genetics that interests
me, but I'm so deficient in my formal
[SPEAKER_00]: training with genetics, but just the idea
of how information is stored, transmitted
[SPEAKER_00]: in these ways that are not necessarily
intuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also what you just touched on is
something that several clinicians that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've interviewed have talked about is this
move towards what's sometimes called N of
[SPEAKER_00]: one medicine or individualized medicine,
trying to figure out how to use that
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic data to understand what a patient
is bringing to the table before going in
[SPEAKER_00]: to prescribe certain treatments and
everything so that you can narrow down
[SPEAKER_00]: with much more confidence what might be
more likely to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We learned this in the epilepsy field that
sequencing and understanding the patient's
[SPEAKER_01]: genome can save lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certain mutations in epilepsy
that just require vitamin supplementation
[SPEAKER_01]: and the seizures go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can often get in the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might put them in CBD and not notice
that for six months and then they end up
[SPEAKER_01]: honeymooning out of it and it really turns
out they just actually needed vitamin B6
[SPEAKER_01]: or B12 or folic acid or they need to be on
a ketogenic diet because they have glucose
[SPEAKER_01]: transported mutations.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's at least 24 different forms of
genetic epilepsy that are actionable based
[SPEAKER_01]: on the genome itself and they may not
always lead you into benzos or
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might lead you in the path that
doesn't even involve these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think it's very, very valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge is cannabinoids right now
sit in this really weird legal conundrum
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's difficult for doctors to
prescribe them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's even more difficult for you to have a
genetic test that actually tries to look
[SPEAKER_01]: at the variants and make informed
decisions in which cannabinoids to
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially use or have to use them at all
because there's a lot of FDA scrutiny on
[SPEAKER_01]: direct to consumer genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There shouldn't be, but there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't like having patients enabled to
make intelligent decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want that all to be channeled through
the FDA appointed medical school doctors
[SPEAKER_01]: and that doesn't scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important that physicians obviously
are very well trained and know what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing, but the better thing is to
make sure all the patients begin to pay
[SPEAKER_01]: very close attention to their health
because there is no one who is more vested
[SPEAKER_01]: in the outcome of their health and the
individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arming them with information in my mind is
always a good thing, but they don't see it
[SPEAKER_01]: that way yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have been cracking down a lot of
companies that do direct to consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics if they ever imply that they're
going to be used for medical decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: 23andMe was one case of this where they
got hammered by the FDA and they sent a
[SPEAKER_01]: signal through the field that if you do
any of this without going through the FDA,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to come down on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, for a while, we're looking at panels
that would genotype patients and try to
[SPEAKER_01]: discern whether they had an MTHR mutation
and they should go one direction or
[SPEAKER_01]: whether they had variants that might
predispose them to opiate addiction
[SPEAKER_01]: because there are some known that increase
your likelihood of opiate addiction and
[SPEAKER_01]: that might coach you in the direction of
cannabinoids, but I think the sequencing
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to get a lot cheaper for that to
happen because right now it's probably a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple hundred dollars might be better
spent going through dispensary and just
[SPEAKER_01]: experimenting with different CBD and THC
ratios until you find something that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually works because the science we have
around the genotypes is still,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say it's fuzzy, but it's early.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very early correlating these
genotypes to outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's exactly where my mind was
going next.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that one of the limitations
currently with some of the genomic
[SPEAKER_00]: research on humans is just trying to
understand how to interpret the data
[SPEAKER_00]: that's there and how to correlate it to
very specific things and something that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think we'll get into in a little bit when
we talk about cannabis is that genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: can be very tricky and that you can think
you have the full picture of what genes
[SPEAKER_00]: and what correlating enzymes and things
are responsible for trickling out into
[SPEAKER_00]: certain effects and then you realize the
picture is more complicated than you
[SPEAKER_00]: initially thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more involved, more genes or even
novel mechanisms that you weren't even
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an onion.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you dig into the genetics, you realize
there's many more layers to the data from
[SPEAKER_01]: the transcriptomics, the proteomics,
all the methylation that's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can in fact be a rabbit hole in that
regard, but on the bright side,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a plant that's largely not been
studied yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look back over the last 20 years,
where they have applied genetics to
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, the productivity gains are just
massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The agricultural revolution that's
happened is clear as day now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since they sequenced the rice genome and
the wheat genome, you can see the number
[SPEAKER_01]: of traits that they're starting to
discover and how they can use that to
[SPEAKER_01]: breed for more efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see those papers, you start to
recognize that the carrying capacity of
[SPEAKER_01]: the planet isn't as limited as we might
think, that we are going to get more and
[SPEAKER_01]: more effective at biology and how we as
humans fit into that biology in a way that
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't as wasteful as it is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that comes to mind is in the
classic story and movie, Jurassic Park,
[SPEAKER_00]: the idea that life finds a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Studying these things helps you understand
how life is so adaptive and able to reveal
[SPEAKER_00]: different traits that you never would have
imagined might have been possible in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to continue persisting throughout time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting to see humans role in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I think about a lot,
sometimes people have a tendency to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about humans as if they're outside of
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the sense of this work, I don't think
of it that way at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are part of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are part of how life is unfolding and
interacting with itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this funny way, people studying
genomics, doing this work, unlocking these
[SPEAKER_00]: tools and understanding how to be more
conscious in how we influence life and
[SPEAKER_00]: that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting because it's like Mother
Nature doing these things through itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: but using humans as a tool to this
meaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does bring up a lot of controversy in
terms of GMOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we part of nature when we start
modifying nature?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this analogous to beavers building dams
and bees building beehives and all the
[SPEAKER_01]: other tool workers out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we meant to utilize our intellect to
do this to nature?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a deep topic that can go on for
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: My general sense on it is there's multiple
different ways one can be performing GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arguably Mendel was doing GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was genetically directing a breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do that today too, but even at a
faster pace because we have basically
[SPEAKER_01]: better measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not just looking at maybe the color
of the peas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually looking at the cannabinoids
which you can't see with your eyes or
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking at the genes that encode
them so that you can track these things at
[SPEAKER_01]: a much faster pace.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're also going to be confronted
in the next few years with how does the
[SPEAKER_01]: community feel about removing genes from
the GMO?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not actually adding any foreign content,
but maybe it's important that we delete a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple rare cannabinoids so we can comply
with the USDA's hemp laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some leaky cannabinoid synthase
genes in the genome and some of them you
[SPEAKER_01]: can get rid of, some of them you can't
depending on what your goals are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen rumors and maybe even a couple
patent applications implying some people
[SPEAKER_01]: have gone about deleting these THC
synthase.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you need GMO to do that
because you can find plenty of plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say it was some other gene you
wanted to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's going to come our way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the other thing we're going to see
are people who are trying to be very
[SPEAKER_01]: cognizant of the fact that GMO has a
marketing problem right now that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to try to do manipulations with the
plant's own genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to maybe take the
chloroplast genome and add stuff to it
[SPEAKER_01]: because the chloroplast genome sits at
extraordinarily high copy number and you
[SPEAKER_01]: might get more expression putting certain
genes there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other people who have thought
about putting other markers on the Y
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosome as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find males from a drone flight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably going to require a foreign
gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know of a gene in cannabis offhand
that might in fact produce that marker but
[SPEAKER_01]: the obvious one is green fluorescent
protein which was pulled out of a
[SPEAKER_01]: jellyfish.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's used to mark all types of other
transgenic plants and you could pop that
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Y chromosome and have your plants
glow in a certain wavelength such that a
[SPEAKER_01]: drone flight could identify males and rip
them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those males presumably won't propagate if
you're good at removing them but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: always a risk that they'll make pollen
that could spread and then there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: property rights issue as to did you get
your pollen into my field and who's
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: With all of these modifications,
that also tends to bring the elephant into
[SPEAKER_01]: the room which is patent rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier to get patent rights on things
that are clearly man notified than things
[SPEAKER_01]: that have been naturally bred.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are breeder's rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are plant patents and there are
utility patents which we're seeing roll
[SPEAKER_01]: out right now and they can cover naturally
occurring plants but it's far easier to
[SPEAKER_01]: get something through the patent office if
you've clearly changed it from nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't necessarily agree with that moral
philosophy but that's the facts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to be faced with a lot
of these things sooner than we realize.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you actually go through the patent
office today, you will find patents in
[SPEAKER_01]: there that have cannabis in there where
they have put glyphosate resistance into
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have put human P450s into them to
modify cannabinoids so that they are more
[SPEAKER_01]: water soluble upon extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suspect they're going to be ones working
on C3 to C4 photosynthesis conversions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a host of these mods that are
already in the patent office.
[SPEAKER_01]: This doesn't mean that technology works
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patents have no obligation to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's anti-gravity devices out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually people don't file those unless
there's some preliminary data because the
[SPEAKER_01]: expense of filing isn't something you just
do on a brain fart.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually want to make sure it's worth
calling the lawyers for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a wave of all of this innovation
coming into a community that has very
[SPEAKER_01]: diverse opinions on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious where that's all going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the next 10 to 20 years, it's going
to be very interesting to see how
[SPEAKER_00]: everything evolves and how the industry
accepts certain technologies and rejects
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very, very interested, especially when
you have, like you were talking about just
[SPEAKER_00]: a second ago with THCA, you have these
market dynamics influencing some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: where you've got people that are more so
maybe now than ever feeling that pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: of needing to find genetics that are going
to ensure that their livelihood stays
[SPEAKER_00]: intact now that the farm bill has passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how it changes over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's why there's a big push now
for CBGA dominant cultivars and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, but they're still getting THC
in some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This starts to segue into some of the
research I wanted to talk about,
[SPEAKER_00]: but before we get into all of that to set
up a good foundation, can you describe a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of some of the tools and
techniques that are used to study DNA?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep in mind that some of our listeners
don't have any background with any of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's generally two different types of
DNA sequencers that are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are sequencers that are used to
resequence a genome generally at much
[SPEAKER_01]: lower cost if the reference genome is
already known.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the human genome back in 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't really finished and still isn't
finished today.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still some centromeres that
haven't been fully sequenced yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: but 99% of the genome is known.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a large effort trying to make sure
we have maps across all the telomeres and
[SPEAKER_01]: centromeres right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've managed to diverse a couple of
chromosomes from telomere to telomere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you have that reference genome,
since the human population is fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: inbred, we differ maybe by one in a
thousand letters in the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that means is you can use a much
cheaper sequencer to resequence other
[SPEAKER_01]: people's genomes and then just compare it
to the reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is usually where Illumina comes into
play.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can only sequence about 100 bases of
DNA, maybe up to 300.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some extreme cases, they can do paired
ends or 600 base pair reads where they do
[SPEAKER_01]: two, 300 base pair reads aimed at each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: That does really well in the human genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can remap and sequence people's
genomes for probably under $500 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't include all the analysis,
but just the raw cost of the sequence is
[SPEAKER_01]: getting close to that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that said, when you're resequencing
and you're mapping to a reference that is
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly representative of the entire human
population, you can figure out where all
[SPEAKER_01]: the single letter changes are really
easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bit more challenging to figure out
where entire chapters of the genome are
[SPEAKER_01]: missing with those technologies because
the read gets shorter than the size of the
[SPEAKER_01]: variant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very difficult for those reads to
actually detect the variant.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you approach 25 to 50 base pair changes
in the genome, the short read systems
[SPEAKER_01]: start to stumble and miss important
genetic variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been an effort to increase those
read lengths and most of those efforts
[SPEAKER_01]: have gone in the direction of sequencing
single molecules of DNA so that they get a
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaner signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Illumina systems right now,
in order to read the DNA, they first
[SPEAKER_01]: amplify the DNA to a couple thousand
copies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you're sequencing that
particular colony, you're actually
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencing 1,000 molecules that are all
marching in step down the DNA strand.
[SPEAKER_01]: What invariably happens as you go out and
read length, each one of those reactions
[SPEAKER_01]: is probably 99.9 percent efficient,
but over time, they start to get out of
[SPEAKER_01]: phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: The molecules get out of sync and it gets
very difficult to start reading the
[SPEAKER_01]: sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get around that synchrony problem,
the direction the technology moved was to
[SPEAKER_01]: sequence single molecules, which is much
harder to do because you need to be 1,000
[SPEAKER_01]: times more sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you're reading single molecules,
you never have to worry about the rate at
[SPEAKER_01]: which the polymerase decides to read the
molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just let the thing run and you get to
read the DNA as the thing is copying it in
[SPEAKER_01]: real time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two sequencers that are probably most
known for this are Pacific Biosciences
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencers and then an Upstart sequencer
that's probably have one floating around
[SPEAKER_01]: here somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Oxford Nanopore.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're much smaller footprints,
but they're much noisier.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things will thread DNA through a
biological protein pore.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the DNA gets threaded through that
pore, the current starts to change on you
[SPEAKER_01]: based on the sequence context that's in
the pore.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing might zip through at 500 bases a
second and as it's doing so, it's leaving
[SPEAKER_01]: a current profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tells you some information about the
sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're about 90 percent accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting better.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very quickly improving platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the interesting thing about that
platform is it's so small, it's portable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can bring it to coronavirus outbreaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can bring it to Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: You usually need a hell of a lot more
bioinformatics in the back end to clean up
[SPEAKER_01]: the signal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The read length on those are unlimited
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have had reads go up to two million
bases on those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a massive breakthrough on read
length.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere that's a little bit more of a
compromise between the two is a system
[SPEAKER_01]: that also sequences single molecules,
but the way it reads it is using a zero
[SPEAKER_01]: mode waveguide, which is basically an
array of very, very small holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a phenomenon when you're trying
to image molecules, single molecules in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular, which are very small,
is that the problem you have with anything
[SPEAKER_01]: that uses light or fluorescence is that
fluorescence is actually fairly large
[SPEAKER_01]: wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at the wavelength of blue light,
for instance, it's 500 nanometers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're trying to measure things that
are angstrom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like shining a floodlight on top of a
speck of sand trying to watch the speck of
[SPEAKER_01]: sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have more than one speck of sand in
the floodlight, you really don't know what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they had to do is build these tools
that focus light into a smaller diameter
[SPEAKER_01]: than the actual wavelength of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's done with the technology you can
see on the front of everybody's microwave
[SPEAKER_01]: oven.
[SPEAKER_01]: A microwave oven actually has a square
mode waveguide there that prevents those
[SPEAKER_01]: much larger wavelengths from getting
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens at the surface of that,
never put your hand directly on the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface of that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't let you because there's a screen
there, but if you were to get close enough
[SPEAKER_01]: to that, there would be a zepto-liter
volume of radiation coming through there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That zepto-liter is enough to illuminate a
single polymerase molecule copying a DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: strand.
[SPEAKER_01]: PacBio does this really elegant device
where they read eight million of these
[SPEAKER_01]: holes at a single time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've managed to be able to put circular
molecules into this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the polymerase grabs onto it and
rolls and starts to copy it, it runs it
[SPEAKER_01]: around like a gerbil wheel over and over
and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You end up reading the forward strand,
then the reverse strand, then the forward
[SPEAKER_01]: strand.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you do this 30 or 40 times,
you eliminate all the noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: They now have 20,000 base pair reads that
are 99.9 percent accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is an absolute remarkable
breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've only had that in the last four
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much of the work that you see in the paper
we put out actually used a technology of
[SPEAKER_01]: theirs that was a little bit older that
was probably 50-fold less accurate,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it had 200,000 base pair reads.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use that to assemble a few of these
cannabis genomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very recently, we've gone back and
resequenced them with this newer Hi-Fi
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry that they have to improve the
references even further.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's those two main tools that I think are
being used the most in cannabis right now
[SPEAKER_01]: is that we don't have good references.
[SPEAKER_01]: The human genome is easy in comparison to
the cannabis genome to sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of the things that make genomes
easier to sequence is that if the mother
[SPEAKER_01]: and the father genomes are fairly similar,
they're easier to sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the case with humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of cannabis, there's probably
a variant every 50 letters instead of a
[SPEAKER_01]: variant every 1,000 letters.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's much more difficult to sequence
because the mother and the father genomes
[SPEAKER_01]: are like sequence in two different genomes
that are blended together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can confuse a lot of the algorithms
trying to put the sequence back together.
[SPEAKER_01]: The long reads on these platforms,
and particularly the long ones that have
[SPEAKER_01]: accuracy, are what are really shining
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the ones that are putting the
genomes together near perfect order right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's enabling us to start to ask,
can we build a single reference for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis where we can resort to these
cheaper tools for mapping reads?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they've already still out on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a lot of Illumina sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pre-print that we have up there has 40
genomes that were done with Illumina
[SPEAKER_01]: mapped back to the references that were
built with Pat Guile.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing that we discovered doing
this is that while there's a single letter
[SPEAKER_01]: change every 50 bases, we're finding
there's an equally high rate of entire
[SPEAKER_01]: chapters being deleted.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what people would call structural
variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That pre-print listed about 58 million
single base pair changes in the 40 genomes
[SPEAKER_01]: that we looked at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in one of the trios that we sequenced,
which is a mother and a father in its
[SPEAKER_01]: offspring, we did that all with PacBio.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the visibility to see these large
chapters being deleted and added.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing upwards is about an eighth of
the genome that's in structural variation
[SPEAKER_01]: between just an inbred cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an enormous amount of genetic
material that is different just by
[SPEAKER_01]: crossing siblings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let alone if you step out and cross a type
1 with a type 3, it's probably going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: even more diverse than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beginning to beg the question whether
we should go with the old route like we
[SPEAKER_01]: did with human, where we make a reference
genome and map it to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might just be the time and where the
technology is mature enough where you just
[SPEAKER_01]: forget the short reads altogether and just
always use something like PacBio.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a cost question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, PacBio is probably tenfold more
expensive than Illumina, so a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people want to try and leverage the
Illumina platforms as best they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you really want to know what's
going on, a single SQL chip from PacBio,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are usually a couple grand,
you can probably get a trio sequenced on
[SPEAKER_01]: one of those now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We tend to recommend people in breeding
programs, if you don't know where your
[SPEAKER_01]: parents came from and you're not
confident, at least sequence the parents
[SPEAKER_01]: with PacBio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can do what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to do with PacBio.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a great starting point,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the direction the field is going
to go is toward a pan genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to build a reference,
it needs to include type 1s, type 2s,
[SPEAKER_01]: type 3s, type 4 plants, so that we have
all the industrial uses of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: there as a reference, so we're not missing
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just focusing on the drug type
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the hemp one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you describe really quickly for our
listeners what are type 1, 2, 3,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 4 cannabis varieties?
[SPEAKER_01]: This goes back to Etienne de Meyer's work
and probably Dave Watson's and a few other
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: They classify cannabis into five
categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: These need to be refined, but this is just
a historical classification where type 1
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are THC dominant and tend to have a
23 to 1 ratio of THC to CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Type 3 plants are CBD dominant plants and
have the inverse relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Type 2s have both genes and they make both
THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you get into type 4s, they don't have
either gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have THC synthase or CBD
synthase.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just make the precursor, cannabigero.
[SPEAKER_01]: Type 5s are broken even further upstream
and don't even make cannabigero.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cannabinoid-free plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what we've come to learn after doing
all the sequencing is that was a
[SPEAKER_01]: remarkable classification system they
figured out not having ever seen the
[SPEAKER_01]: genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: They figured all this out the old school
way with Mendel.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't really know, never published
where those markers are in the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: The preprint we put out at least attempted
to do the most popular ones that we found.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most common variations we see in these
cannabis genomes that map to this
[SPEAKER_01]: nomenclature system are the type 1 plants
have a broken CBD gene, so they really
[SPEAKER_01]: only have THC synthase there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever CBD is coming through is probably
promiscuous synthesis from the THC
[SPEAKER_01]: synthase gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: These genes are not 100 percent pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't make only one compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tend to predominantly make one
compound, but leak a little bit of the
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likewise, if you look at the CBD plants,
they usually have the THC gene completely
[SPEAKER_01]: deleted.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why we think the nomenclature
system probably needs some more refinement
[SPEAKER_01]: is that there are some rare cases where
you can have a THC gene be present in a
[SPEAKER_01]: type 3 plant, but it has a point mutation
in the gene that's deactivating it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the gene's still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can throw off some testing tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had testing tools in the marketplace
now for three or four years that try to
[SPEAKER_01]: just look for the popular ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: The full gene deletions, but they get
tripped up when there's actually a THC
[SPEAKER_01]: gene there and there's a point mutation
that's killing it because the assay is not
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitive to pick up that single case
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likewise, if both of these genes are
missing from the genome, it's usually a
[SPEAKER_01]: good sign that it's a type 4 plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have been using the
sequence information to breed for CBG
[SPEAKER_01]: plants right now because when you have
both THC and CBD synthases deleted,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have less synthase genes that could be
leaking THC expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other genes that we're paying close
attention to in that preprint are the
[SPEAKER_01]: kinabacromene genes because those are the
next closest related genes to THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant, for some reason, is made like
eight of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got more of those genes than the THC
and CBD synthase genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not heavily expressed in a lot of
the tissues we've looked at, but again,
[SPEAKER_01]: we haven't looked very deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think to really find kinabacromene
expression, you might need to be looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at different time points in flowering and
maybe in veg states to really see it turn
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We happen to see the most kinabacromene
expression in male plants, and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was the only place we actually
got RNA expression in that study were in
[SPEAKER_01]: male flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Jamaican lion plants that we sequenced
have a kinabacromene cassette.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of plants don't even have that
cassette.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another gene that people like to
keep their eye on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to breed a wider spread
between a cannabinoid and THC that's
[SPEAKER_01]: compliant with the USDA regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pay very close attention to the copy
number of THC synthase, CBD synthase,
[SPEAKER_01]: and CDC synthase.
[SPEAKER_01]: That usually gives you some guidelines as
to how much you might leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going specifically to CBC just for a
second, in any of the work that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: done, have you seen any correlations with
differences in environmental qualities
[SPEAKER_00]: that might influence CBC in any sort of
way?
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I ask is there's some old
literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember when it came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was possibly late 90s, early 2000s,
so it could be totally irrelevant now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was based on looking at some of the
data that was coming out of the University
[SPEAKER_00]: of Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the accessions that they had,
they were seeing higher levels of CBC,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there was speculation that it might
have something to do with humidity or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, given that the plants
are grown in Mississippi versus more arid
[SPEAKER_00]: environments where they normally would be
grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that surprised us in this whole
study is after we sequenced these 40
[SPEAKER_01]: genomes, and there's a figure in the
paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should point people to in this that may
give them a perspective on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see which one it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's figures seven, eight,
or nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we looked at was the presence of
these copy number variations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your audience probably can't see this,
but what shocked us, we'll maybe post it
[SPEAKER_01]: in show notes or something, is that blue
means they're deleted and red means that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have the genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Jamaican lion strains are here in
purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was shocking to us is that there are
all of these different strains out there
[SPEAKER_01]: that don't have this chromium cluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't one gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is two billion bases of sequence
that's deleted.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's on that contig that's been deleted
or the portion of contig that's deleted
[SPEAKER_01]: happens to be three or four other genes
that are involved in pathogen response.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an aquaporin gene in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few of them listed in the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's any cannabinoid that would be
most directly linked to environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions and perhaps pathogen response
or humidity, I would pin it on that one
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can see that there's a common
deletion in the population that when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: gone, you lose some of these other genes
with those cannabinoid synthase genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those plants arguably are either going to
be more prone to pathogens or have a
[SPEAKER_01]: different response to stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is actually a gibberellin
transporter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gibberellin is a really important plant
hormone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how many more the genome has.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to go and look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just seeing one of those things get
deleted means that the plant's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have a really odd response to
stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in very close proximity to the
cannabichromin genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be reason to believe that
cannabichromin expression might be a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more linked to these types of
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is already making the gerbil wheels
in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I've always wondered
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hearing about this genetic work is nice
because with my background, looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry of the plant and doing testing,
that sort of thing, CBC is one of these
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic cannabinoids where if your
method is not really dialed in to really
[SPEAKER_00]: measure CBC accurately, you can get a lot
of other compounds that can coelude around
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time as CBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are isomers of other cannabinoids
that show up around the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I say to a lot of cultivators
and extractors that are trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: information on CBC is some of the data
that's floating around on your test
[SPEAKER_00]: results about CBC, you can take with a
grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be CBC, might be something
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just coming out of the labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know it's one of those problematic
cannabinoids that a lot of times is not
[SPEAKER_00]: super accurate compared to CBD,
THC, or CBG even.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting wide problem in that
we have a hard time as it is correlating
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these genetics to the particular
chemotypes because we're usually relying
[SPEAKER_01]: on genetics from all over the world,
but then chemotype testing that's done in
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 different laboratories that all run
different methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard to standardize and get
results that you believe in unless you
[SPEAKER_01]: take control over all of that and run it
locally.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means you're usually studying plants
that are only within your state because
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't get the flower material across
state lines legally unless you're doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: with type 3 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of limitations, I think,
to the research because of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As your other cast have mentioned,
we do need to be looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabinoids and a variety of these other
cannabinoids that people are starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: find like the Italians, the THCP
cannabinoid is probably at very low levels
[SPEAKER_01]: in some cultivars that we just don't know
about because no one's been looking for it
[SPEAKER_01]: and there aren't standards for it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis as a biochemical factory,
the potential there is really incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I also say to people a lot is if
you're a researcher wanting to get into
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis research, it's an exciting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can think outside of the box of
just THC and CBD, there's so much
[SPEAKER_00]: low-hanging fruit to pursue regarding
research projects and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much work that needs to be
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have mixed feelings about the way the
hemp industry is going, but one thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that's exciting with labs needing to get
DEA licenses to handle hemp, this changes
[SPEAKER_00]: the game as far as labs being able to work
with universities or even other labs that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been slowly trying to do cannabis
research on a federally legal level and
[SPEAKER_00]: have struggled and there hasn't been a
strong network of researchers there to
[SPEAKER_00]: support each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to change a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already, I've done a little bit of work
with some universities to help them get
[SPEAKER_00]: caught up on some of the scientific
literature and get some analytical methods
[SPEAKER_00]: in development and moving towards
validation and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to see what momentum
we're going to see when these labs are
[SPEAKER_00]: able to actually move material to one
another and universities are feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable not risking their funding and
that sort of thing to actually touch
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is starting to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing Cornell get funding now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing Harvard get funding now,
but you're right about the DEA issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's almost going to guarantee that labs
that know the least about the plant are
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones that are put in charge of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The testament to this is just look at what
happened to Full Spectrum Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were an operating cannabis lab who
tried to play by the book, applied for a
[SPEAKER_01]: DEA license and since they were at the
time presently handling cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: they got raided and shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone who's currently right now handling
cannabis, they're going to be really
[SPEAKER_01]: reserved to go and apply for a DEA license
knowing what's happened in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's almost going to invite a DEA raid
unless you set up in a completely new
[SPEAKER_01]: business that's financially untethered and
then somehow get your intelligence in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and then apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's certainly going to favor pre-existing
DEA laboratories and from the ones that I
[SPEAKER_01]: know, they're great at picking up
cannabinoids and urine, but they're awful
[SPEAKER_01]: at the same time.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they've been focused on toxicology
and that's really the only thing they've
[SPEAKER_00]: been really working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's going to be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a learning curve for
sure that we're going to have to wade
[SPEAKER_00]: through over the next several years while
labs get caught up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking about the long-term, I'd rather
just see cannabis descheduled and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and then this is a DEA person to
study a plan is kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It absolutely is and that's something I
always try to preface.
[SPEAKER_00]: As much as I talk about part of my job on
the side is helping people navigate these
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about it a lot kind of casually,
but I do like to point out, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want it to be this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it is and it's what we have to
work with until it changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so segueing into the research that
we've been sort of dancing around,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's talk about the study that just
recently put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, it's in a pre-print form.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a ton of data there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this research, you looked at Jamaican
lion cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say you were mapping
the parents, the siblings, and you were
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at genes related to cannabinoid
expression, sex expression, and pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to caution all of it, it is a
pre-print.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not been through peer review,
but all the data is public.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyone can grab the data and download
it and play with it while it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: through peer review.
[SPEAKER_01]: Koji is a great place to go if you want to
look at the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a genome browser.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just Google COGE or comparative
evolution or comparative genomics genome
[SPEAKER_01]: browser, you'll search in there for
Jamaican lion or for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you'll see a certified reference up
there that has a lot of this data linked
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got great graphical tools,
so you can kind of play around with this
[SPEAKER_01]: data yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so the purpose of that project
was to first build some good cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: references.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in 2011, we sequenced a chem-dog
strain with these short-read Illumina
[SPEAKER_01]: tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably did a billion reads,
and when you try to assemble those reads,
[SPEAKER_01]: the genome is so complex that you only get
puzzle pieces out that are about 3,000
[SPEAKER_01]: letters long.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we call a contig size in
genomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want those contig sizes to ultimately
be the full length of a chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rare they ever end up that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They usually are broken up into a couple
pieces because the centromeres are hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: get through, and some of the telomeres are
hard to get through.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the human genome has one or two
chromosomes after 15 years of being
[SPEAKER_01]: declared finished or done, finally hit the
tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to do much better than that
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to happen faster because we get
to stand on their shoulders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this term in the genomics field
that measures the contiguity of genomes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's known as the N50 number.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the average size of the length of
the pieces of your puzzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis chromosomes are usually 60 to
100 megabases in size, and you'd love for
[SPEAKER_01]: your contigs to be perfect stretches of 60
million bases long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the largest one we have in one of
ours is 40 megabases, so it's close.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're almost to perfection.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the references we had when we started
this project, the N50 size, I think the
[SPEAKER_01]: largest one at that time in GenBank was
about 150 kb, so 150,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a big improvement from 2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then John Page's group put a few out a
few days after we released the Jamaican
[SPEAKER_01]: Lion one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put one out from Purple Kush and
Fanola, and those inched up toward 400.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Sunrise put one out that's in the
750 range, 750,000 bases.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the real assembly gurus don't get
excited until you're over a megabase.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of like a mental threshold
that they want to see before they start
[SPEAKER_01]: considering a reference-grade genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we still weren't quite there yet,
so we decided to keep sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all that we did different than the
people behind us was that we just jumped
[SPEAKER_01]: on board of the newer sequencers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The latest and greatest chemistry just
pushed the Jamaican Lion reference above
[SPEAKER_01]: the megabase mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's currently in around 3.2 megabases
on the preprint that we put forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the average stretch of sequence in
there is a stretch of three and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: megabases long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the other thing that's important is
looking at the quality of the sequence to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure there aren't a lot of errors,
because when you have 58 million variants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want to be spending your time on
five million ones that are wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of error to sift through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more later sequencers tended to
have a lot better error rates and more
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the other thing that you tend to do
to really build a strong reference genome
[SPEAKER_01]: is you like to sequence a trio,
which is a cross, basically, a mother,
[SPEAKER_01]: father, or an offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason you do that is you can then
triage your errors that don't make any
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendelian sets from the ones that should.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call these Mendel errors, and there's
less than like a 0.2% Mendel error rate in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Jamaican Lion trio that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that means is you look for
variants in your offspring, and you say,
[SPEAKER_01]: do I see evidence of this in either of the
parent?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not either parent, it's probably a
sequencing error.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you use that information to basically
categorize what variants are real and what
[SPEAKER_01]: are wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that usually has to go on
when you're dealing with a new species,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're doing some work with this on
Google and a few other parties in the
[SPEAKER_01]: space, is you usually have to retrain your
algorithms that look for the variants when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're dealing with a genome that's as
polymorphic as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these tools were trained on humans,
so they're only expecting a variant every
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand letters.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they start seeing one every 50 faces,
they start throwing everything out,
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, this is a different organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the hell out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to go back and retrain all the
base callers and all the variant callers
[SPEAKER_01]: to start calling the variants more
appropriately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they usually take the tools that are
used for mosquitoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mosquitoes have a variant like every 20
bases.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably one of the most
polymorphic species out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the tools that they did on gambe,
Anopheles gambe, they can then kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: tune to be somewhere between humans and
Anopheles and settle in on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went through the effort of doing
that type of training with the tools that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get the base calls really accurate,
and the assembly is very accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you have that sort of trio,
that reference set, you can then
[SPEAKER_01]: confidently take Illumina data and map it
across all of those references and start
[SPEAKER_01]: asking questions like, are there entire
segments of the genome missing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the polymorphism rate in all the
genes that are out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many highly damaging variants do we
have in the given cultivar?
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, gene, like mutations that
actually destroy genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of them?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like 2000 of those in a given
genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that many genes that get
obliterated through polymorphisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you also have these reference sets,
references, the next thing you want to do
[SPEAKER_01]: to curate them is you go and sequence the
RNA off of as many tissues as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that does is it tells you what
genes are being turned on and where they
[SPEAKER_01]: are in the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we don't have great tools that can
just scan a reference genome and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I can see where all the genes are just
algorithmically.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really want to see biological
evidence of how those RNAs are getting
[SPEAKER_01]: written off the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the listeners aren't familiar with
DNA and RNA, the analogy you often hear is
[SPEAKER_01]: that DNA is like information on a hard
drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the RNA is what's in your task
manager, which programs are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: getting executed off that hard drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not every cell in the genome or in the
plant is going to be expressing all genes
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A trichome is going to be expressing a lot
of THC synthase, but it may not be
[SPEAKER_01]: expressing any of the root proteins that
are needed to interact with the
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do this to try and get as many
pictures of what genes are on and which
[SPEAKER_01]: tissues.
[SPEAKER_01]: This helps you annotate the genome so you
know where all the genes are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think we're done with that
process yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did this across five tissues.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found about 27,000 genes in the female
genome and about 32,000 genes in the male
[SPEAKER_01]: genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those numbers are likely to increase
over time as people survey more tissues
[SPEAKER_01]: and do more sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that is really a bit of a
breakthrough that's happened this year in
[SPEAKER_01]: the sequencing platforms is those same
single molecule sequencers can now be
[SPEAKER_01]: deployed on RNA molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the past, we didn't really have
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had these short read sequencers trying
to ascertain where the RNA is mapping to
[SPEAKER_01]: the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really hard to do because RNA
is kind of like a fragmented hard drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never reads a gene from like a capital
letter to a period as a perfect sentence.
[SPEAKER_01]: What tends to happen in the genome is your
gene gets scattered across the genome in
[SPEAKER_01]: like 10 different pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost like fragmented data on a hard
drive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are tools in the cell that when
you make that RNA transcript, they go and
[SPEAKER_01]: splice out the regions that are the exons
and make what's known as a transcript.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the process of excising those exons,
it can do in a combinatorial way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have any given gene through a
process known as alternative splicing of
[SPEAKER_01]: that RNA can make three to 10 different
proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the protein complexity is not a
one-to-one correlation with the genes that
[SPEAKER_01]: are in the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But having these sequencing reads that can
read across the entire gene's RNA in one
[SPEAKER_01]: shot means you can accurately place all of
those exons back into the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't had that in cannabis until this
year, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're the first people to probably
put out any PacBio RNA ISO-seq data that
[SPEAKER_01]: gave us really clean information on intron
and exon boundaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that's really hard to do
with short reads, particularly in very
[SPEAKER_01]: polymorphous species.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bit of a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we now have that backbone inside that
Koji browser.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see where all the transcripts are
in five different tissues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also started to play around
with methylomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the epigenetic code, and it's
never been done in cannabis before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard to do in cannabis because
cannabis, the genome is 63% AT.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's four bases in most genomes,
AT, C, and G.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the human genome has roughly an equal
amount of all four letters, making it a
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly easier genome to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as the genomes skew themselves more in
the direction of one nucleotide pair or
[SPEAKER_01]: the other, it's kind of like putting a
jigsaw puzzle together where all the
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces are the same color and having less
entropy and signature in each of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you find yourself confused more
often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you want to do methylation
analysis, you have two choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use some of these single molecule
sequencers, but they're not good at doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because plants' methylation patterns are
far more complicated than microbial ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can hit microbial and maybe human
methylation patterns with the single
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule sequencers today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't handle plants very well
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to resort to a tool that's known
as bisulfite sequencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that will convert the
DNA if it's not methylated into all the
[SPEAKER_01]: cytosines in the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're not methylated, they get
converted into a T, into a different base.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by sequencing this, before and
after a conversion like this, you can
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out all the cytin bases in the
genome are protected by the methylation
[SPEAKER_01]: mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the genome goes into something
like 88% AT.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes so AT rich that you can really
get lost trying to put the reads back into
[SPEAKER_01]: the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only map half of the genome back
with this tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the only thing we've got today to
handle methylation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we ran that on four different
tissues to get an understanding of where
[SPEAKER_01]: are the promoters are in the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: The promoters are the regions in front of
the genes that are usually responsible for
[SPEAKER_01]: turning the gene on or off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they're methylated, they're
silencing the gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they're un-methylated or
hypo-methylated, they're turning the gene
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've got beautiful pictures now of
THC synthase and the adestin gene,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is involved in some seed
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those methylation patterns getting turned
on and off DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: One reason why we're excited about this is
it does give you better paleogenomic
[SPEAKER_01]: tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever want to look at ancient
cannabis samples, you can't do it with
[SPEAKER_01]: RNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: RNA is one of these molecules that breaks
down really readily and very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that way on purpose because it needs
to make those RNAs to send a signal and
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to kill those programs afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's all the feedback mechanisms
in cells to destroy RNA after it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: expressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Methylation, however, sticks around for a
really long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually pick up methylation
signals on ancient DNA samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it can give you some understanding
of what genes are turned on and off across
[SPEAKER_01]: long time horizons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's an interesting aspect to
methylation data in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that information is now together in
public and people can kind of comb through
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was leading to, I think, your final
question, which is, what do we see in this
[SPEAKER_01]: data regarding pathogen response?
[SPEAKER_01]: On the pathogen response front,
we took a little bit of a myopic approach
[SPEAKER_01]: in that we looked at all the genes that
have been published in hops that play a
[SPEAKER_01]: role in pathogen response, particularly
powdery mildew resistance, because powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew is a type of pathogen that's very
cheap to detect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not only PCR assays for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can visually see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can tell if a plant is powdery
mildew resistant or not, if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: surrounded by other plants that are loaded
with it and it seems to not have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the case with a lot of other
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't see them, so it's hard to
phenotype them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked at chitinases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chitinases are enzymes that are throughout
the plant kingdom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see them in all plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also even see them in fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was about to say,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an interesting game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some fungi express these to kill other
fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: A trichodermal is one that makes
chitinases to kill aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a weapon that's used to fight off
fungi because it's the cell code and fungi
[SPEAKER_01]: are made of chitin and another molecule
known as a beta-glucan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And beta-glucan is something plants have
evolved to fight as well with proteins
[SPEAKER_01]: known as thometin-like proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things chew the other thing that's
inside of a fungal cell membrane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we looked at those two gene classes and
then another one known as MLO,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a mildew locus that was
discovered or mildew resistance locus that
[SPEAKER_01]: was discovered in hops.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other plants as well, but there's some
work done in hops trying to map this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all in all, that was about 82 genes
that we just went through and said,
[SPEAKER_01]: are there any large copy number changes in
these genes that might correlate with
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen response?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're starting to find some of those
patterns in Jamaican Lyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a handful of thometin-like
proteins that have copy number
[SPEAKER_01]: amplifications that seem to correlate with
powdery mildew resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some chitinases as well that
are sticking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those have been interesting to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wouldn't say it's the final chapter
on that story because I think we have
[SPEAKER_01]: found the genes responsible for powdery
mildew resistance in Jamaican Lyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think you can necessarily
apply those to all the other plants out
[SPEAKER_01]: there because I think there's five to 10
different modes of resistance out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just happen to be looking through
the lens of one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a really important point when
people read this data that it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinating and it gives you insight into
this one mode of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like we were referring to earlier,
the picture is almost certainly more
[SPEAKER_00]: complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be other things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super, super fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of things that I wanted
to ask you to define in case anybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: listening and has gotten a little
confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is, can you briefly describe simply
what methylation is to listeners,
[SPEAKER_00]: which normally my exposure to it is around
heavy metal resistance in plants and that
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, just briefly describe what that
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that in context for listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ATCs and Gs in the genome
faithfully replicate themselves in cell
[SPEAKER_01]: division.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are other marks, almost
environmental memories that get written
[SPEAKER_01]: onto the DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they get written under the DNA in the
form of methylation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tend to methylate cytosines,
Cs in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is some methylate that you see in
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the most common methylation pattern
you see is a methylation significance put
[SPEAKER_01]: in cytosine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's a couple other forms of
methylation on cytosine that I won't get
[SPEAKER_01]: into.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in neurons and humans, there's five
hydroxymethylation and there's a variety
[SPEAKER_01]: of other forms of methylation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's still all working on the cytosine
base, just different methyl groups hanging
[SPEAKER_01]: off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is usually something that's done
to make the DNA coil and to contract.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you add a methyl group, it makes it a
more hydrophobic molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like adding more carbon to it makes
it greasier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the DNA changes properties and the
methylation tends to also attract other
[SPEAKER_01]: histones and other proteins to it to wrap
the DNA and coil it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of gene expression is based on
just uncoiling the DNA, getting these
[SPEAKER_01]: histones to move out of the way,
getting the DNA to relax so that an RNA
[SPEAKER_01]: polymerase can come in and start to
express a gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you tend to find the regions of the
genome that are getting silenced,
[SPEAKER_01]: get heavily methylated, the cytosines get
methylated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they're getting expressed,
they tend to erase that methylation
[SPEAKER_01]: pattern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, sometimes in rare cases, this
methylation is accidentally heritable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets moved through sperm and meiosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've shown in rats and mice that there
can be methylation signals and small RNA
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules that transfer environmental
information into the offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very, very subtle effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need very large N numbers to really
prove this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably a minority of the
heritability that's going on in genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of these things that's brought
back the debate between Darwin and Lamar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole Darwinian genetics where it's
back and it's good that it is back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a long time Lamar was silenced
for many years, but the reality is a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of Lamar was right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that there are aspects of your
environment that will get written onto
[SPEAKER_01]: your DNA and a small portion of that may
in fact find its way into the offspring
[SPEAKER_01]: such that the environment can actually
change the genetic outcome in future
[SPEAKER_01]: generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's a very subtle effect and
not nearly as powerful as the mutations
[SPEAKER_01]: you might see that are actually written
faithfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that pops up in my mind to
conceptualize this in a totally different
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife is a mental health therapist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of the concept of
intergenerational trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like these subtle things that can get
passed on that relate to how somebody grew
[SPEAKER_00]: up and their environment and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting and I know we're
deviating, but I think this is something
[SPEAKER_00]: in general I wanted to ask you about
misconceptions around genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: genomics and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concept of epigenetics is talked about
a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big buzzword in popular science,
pop culture science and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions I was going to ask
you now, what are some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: misconceptions that you hear popularly
shared about genetics, genomics and
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly epigenetics, whether it be
related to plants or humans that you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like to set straight?
[SPEAKER_01]: The scientific field is really excited
about methylation for complete opposite
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons that pop culture likes to magnify
its effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pop culture likes to almost guilt people
into their actions today are going to hurt
[SPEAKER_01]: some child three generations from now and
that is remote garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to hang on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're excited about it because it
teaches us about the machinery of
[SPEAKER_01]: expression and the cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we see the cell methylated in certain
things, it gives us another vantage point
[SPEAKER_01]: on what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one thing just to measure the RNA
that's coming off of the genome,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's entirely another thing to have and to
know which parts of the genome it's
[SPEAKER_01]: methylated as a result of this because
that implies there's a feedback mechanism,
[SPEAKER_01]: that there is something else in the cell
that is responding to a signal to make
[SPEAKER_01]: something transcribe and maybe even a
feedback mechanism turned off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like having those circuits all spelled
out, so we're really excited about
[SPEAKER_01]: epigenetics for that reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of that often gets pushed into
pop culture as being your actions from
[SPEAKER_01]: three generations ago are now impacting
the direction of the human population.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's very, very thin evidence for those
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't doubt that some of those studies
are in fact real, but the Ireland famine
[SPEAKER_01]: is one that comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's such a weak p-value and such a
weak effect that you'd be better off
[SPEAKER_01]: worrying about whether you're staring at
your phone too long walking into a street.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's stronger selective pressures out
there that are likely to affect your
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics than some of those epigenetic
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unfortunate, but it happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Science often gets interpreted politically
and I think epigenetics is one that has a
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of guilt associated with it that's
being leveraged politically.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people that are not scientists or have
a very vague understanding of the research
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gone into this, it can really freak
people out unnecessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cause a lot of stress like you
mentioned that really isn't warranted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another example that comes to mind is
concern over different types of waves that
[SPEAKER_00]: are passing through your body and the
effects of gravitational waves and this
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of stuff that some people,
when they start hearing about,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh gosh, quantum gravity and quantum
mechanics is a big one where people start
[SPEAKER_00]: to hear these concepts and then they get
really strung out worrying about these
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of things that the effects may be
real, but they're so small in comparison
[SPEAKER_00]: to other things that have much bigger
pressures on you like you're saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not really worth exerting the mental
energy to worry about that when you have
[SPEAKER_00]: much more real issues to deal with that
you probably don't have to worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: gravitational wave distortions being
caused by comets and things moving through
[SPEAKER_00]: the galaxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strung out is a great way to describe
string theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to the research study now,
I guess one thing I want to summarize for
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners too just to talk about some of
the techniques and the things you've
[SPEAKER_00]: described.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about basic DNA sequencing and
that is looking at the possibilities
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially of the organism, what's there,
the foundation to work from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measuring the RNA allows you to understand
what's actually at play within that DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence and then the methylation piece
being able to look at that helps you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how the environment is
influencing these things that are at play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a good super simplified version of
explaining that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Methylation in many ways, I'd actually
like the RNA data better because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: so much more information content there and
it's more accurately mapped, but the
[SPEAKER_01]: methylation is another confirmation.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see promoters have methylation
patterns that promote the expression of
[SPEAKER_01]: the genes, you have more confidence in
actually what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another view onto the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's effectively the central dogma.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we have this genome, it is the hand
that you're dealt and if you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: certain aces in that deck, you're never
going to get them no matter how much light
[SPEAKER_01]: and water you plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have a THC synthase gene,
you're not going to coach that plant into
[SPEAKER_01]: making THC some other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you do have a THC synthase
gene, the gene doesn't necessarily predict
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're going to make 7% versus 14%
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least that gene doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hunting down a couple other genes
that are related to the precursors in the
[SPEAKER_01]: pathway that might in fact have a bigger
impact on the magnitude of expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, the genetics between THC and
CVD, they really just give you the ratio
[SPEAKER_01]: to expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you push the magnitude of expression of
a given ratio too far, it will break the
[SPEAKER_01]: USDA regulations and the genetics today
aren't going to predict that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in a couple of years, we'll know
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll know that there's a couple of genes
up stream that everyone's looking at that
[SPEAKER_01]: are involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: The AA3 and AA1 and there's a little talk
acid cyclase and final transfer.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those things are great candidates
for mutations that may in fact be driving
[SPEAKER_01]: the magnitude of expression between a 7%
or a 14%.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a 14% CVD line, you're going
to be risking that popping hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to probably approach that 0.3%
under the given regs that are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are unfortunately trying
to find 7% lines, grow twice as much
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only so the material 99% of it ends up
going into an extractor when the ratio no
[SPEAKER_01]: longer forces.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolute vanity by regulation,
but it's what's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: To the point of your analogy on cards,
if you're missing both ACEs, CVD and THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to be making the precursors,
the kings if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: The genetics can be very, very predictive
and they can be predictive at a very early
[SPEAKER_01]: age.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can also scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing that I don't think
everyone appreciates while they probably
[SPEAKER_01]: are never going to be a replacement for an
HPLC value.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably never going to have a
field portable HPLC that can run thousands
[SPEAKER_01]: of samples a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will be doable with genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a matter of time, but it's much
harder to imagine getting that to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with an HPLC system that's field portable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're complementary and we always
encourage people not to view them as one
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the other because there are many
more things that you can measure with
[SPEAKER_01]: genomics and its price points are changing
so radically.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should pay attention to it,
but they're always going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: complemented by people who have good
analytical testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's an excellent way to
summarize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all complementary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even within analytical chemistry,
there's sometimes a strange competition
[SPEAKER_00]: between analysts that prefer traditional
chromatography and those that like to rely
[SPEAKER_00]: on mass spectrometry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some people that are very
resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to stick to chromatography and
that's what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others really trust spectrometry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, they blend together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use mass spectrometry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the science world, there are these
weird little camps and tribes just like
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: They exist in sequencing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all bicker over what's the better
platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any other lessons that you
gleaned from this recent research project
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we mentioned, but I don't know
if we really got into it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between these cannabinoid
acid synthase genes and the pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We touched on it early on, but I don't
know if we really got into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ongoing debate in the field is what is
responsible for residual THC expression in
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that don't have a THC synthase
gene?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are hemp plants popping hot?
[SPEAKER_01]: The number one culprit for that is CBD
synthase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever people clone that into yeast and
run it, they tend to get 20 to 1,
[SPEAKER_01]: 23 to 1 ratios of CBD THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gene in yeast will make promiscuous
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can alter the pH of those conditions
and even get those genes to make all the
[SPEAKER_01]: other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, there's a really good
presentation I'd recommend people look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a CanMed presentation from this
October from Andrew Horowitz from
[SPEAKER_01]: Demetrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Demetrix is a synthetic biology company
out of Jay Keesling's laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jay Keesling is well known for cloning a
lot of the plant genes into bacteria and
[SPEAKER_01]: into yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This freaks a lot of people out,
but there's actually a really good science
[SPEAKER_01]: that you learn when you isolate a gene
into a model organism like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can perturb it in isolation of all the
other cannabinoid genes that are in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take one of them out and put it into
yeast, and then you can play with the pH
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can play with the temperature and
all these other conditions, feed it
[SPEAKER_01]: different precursors and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they did is they fed those yeast
hexanoic acid and they got THCP.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually found THCP before we found
it in the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Italians discovered it very recently,
but if you actually go through the
[SPEAKER_01]: literature, you realize, no, they were
making this in yeast and they learned that
[SPEAKER_01]: the synthase genes in cannabis that we
currently have, if you feed it octanoic
[SPEAKER_01]: acid, will make THCP.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need to go be looking for a
different THC gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same gene will fold THCP and THCP.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to be looking upstream maybe in
the pathway that's governing what makes
[SPEAKER_01]: hexanoic acid and what makes octanoic
acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're beginning to be able to use
synthetic biology to teach us about the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a very similar thing in this study
in that we took a couple of the genes that
[SPEAKER_01]: we saw were related to pathogen response
and we cloned them into E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took a thomatine-like protein that was
amplified in the Jamaican lion genome and
[SPEAKER_01]: also amplified in a couple samples that we
got from Colorado Seeds and from Minibus,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark Jordan's group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those ones we put into E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli and once we had that cannabis gene
getting synthesized in E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli, we can make gobs of it and then
apply it back to microbes that we know
[SPEAKER_01]: infect cannabis like fusarium and
aspergillus and see if that peptide
[SPEAKER_01]: actually kills those microbes,
at least in a petri dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: We demonstrate some of this in the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have evidence that the TLPs,
the thomatine-like proteins are killing
[SPEAKER_01]: aspergillus, but we do see that it's
retarding the growth of penicillium
[SPEAKER_01]: species and of fusarium oxysporum.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next experiment we have running is
grabbing the other gene we found that was
[SPEAKER_01]: correlated with this resistance,
which is a chitinase.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have that getting cloned and expressed
in E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the plant literature shows that if
you combine these two, you get a better
[SPEAKER_01]: one plus one equals three effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really can knock down the microbes
once you have both of them present.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the process now of taking those
cannabis genes and just making gobs of
[SPEAKER_01]: that protein so we can test out the
theory, are these the proteins that are
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible for keeping cannabis powdery?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they some of the proteins,
I should say, not the only ones that are
[SPEAKER_01]: making cannabis powdery?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we consider those as like a foliar
spray?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one thing to have the genetics and
know how to breathe for resistance with
[SPEAKER_01]: this particular form of resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very helpful, but it might take
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some jurisdictions, particularly
here in Massachusetts, where changing your
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics isn't easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to run with the genetics you put
into the seed to cell tracking system.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to add new genetics,
you've got to go through a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: paperwork with the CCC and it's a big
hassle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are locked and loaded with the
mothers they have, and they're looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: ways to fight off these pathogens with
native peptides from the cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: not with some foreign molecule that's
going to end up in a vape pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really excited about that side of
the market because we like the idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymatic pesticides because enzymes
degrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can destroy them and you can get rid
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use them in a really ephemeral
nature and they're not going to end up
[SPEAKER_01]: like myclobutanol concentrating into a
cartridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd rather do this with peptides that we
know are from the cannabis plant because
[SPEAKER_01]: the consumers are already consuming those.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to grab something foreign
that might trigger an allergic reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to grab something that has been
time tested with human biology for
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's come out of cannabis, it's
probably been through that ringer before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's super exciting using these
technologies to think about different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that came into my mind then too
is we've been talking about pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what about genes related in some form
or another to beneficial relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plant would have with
microorganisms?
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that shocked us that came out of
the paper was if you look at the RNA
[SPEAKER_01]: expression in the plant, the most heavily
expressed genes in the genome are these
[SPEAKER_01]: chitinases.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they're also the most
differentially expressed genes,
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning that the RNA expression is quite
divergent between tissues, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: completely absent in the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the same was similar with the TLP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it not expressing pathogen response
to the roots?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we think that's due to a lot of the
work people have just demonstrated before
[SPEAKER_01]: us, but these mycorrhizal interactions you
might have in the root systems,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to foster mycorrhizal
interactions, you don't start off that
[SPEAKER_01]: handshake with a toxic chitinase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on in and let me kill you while
you're at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fascinating because the roots are
not making this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably to have some commensal
relationship with the fungi in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that was interesting along
those lines is that deletion that we see
[SPEAKER_01]: so commonly in the type 1 plants,
which is a cannabichromine deletion,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's quite present in a lot of the hemp
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of the hemp growers are working in
breeding programs to cross and capture
[SPEAKER_01]: that cannabichromine deletion into their
hemp lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that's what's responsible for the
THC levels that you see in type 4 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see some type 4 plants out there
that are like 100 to 1, and they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have THC or CBD synthase.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most likely place that residual THC is
coming from is probably the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabichromine cluster, and so people are
looking to just try and get rid of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly if it's already known to
exist in the population and we can just do
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple crosses and get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the process of doing that,
we have to pay close attention to those
[SPEAKER_01]: other four genes that are on that deletion
that are involved in pathogen response
[SPEAKER_01]: because that may alter... You may breed
yourself a really compliant hemp line that
[SPEAKER_01]: is loaded with botrytis and battery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little bit more frightening to
us, actually, because the USDA has nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: in the regs for microbial detection.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have it loaded with aspergillus,
and as long as it's below 0.3,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a bit of a bummer for those who are
looking at CBD flower for a smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of success in people
swapping out CBD for tobacco, or swapping
[SPEAKER_01]: tobacco out for CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Switzerland's been doing a lot of
that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a much safer alternative,
as Donald Tashkin's shown, but I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know that I can say that if it's going to
be hemp that can be loaded with pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to do more work there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still just a theory that these
genes are missing when you select for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabichromine deletions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more work that needs to go
into proving that those are, in fact,
[SPEAKER_01]: more pathogens susceptible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't done that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just pointed out the fact that it's a
common deletion.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are probably going to breed for it,
and it's going to come with these genes
[SPEAKER_01]: getting knocked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those four genes is a gene that's
involved in viral response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Viruses, we know, we're now starting to be
able to detect those with the RNA
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencing data that's coming out of a lot
of the laboratories.
[SPEAKER_01]: The discovery phase of cannabis viruses is
really just beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only a few that have been really
quantitatively nailed, but I think we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to see 10 more in the next two
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to change how we manage those
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I keep seeing every year
since, I don't know, one or two years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm starting to see, or people are
messaging me saying, have you heard of
[SPEAKER_00]: this virus that's been identified?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes these viruses have very cryptic
names because they don't have a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember the name of one I came
across.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called cryptic cannabis virus,
one and two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are in NTVI.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made assays for those.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've never found them in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge with the viruses is that
they're usually RNA-based.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they're vibroids and they don't
even have a protein shell in them,
[SPEAKER_01]: so they're very susceptible to breakdown,
which means it's unlikely they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: make it to your laboratory intact across
state lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very few people want to hang out for that
experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they think they have a virus,
they torch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put it over here so you can play
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bit to ask saying, hey,
can you save that one for me and ship it
[SPEAKER_01]: across state lines?
[SPEAKER_01]: What it usually means is you've got to
teach people how to do RNA extractions in
[SPEAKER_01]: the field so that you can get something
that's converted into DNA or is on ice and
[SPEAKER_01]: can survive the shipment to a laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just not there yet as a community.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still getting some of those tools
out to the masses.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can do on-site RNA preps,
but the ones that are tightly linked to a
[SPEAKER_01]: close university can probably get those
studies done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Dark Heart Nursery did some work
looking up the... That was a Viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a Hopps-Layton Viroid,
but there was also some excellent work out
[SPEAKER_01]: of Israel looking at a lettuce chlorosis
virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually demonstrated white fly
transmission in that paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pest management is actually playing a
role because some of these pests are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually the vectors for the disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've built quantitative PCR assays for
all three of those, for cannabis cryptic
[SPEAKER_01]: virus, Hopps-Layton Viroid, and then
lettuce chlorosis virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just in the early stages of working
with people to get them to test these out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know people out there that are
interested in quantitative PCR tests to
[SPEAKER_01]: monitor that, we have the tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just don't have the grows or the
gardens or the places to deploy them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to partner with people to see
exactly how to put those things to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was the Hopps-Layton Viroid
that someone asked me about very recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't heard about that in the context
of cannabis at all until they mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I was wondering is,
is there any way to test a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: generically to understand if it is likely
to have a virus regardless of identifying
[SPEAKER_00]: what that virus is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know a lot of cultivators battle
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes viruses appear as nutrient
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have very similar symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have cultivators that ask me a lot,
how do I quickly know whether this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient problem or a viral problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually an industry-wide problem
that's not unique to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Viruses, they don't have necessarily
conserved sequences that we can rely on to
[SPEAKER_01]: universally capture them and sequence
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at fungi and bacteria,
there's tricks that you can play.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have to have ribosomal DNA
operons.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can design primers that will amplify
all yeast and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't say all, most, because there
is even some divergence amongst primer
[SPEAKER_01]: sites you might pick to try and amplify
all of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likewise with bacteria, you usually go
after the 16S region.
[SPEAKER_01]: That single set of primers can probably
get you everything in the bacterial side
[SPEAKER_01]: of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have the analogous primer
sequences you might target for viruses
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be conserved across all of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're having this problem with
coronaviruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to engineer new assays for these
viruses so they can spread them around the
[SPEAKER_01]: world and the virus mutates a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to have multiple different
primer sites that target the coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_01]: What people do in the case where they
can't use something as fast as QPC,
[SPEAKER_01]: they resort to RNA sequencing,
which captures all of the RNA that's
[SPEAKER_01]: present, sequences that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they'll try and deplete the
really common ribosomal sequences that are
[SPEAKER_01]: in the RNA so they get more efficient
sequencing, but it's another expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they blast that all through a DNA
sequencer and then filter that information
[SPEAKER_01]: for sequences that look like they're from
the virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several viral databases out there
that you can leverage that will scan your
[SPEAKER_01]: RNA sequencing data for virus content.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about hundreds to thousands
of dollars to do studies like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's not something that you just do on
a whim.
[SPEAKER_01]: You find yourself in the scenario of doing
lots of tests for individual viruses of
[SPEAKER_01]: suspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've not seen tobacco mosaic virus ever
show up genetically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people say they have it due to
some pictures, but I've not seen it
[SPEAKER_01]: actually show up in a test that's proven
that it's probably something very related,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not exactly tobacco mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably a hops mosaic virus or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few of those that have been
listed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does make for a bit more cumbersome of
a test.
[SPEAKER_01]: How they handle this in human clinical
studies is they tend to have multiplex
[SPEAKER_01]: tests that look for a panel of
rhinoviruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they first scan 20 or 30 of them
with QPCR and then depending on what hits
[SPEAKER_01]: they get, they might do narrow it down to
some other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's at least what they're doing with
the coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a test that looks at a handful
of common cold viruses, rhinoviruses,
[SPEAKER_01]: and norel type viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if they see it's negative for all of
those, they've graduated to maybe a SARS
[SPEAKER_01]: or a coronavirus test.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll probably see something similar like
that in cannabis as there'll be a two-step
[SPEAKER_01]: screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really need to know because it's
plaguing your entire grow, you might
[SPEAKER_01]: graduate to doing a DNA sequencing and RNA
sequencing to thoroughly figure out this
[SPEAKER_01]: is something novel that's never been seen
before and then you want to crush it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's usually what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know growers want that easy detection
fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's disappointing to hear that
it's just not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know many growers that have tried to
battle with what they thought were
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient deficiencies for far too long,
trying to battle what actually ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: being a virus and just wasted a lot of
time and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: My response is usually, if you're really
worried about it, can you just torch that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and move on rather than wasting so
much energy and time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers are now getting that point
because their fields are so big now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not worried about saving a single
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a handful of plants so they're able to
just call the ones that seem to be causing
[SPEAKER_00]: problems and move on, which would be more
typical in bigger forms of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Changing gears quite a bit, what are your
thoughts on how genomics research is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to influence cannabis taxonomy in the
future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's a really muddy area in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis taxonomy is one of these things
that nobody, even botanists and chemists
[SPEAKER_00]: and geneticists, it's hard to get on the
same page on how to classify plants or
[SPEAKER_00]: even how to define what a species is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you see that moving towards in
the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in this weird timeframe where the
entire phylogenetic tree of life is
[SPEAKER_01]: getting redefined.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm waiting for that dust to settle before
I weigh in.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no need to do it genetically,
which is if you're 95% identical to this
[SPEAKER_01]: other microbe, you're the same genre or
the same species.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to make metrics like that
to begin calling these.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is needed because we have a lot of
redundant nomenclature, even in the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you try and get Aspergillus species out
of ATCC or other cell banks, you'll find
[SPEAKER_01]: that a lot of them haven't been sequenced
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you apply primers to them from the
literature that are supposed to hit them
[SPEAKER_01]: and they don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you sequence this genome and realize
it's not what they told you it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of this stuff has all been done with
eyeballs, people looking at the morphology
[SPEAKER_01]: and looking at these things on plates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, organisms can express really
bizarre phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The classic case is like a caterpillar and
a butterfly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you looked at those things,
you wouldn't call them the same species.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at Aspergillus species,
they can be just as genetically diverse,
[SPEAKER_01]: yet they look identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: The look of the species is no longer
trustworthy for classifying them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speciation in general usually involves
whether they can continue to cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have cannabis plants that all cross
with one another, so they're arguably the
[SPEAKER_01]: same species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you want to subdivide them into
subspecies Indica sativa and all that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's great, but we probably need some
paleogenomics to really nail that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's in fact the story that the
Indicas came out of one geographic region
[SPEAKER_01]: at one point in time, and the sativas were
more equatorial, then maybe that will bear
[SPEAKER_01]: itself out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, they've been so mixed and
inappropriately named during that mixing
[SPEAKER_01]: process that the sativa Indica thing
doesn't match up to any of the genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually don't get involved in a lot of
debates on whether we're going to call
[SPEAKER_01]: these things chemovars, cultivars,
or strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to mock them actually because I
don't find a very productive conversation
[SPEAKER_01]: when the whole tree is getting rewritten.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can argue over the taxonomy stuff
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to just read the DNA because that's
the answer you're really looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're looking for in this
categorization is how do these things
[SPEAKER_01]: differ biochemically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Chemovars are a great name, but right now,
the chemovars we're measuring aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: really measuring the flavonoids,
so I don't view that as a legitimate way
[SPEAKER_01]: to necessarily draw the taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, it's the heritable units that
govern the taxonomy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taxonomy is DNA, and anyone who tries to
tell you otherwise is going to be proven
[SPEAKER_01]: poorly wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really important to point
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when in some of my early
graduate work studying mycology,
[SPEAKER_00]: how frustrating this issue was of learning
the taxonomy of different fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then tomorrow, it changes because just
like you said, there'd be some genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: work that's done and they realize,
oh, these things that look identical even
[SPEAKER_00]: under microscopy and everything,
they seem the same spores, look the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: have same ornamentation, but they're
different genetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've got to call them something
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Students, everything you learned,
wipe your brains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we're changing the whole system and
even botany too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a botanist with the BLM for Wild
Bureau of Land Management, scouting native
[SPEAKER_00]: plants around Oregon and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized it had been a while since I've
gone back and looked at the scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: names of a lot of the plants that I worked
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few months ago, I went and looked
and saw that about half of them that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: studying that had already gone through
like genera changes and that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: things, I've already gone through changes
again and been reclassified and split and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a headache of trying to keep up
with all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: To give you a sense of the wave of
headache that's coming even further,
[SPEAKER_01]: the last study I heard, I think it was in
the UK, they're going to sequence a
[SPEAKER_01]: million species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once that happens, everything you've
learned, you've got to rewrite.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Aspergillus species are getting
renamed all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Braziliansis got carved out of Niger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no doubt it's going to happen in
this field, but I guess I've been advising
[SPEAKER_01]: people in cannabis, just stay tuned and be
patient because this is the wrong time,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, to fight over those terms because
we're just in the earliest stages of
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencing everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we have a map of 100,000 different
cannabis genomes, I think we'll have a
[SPEAKER_01]: picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably aren't going to try to force
that picture into sativa, indica,
[SPEAKER_01]: antiquity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're probably going to say, okay,
the auto flowers are over here and the
[SPEAKER_01]: genotypes that have these types of
clusters are over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be named in a coordinate system
that's probably more related to large
[SPEAKER_01]: segmental duplications or deletions that
are related to its diaspora around the
[SPEAKER_01]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the main thing, any listeners that
are banging their heads against the wall
[SPEAKER_00]: about how to talk about cannabis
varieties, the main thing is to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about what are you trying to communicate
in the first place and what do you care
[SPEAKER_00]: about?
[SPEAKER_00]: That can drive your vocabulary a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at cannabis varieties
and you're trying to understand chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: differences, then talking about chemotypes
and stuff could be valuable as long as you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that that's a tool for us to
communicate things, not necessarily some
[SPEAKER_00]: hard coded taxonomical structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's important in general
because it's very rare that science drives
[SPEAKER_01]: to a consensus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they changed the definition of the
kilogram last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're like, oh, shit, that can change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was tied to some astronomical unit
of the wavelength of light or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize it was ever going to
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they do and there was a consensus
against marijuana for 80 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And clearly, that's in the latest stages
of changing today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes the communication that's
most popular is probably technically
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if your goal is to communicate,
think the most amount of people that will
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you just use the language that
conveys that most simply.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's probably the case of what's
happening with strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one likes that name because it's a
microbial term.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do a Google trends on strain
versus cultivar or chemovar, there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: one talking about cultivar or chemovar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's continuing to talk about
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to effectively communicate
to large audiences, sometimes you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: use those terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason people put things in Latin is
because it's a dead language and the
[SPEAKER_01]: language doesn't change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we don't yet have chemovar or
cultivar necessarily in Latin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think cultogen might be technically a
combination of an acronym of Latin terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's all about making sure we
have communication and not necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: hard fixed religion because there's one
thing we're going to learn in the next few
[SPEAKER_01]: years is that whatever we're saying in
this podcast today will probably be
[SPEAKER_01]: partially mocked as being wrong in a few
years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's two things that come to
mind there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one is I've always been a fan of
Richard Feynman and his work, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: as a science educator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a lot of great work for science
education in general, much less the
[SPEAKER_00]: physics side of stuff he worked on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something he talked about in one of
his late books called The Meaning of It
[SPEAKER_00]: All.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he talks about the problem with
science education in our culture is that
[SPEAKER_00]: most lay people expect that what science
does is it produces facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those facts, everyone can form a
consensus around them because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are known.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hard, objective truths.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality for people that are
actively doing research and diving into
[SPEAKER_00]: all this stuff is you realize there aren't
a lot of hard facts, if any, and consensus
[SPEAKER_00]: is harder than you would expect,
depending on what you're trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: consensus over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Richard Feynman said is that
ultimately what science does is it gets at
[SPEAKER_00]: answers to questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not necessarily provide you the
hard answer, but it gravitates towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always moving towards that
answer, even if it doesn't quite get to
[SPEAKER_00]: that very specific hard truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you talk to people, like,
for instance, on a political stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're talking about, let's say,
climate change, people want to know the
[SPEAKER_00]: facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to know that you've got
some general idea of where the science is
[SPEAKER_00]: moving towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't want to hear about
probabilities and confidence intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to know what's the state of
things and what do we need to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a politician is willing to just
assert solid, bold, flat claims,
[SPEAKER_00]: people resonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, because it's a lot easier to
digest than the actual muddiness of
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets weaponized oftentimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my view on this is they only
separated the church in the state so that
[SPEAKER_01]: they can replace the church with people in
white robes versus black robes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the scientists are propped up as
some kind of priest that can read the code
[SPEAKER_01]: of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything that comes out of their
mouth is ironclad truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to drive politics off of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's nothing to be further from the
truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're generating questions, not answers
most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is generally about trying to figure out
what are the better questions to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that drives what research you're
going to do and how you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: approach a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Isaac Asimov, another writer,
science educator, even though he wrote a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of fiction, he had a paper that he
wrote in response to someone criticizing a
[SPEAKER_00]: statement he made about basically what you
said just earlier, that in 10 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything we're saying now, a large part
of it is going to be mocked at and thought
[SPEAKER_00]: of as wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made a statement like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone said, well, if that's the
case, then does that mean that essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of things are wasted and that
anything could be overturned at any time?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, well, no, no,
no.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is just that our
understanding gets sharper over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it feeds off of what came before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that what's going to come after
is going to be totally irrelevant and in
[SPEAKER_00]: total opposition to the science that's
happening now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to keep pressing forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the example he used was the
spherical nature of the Earth and how
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually we learned that it's not a
perfect sphere and that it's sort of like
[SPEAKER_00]: a lemon in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has this sort of oblong nature to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it even kind of like wiggles and
moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before that, it was assumed that the
Earth was flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just pointing that these aren't
total overhauls of what came before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're refinements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like getting the clarity tuned up
even more as things go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's important for people to
understand that what we're saying is not
[SPEAKER_00]: that all of this is just getting thrown
out and that a lot of scientists are
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially wasting their time,
but that we're all standing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulders of everyone that's come before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people 10 years from now are just
going to have a very different set of eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: than we have now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, that's probably the most compelling
argument I've heard in this climate debate
[SPEAKER_01]: is that the number of ideas that are human
generated tend to be cumulative.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're idea bridging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the fact that we had twice the
amount of population back when Einstein
[SPEAKER_01]: was around or Edison or Pasteur,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you did population control because you
were concerned that we weren't going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: smart enough to figure out how to use
things more resourcefully, you would have
[SPEAKER_01]: picked off Einstein or maybe Pasteur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then where would the world be if we
only had electricity and not the germ
[SPEAKER_01]: theory of disease, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that we had the population we had
back then, we are so much more richer and
[SPEAKER_01]: more resourceful today than we would have
been if we actually choked the population
[SPEAKER_01]: back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes back to the concept of humans not
necessarily being a cancer cell on the
[SPEAKER_01]: planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually part of this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to learn as much as we can about
it so that we don't unwise the use the
[SPEAKER_01]: resources that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ingenuity is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the evidence is pretty clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at people's standard of living
and if you look at people's income,
[SPEAKER_01]: they tend to become more environmental as
that goes up over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the environmental damage is done
due to poverty and more people are moving
[SPEAKER_01]: out of poverty than ever before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we actually have a really bright
future that you won't hear about in the
[SPEAKER_01]: political sphere because that's about
selling fear that we're all going to die
[SPEAKER_01]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: From coronavirus and and tsunami or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think I'm very optimistic about the
fact that the population is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: fine, that I think we're science is going
to be exponentially building upon itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we often underestimate that that fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just now we're in the first
generation of people who have access to
[SPEAKER_01]: all information knowable on their phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: School is now irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one wants to say that, but it is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're if you like to read and you're
curious, you don't need school.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need your phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no parent wants to say that to the
kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we didn't have that when we went to
school.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to go to centralized campuses where
all the information was literally stacked
[SPEAKER_01]: on paper in the library so that in
microfiche so we can come through this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff and be near the people who are smart
and who already read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we can be near those people on
conversations like this and get all the
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to radically change idea
generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and it's going to radically change
people's access to capital and the ability
[SPEAKER_01]: for people to grow and to invent and to
become more resourceful with with the
[SPEAKER_01]: limited amount of resources we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis is like emerging from
prohibition during all of this because we
[SPEAKER_01]: now have probably one of the most
resourceful plants on the planet where
[SPEAKER_01]: people have been restricted from being
able to really adequately study it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the gates are open and we can
study one of the best photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms we have that can literally feed
the world with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a tremendous amount of
potential, I think, for solving a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these climate concerns we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think just by doing what we do so well
with him, learn this thing, figure out its
[SPEAKER_01]: code, figure out how to tweak it,
figure out how it interacts best with the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be a combination of
not its genome, but also the microbes that
[SPEAKER_01]: are in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more we can learn about that,
we're probably not going to come to
[SPEAKER_01]: consensus about what it all means.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as Feynman saying, we're going to be
pushing ourselves in the arc of being more
[SPEAKER_01]: and more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: With what limited stuff we have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's such a great summary to bring
this whole conversation back around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate how much time you've
been willing to spend with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been going for almost an hour and 45
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of a couple of closing
questions for you to cap us off.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is what other research interests do
you have beyond cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually like to ask every scientist I
interview that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really interested in other pathways
that are in its neighboring plants lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also this concept of xenohormesis that
your previous guest, Kevin Spelman,
[SPEAKER_01]: will probably have a lot to say about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hops has a similar pathway that makes
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes a different set of compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would probably call the analogous
medicinal compounds in hops or the example
[SPEAKER_01]: of humul.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those compounds are starting to show
anti-cancer properties, much like the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know really what receptors they
had and why, but everything that's needed
[SPEAKER_01]: to make those compounds has some homology
to the cannabis genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible the cannabis genome could be
making some of those compounds as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's going to need to be
crossed into it or how we genetically
[SPEAKER_01]: engineer it, but it's something that makes
you turn back and look at all these other
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that we've taken for granted and
start to ask, well, what are the secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolites in those plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the only reason we've paid so much
attention to cannabis is that one of them
[SPEAKER_01]: has a really easy bioassay to tell you
when you're getting something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have that in hops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might have beta-carotene, which is a
CB2 agonist, but you probably can't really
[SPEAKER_01]: feel that unless you're in pain and you
take a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these other compounds that we can't
really perceptually feel, we need to go
[SPEAKER_01]: back and look at because the FDA system is
selecting against these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: In many ways, the regulatory environment
we have here in the United States favors
[SPEAKER_01]: largely capitalized companies that can
then pay politicians to limit the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory space of the operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the genetics tend to go through
bottlenecks in those environments and we
[SPEAKER_01]: end up having massive genetic shifts
because of regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm somewhat fascinated about the impact
of regulation on genetic drift because I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that there's genocides going on all
over the place as a result of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This 0.3% thing is going to create a
massive, just like prohibition,
[SPEAKER_01]: create enriched type 1 genetics and
probably a depletion of a lot of type 3s.
[SPEAKER_01]: This 0.3 thing is going to have the
opposite effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to end up meaning we're going
to have to select a very narrow set of
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars to move forward that are
compliant with the USDA and it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: wipe out all types of diversity we don't
know yet because those selections arguably
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to wipe out these other
secondary metabolites no one's measuring.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's going to be measuring the
canflavin pathways in the process of doing
[SPEAKER_01]: these subjects.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are, we have sequencing that looks at
that pathway, but very few people are
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily going to jump on that train
right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the process of even putting in
microbial regulations in place,
[SPEAKER_01]: this means plants that like and enjoy a
particular microbial background are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get eliminated from the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you have a plant that needs
trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trichoderma is not harmful, yet some of
the regulations in some states have CFU
[SPEAKER_01]: language.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colony forming units or they don't know
what the hell they're counting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just saying bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, really ignorant to think of
microbiomes that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you put that in place,
all of the plants that can get through
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation, then go through a genetic
shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the selection for plants that
tolerate low-microbe environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, those may not necessarily be the
most productive plants from a secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolite standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's looking at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just looking at maybe THC and CBD,
but all these other flavonoids might be
[SPEAKER_01]: abolished in the practice of doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm curious at seeing where that's
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the xanthohumal thing and the
xenohormesis is just this concept that
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants are making these secondary
metabolites to communicate to the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that propagate their genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were to actually look at the
number of cannabis cells and the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: genomes that are divided throughout space
and time, there's probably a good argument
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's winning that race compared to
humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we are propagating more cannabis DNA
right now than human DNA because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: nature of how big some of these plants can
get, how big their genome is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that they replicate every 12
weeks and humans don't replicate that
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly means that some numbers I've drawn
out suggest that the cannabis genome has
[SPEAKER_01]: actually done a remarkable job finding an
ideal pollinator.
[SPEAKER_01]: That likes to propagate it all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how did it do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It did that by being able to make
secondary metabolites that tap into our
[SPEAKER_01]: biochemistry to tell us that changes in
the environment are coming or what have
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this work was all done by David
Sinclair.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a guy who does a lot of work on the
family youth and resveratol and many of
[SPEAKER_01]: these compounds that are involved in that
pathway.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's got a great paper out there
called Xenohormesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it talks about how these plants,
when the environment changes, they shift
[SPEAKER_01]: the secondary metabolites they make so
that the things that beat them,
[SPEAKER_01]: their mTOR pathway gets triggered so that
they start going into caloric restriction
[SPEAKER_01]: because the plants biochemistry has
changed to know that the environment is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to change and it's going to have an
impact on the amount of material that it
[SPEAKER_01]: can feed the thing that's supposed to
propagate tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that whole interaction space,
I think is the key to cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can understand how those plants
are signaling the metabolism, the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that propagate their seeds, we will
understand cancer in a much better way and
[SPEAKER_01]: a much more thorough understanding of
cancer because usually cancer is a
[SPEAKER_01]: scenario of your own genome having a
metabolic defect going on in the sub
[SPEAKER_01]: population of the cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that metabolism is getting triggered
and it's usually because of an acidic or a
[SPEAKER_01]: different environment, a mutation has
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the things that seem to be having the
most potent effect on our cellular
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolism are the vegetables and plants
and foods that we eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we need to better
understand to really understand cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of like the intersection of
plant metabolites and cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of touches home for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a field that I think our myopic
focus at the FDA is constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: deteriorating because they have this
reductionist approach of looking at single
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds as opposed to synthetase of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're at a stage now where we have the
tools to look at synthetase.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't fit into their trials very
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need to rethink whether the trials
are the right way to do medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I happen to think they're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you can get a hell of a lot more
power out of a study with 100,000 to a
[SPEAKER_01]: million people connected via observational
trials on digital equipment like we do
[SPEAKER_01]: with peer-to-peer networks and 5,000 or
10,000 people in a trial that is a
[SPEAKER_01]: subsampling of statistics to the point
where you end up with Vioxx-like compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: that escape that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, and not to mention the way
that the clinical trial system is set up
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates such a high barrier to entry to
even try to get through that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it literally kills people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no one willing to look at the
seen and the unseen here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, OK, the fact that a drug takes
$500 million and 10 years to get through,
[SPEAKER_01]: has anyone done a survey on the number of
people that died waiting for that drug,
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing that it's available in Europe and
it's available in Australia?
[SPEAKER_01]: Other countries have deemed it safe,
but not here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those people don't have the money to
travel there to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they sit here, they wait, and they die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's people who study this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a large number of people every
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Independent Institute does a lot of
work on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're FDAreview.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worth reading because they go through
all of the scenarios where drugs that were
[SPEAKER_01]: approved in other countries, so they pass
other countries' criteria and eventually
[SPEAKER_01]: passed here, but three or four years
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they count the number of deaths that
occur because of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no one's responsible for this.
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't vote them in or out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they regulate now like 25
cents of every dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something that is I'm totally
terrified that it's going to come into the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis space and somehow make the same
mess of this space as it did the opiates.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, there's a lot of good
scientists that work there that have all
[SPEAKER_01]: the right intentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are trying to put genetics into
all the programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to build blockchains.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to track all the food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've got all the right vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think they don't recognize that
it's too big of a problem for one
[SPEAKER_01]: centralized organization to solve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's too prone to regulatory capture
and corruption.
[SPEAKER_01]: They shouldn't set up that honeypot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should somehow decentralize it and
have competing agencies that can perhaps
[SPEAKER_01]: invent different ways of regulating
because it's certainly an important
[SPEAKER_01]: feature of a marketplace to have
regulation, but not necessarily in the way
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's getting done today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I also find it kind of funny
that a lot of times drug approvals get so
[SPEAKER_00]: hung up on needing to prove a certain
level of safety, sometimes to kind of an
[SPEAKER_00]: absurd extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, right now, we're seeing this with
CBD right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the liver talk stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not acknowledging the nuance around
some of that research and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting is that the actual
efficacy of a lot of pharmaceuticals that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually make it through the process are
not that effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe for 20, 30% of the target
population, they may be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have terrible safety profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's, I don't know, it's a weird
dynamic that the safety profile of a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of these natural products that people want
to research and try to understand how they
[SPEAKER_00]: can be elevated out of the realm of sort
of this alternative medicine sphere and
[SPEAKER_00]: try to understand what they're actually
doing and how to actually legitimize them
[SPEAKER_00]: as medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very challenging, even though the
safety profiles of a lot of these things
[SPEAKER_00]: are pretty well understood by this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the other big hang up they've
got is there is this gold standard,
[SPEAKER_01]: almost religious consensus, as you
mentioned before, on double blind placebo
[SPEAKER_01]: control trials being the only path to
ensuring safety of medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's being fundamentally
challenged by, if you look at the work on
[SPEAKER_01]: what governs the placebo effect,
it starts pointing back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's actually papers out there
on the endocannabinoids being involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: the placebo effect in analgesia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you put cannabinoid through
double blind placebo control trial?
Exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The placebo effect we think is people's
reactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're ECS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their reduction in anxiety is caused
probably by anandamide or something that
[SPEAKER_01]: when they take something, they're taking
control of their problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're taking action and that action
gives them confidence and that boosts
[SPEAKER_01]: their anandamide levels maybe.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the very pathway that you're trying
to interact with is what's involved in the
[SPEAKER_01]: placebo process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's just all going to create
noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we should be looking at very large
observational studies that we can enable
[SPEAKER_01]: now with these digital tools that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably going to give us a far
faster and more, I mean, back up and just
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the vape crisis, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a COX-2 inhibitor, CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are vaping CBD,
sometimes THC, and they both have
[SPEAKER_01]: analgesic effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I throw them into that category of
Advil and ibuprofen replacements,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe even Tylenol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tylenol is in fact an endocannabinoid
magnetic, which makes AM 404 with a shitty
[SPEAKER_01]: liver.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are vaping these things probably
because they like getting a little relief
[SPEAKER_01]: from some pain and some fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: That took the field probably 10 months to
resolve, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because everyone was sharing information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rumor came out of this company is making
crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's got bad vitamin acetate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideas are flying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with all of the networking we have,
there's a crisis that was affecting maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: a thousand to two thousand people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nine million vape pens sold a
month, 90 million, maybe 100 million over
[SPEAKER_01]: the course of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we only had an incident rate of one in
45,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's one piece of arithmetic that's
important for how frequently we sample for
[SPEAKER_01]: these contaminants in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not sampling nearly deep enough to
find a frequency below.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if we were testing for vitamin A
acetate, I'd argue we still would have
[SPEAKER_01]: missed it because the frequency of this
creating a problem is so low that you need
[SPEAKER_01]: to up the sampling rate you do in the
industry to find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that being said, can roll it back to
Vioxx, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Vioxx went through, probably killed 50,000
people and it took the FDA five years to
[SPEAKER_01]: finally admit they were wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because admitting they're wrong
after they were paid a lot of money by the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical industry to put that drug
through is harder to reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just it's more it's more crow to eat
than you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many people don't realize the FDA
right now is governed by the Bidoufa Act
[SPEAKER_01]: in 1992, which means about half to two
thirds of the revenue going into the FDA
[SPEAKER_01]: comes directly from the companies that
they regulate.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a way of the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a euphemism for bribery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Effectively, how can that agency with a
straight face claim that they are out for
[SPEAKER_01]: the consumer when they're on the payroll
of the people they're regulating?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to lead to really bad
decision making, even if it has the right
[SPEAKER_01]: intentions, that the incentives aren't
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they make a mistake, they're going to
get a bigger budget.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so this is this to me is like we
don't need this near cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis hasn't killed anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the FDA?
[SPEAKER_01]: What they've already done to cannabis,
if you just look at Epidiolex,
[SPEAKER_01]: has made it 30 times more expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Made it an isolate, put in the strawberry
flavoring that is registered as a
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide by the EPA and then added in
like superlose, which like gives people
[SPEAKER_01]: smoother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made it into a worse drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And GW has to kind of unfortunately put up
with this.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And GW is filled with people who know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the the extracts are more effective,
but they can't get something that
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they got Sativex through,
but they haven't gotten it through our
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Ethan Rousseau and I talked about
this in our interview and a little bit off
[SPEAKER_00]: interview, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the fact that they're
struggling so much with Sativex and that
[SPEAKER_00]: if Sativex does make it through the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: system, it's it might end up being a very
different pharmaceutical altogether than
[SPEAKER_00]: what you would find in the UK or or in
Spain or things in Canada, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've been following GW for pretty
much since I knew about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: knew about them in, I don't know,
long, long time ago in the early 2000s or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've followed the work of
several of the different scientists that
[SPEAKER_00]: have come and gone, that have that have
worked with GW.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it seems like as far as I can
tell, they understand the the best way to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually apply these medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the research they've done is
actually highlighted, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're having to play the same
regulatory games as anyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's it's so common,
especially in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: for people to bash anybody that is
perceived as, you know, a dastardly
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, hey, they write the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got to play by them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't blame you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they write the rules when
they're really big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think GW set that scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something I try to remind
people of, you know, is one they were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this work in other countries
initially where they were able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: things that they can't really do here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the products, I mean,
Sativex in particularly is actually a very
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive product.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think about it, it's not I think
there's a misconception that it's isolated
[SPEAKER_00]: to DHC and CBD, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's a standardized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a standardized extract.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, Ethan and I were talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do actually a really good job
measuring.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're measuring things that the labs are
measuring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're measuring sterols,
a host of these other compounds that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: not seeing in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have with hands down the best
manufacturing process for this that there
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't think one bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're getting asked to make you're
getting asked to point that amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific engine they have in the wrong
direction.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but tell us what's the active.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all active.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I would love to see in
the United States some process for getting
[SPEAKER_00]: herbal medicines approved as, you know,
legitimate standardized medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, now we have like what are
they called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like medical foods that you can get
prescriptions for that often are usually
[SPEAKER_00]: just imported from other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the example I always use is like
standardized ginkgo biloba extract that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get a prescription for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has standardized amounts of,
you know, certain chemical constituents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it didn't go through the you know,
it wasn't produced in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it it you know, it's an interesting
process to even get it to be allowed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: used the way it is in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just one of those things that I
think a lot of people don't realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: That there are alternative ways of
determining what is a medicine and how to
[SPEAKER_00]: give people access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of countries have do have some
pretty decent ways of handling herbal
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't a complicated problem to
figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a bureaucratic and political
problem to figure out in this country is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, I think it's that same
process of, you know, politics and
[SPEAKER_01]: bureaucracy that are forcing these really
odd distinctions between medicine and
[SPEAKER_01]: food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the concept of like recreational
versus medicinal is to me is like mind
[SPEAKER_01]: boggling that people don't recognize that
if you do the recreation, you won't need
[SPEAKER_01]: the medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're one and the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just when you get into a chronic
state of disequilibrium, you might call it
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that distinction is purely political.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes I don't know where it comes
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes from some hatred of people
getting high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet they happily to have you know,
Bud Light commercials all over the Super
[SPEAKER_01]: Bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a yeah, it's a strange, strange state
of affairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting, interesting time and place in
history that we find ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it evolves in a in a more
favorable direction in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I now we've already gone over two
hours, so I'm beyond ecstatic that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been willing to talk to me for this long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give you a final platform here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let people know how to learn more about
medicinal genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, one thing we didn't even talk about,
but is Canapedia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where people can actually explore some
of the genetic data and even some chemo
[SPEAKER_00]: type data that medicinal genomics and
other groups have been bringing together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just kind of give you a platform
here to let any any of our listeners know
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that we haven't covered and where
they can find out more about your work and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so medicinal genomics, we make in
addition to doing sequencing for for folks
[SPEAKER_01]: in the industry, we make a lot of tests to
look for different genetics in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So THC and CBD and X, Y testing,
we make assays for testing those markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have markers that look for fusarium and
powdery mildew and basically all the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes that might harm the plant and
also all the regulated microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we sell a lot a lot of quantitative PCR
kits into the into many of the labs that
[SPEAKER_01]: measure aspergillus and seminal and E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli and those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that you can find in medicinal
genomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sequencing work, there's a lot of it
put public on a site called Canapedia.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't know that we run
that site because of the way it looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's that's a medicinal genomic site
for hosting a lot of this sequencing data.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's serving some purposes for for
research and also for IP.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a blockchain component of that
that will etch the timestamps that your
[SPEAKER_01]: data is generated into a ledger that we
can't control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we ever become evil on you,
you still have your data recorded
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all managed at the Canapedia
site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then thirdly, we do run a scientific
conference every year called CanMed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're interested in more of these
topics, there'll be many people presenting
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
