[SPEAKER_00]: He's asking what's the major differences
between the Northern Lights cuts you hold
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're all named with those
numerics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the significance of that and what
does it mean to you and how you use them?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would really need the guys here that
originally bred the Northern Lights
[SPEAKER_01]: strains to answer all these questions,
but from what I've read and understand and
[SPEAKER_01]: what I've heard through the cannabis
culture is Northern Lights number one is
[SPEAKER_01]: the pure form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, three were crossed to Indica's.
[SPEAKER_01]: NL five, six, seven, eight, nine were
crossed to Sativa's to hybridize.
[SPEAKER_01]: NL five has the best bag peel and the best
marketable bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: NL two has the strongest, most Indica,
a lot of juniper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just real kush smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern Lights number one is the backbone
of all the other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can smell it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the building block.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what Neville used.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he had a clone and he wanted to
recreate that clone, that was the male he
[SPEAKER_01]: used.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he wanted to make a pure hash plant
off the hash plant cutting, he back
[SPEAKER_01]: crossed off of the Northern Lights number
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: When he wanted to bring Big Bud to the
market and he just had the Big Bud clone,
[SPEAKER_01]: he back crossed off of Northern Lights
number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real building block.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as it by itself, it's great smoke
but it doesn't have the bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
