[SPEAKER_00]: What the heck is a PhD doing in the
cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's actually a lot more of us
than you'd think.
[SPEAKER_00]: My journey was kind of an accidental one
on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd actually left chemistry for a bit and
I was an MRI tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make a lot more money as an MRI tech
than you do as an adjunct lecturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I always missed chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always committed to medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really, really, really liked the
smell of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have some on, oh yeah,
a little aromatherapy on my fingers there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I decided to take a plunge and just
go out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Nate Ferguson over there gave me a
chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Said, you know, we're going to bring this
guy on board and see what he can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been an adventure since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead and get started with the talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the slides?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like I have the slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until very recently, most of you,
if you knew about me, knew me as Dr. Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: Hughes, a little bitty Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of my medical connection,
I could not reveal my real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though Kaiser will actually prescribe
cannabis to dying patients, they won't let
[SPEAKER_00]: MRI techs who use cannabis be employed
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Wyeth Calloway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, we're going to talk about a
study in the expansion of production
[SPEAKER_00]: through technical improvements and
innovations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jetty's changed a lot since I first
walked in the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just been me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to emphasize that entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been kind of like, let's make the
nerd analogy to the Starship Enterprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty much like Spock.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say things like, this isn't a
logical course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am 100% certain this will fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's my clicker?
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's Jetty.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some pictures of Jetty,
who we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right up there is our nice reception
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is my messy R&D corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually a column for column
chromatography.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to run kilo scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over here is what used to be the
rotovap area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll talk more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least is the bee who
greeted me on my first day at Jetty,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I didn't even know what honey oil
meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very ironic.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what bubble hash was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been making bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me grab this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started in 2013 and were founded by a
group of surfers in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Nate Ferguson, Matt Lee, Rob Ferguson,
and Ron Gershoni.
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: We were about $100,000 in revenue that
first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, we've roughly doubled more or
less every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a distillates and concentrate
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of our trademarks is up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the top swatter clear pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trademark is actually the sandalwood
tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sandalwood is very renewable in terms
of a tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most places have metal or plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of our signature Jetty
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing is the Dablicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dablicator is a way of dabbing that
allows you to control a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: than sticking a scoop into a little jar
and then just dabbing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got a little clicking mechanism,
and you can more or less get a decent
[SPEAKER_00]: dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I want to talk about with
Jetty, who are we?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Shelter Project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Shelter Project is a compassionate
care program started in 2014 by our own
[SPEAKER_00]: Lindsay Friedman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at one point, we had 1,000 patients
that we were giving formulated or
[SPEAKER_00]: unformulated cannabis medicine to for
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave her over $1 million in free
merchandise, free product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, SB64 decided that they
would impose a tax on donated goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really affected compassionate
care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably some of you out there actually
know about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lindsay's first efforts, and everybody
his first efforts actually failed on Jerry
[SPEAKER_00]: Brown's desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: He vetoed the first compassionate care
bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've got SB34 in the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So call your congressman, congressperson,
and tell them you support SB34,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's going to make things more
rational.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to be able to have to pay
taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a lot more easy to enroll
people in the program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if anybody's a fan of
Jetty, but did you know we used to make
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were from 2016, 2017,
called Jetty Mind Tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cannabis infused toffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have no idea to this day how they
got the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps Obi-Wan here could tell you these
are not the droids you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jetty and Mind Tricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually do know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what am I going to talk about today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis distillate production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is sort of a summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm preaching to the choir
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably absolutely everybody in the room
knows everything about this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nonetheless, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first step is biomass preparation,
then we have extraction, winterization,
[SPEAKER_00]: filtration, then concentration,
decarboxylation, which a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: just call decarb, but it's also a
devolatilization process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have final distillation of the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as a side note, we have actually
cannabis essential oil production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't really necessary to the
distillate market because there exist all
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of flavor elements that are out
there, including fake plant-derived
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profiles, which will have the name
of a cannabis chemovar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all probably know about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are a few examples of my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the top left there is God Only Knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's a reclaim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not super proud of that color.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next is our D8 Reserve, Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty high ratio there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last is the WaterClear Delta
line in the corner there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who were we before I came to JETI?
[SPEAKER_00]: We were Prop 215 compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were using CO2 supercritical fluid
extraction and ethanol extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: capabilities at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the winterization slash precipitation,
we had a cold room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to do carbon scrubbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did vacuum filtration with large
fritted funnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've all seen these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buechner funnels, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of iteration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one small rotavap at first for the
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just needed a light winterization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've heard the story about 1,000
monkeys, 1,000 typewriters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can write the perfect novel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the early days of cannabis,
what I've seen and been told is basically
[SPEAKER_00]: if you had a machine and it was working,
you just bought five more of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we were doing a manual
decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't devolatilizing at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a two-inch pope.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a white film system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to do two passes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one to remove the quote unquote terp
fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about that a little more later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had done some research on short
path distillation but never used in
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And initially short path was how I learned
to do what all of you pretty much knew how
[SPEAKER_00]: to do before cannabis was a twinkle in my
eye or whatever how you put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had an old legacy short path,
a two liter and a five liter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were doing small scale production of
cannabis essential oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I arrived at Jetty,
we were doing cannabis essential oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want to make that clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I walked in, I didn't have
these plant-derived profiles to smell as
[SPEAKER_00]: an example of what cannabis tasted like in
a vape pen I had the real McCoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so after I tried that, it was revealed
to me there were plant profiles and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried that and I was like,
oh, yuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yuck, this won't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want to knock it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the early days of our cannabis
essential oil production, we had similar
[SPEAKER_00]: off flavors in every batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were using a technique that I'll get
into in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a problem in Denmark there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things about Jetty that I'm
going to emphasize in this talk is we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't stand still.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always critique what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always try to be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't look at the competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at what we are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these guys who founded Jetty,
they love the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the way the plant smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love vaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we put so much love in our products
that we actually talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll actually sit and talk about
intentionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something before I met my
lovely wife that I really never heard
[SPEAKER_00]: about, intentionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my intention to get to my molecule
the quickest that I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this whole concept of intentionality,
it sort of brought me to this community
[SPEAKER_00]: and this whole idea of plant-based
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So enough asides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to the next slide here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are we now?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're Prop 64 compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrocarbon is our main method of
extraction with dewaxing capabilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have precision grinding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of just the cold room,
we also have a minus 60 cryo freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're no longer doing any scrubbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have large capacity stainless steel
filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only need large rotavaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a VTA, which is a very nice
continuous white film system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it in two passes, just like the
Pope at a lot higher capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In February, we acquired an HP1,
HP2 hot condensing short path and
[SPEAKER_00]: distillation device, and it's amazing,
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if anyone's used this or seen
this on At Breaking Dab's website,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, thank God, it's my R&D piece,
and I got to retire the old 5-liter Summit
[SPEAKER_00]: bastard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about how fast that one was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You always gotta love the first thing you
trained on, but this thing's the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Cadillac now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with work, we devised scalable
production of cannabis essential oils,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we eliminated the off flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may see me stop and take a sniff of
these if I'm feeling a little woozy,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a gelato from Grizzly Peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the farm that made the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later, we can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just greater in aroma therapy
in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I love about my job is I
get to walk into a place where I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: fridge full of cannabis-derived terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter my mood, there's something
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we just started talking about
Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one thing we gotta really talk
about in Prop 64, which is probably my
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest contribution to Jetty,
I would say, in the machines department,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is analytical testing,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two types of analytical testing
that I've broadly categorized in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry, and one's accuracy,
so cannabinoid potency, and also terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanna put terpenes on your label in
California, you gotta have them tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all know this within, I believe it's
10% of the printed value on your package,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you fail compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, as you all know, a very bad
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Safety as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have on the right, it's not the 62,
it's the 58 pesticides that can be tested
[SPEAKER_00]: by HPLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 62, and of these, there's category
two and category one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody know the difference between
category one and category two?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you even see category one on your data,
you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fails compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly, this is because these pesticides
that have been used in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry before are not designated as safe
pesticides for the state of California to
[SPEAKER_00]: be used in food production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where that came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So below is a little nice 97.13% total
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of our nice oils there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an idea of sort of the potency
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So along with safety, we have residual
solvents, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so back in the day, and I'll talk
about this, there was sort of a different
[SPEAKER_00]: category for residuals, but now they
compromise solvents that are deleterious
[SPEAKER_00]: to human health, or, I don't know if
that's the right word, are bad for humans
[SPEAKER_00]: to inhale, okay, or eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are toxins produced by
microorganisms that are dangerous to human
[SPEAKER_00]: health.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really don't have a problem with these
in distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, heavy metals,
cat three, you have on the next slide,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got arsenic, ACLM, ACLME.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little MRI thing, the ACL,
people tear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to keep those to parts per
billion levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why do I talk about this about JETI?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're ahead of the curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even before I got there, before they were
even asked to do this, JETI was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: potency and pesticide testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the records go all the way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of fun to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steep Hill was the only game in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we used.
[SPEAKER_00]: In July 2016, started with CW.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did terpene testing and also residual
solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the thing about residual
solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was less than 5000 parts per million of
flammable solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, flammable solvents, which is funny
because ethanol is really flammable too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although it's not great to inhale,
it's not going to kill you or give you
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer like chloroform, dichloromethane,
dichloroethane, some of these really
[SPEAKER_00]: gnarly chlorinated solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, by the grace of the chemists
who worked with the BCC whatnot,
[SPEAKER_00]: we got a new list of residual solvents
that include the chlorinated solvents and
[SPEAKER_00]: also benzene, xylenes, things like that,
although those are flammable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's talk about the heavy metals
because I don't think the industry was
[SPEAKER_00]: ready for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you guys ready for Cat 3?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cat 3 hit everybody like a kick in the
pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is, is the equipment that the
labs needed to study Cat 3 is inductive
[SPEAKER_00]: coupled plasma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an expensive technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old technology, atomic absorption,
wasn't quantitative enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, who even had an ICP?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who even had the working capital to spend
150 grand, 200 grand and figure it out and
[SPEAKER_00]: have a chemist figure it out how to do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys, as you know, these guys and
gals in the testing labs, they're backed
[SPEAKER_00]: up, you know, a week sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you've got to pull somebody off to get
that ICP running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when I came to Jetty, we have all
these things that are mandated and we've
[SPEAKER_00]: got to figure out what is going to be our
response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the two pictures on the right,
the top one that looks like something out
[SPEAKER_00]: of Star Wars is a triple quad HPLC mass
spec, mass spec and it's used for those 58
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other four I didn't mention,
you need a gas chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the bottom there is the HPLC UV viz
that I would have been able to afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you just dial it in,
it pumps, it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in house analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that was the first thing I was asked
to evaluate and we went around and we
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at stuff and the HPLC UV viz was
the standard for potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were, you know, interested in that
but it was about 40 or 50 grand to get in
[SPEAKER_00]: that and don't know if you know this,
HPLC is a liquid chromatography technique
[SPEAKER_00]: so now we've got to have organic solvents
and we've got to have a place to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: organic solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have fume hoods at the time so
we decided against that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next option, triple quad and a GCMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, there's four pesticides you
can't do with the triple quad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that was about 300k used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, as you heard earlier, I'm not an
analytical chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an organic chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a jack of all trades.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my Instagram name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I told the guys,
you know, if we're going to go for this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, HPLC triple quad, I'm going to
need some training.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm going to need some training
and it's going to be a lot of my time on
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing and I want a service plan,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the numbers started rising and we just
kind of decided, you know, that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: really what we need to do for just one
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, in there at the bottom, I'll mention
it was the ICP.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of put that there as a joke because
it really can't do anything else for us
[SPEAKER_00]: but heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the middle thing is what we settled
on, the GCFID because it can do potency of
[SPEAKER_00]: the neutral cannabinoids, THC,
and then to do THCA and all the other acid
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, you have to do something
called derivatization, but I believe there
[SPEAKER_00]: still is to this day a testing lab in
California that uses GC to do its
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticide testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, GCMS, you can take a GCFID,
it's flame ionization detector,
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporized particles hit, they hit a flame
and they're counted by basically a
[SPEAKER_00]: detector, counts ionized particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really good at measuring small
electrical signals and so that's how that
[SPEAKER_00]: works, forms a peak every time a substance
comes out of the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go into this a little bit more at
the end if people really want to go into
[SPEAKER_00]: these techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we could add residual solvents and we
could add terpene profiles just by
[SPEAKER_00]: slapping something on the end of the
machine, it was only about $10,000,
[SPEAKER_00]: $15,000, and I would probably have begged
for a service plan, but it's better than
[SPEAKER_00]: the $300,000, $400,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the best return on investment,
remember what I said, Jetty, we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: about running lean, we're all about
intentionality, and so I would have loved
[SPEAKER_00]: to have all those instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely loved to have my own lab like
that and have Jetty pay for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We scientists, we love to have toys,
y'all, and we love to have y'all pay for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we decided on was a GC flame
ionization detector.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a quick potency method for oil
from ResTech and in four minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: four minutes, I had my answer,
and in fact in two and a half minutes I
[SPEAKER_00]: had my answer, because pretty much all the
cannabinoids that would elute were done
[SPEAKER_00]: after two and a half minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if anybody knows about thin
layer chromatography, the old school
[SPEAKER_00]: method, you have these little plates,
we use them to monitor reactions and
[SPEAKER_00]: purity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they take about two and a half
minutes to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: GC, I can actually get percentages and
ratios, and man, I'm telling you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost never ran TLC again, but GC went
down for a little bit, so we had to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so I really liked it because
now we had a machine that could do really
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly potency testing, we could monitor
our distillations, we could monitor
[SPEAKER_00]: incoming material, just sort of things
that everybody has to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just insane to me that people were
producing distillates with all these
[SPEAKER_00]: procedures and didn't have their own
analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man, looks good, brah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yellow, yeah, look at that,
it's good, brah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, little did I know, I mean,
you can actually do a lot with a visual
[SPEAKER_00]: inspection, and chemists have been,
for hundreds of years have been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but I come from a fancy little
graduate school, and we have all our
[SPEAKER_00]: machines that y'all paid for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, useful reactions involving basic
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody now is onto these minor
cannabinoids, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: THCV, CBN, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: D8, THC acid, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Acetate, THC hemisuccinate, hexahydro THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wanna go into the lab and make these
things, I can actually watch my reactions
[SPEAKER_00]: proceed and decide that if I have my head
up my butt, or I actually found something
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted that capability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were also be able to do terpene
profiles, it's easy to operate,
[SPEAKER_00]: no solvent, and then of course the upgrade
that I talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, GC succeeds where HPLC fails.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, this is an interesting story
that I wanna kinda tie in a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: later, we're gonna come back to it at the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably wanna bite into QC a little bit
to talk about this, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're here to talk about production and
innovations, and this is a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna go ahead and skip past
that, skip past the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna talk about, go back into
my outline, biomass is the first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found biomass preparation necessary
for CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows that, you can't just take
a mallet and start jamming the CO2 thing
[SPEAKER_00]: full of biomass, it's not efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anyone knows who Marcus Rogan is,
at the time I met him, he was at Outco,
[SPEAKER_00]: he actually optimized particle size and a
number of other concerns with CO2 and his
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 oil, it looked amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, back to when I, back off my
tangent, we used ninja blenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you know, I would say Nate did.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went out, they told me they'd go up
to Humboldt County with a bunch of ninja
[SPEAKER_00]: blenders, and they would hack that crap
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's going, what, blenders?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you, you know, and you know what the
really funny thing, and this is what dials
[SPEAKER_00]: back to Marcus Rogan, is guess what grind
is best for cannabis terpenes and CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: The frickin' ninja blender.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ninja blender.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a tidbit for Marcus's talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, when we moved to ethanol,
we found that grinding was unnecessary,
[SPEAKER_00]: this was the early days, and we were
getting a lot of chlorophyll from our
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we really needed no advancement
in grinding technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 are the, when we got into
hydrocarbons, we had to ditch that ninja.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neo Farms told us, ditch that ninja.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does this stuff really fast,
you know, and it beats the ninja blender,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it kind of looks like, it looks like a
snow-making machine to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And much like a snow-making machine,
it loved to blow keef all over the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you have probably used this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had no dust control, and I would not
go near that room when that thing was
[SPEAKER_00]: running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just allergies like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had no control of particle size,
we had no speed control, and there was,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, a heck of a loss of
mechanical material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that same conference where I met
Marcus Rogan, he introduced me to a
[SPEAKER_00]: company called, I believe it's called
Fritch, okay, that make these Cadillac
[SPEAKER_00]: hammer mill grinders, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like it's amazingly new tech,
it's just kind of new to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those things, being a Cadillac,
are a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did our usual jetty research,
and we kind of got in the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Spock was asked what he thought about
the grinding, and I mentioned that I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: seen this hammer mill tech, and then our
lab manager, Kurt, went out and he just
[SPEAKER_00]: scoured the earth for an affordable
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how we got it to the hammer mill
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's get to the picture of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our Keef room, and this is our
fancy grinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have positional blades,
we have air assist if we need it,
[SPEAKER_00]: because Keef gets sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got sieve screens, we can control
particle size, and boy howdy, look at
[SPEAKER_00]: those numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: 45 minutes before to process, not
precision process, 50 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that hammer mill running, 10 pounds in
50 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I mean, 50 pounds in 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a lot of stuff backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this really kicked it up a notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extraction, okay, this is kind of the big
thing that I really don't feel like I need
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk to about a ton, because everybody
is super passionate about the way they do
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at Jetty, we do a lot of stuff by
trial and error, small scale, and at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, there was just some disadvantages to
these other techniques that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main message here is throughput and
regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 couldn't do the throughput we needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ethanol, while it was good,
if we wanted to scale it up, which we did,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were growing, we had to change our
chemical manufacturing status,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we needed more than 1,000 gallons
in process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we had was we had one of these
little waters guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a pretty big waters guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a single tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got the Delta CUP,
and that's what we used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were cranking out oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last thing I'd like to say about the
ethanol issue is filtration and
[SPEAKER_00]: bottlenecks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows solvent recovery is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I don't know about the cryo
technique, but when we were doing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the particle size, this stuff would
coagulate like crazy, these fats and
[SPEAKER_00]: waxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had to, it was a bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you'd be scraping this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried all kinds of different
iterations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was nice when we finally got to
hydrocarbon, and we were able to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: much more easy to deal with process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the decision to do hydrocarbon summer
2017 to 2019 was a decision driven by
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got our Type 7 license, and so we're
ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before we went a little crazy,
we got ourselves a little busy bee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure we even owned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just started doing what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started doing experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, like I said, it's what we found
that the processing, post-processing went
[SPEAKER_00]: to almost nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's all kinds of
post-processing that everybody knows about
[SPEAKER_00]: here, and I'm not gonna belabor the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all on future 4200, and that's where
I learned it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for us, speed, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: The more you can do with the less labor is
more efficient, you're faster to market,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, that's really important to
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided that we would go with
hydrocarbon deliberately, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first got into this, I was like,
whoa, hydrocarbon's really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was introduced to the process,
and I realized the only thing left in
[SPEAKER_00]: these extracts is ethanol from
winterization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anybody who winterizes or uses ethanol
is gonna potentially have ethanol in their
[SPEAKER_00]: final material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that faded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got Betsy up there in the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who named her, but she's a
workhorse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did this because at the time,
ethanol could only do distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to branch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys have been doing this since
2013, nanodendispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew about the variety of products that
were out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diamond technology was just starting
to come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cookies, has anyone ever seen
cookies?
[SPEAKER_00]: These little cookie things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we brought out a guy named Tran,
and he is a butane artiste.
[SPEAKER_00]: He loves making pictures and stuff with
butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't do like I did and assume they're
nilla wafers in the break room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God the metabolism of THCA,
right, is very, very slow in your body,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not decarbed yet, or I would not
be here talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not nilla wafers, but they are
delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be releasing them fairly soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last picture over here is our C1D1
room, shot from above.
[SPEAKER_00]: The C1D1 room, and I guess I should talk
about this a little bit, with Jetty.
[SPEAKER_00]: We literally doubled in size when we were
getting our hydrocarbon and our intake
[SPEAKER_00]: apparatus ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we knew hydrocarbon was gonna kick
ass and do a lot of trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we acquired, there was a whole nother
company here when I started, we acquired
[SPEAKER_00]: that side, and we were able to expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually have two C1D1 rooms,
and one of them we use for pesticides and
[SPEAKER_00]: filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quickly let's talk about winterization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not gonna belabor the point, used to use a
walk-in freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got this sweet ass cryo freezer,
minus 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: 48 hours goes down to four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the hydrocarbon precipitates,
the fats and waxes, it's a lot easier to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here's like I said, the thousand
monkeys or the thousand typewriters
[SPEAKER_00]: mentality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these 15 mil Buechner funnels are
really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can take that amount of activated
carbon, which we needed, and you needed
[SPEAKER_00]: about 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it looked like an organ, so it was
pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you believe that, I have a bridge
to sell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had much larger ones, 2,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here is what we ended up buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stainless steel filter or skid table,
or stainless steel, stainless steel filter
[SPEAKER_00]: table with basically on a skid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually the idea is, you know,
as everyone's done and Heisenberg's done,
[SPEAKER_00]: you basically, you wanna go to
manufacturing that's simply never sees any
[SPEAKER_00]: buckets or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all in line, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this piece of equipment will eventually
be able to integrate into this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the great thing about this is we went
from 40 kilograms a day, or I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: six kilograms a day, with that nasty goopy
stuff to 45 kilograms a day, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: still under capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if anybody needs to filter in the Bay
Area, I'm sure we can total process,
[SPEAKER_00]: Nate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll total process your filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did this with half the labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody wants to know, it's an infinity
manufacturing concepts, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentration, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm accused of not having a lot of
concentration sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But concentration simply means a lot to
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started out with the 2015 with the
two liter, and then 2016 when we moved to
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol, as you guys, as you all know,
the capacity that you need to do solvent
[SPEAKER_00]: removal is just crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 2017 to 2019, when we moved to
hydrocarbons, we were able to drop back to
[SPEAKER_00]: 220 liters, but we also needed five two
liter rotovaps that we already had to do
[SPEAKER_00]: the final processing to get it ready for
the decarb, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that workflow was based on the
decarb workflow, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: April 2019 is when we initiated the new
decarb, which is what I'll talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: next.
[SPEAKER_00]: We retired the little rotovap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing an average of four liters
per hour of solvent removal, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm looking at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to ramble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's try to pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2016, 2019 were the dank ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about atmospheric decarb.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a picture of how VTA told us how
to decarb.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said put it on a hot plate and stir
it for eight hours, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's fine though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually works for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works really well, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just kind of gives off a lot of
volatiles of a lot of dank, but it does
[SPEAKER_00]: work really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to do it a little bit more
efficiently because the reason it's on
[SPEAKER_00]: there for eight hours, and we knew this,
is when you're doing manual decarb,
[SPEAKER_00]: it only took about an hour for the bubbles
to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why the heck are we doing this for eight
hours?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's those volatiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just let me kind of divide up
cannabis, if I will, just as a broad
[SPEAKER_00]: category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have basically we're going to have
an insoluble amount of stuff that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to remove in winterization,
or we're not going to extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the first set of volatiles,
cannabis drive, terpene, essential oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next half are what I call the
volatiles, and those are all the way up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the boiling point of the cannabinoids,
what we really want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then afterwards you have what everyone
calls, I think, retendates, the goop,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to get rid of those volatiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to get rid of those volatiles
above the cannabis-derived essential oils,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did do quote-unquote terp runs,
so some of the higher volatiles right
[SPEAKER_00]: before the distillation point of the
cannabinoids, okay, we could strip those
[SPEAKER_00]: out, but the lower volatiles would really
mess up the white film.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to get rid of them, but being a
chemist and having been cut my teeth on
[SPEAKER_00]: short path distillation, I decided that we
could do this under Vacuo, and I know
[SPEAKER_00]: people were doing this way before we were,
but as jetty goes, I had to prove concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't just walk in and be like,
hey, y'all, this is illogical.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just illogical.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I had to show them it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to show them it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me about on and off three or four
months messing around with systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I finally got a system that
retired our road of apps and made a
[SPEAKER_00]: 24-hour process into eight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, the delicious tangy
smell was gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so distillation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the large, largest capital
investments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, I didn't even get to the dank ages,
so this is what I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so distillation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The largest capital investment,
decision time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided to go with white film instead
of short path because basically it was
[SPEAKER_00]: just easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short path takes skill, and I learned no
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most I ever learned about the skill it
took was from this man breaking dabs over
[SPEAKER_00]: there because I really thought I had
gotten short path.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd made this beautiful water clear oil,
and I thought, man, I got this down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do one liter in seven hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to go with the pope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produces actually a pretty nice oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do two passes, or you have to do
two passes, and the picture over there is
[SPEAKER_00]: an example of... That's probably a
six-inch pope, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the distillate comes out on one side,
the retente on the other, and you do your
[SPEAKER_00]: two passes or its chirps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then we decided to add another
pope, and we added the four-inch pope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although we were able to load more,
and this is kind of the funny
[SPEAKER_00]: contradiction, there was no change in
speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have a continuous white film
distillation system, and so we had to have
[SPEAKER_00]: operators load it, unload it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went to one of the really famous
consulting firms to get an auto feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in those days, I want to say the
tech wasn't ideal, and unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dream of running the thing overnight
and continuous extraction failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when we started looking at these
continuous extraction white film.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to say that I guessed
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got to put this out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet on the wrong pony, and they
overrided me, and I'm glad they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided to go with the VTA instead
of an American brand that I really loved,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've heard a lot of bad things about
since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, this is a really passionate
topic, so I'm not going to go into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got root sciences, German engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can do VKL with our VKL.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: 705RS.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's our model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do eight liters a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could probably push this and break it,
and that's what two passes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a better color distillate,
and we're consistently, I put in the 90s,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It honestly depends on the biomass,
too, that we're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at least always in the middle high
80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a beautiful jar of the oil
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our, I don't even know what it
is, lab manager, Jones, and that's our
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful root science right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You load the material here, and all under
vacuum, through the wiper, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: oil just comes out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty cool technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there's a lot better stuff,
but right now at Jetty, it's working for
[SPEAKER_00]: us, and we will make the investment in the
next step of technology when we go to that
[SPEAKER_00]: continuous flow through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Process that I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so right now we're kind of looking at
that and how we're gonna do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been sneaking a recorder and a
camera into Heisenberg manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just click, click, click, click.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Click, click, click, click.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so let's see where I'm at in this
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Travis, I gotta time check 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I do, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really wanted to talk about this a
lot, because this is one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my research instrument,
and this was the biggest breakthrough in
[SPEAKER_00]: short path, as far as I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called wide bore and hot
condensation, and he developed it in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really can't go through this slide as
much as I'd like, but you're gonna have it
[SPEAKER_00]: available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long story short, we bought one,
and there's me with the system,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that allowed us access to D9 water
clear, D8 THCV, and now I'm doing two
[SPEAKER_00]: liters in five hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that start to finish with decarboning
the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do a second pass in two to three
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this thing rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that takes down the resident time,
which is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really quickly, let's talk about
cannabis-derived terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my thing, and I want you to
call them CEOs, cannabis essential oils,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're more than just terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hundreds of terpenoid and
non-terpene compounds available in the
[SPEAKER_00]: volatile portion of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is nonanal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not non-anal, true heads out of the
gutter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a floral and orangey smell,
and it is in no way a terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an aldehyde, C9 unit, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, it's one of the highest
contributors to the odor of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take cannabis and put it in a
duffel bag for 68 hours, nonanal,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you sample the head space around it,
nonanal is actually one of the strongest
[SPEAKER_00]: scents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were training the dogs to do
karyophylline oxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so where were we at Jetty?
[SPEAKER_00]: We were doing steam still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steam still is what everybody's doing,
doing the R&D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we bought a big one, looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water goes in here, biomass in there,
heat the steam, comes on out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The steam cools and then is caught in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes will float on top,
the cannabis oil will float on top,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you can separate them,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing 100 pounds a day,
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I wanna show you really quickly the
difference between a profile and a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis-derived essential oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the grass, is what I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a profile of granddaddy perp,
and probably see about 20 peaks,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a cannabis essential oil of an OG
cush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my GC isn't even that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at alpha-pinene.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is on my method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can only sample boiling points around
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get a head space, I can go more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alpha-pinene, there's compounds in front
of it, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know roughly what these compounds
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that there's about 400 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody wants to finance me to
start getting some standards, then I would
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate it and we'll start figuring out
examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is exactly what this is, or we'll
farm it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so the next iteration, now that you
know what cannabis essential oils are and
[SPEAKER_00]: how complicated they are, is to do it with
a vacuum assist so you can do it at a
[SPEAKER_00]: lower temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this was better-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I smelled steam-still oil,
it really all smelled the same to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a burnt caramel and a grassy smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got to atmospheric,
and the smells were still there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I so hated them that I would just be
super picky about it and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is not acceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, I studied in France,
so I'm not trying to insult the French
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it also took days to dry, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to have a drying room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed turns brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gnarly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go in there without a mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes too long, and we still have those
off flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just went in the lab, and like I
said, we always try to do better and
[SPEAKER_00]: better and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through Mark 1, through Mark 4,
I finally was able to prove to Jetty,
[SPEAKER_00]: we love the essential oils we were making,
but we're only making them on small scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was able to prove to Jetty that we
could do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, we got to the Mark 4.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real kicker for us was when we did a
water-clear Skywalker OG pen, and Noah and
[SPEAKER_00]: Travis tasted this, among others,
and they were like, whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and we were like, whoa, whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I said about accidental medicine
is we actually gave these pens to all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the convention, and I had a patient or
person write me back and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the best D8 water-clear I have
ever had for pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wrote him back and I said,
it's not D8, it's D9.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, well, I don't know why
I've tried every D9 product I can get my
[SPEAKER_00]: hands on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were like, crap, must be the
turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not sure, but it's something we'd
like to study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so it's been implemented at Jetty.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're making cannabis-derived terpenes at
scale, and we can get broad profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can control the profile if we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drying room is gone, and the Mark 5 is
in development and probably is that high,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the year of cannabis essential
oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year and next year, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other methods, you can look at these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at them, didn't like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microwave, and then what I call Pangea
Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go ahead and go through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Pangea was ICMAG, so woot,
woot, open sourcing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, ICMAG, he or she, I never even
really met Pangea, designed a system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go on and you can Google it,
and it actually makes really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: water-clear, good-smelling cannabis
essential oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now here's the meat and potatoes of
the actual events.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a timeline from 2018 to May 2019,
and here shows what happened with the
[SPEAKER_00]: implementation of these technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we got to hydrocarbon,
we increased our production 50 to 100
[SPEAKER_00]: percent, and our capacity increased 100
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The VTA, the cryo-freezer, we got in
August, 8-18, got about the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'd like you to understand the numbers
are kind of melded together, but when you
[SPEAKER_00]: go from 48 hours to four days,
that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: The VTA, 470 percent increase in
production, capacity up 800 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Filter table, 13 percent increase in
production in January 19, and then we,
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me, the capacity increased 750
percent, and half the labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Category three screwed us over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it screwed everyone over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Output dropped, or input, so production
dropped, and that meant input also
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, significant events as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mark IV came online, and we were able
to access these essential oils in our
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if anyone's noticed a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 319, we instituted the SPD tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to do jetty reserve,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually has a 4 percent increase in
production of these specialty products,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if we maxed this thing out,
we could get 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: De-carb, de-volatilization, another 12
percent increase, and the thing about that
[SPEAKER_00]: is 24-hour process goes to eight hours,
and we no longer need this large de-carb
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We no longer need the road of apps.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of space to expand,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: R&D space, I wish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over this period, over this 15-month
period, we had a tenfold increase in the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of material we were able to bring
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the technology just fed exactly,
if I had the line here, I didn't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: put it, but it basically follows this
trend exactly, and now we're kind of in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a period where things are
kind of cuckoo, and we can talk about that
[SPEAKER_00]: later if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: In summary, I just wanted to say that,
you know, jetty's ahead of the curve
[SPEAKER_00]: usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do things intentionally, and if you get
anything out of my talk, it's something
[SPEAKER_00]: you already knew, that extraction and
distillation methods determine capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run lean.
[SPEAKER_00]: The largest acquisition that I made was a
35K short path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else I did, the turps,
the de-carb, everything else, that was
[SPEAKER_00]: done under $10,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GC was done around 20K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so our commitment to cannabis
essential oil has upped our game.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have great capabilities to,
I mean, this is just, it's just the tip of
[SPEAKER_00]: the iceberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just making them is the tip of the
iceberg, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have the tech to make them,
you can do so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and the last but not least,
sort of my deal, is that manufacturers
[SPEAKER_00]: with their own analytical, even if it's
just a GC FID, are more agile,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I have time to talk a little bit about
the story about the D10, why this made us
[SPEAKER_00]: more agile?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, let's go talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, does anybody here know what Delta 10
THC is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Delta 10 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, there's no chirality indicated
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just a general structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The double bond has moved from this
position to this position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different molecule, different shape,
different activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the top there is a molecule called D6A,
D10A, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another cousin of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about this story here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, while I'm clicking back, while we were
short pathing in these old five liters and
[SPEAKER_00]: two liters with long residency time,
we were getting what we noticed,
[SPEAKER_00]: low potency oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we couldn't figure out why,
because more passes is more better,
[SPEAKER_00]: the color got better.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we had a GC, you guys, so we could
actually see what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we were finding is that there
were these two peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's about the sophistication I had
with the GC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are these two peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we didn't have standards for those
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew they fell in the cannabinoid
range, so we weren't really super worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, this was lowering our
potency and we couldn't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is a product that we had,
one of our Orange and East products with
[SPEAKER_00]: these two peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can see, you've got CBD and then
there's question mark D10, D10A,
[SPEAKER_00]: 6A, THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that I can actually put those
question marks there is because I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: it was an isomer of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure if it was D10 or any of the
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, lucky for me, I met Noah Cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave me, he's like, here,
here's some D10.
What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, D10 might be your mystery peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we took that sample back to the lab
and it was 80% pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank God it was, because I got two
peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he just given me 100% pure Delta 10,
that would end this story, which gets a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so we had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went and we took some material that
had these peaks in it and we spiked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of D10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, we saw those peaks
rise, no new peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew that we had Delta 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was lowering our potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these people went even further.
[SPEAKER_00]: They figured out the potency loss was due
in part to high residency times and short
[SPEAKER_00]: pass, but also because there was Foss
check out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That crap they sprayed all over California
during the wildfires.
[SPEAKER_00]: And y'all probably got some cheap trim,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but when you process this trim,
you ended up getting an oil that had these
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown peaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the oil should look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't in everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had the GC and now I can monitor for
this peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know now when I'm doing crap short path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's D10 and now I know that I can
monitor all of our processes and see if
[SPEAKER_00]: D10 is happening and be like, hold the
presses everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how agile we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have to take in bad material.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's tests for ammonium phosphate and
ammonium sulfate, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before I want to end with this really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the D10 story gets a little more
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about that second peak?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone was talking about D10,
D10, D10, yada yada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like on futures 4,200.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, which diastereomer,
which enantiomer?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, molecules have shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though they have the same exact
chemical structure and bonds, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: something called handedness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're like mirror images,
some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't have the same shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually there are four potential
compounds for D10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought, well, you know, these,
that other peak is probably an enantiomer
[SPEAKER_00]: or diastereomer, diastereomer,
say enantiomer, diastereomers,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they have different boiling
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here are two diastereomers that
Mechelem et al made in 1984.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we just don't know where to look
for things because it's in the scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did a little bit of an experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read the literature and I found out that
there's a difference in boiling point or
[SPEAKER_00]: melting point by a hundred degrees on
these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a diastereomer, Wyeth,
because they would show it completely
[SPEAKER_00]: differently on the GC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've said, okay, we got one of these
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that next peak?
[SPEAKER_00]: Read the literature and you see that if
you heat them like crazy, they go to D6A,
[SPEAKER_00]: D10A.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not known in 1984, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had this paper and it was only until
we got an NMR of this material that we had
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of a clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I want to share with you this
experiment that actually clued me on as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had some low potency short path oil
and we have all this crap sitting around
[SPEAKER_00]: and I wanted to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought, Hey, let's just throw some
T41 clay in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's turn it all into D8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's watch what happens folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two hours into the reaction, Delta 9
actually does start going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a reduction in the D10 peak and
then this new peak starts rising up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm like, well, shoot, this sucks
because that's actually where the other
[SPEAKER_00]: shoulder lines up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So D8 and that are, they might be on top
of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three hours, the reaction is pretty much
finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: D9 is almost gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then look at the D10 ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost completely gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, yeah, got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: D10, you're out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got none.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a way to create Delta 8.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got Delta 8, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: From junk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are interested in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I sent it out for lab testing and
unfortunately, and this ties into the
[SPEAKER_00]: other story why GC was better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a result back that said it was D10
plus CBC because everybody knows that
[SPEAKER_00]: peak's BS.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no CBC in a lot of your low
potency oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Delta 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what folks, it ain't just Delta
10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's me going out on a limb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we learned, the result I got back,
D10 plus, you know, I got rid of it was
[SPEAKER_00]: 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go back and you look at,
shoot, you go back and look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: starting material, the ratio of these
suckers was about 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nothing changed there and I was really
bummed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of set this aside and then an
NMR came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the NMR, there was a small side
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was very pure stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Noah's stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the NMR, there are these two little
peaks out in a region where us chemists
[SPEAKER_00]: really know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And easy to see from everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually what it turns out is there
are these peaks right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they match up perfectly with Delta 6A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delta 10A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't proved shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't proved anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a, I've got a hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I need to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a pure standard of Delta 10A.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need an NMR of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a GC of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what a fine mess we've walked into
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause all these potency labs, they've got
HPLC UV viz as their, uh, their method to
[SPEAKER_00]: do potency on your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: D6A and D10A maybe 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sitting under the same peak in
their method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can't tell you the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can now say, oh, well it's D10A,
D6A, 10A and 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yada yada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And diastereomers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually when this product is formed,
it's actually not just one compound,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the right hand in the left hand of
D6A, 10A.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's racemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So boy, we've got cannabinoid soup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really hope that they can figure out
a way to redo their methods so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: see this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stop, stop telling everyone at CBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, well, I've got a GC method to
sell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Routestech does, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's, let's finish off with
acknowledgements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to brush over this really
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for your patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, I talk forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so basically, um, here's who made it
all possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if these guys, Nate, Rob, Ron and Matt
hadn't been here, I wouldn't be up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kurt didn't offer up there because like I
said, I'm Spock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Kurt is oftentimes Scotty and
Chekhov and Uhura and everything else,
[SPEAKER_00]: including the captain sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just does amazing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made my, I make my scientific
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look into stuff and then as a team,
we decide what we implement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just here's a production team.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Lindsay, of course, uh, shelter
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over here is everybody else that
I'd like to specifically mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to tie into our last proposal,
you guys, I wouldn't know anything about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis as quickly as I did without open
sourcing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to put this out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is another reveal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to put my new terpene
technology, not Jetty's technology,
[SPEAKER_00]: open source, as soon as I figure out how
to scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So y'all can play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally could not control enough
biomass in my dreams to make the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis drive terpenes that people are
going to want to use for medicine and
[SPEAKER_00]: recreation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my promise to you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, here's my email.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can follow us on IG at Jetty extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, uh, at Dr. Jack Hughes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a pleasure speaking to you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry I went over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it up for Dr. Wyatt Callaway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
