[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Rob Battiston with Inspire.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Sam Bergnar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a crop scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Nadia Saba, president of Dr.
Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's talk HVAC.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I got into this business about
eight years ago, just kind of stumbled
[SPEAKER_05]: into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then for the last three years,
I've been doing HVAC for agriculture,
[SPEAKER_05]: typically indoor, some greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been a race to understand the
plant science along with the HVAC
[SPEAKER_05]: challenges that go along with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You start by using commercial equipment
and stubbing your toe again and again and
[SPEAKER_05]: again and not really understanding why the
plants aren't yielding what they're
[SPEAKER_05]: supposed to and thinking maybe we
shouldn't be slapping a weed leaf sticker
[SPEAKER_05]: on the side of a commercial air
conditioning unit, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that led us to develop better
products, use tried and true
[SPEAKER_05]: dehumidification technologies,
and start really reading the papers and
[SPEAKER_05]: the latest understandings of how,
particularly cannabis, reacts to the nine
[SPEAKER_05]: cardinal principles.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you talk to Dr. Bugbee about this kind
of stuff, you find out what's in our
[SPEAKER_05]: control.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's wind speed, temperature,
humidity, and CO2 delivery, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: As HVAC people, we don't control the
lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: The growers gonna pick a light that they
think is gonna give them the best result.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't control the root condition
directly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we can do underfloor heating and
things like that in greenhouses and that
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the room temperature does affect the
root temperature, but yeah, those are the
[SPEAKER_05]: four cardinal things that we play with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would add air quality to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have control over the constituents
in the air, such as mold spores and pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things like that through air
filtration and purification.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in your presentation earlier,
you made a very good point.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are blasting money away in MERV 15
or better, like HEPA type filtration
[SPEAKER_05]: systems, which are complete overkill.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, MERV 13 is like, it's a very
readily available filter.
[SPEAKER_05]: The pressure drops are much better since
they became like a lead standard as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: The filter designs have gotten better.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's basically where we stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our units don't use any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anything HEPA and beyond is just kind
of overkill.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: We see these challenges all the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things I would say is that,
you know, we see this VPD term being
[SPEAKER_05]: thrown around constantly by growers who
are picking a number and they are using it
[SPEAKER_05]: as gospel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: It probably drives you nuts too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and there's a lot of adaptations the
plants have to deal with changes in VPD,
[SPEAKER_04]: just to model control.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have active uptake of water through
their root system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like if the humidity level is too high
during the night period, you'll see water
[SPEAKER_04]: actually coming out of the tips of the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called gutation.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll start to just build up a ton of
pressure inside themselves, even when the
[SPEAKER_04]: VPD is totally maxed out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or sorry, the humidity is totally maxed
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, is that happening because
there's another mechanism driving it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Driving water out of the plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the roots can actively take up water
to build up root pressure, which also
[SPEAKER_04]: helps drive water through the plant as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's also aquaporins that are just
like active open channels that are
[SPEAKER_04]: constantly drawing in water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It also has to do with solute gradients
inside between the actual rhizosphere and
[SPEAKER_04]: the root itself as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So keeping your humidity levels in check
in the room is giving the water a place to
[SPEAKER_05]: go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise the plant is just like
ballooning.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just filling up entirely with water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to the point that it'll actually start
exuding out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one of the reasons that high VPD
numbers, obviously very low VPDs,
[SPEAKER_05]: when you draw a VPD chart, at 100%
relative humidity in the room,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's zero.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a red zone on every chart
because you're not getting any carbon
[SPEAKER_05]: dioxide in because the water molecules
that would be leaving due to vapor
[SPEAKER_05]: pressure are not exiting the stomata.
[SPEAKER_05]: And therefore CO2 can't get in.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the opposite side, if it's too dry,
you have so much water leaving.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's such a rate that CO2 can't get in.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just looked at some research from
last year that indicated, as long as you
[SPEAKER_05]: have a high enough level of CO2,
VPD was not so much a factor.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the things being equal, VPD wasn't
necessarily a factor for photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_05]: rate or carbon synthesis or integration
simulation inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you can keep your CO2 levels high
enough, you can have a high VPD or a low
[SPEAKER_05]: VPD and still have decent photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, you have to be mindful of how you
get water through the plant and whatever
[SPEAKER_05]: nutrients you want to take.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how that affects nutrients,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're going to get different
transpiration rates out of different
[SPEAKER_04]: leaves at different levels of the plant,
going from the newest growth down to the
[SPEAKER_04]: older growth, where the leaf is very
mature, it's very large.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get such a high transpiration rate
out of these large leaves, just not
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily per area, but there's just so
much of that leaf at that point.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very developed, a vascular system.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to draw nutrients into that
large leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: The nutrients that are dependent on water
flow through the plant, at least some,
[SPEAKER_04]: are more mobile and can be moved around or
flow independent.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the ones that are really based on
movement in the water tubes throughout the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant are going to end up getting drawn to
that larger leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why you see a lot of the tip
burn issues, like in lettuce plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because there's no calcium making it
to the actual new growth because there's
[SPEAKER_04]: so much water movement coming out of the
larger leaves that you just start to get
[SPEAKER_04]: these crinkled edges where, and then when
the leaf actually expands, it's like
[SPEAKER_04]: pinched on the edges because there was no
calcium movement into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely can see that a very high VPD
can be very risky, just in terms of that,
[SPEAKER_04]: because you're not getting an even
movement of nutrition through the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: VPD also affects how much water the plant
uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just think about it in terms of
water efficiency and water utilization,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you have a higher VPD, the plant has
a greater demand for water, and so you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have to irrigate your plant more
to keep it well watered so that it can
[SPEAKER_01]: keep growing and is going to not wilt and
all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at a lower VPD, the plant has less
pressure on it to use that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I mentioned in my talk earlier,
that we can actually control VPD when the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is very young to turn it into a
drought tolerant plant so that when it
[SPEAKER_01]: grows up and it's an older plant,
it requires less water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those plants have more smaller stomata.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just in terms of controllability,
you have variable speed compressors
[SPEAKER_01]: almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you have all these stomata that
when they're all open, it's like three big
[SPEAKER_01]: stomata with 30 tiny stomata.
[SPEAKER_01]: More controllability, more granularity.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always mimicking its environment,
or at least it's a reciprocity between the
[SPEAKER_04]: environment of how it's going to develop a
leaf, even down to just the chloroplast
[SPEAKER_04]: level, where the chloroplast are
positioned inside of the mesophyll cells
[SPEAKER_04]: inside the leaf is going to be dictated by
the type of light source, the intensity of
[SPEAKER_04]: the light source, the thickness of the
leaf will change as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're in that type of light
setting and then you go to another light
[SPEAKER_04]: setting, now the plant has built itself
for this light source at this intensity
[SPEAKER_04]: and it has to totally change, which is a
tremendous amount of energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why you'll see these long
lagging acclimation times going from one
[SPEAKER_04]: environment to another.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the same thing with VPD because
it's built that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's intense to say that you could
build a drought tolerant plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I get what you're saying for sure,
that it's adapted itself to those
[SPEAKER_04]: conditions and now it has to change its
stomata density or the quantity per area
[SPEAKER_04]: or the size to adapt to that change.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things I'd like to see,
because again, this strict adherence to a
[SPEAKER_05]: VPD chart that they took off the High
Times magazine website article,
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever, and it's like we're going to use
this chart as gospel and they've circled
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever number.
[SPEAKER_05]: The better charts, they are temperature
specific to leaf temperature relative to
[SPEAKER_05]: the atmosphere because you have to redraw
the chart based on the radiation source.
[SPEAKER_05]: But even to that end, like you said,
within a gradient of canopy, which leaf
[SPEAKER_05]: are you going to measure to get your VPD
from?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more an argument against using VPD
without understanding all the variables
[SPEAKER_05]: and understanding that when you say I want
this VPD in my room, that you've taken an
[SPEAKER_05]: average leaf temperature and a good
estimated guess of what the leaf
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature is and understand that that's
the VPD for those leaves at that
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is an average leaf temperature and
how do you get that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What exactly does that mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it depends on the radiation source.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a radiation source is going to have a
lot of infrared or no infrared.
[SPEAKER_05]: And depending on whether it's one or the
other, the transpiration through the leaf
[SPEAKER_05]: is going to cool that leaf.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I have a high infrared and HID in
light, like an HPS system, heating my
[SPEAKER_05]: plant leaves, I need to keep the room a
couple degrees colder than where I'd like
[SPEAKER_05]: the leaf temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a couple three, four degrees Fahrenheit
below the leaf temperature I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: maintain.
[SPEAKER_05]: In an LED system, I still have
transpiration, even though I've got mostly
[SPEAKER_05]: photosynthetically active radiation
hitting the leaf.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to keep that room warmer because
I'm not cooking the leaves with my lights
on.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm still transpiring.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to get heat into that leaf to get
the water to turn into vapor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've got to keep that room temperature
warmer.
[SPEAKER_05]: LED rooms, 82 to 85 degrees in the
flowering stage for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: HPS rooms, 75 degrees.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to play with those numbers
because we're shooting for a leaf
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're shooting for a temperature where the
metabolism, when you give it enough carbon
[SPEAKER_05]: and all the other right elements is going
to be in that optimum band.
[SPEAKER_05]: Too hot and that band falls off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Too cold and that band falls off.
[SPEAKER_05]: They like to play within between 20 and 25
degrees, which is probably too large a
[SPEAKER_05]: number for what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys have better ranges or optimum
for a cultivar for leaf temperature,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to hear it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No pressure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't get it tattooed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's probably 80 degrees for
something like tomato and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry for mixing up Celsius and
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's 27 or 28 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a lettuce plant, we're probably
looking closer to 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 21 degrees Celsius is the target.
[SPEAKER_01]: But root temperature also has a play in
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we could have an excessive air
temperature and leaf temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if we can also control the root zone
temperature, then maybe we can compensate
[SPEAKER_01]: for some of the high temperatures at the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is, is that unless you're
doing true like hydroponics where you
[SPEAKER_01]: have, you know, deep water culture or
something and you can really control the
[SPEAKER_01]: water temperature to control the root
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're really controlling the
plant with the air.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people are most people are dependent
on just where their water storage is.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the temperature of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's inside, maybe it's a conditioned
space and they can have a little more
[SPEAKER_04]: control that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've seen some people where they have
it outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the water is coming in at like 50
degrees Fahrenheit, like it's been sitting
[SPEAKER_04]: out there during the winter.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you water the plants with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is detrimental.
[SPEAKER_04]: California or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in a greenhouse where they had
their water storage tank outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was, you know, 110 degree water
that they're delivering to the plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Zero oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Algae, actually, because it was a clear
tank.
[SPEAKER_05]: So can I can ask the plant scientist
something?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why does the VPD chart have a band of
green, a band of yellow and two bands of
[SPEAKER_05]: red typically?
[SPEAKER_05]: And those bands extend all the way up to
these temperatures where you'd never want
[SPEAKER_05]: to grow a plant in the high range and to a
very, very low temperature in the low end
[SPEAKER_05]: where you'd never want to grow a plant
anyways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is that green band there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is the yellow band there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did those colors come about?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just it's research that's
happened with different crops and like
[SPEAKER_04]: extension services trying to actually
create something to give a reference to.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's largely just like it's just physical
values presented in that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those have those have been shown with
various crops to like to have high
[SPEAKER_04]: productivity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis is the only one that's really
just brought in like a different practice
[SPEAKER_04]: historically.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I would say, I mean, when we look
at the VPD chart and when we create them
[SPEAKER_01]: for different crops, I mean, we will try
to trim off the edges depending on what
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at our lettuce chart,
it's very small compared to, say,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, I mean, if you think about it
with cannabis and tomatoes, and let's say
[SPEAKER_01]: we're growing in a greenhouse and,
you know, we didn't oversize the system
[SPEAKER_01]: for the peak load or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we know that there's going to be
days that it might be 90 degrees in that
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that's not ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it is 90 degrees in there,
what is the humidity exactly?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only about water movement,
the VPD chart.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's these it's it's fairly theoretical
with some some experimental information
[SPEAKER_04]: put in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's some of that some of the ends of
that chart are kind of irrelevant because
[SPEAKER_05]: it's only about water movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: VPD.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, so when we're talking about
Robisco activity, which is the it's the 50
[SPEAKER_04]: percent protein of plant leaves,
it's what's being used to actually fix
[SPEAKER_04]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: That has its own temperature limits as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whereas like your VPD may be OK at this
like high range on that graph,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is still in that green zone,
still around one point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now your Robisco activity is starting
to fall off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you're having leaky cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the membranes can't membranes are
made of fats and they'll they'll change
[SPEAKER_04]: out the types of fats to make sure they're
keeping the contents inside of the cell.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, they'll put in more liquid
fats or more solid fats and based on what
[SPEAKER_04]: the temperature is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like if it's a really hot day,
you want more unsaturated fats in that
[SPEAKER_04]: place that are going to actually like have
more fluidity and be able to withstand
[SPEAKER_04]: higher temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, sorry, saturated fats.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other direction, if it's
really cold, you don't want fats that are
[SPEAKER_04]: going to harden in cold temperatures and
see separate and create pockets where
[SPEAKER_04]: there can be things leaking out of the
cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's other things related to
temperature that are not related to VPD or
[SPEAKER_04]: transpiration.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not captured on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, one thing I would say about that is
as soon as you get out of the temperature
[SPEAKER_05]: band and you start moving the humidities
around, your leaf temperature changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the same room with even if you played
along and went to a green part on the VPD
[SPEAKER_05]: chart in the same room, it's not going to
be a two degree temperature leaf
[SPEAKER_05]: difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have to redraw your chart for
whatever the new leaf temperature is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think what I'd like to see from the
building control world that the building
[SPEAKER_05]: automation world is a good leaf
temperature sensor that will help you
[SPEAKER_05]: redraw the leaf temperature, help you
redraw the VPD chart and let you play in
[SPEAKER_05]: the new numbers when you get to those
spots.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's less important in indoor
because we have very tight control over
[SPEAKER_05]: the room temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're going to have different
cultivars and play in different
[SPEAKER_05]: temperatures and humidities, you have to
be able to understand that the leaf
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature has changed and your adherence
to an old VPD chart needs to be revisited.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, to that end, I would also
say if you're not getting airflow into the
[SPEAKER_05]: canopy in a consistent way, no matter what
you do with your air conditioning system,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is doing bulk removal of moisture
and changing the temperature to keep the
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature of the room somewhat accurate.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can't get that dry air into the
canopy or that conditioned air into the
[SPEAKER_05]: canopy along with CO2, it really doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, airflow inside the rooms is as
important as anything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the old ways of doing oscillating fans
inside the rooms that has got to go,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially as we go to two and three tier
type systems, you just you're not going to
[SPEAKER_05]: get that consistency of product.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to end up with pockets of
very bad pathogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Higher resolution airflow, more locations.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were all three of you in the HVAC session?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was speaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were speaking.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to hear from you your key
takeaways from his presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a very intense discussion of plant
physiology and how it pertains to HVAC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, you know, I very much so enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was I felt it was very well spoken,
but also there was some like new
[SPEAKER_04]: information presented that no one's really
paying attention to yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was talking about how comparing
different VPDs at different CO2 levels,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is important.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said some stuff just about
demonstrating that you're getting the same
[SPEAKER_04]: photosynthetic rates at different VPDs,
but you're also getting different
[SPEAKER_04]: transpiration rates.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, you can it's demonstrating
that you can get similar productivity even
[SPEAKER_04]: at a much lower energy cost because you're
not having to deal with so much
[SPEAKER_04]: transpiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then that also that also introduces
some more like pest issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because not, you know, if you don't if you
don't have clean starting material coming
[SPEAKER_04]: into the grow space, like a lot of people
are dependent on nurseries to get clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those nurseries aren't always clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes they're already coming in with
spores all over them or they're coming in
[SPEAKER_04]: with bugs on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you don't have an opportunity to
defend yourself against that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why traditionally a lot of
people have just worked with the higher
[SPEAKER_04]: VPD, low humidity values.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, I also think it was important
to it wasn't necessarily highlighted in
[SPEAKER_04]: the discussion, I think, is just because
of what we're there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about was mostly about water and
energy and productivity.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the effects of CO2 are also they're
they're affecting the transpiration rate
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as they're affecting how the
stomata how the stomata operate,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is affecting how water move water is
moving through the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we didn't really get a chance to go
into maybe some of the effects of CO2
[SPEAKER_04]: levels on VPD as much as I really wanted
to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So be for another another discussion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he had eight minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a camera and microphones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like he put the ball on the tee
for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now can you reinforce the like give us
the give us the juicy key points that you
[SPEAKER_03]: made and you wanted people to walk away
from and then elaborate on the thing that
[SPEAKER_03]: he wished?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the takeaway is we have those four
cardinal points that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: biosecurity is the fifth, temperature,
humidity, wind speed and CO2.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plants are very important.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very reactive.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are smarter than most people give
them credit for.
[SPEAKER_05]: They will react to their environment and
do their best to increase their metabolism
[SPEAKER_05]: in the most efficient possible way,
given the materials they need to get by.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you give them more CO2, enough CO2 to
increase their photosynthetic rate,
[SPEAKER_05]: they understand that they no longer need
to keep their stomata so open and they can
[SPEAKER_05]: start to close them off.
[SPEAKER_05]: And along with that closing of the stomata
comes a reduction in the transpiration
[SPEAKER_05]: rate, which means it needs to move less
water through the plant to maintain the
[SPEAKER_05]: turgor in the plant, to maintain uptake of
the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just it's better all around for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: The plant is going to grow typically at a
much higher rate and have much higher
[SPEAKER_05]: photosynthetic activity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the talk yesterday was very similar to
what you talked about today, which is your
[SPEAKER_05]: VPD line.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your VPD is the difference between the
vapor pressure at whatever leaf
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature you're at minus whatever the
room condition is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can draw that chart and adhere to
that chart as much as you'd like.
[SPEAKER_05]: But your chart has everything to do with
where you put the leaf temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And every time you change that leaf
temperature, you have to redraw the chart
[SPEAKER_05]: to know where you are on the VPD,
you know, with your VPD.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to that end, wind speed affects leaf
temperature relative to the room
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: The humidity changes the leaf temperature
relative to the room temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all sorts of other things like
stomata conductance.
[SPEAKER_05]: These things affect and lighting intensity
on the plants affect leaf temperature
[SPEAKER_05]: relative to the room temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now that we know those things and
we're starting to understand those things
[SPEAKER_05]: better, we have a better way to figure out
what that leaf temperature is with all
[SPEAKER_05]: these other sensors we have in the room
without actually having to go and take the
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature of all the leaves in the plant
and the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is, you know, it's a surrogate
for actually doing that to know all those
[SPEAKER_05]: other components.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have to go and take the
measurement of every leaf and we can do a
[SPEAKER_05]: better job of producing plant matter out
of a room using the sensors we already
[SPEAKER_05]: have.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we've got rooms with 16 sensors
in them, two tier CO2 temperature and
[SPEAKER_05]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Each sensor has got those built into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can pull that data out and and make
some assumptions on wind speed because
[SPEAKER_05]: we're doing static tests and those fans
are on 24 seven running all the time
[SPEAKER_05]: inside the racks.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can come up with a leaf temperature at
whatever condition we're in and we're
[SPEAKER_05]: going to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're doing the test right now,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're running those rooms and we're going
to figure out which conditions are better
[SPEAKER_05]: for the environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're sending all that data to the cloud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazon's analytics are going to pour
through millions of points of data and
[SPEAKER_05]: they're going to tell us, hey,
this cultivar in this room is going to
[SPEAKER_05]: give you 2% more THC, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we, if we feed the data back in,
then we'll have something to work with
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do some real good, interesting
research.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I kind of a way I wanted to express
what you guys are doing is like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you're you're maintaining the
architecture of the plant, like because
[SPEAKER_04]: it's basically it wants to have its leaves
upright, fully expanded so it can
[SPEAKER_04]: constantly be harvesting sunlight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the conditions are not appropriate
for it to be able to control its water
[SPEAKER_04]: content, if it's just getting water ripped
out or there's too much, it's not able to
[SPEAKER_04]: keep itself in a perfect position to
harvest sunlight.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the temperature is off, it's not able
to actually like perform its enzymatic
[SPEAKER_04]: activity at the proper rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just recently saw, for the first time,
I've seen a lighting company advertising
[SPEAKER_04]: that it said on their site, like,
activate your Robisco content of your
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they were, I was like, that's deep.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are really making, because if you
look at some of the like, they'll have
[SPEAKER_04]: like CO2 assimilation, CO2 assimilation
rate against like different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, often you'll see like a peak of
activity at like, you know, 30 degrees
[SPEAKER_04]: Celsius or higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's most likely just because of the
Robisco activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it has it has its own thresholds to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's also to consider, you know,
we talk a lot about this stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: but long term adaptations to these
different conditions are very different
[SPEAKER_04]: than a short term measurement that we
could take as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: How does the plant respond to that when
it's endured it for two months?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of the things that we're doing with
the data that's, you know, paying back
[SPEAKER_05]: immediately is you mentioned, I think
someone asked the question in the previous
[SPEAKER_05]: talk, how do you measure transpiration
rate, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's the standard testing?
[SPEAKER_05]: And you measure the plant over time,
you see how much water has gone through
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can, in a well sealed room,
the sensors we put on our air conditioning
[SPEAKER_05]: units, we care so much about it because
we're so much more efficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to prove it to the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're using our sensors to tell us how
much water we take out of the air every
[SPEAKER_05]: single minute of every single day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can see when the emitters in a room
get clogged or the solenoids didn't fire
[SPEAKER_05]: to water the plant because the watering
rate changed so drastically from one day
[SPEAKER_05]: to the next, we can immediately fire an
alarm, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And in one day, if someone didn't notice
that the plants were wilting, they can go
[SPEAKER_05]: in there and fix that problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, we do have the ability to do
transpiration rate measurement,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is, you know, it's just one of those
metrics that is going to help us indicate
[SPEAKER_05]: plant health and plant vitality and
increase our yields basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: It helps a lot for planting grow rooms
too, to have that data.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had spoke about training plants when
they're young to need less water.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're successful at doing that,
when they get older, are they tougher?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the VPD less of an issue?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the leaf temperature less of a factor
because they've been trained properly?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually been sitting here thinking
that same question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like the answer has to be yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if we've conditioned them to be
drought tolerant and to be acclimated to a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain environment where there's not,
you know, I don't know, just a lush source
[SPEAKER_01]: of water all the time, then why wouldn't
their leaf temperature be different than a
[SPEAKER_01]: different plant that wasn't conditioned to
be drought tolerant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why wouldn't their Robisco levels be
different?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually don't know the answer to that
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it would depend on what
environment it's moved into after that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you're doing it because these
plants are going into a drought type
[SPEAKER_04]: environment after being conditioned that
way, then it's, you know, it's probably
[SPEAKER_04]: going to stay pretty similar to what they
were already existing in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's going into something else,
I mean, they're constantly just adapting
[SPEAKER_04]: to their environment and trying to reflect
their environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would think it would change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, why would you take a plant that had
been trained to be sort of drought
[SPEAKER_02]: resistant and put it into a and then
smother it with water?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, wouldn't you drown it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you do whatever it took to get the
most productivity out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it meant that that's how you got the
most productivity out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it's drought tolerant or drought
resistant, then maybe I get the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: point of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole point was that these younger
plants that have been trained this way are
[SPEAKER_02]: keep retain those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are still productive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those studies have been done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not for cannabis, but for other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just take it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We grow it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We kill it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoke it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Poor cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, are those studies worth doing,
you know, to figure that out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially in terms of like the context of
this conference where we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: energy and resource and efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're all talking about energy,
but when it comes to agriculture and
[SPEAKER_01]: farming, really, the question we should be
asking is about water, the liquid gold
[SPEAKER_01]: that's used to irrigate our farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, 65 to 70 percent of all the
fresh water on earth are used for
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ultimately, when we solve the problem
about energy, the next big question and
[SPEAKER_01]: the question we should already start
asking ourselves is about water use
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, being able to collect the
water that's condensed on these air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioning systems is a huge opportunity
and is probably one of the something that
[SPEAKER_01]: we should be screaming to the rafters
that, hey, yeah, we use a lot of energy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're recycling between 65 to 95
percent of the water that we initially
[SPEAKER_01]: charged these facilities with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never leaving.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is almost a closed system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we, you know, we're not
proponents of desiccant or economizer
[SPEAKER_05]: cycle type systems that are just blasting
the water out to the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we use an energy recovery system
around our cooling coils, which makes it
[SPEAKER_05]: way more efficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also we get to collect all that water.
[SPEAKER_05]: None of that water leaves the facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: It all comes out of the condensate drain.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you treat it appropriately.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't just feed it back in your plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, make sure it's clean and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you can feed it back in.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, yeah, we capture all that water a
gallon in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ninety nine percent of that gallon comes
out of that pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if it's relevant to this
discussion, but I've been on a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: dry farms, cannabis dry farms in southern
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're kind of scattered along the Eel
River.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're really amazing, extremely
productive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you high?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not at the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just doing a tour of the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, well, I have been high from the
produce from those farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really great flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plants, it's so like at the base
of the plant, it's like literally like
[SPEAKER_02]: desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's as dry as desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet the plants themselves were thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And luscious like you can't believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that's obviously very unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you have to have the groundwater
at the at the right place.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but it's real.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these are these are thriving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and I'm just wondering if there's
anything to be learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, it's not an indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like an application for a
drought conditioned plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's that's that's produced,
produced and produced in a controlled
[SPEAKER_04]: facility to be handled that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, it's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did in a Sunshine Johnson is the name of
the grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did an article and it was titled The Art
of Doing Nothing because, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and she's a wonderful grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a traditional grower and she's only
been doing dry farming for a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But she literally lets kind of nature do
all of the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and I get one of the lessons is just
how hardy and how powerful the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: plant is in drawing the water and the
nutrients that it needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I don't know if there's any
applications here other than, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're training your plant to be drought
resistant to an indoor, more controlled
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe there is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would you know, there's so many there's
so many considerations to take it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't even say if it's the right
thing or not, because how many cycles a
[SPEAKER_05]: year could you get from that plant?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: She does one.
[SPEAKER_02]: She does one harvest a year, one harvest a
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it might take so long because it is
drought resistant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: To get to that spot that even if you
brought it indoors, you're not going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to go through the flowering stage in
the same amount of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that all those factors need to be
considered because growing cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: indoors is a business.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are trying to save the energy and
balance that with get the yield and also
[SPEAKER_05]: maintain consistent quality because they
have contracts to fulfill.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all these things need to be balanced
with how do we do it in the most energy
[SPEAKER_05]: efficient way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I mean, we're talking a lot about
productivity and photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, there's also quality
considerations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when we have flowering
fruiting plants, they're flowering and
[SPEAKER_01]: fruiting because they're stressed and
think they're going to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're like, oh, my God,
you know, winter is coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I better start the propagation process
so that I can send out my seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can send out my pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can accept the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can accept the pollen from a male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so stressing them through,
you know, through drought conditions,
[SPEAKER_01]: through, you know, not giving them
nitrogen in the last week of their life by
[SPEAKER_01]: dropping the temperature, making them
think that the weather is changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all techniques that they're
using.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they're doing is they're inducing
a stress response.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are making the plant think that it's
going to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it is going to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're playing on what it would have
naturally experienced in its genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: development.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so keeping things from it and creating
not a good environment or not a great
[SPEAKER_01]: condition for productivity is actually
going to improve the quality of what it is
[SPEAKER_01]: that we want to consume, unless it's a
lettuce.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, unless, yeah, controlled stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's controlled stress and steering the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really excellent point,
I think, because that speaks to really
[SPEAKER_02]: what it's all about, you know,
and what a lot of these growers are all
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they're going for,
especially the small ones, the craft ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's all about quality or they're
out of business.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just not mass producing to
generate some oils for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a gummy bear or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a gummy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some sort of gummy-shaped animal creature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what else can we talk about HVAC-wise?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you guys want to cover?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want me to get on a soapbox?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you can do a soapbox or absolutely you
can plug it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's usually best done in terms of any
sort of new technologies or innovations
[SPEAKER_02]: that are on the horizon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: We see data every single day of brute
force dehumidification systems or
[SPEAKER_05]: misapplied dehumidification systems that
create either microclimates or huge energy
[SPEAKER_05]: bills.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the technologies exist now.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no excuse for people not to be
using these new technologies.
[SPEAKER_05]: They involve those energy recovery systems
around the cooling coils, which is a
[SPEAKER_05]: primary way to do this, or liquid
desiccant systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: These technologies are out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And until people come to realize that
there is a better way to do it and still
[SPEAKER_05]: get the precision you need inside the
room, still get the airflow you need
[SPEAKER_05]: inside the room, but also understand that
airflow is such a big deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't just buy an air conditioner and
strap it to a room and expect it to do the
[SPEAKER_05]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't like fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't like air conditioners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideal airflow is natural?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we need air conditioning and
dehumidification if we're going to do an
[SPEAKER_05]: indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're supplementing CO2 to such a level
that if I just try to use outside air and
[SPEAKER_05]: pump in a lot of CO2, I'm going to lose
all that CO2 as the outside air comes in
[SPEAKER_05]: and gets exhausted back out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think air conditioning and
dehumidifying should be done.
[SPEAKER_05]: We should be doing it with more efficient
technologies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my one rant and rave.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by more efficient, you mean just simply
more energy-efficient machines,
[SPEAKER_02]: technologies, such as?
[SPEAKER_05]: So one way to dehumidify more efficiently
is to run an energy exchange system around
[SPEAKER_05]: the primary dehumidification mechanism.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like you said in your talk,
mechanical dehumidification means I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: going to cool the air down to or below the
dew point, which is the temperature at
[SPEAKER_05]: which dew will form.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to do that with a cooling coil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And before I get that air to the cooling
coil, I can exchange energy from both
[SPEAKER_05]: sides of that coil so that the air that
reaches the cooling coil is already
[SPEAKER_05]: saturated.
[SPEAKER_05]: I take away all the sensible
temperature-based cooling I needed to do
[SPEAKER_05]: using the energy exchange from behind the
coil to the front of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the effect is I get to reduce the
amount of compressors I use inside my air
[SPEAKER_05]: conditioning unit by about 50%,
somewhere between 35 to 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a technological solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That has been done for years.
[SPEAKER_05]: That people like you would do?
[SPEAKER_05]: We've already implemented all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_05]: The industry has done it probably for
about 40 or 50 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: In places where we're in San Diego,
many engineering firms out here are not
[SPEAKER_05]: familiar with the challenges of
dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_05]: If this was Florida, we'd be having a
different set of engineers who can jump
[SPEAKER_05]: right in and say, yes, we all do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up north?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I was just going to say one thing also
is that conventional HVAC equipment has
[SPEAKER_01]: been, over the course of 20, 30,
40 years, has been set to a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: standard to meet certain energy efficiency
ratings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to meet an EER, an SEER,
an IEER, certain things have, certain
[SPEAKER_01]: changes in the design of the HVAC system
have occurred to reduce compressor energy,
[SPEAKER_01]: to reduce fan power energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bummer part about that is those
things that have been done to improve
[SPEAKER_01]: energy efficiency have resulted in less
dehumidification capacity of those
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love talking to mechanical engineers
in the south because they really
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the challenges that energy
efficient equipment put on
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidification potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not funny, but not funny,
ha ha funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you talk to a mechanical engineer in
Georgia who just designed this super tight
[SPEAKER_01]: apartment building, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're using 17 or 18 SEER VRF
systems and they can't control humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are they doing in these buildings?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're installing standalone
dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going through the same pains.
[SPEAKER_02]: An apartment building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in residential building,
even commercial buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm just giving this one example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have this image of an article in
my head where they're literally installing
[SPEAKER_01]: like in the wall standalone dehumidifiers
that look like like those old radiant
[SPEAKER_01]: heaters that you would see in like an old
school apartment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make the same type of model,
but for a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's just like efficient form of
dehumidification when they had the
[SPEAKER_05]: opportunity in the infrastructure to build
the HVAC such that it took care of both.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ashley is not tackling this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like this elephant in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's such a bummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there should be different standards,
different codes based on your climate
[SPEAKER_01]: zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are for a lot of different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for whatever reason, energy efficiency
is God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they've started to come up with MRE.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ashley's got MRE and some other like heart
load MREs.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as it applies to the cannabis or
indoor grow in general, those standalone
[SPEAKER_05]: dehumidifiers are the bane of many growers
existence.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we go into grows where they have a
graveyard of spare parts because they've
[SPEAKER_05]: all broken down and they've got new ones
in and they're mixing and matching
[SPEAKER_05]: components.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they go and install them inside
their rooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stuff as many between the lights as they
can.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the condensates fill up and drip dirty
condensate water on top of their plant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're proponents of get everything out of
the room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Use one or maybe two units per room that
are both temperature and dehumidification
[SPEAKER_05]: control systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have them like outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have them outside and duct it in and use
that duct work to deliver the air in a
[SPEAKER_05]: consistent way to circulate the air
through the room properly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get it to the in rack fans and
distribution systems you need to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just that whole model boggles my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's that's really essentially where
we had our first kind of victory.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was going up against one of the larger
manufacturers who was first to market in
[SPEAKER_05]: the cannabis specific HVAC space and
sitting at a table with them and having
[SPEAKER_05]: them justify their decisions and how they
designed equipment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once you lay out every single aspect
of that design versus a more holistic,
[SPEAKER_05]: well thought out and well engineered
design, it's a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And part of it comes down to having the
tools.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's 2020, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We model every single room.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no excuse for us not to.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have very expensive modeling software.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to model every single room to
make sure that I get the air where I need
[SPEAKER_05]: to inside the canopy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just whether it's a greenhouse or
indoor proper.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's you have to do that to make
sure you get the room right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's critical also with these types of
systems that enables you to actually it
[SPEAKER_04]: reduces the different you have between the
air coming into the space and the air
[SPEAKER_04]: conditions you want to maintain within
that space as opposed to the redundancy
[SPEAKER_04]: brute force methods that are traditional
to the industry so far, which is just
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial air conditioning equipment and
standalone dehumidifier is exactly what
[SPEAKER_04]: you guys have been talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: In that case, all of your air mixing is
happening in the room instead of supplying
[SPEAKER_04]: this like pretty close to what you
actually want it to be supply air to the
[SPEAKER_04]: space.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you've got hot, dry air.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got cold saturated air inside the
space.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have this little climate
around the plants and all that's mixing on
[SPEAKER_04]: the plants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the dehumidifiers are short cycling
air back to themselves.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they stopped dehumidifying five
hours ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I would even say desert hot
springs and where it's desert and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a different problem and
solution, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have a lot of humidity out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to put moisture in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you talking about inside a greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, inside of an indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in an indoor farm, typically we
don't bring in a lot of outside air.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're recirculating the majority of the
air.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we're supplementing CO2 levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the outside air has less of an impact
on what's going on inside the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in a greenhouse environment then?
[SPEAKER_01]: In a greenhouse environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in that case, we want to humidify
your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to use evaporative cooling.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to use high pressure fog system
and add moisture because the VPD will be
[SPEAKER_01]: too high in there, which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in terms of cooling efficiency,
evaporative cooling doesn't get more
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient when it comes to energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is that it uses a lot of
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for my PhD, I actually looked at water
use efficiency of evaporative cooling
[SPEAKER_01]: systems for greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I included that to the entire
water balance of the hydroponic system,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of a sudden it looked like growing
tomatoes in a field in terms of water use
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I would say that there's a lot
of benefits to growing in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just the quality of the product,
the control of the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Year-round production.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, TOV.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's going to ripen right there
and be as nutritious of a tomato as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the altitude of the greenhouse impact
these factors, the environment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of a greenhouse for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a reason why you see
greenhouses being built at higher
[SPEAKER_01]: altitudes because the maximum high daily
temperature is lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there's less obstruction to
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just through the particles in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, really, you're closer to the
sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Careful like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get better light transmission.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's cooler, better light transmission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's good reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, from an HVAC perspective,
if you're designing a piece of equipment,
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Altitude changes everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have calculations to solve that
problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's neither here nor there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a bigger deal for
greenhouses, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are your machines geared for certain size
grows or do you work with all different
[SPEAKER_02]: size?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, just in terms of our bandwidth
as a company, we're trying to focus on
[SPEAKER_05]: 10,000 square foot can be in a facility or
above.
[SPEAKER_05]: But are we go into rooms that are about a
thousand to fifteen hundred feet up to you
[SPEAKER_05]: name it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's no top limit on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we'll work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my kind of general takeaway from this
is that there's still a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation to be had with the
cultivators and education in order to get
[SPEAKER_02]: all of this right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That there's still some misunderstanding
and there's so many factors to consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: And despite the fact that so many of them
have been growing for a long time,
[SPEAKER_02]: the learning curve is still there and
straight up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just kind of my takeaway.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the science.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's everything about this is still so
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that even the science is in general,
we just we need better communication and
[SPEAKER_01]: education across the aisles.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can, you know, I mean, manufacturers
and engineers and technical people really
[SPEAKER_01]: need to understand the plant better.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to understand the grower better.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to understand that farming is a
business, you know, and just the
[SPEAKER_01]: complexity that we've all been talking
about in terms of growing a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just throwing a seed in the
ground and then, you know, watering it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just going to poof grow into,
you know, the beautiful plant that you
[SPEAKER_01]: want it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we need growers to understand the
engineering, to understand the
[SPEAKER_01]: implications of their choice of vapor
pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, also needs to understand this is
home growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because home grow is a really
important part of this industry and
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully will be allowed throughout this
country.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there are some states they don't
want to allow it, but that would be a
[SPEAKER_02]: really big mistake.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they especially need to if they
don't want to ruin their homes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You go into any room that's had a grow in
it and go looking for mold and you don't
[SPEAKER_05]: need to look too far.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You put a high humidity room in a cold
environment that wasn't meant to have a
[SPEAKER_05]: high humidity room in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so sorry if you have other people
living there besides yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you've made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's problematic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hugely problematic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably the reason that we have
grocery stores today.
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact is the production quality you can
get from a craft grower is most likely
[SPEAKER_05]: going to eclipse what most people can do
at home.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And look, there's a novelty to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: My parents are Italian.
[SPEAKER_05]: My dad, every year we harvested all the
tomatoes and lettuce we wanted to eat from
[SPEAKER_05]: our own backyard.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I get the home grow approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're going to put it indoors,
we're talking about indoor ag,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, is an efficiency thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just be very careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any like little grow rooms that
work?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never seen them work, but I know that
they exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: They certainly exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have those tents.
[SPEAKER_05]: The gorilla tents.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have these cute, not cute,
but like really cool looking architectural
[SPEAKER_05]: boxes with the lights inside and HVAC
included.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they do all the things.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've never seen them work.
[SPEAKER_05]: They seem to be a novelty.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure they do work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would the problem be that they're porous
or they're they don't they don't maintain
[SPEAKER_02]: the correct environment?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just haven't seen them work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you haven't seen them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they look very cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool looking for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you're just curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really enjoy listening to this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious to know about the best
way to price HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it dollars per ton?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it is it pounds of moisture removal per
kilowatt?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there are there ways to specify it
by square footage of grow or are there
[SPEAKER_00]: other challenges and pitfalls doing doing
it that way?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if we're talking about
conventional equipment where a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: cooling is includes both the temperature
heat removal and the latent moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: removal, then you know, we can use kind of
our typical HVAC rules of thumb,
[SPEAKER_01]: which ranges, you know, from a thousand to
three thousand dollars per ton.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just call it that.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, because of dehumidification,
because it's not so I mean, you can
[SPEAKER_01]: convert, you know, pounds per hour to BTUs
per hour to a tonnage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, if we're talking about a
dehumidification or a moisture removal
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency, then basing a price on tonnage
might not make as much sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's dependent on room conditions as well,
correct?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What your set points are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dollars per ton from our perspective,
because we have that energy efficiency
[SPEAKER_05]: mechanism inside of our unit, which
reduces tons by 35 to 50 percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use way less tons, but we move as much
air and we have as many components in
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: The dollar per ton doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're looking, we are striving for that
metric.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dollar per pound per hour is a good metric
for us, because the numbers work out to
[SPEAKER_05]: be, you know, not astronomical and not too
small.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just kind of in numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you figure this out?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you figure out ahead of time before
you have to buy it?
[SPEAKER_02]: How much you're going to need?
[SPEAKER_02]: How much you're going to need to remove
from the environment before you purchase
[SPEAKER_02]: the thing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so we have a, most manufacturers
will have a project input form and that
[SPEAKER_05]: project input form is going to look at
what they're trying to get is what are the
[SPEAKER_05]: inputs of energy over the course of 24
hours of the highest load of that room,
[SPEAKER_05]: both in electricity and in water.
[SPEAKER_05]: So remembering that transpiration is 99
percent of the water you put into the
[SPEAKER_05]: plant is going to end up out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need an into the air that we have to
remove.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to look for the number of
plants and the water per plant per day at
[SPEAKER_05]: the peak time of transpiration to
determine and that's not necessarily the
[SPEAKER_05]: same thing as how much water I put in the
root zone.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's how much water stays in the root zone
in the course of that 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to be able to remove that with my
dehumidification and temperature controls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you determine that while they're under
construction?
[SPEAKER_05]: We do it before they're under
construction.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's usually a grower who's on board
with the development team.
[SPEAKER_05]: That grower will say, I did this before
and this is what we're going to do here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we look at those numbers and say,
well, those numbers are wrong because they
[SPEAKER_05]: are not accounting for, you know,
they're not accounting for drainage or
[SPEAKER_05]: those numbers are right because they seem
to fit a set of ranges that we've run into
[SPEAKER_05]: time and time again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or they're right because they fit the data
we get out of rooms that are similarly
[SPEAKER_05]: designed to this with the same lighting
technology and the plant density,
[SPEAKER_05]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can advise and say, we think you
might want to revisit this or we think
[SPEAKER_05]: you're bang on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then give them a size of equipment
that they can then go and take to the
[SPEAKER_05]: market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you dealt with any and I know that
several grows have hired growers from the
[SPEAKER_02]: Netherlands to come over because they've
worked at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you dealt with any of them?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is this stuff, are they are they
queued into all of this because they're so
[SPEAKER_02]: experienced?
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them are amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So at the Canadian Greenhouse Conference,
I ran into a number of them who had such
[SPEAKER_05]: an incredible understanding of temperature
and humidity control.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was almost unmatched.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very happy to be talking to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were others who were 50 years in the
greenhouse industry, looking at newcomers
[SPEAKER_05]: like ourselves who come from the
commercial and indoor ag space saying,
[SPEAKER_05]: you don't know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a huge mistake.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, these things, these ideas
will never work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those same growers, sorry, those same
greenhouse manufacturers, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: had their facility shut down because it
wasn't a viable cannabis facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, two, two months after it was
bought, they pulled all the plants out,
[SPEAKER_05]: had to destroy them all because of the
powdery mildew outbreak.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it turns out that cut flower
greenhouses are not ideal for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when people, you know, you have to take
what people say and their experience with
[SPEAKER_05]: a maybe a grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes they have a firm belief that
they are the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been doing this in the Netherlands
for so long.
[SPEAKER_05]: How dare you question us?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, well, look, it's a, it's a whole
new world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens when the day comes and
we've solved the mildew problem in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: If that day could ever come and we know
they're working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: The sun has expanded.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, or genetically or maybe it's somehow
done genetically or new strains or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But say that we're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that change everything here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that change?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just about powdery mildew or
mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's about plant health and but it's
the fear of the mold that causes growers
[SPEAKER_02]: to behave in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So their behavior might change then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it takes away one of the many
variables they're concerned about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are so many other pests and pathogen
problems to worry about for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Waterborne.
Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was really wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you guys are just fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for having me.
Thanks for having me.
Thanks for having me.
