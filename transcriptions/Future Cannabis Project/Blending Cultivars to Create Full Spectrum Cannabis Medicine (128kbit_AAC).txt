[SPEAKER_02]: Just quickly, because I'm sure everyone's
hungry, but can we ask you about what we
[SPEAKER_02]: were talking about out there, which is
your philosophy on whether it's making
[SPEAKER_02]: hash or tinctures of mixing cultivars
versus single cultivar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how deep to go into it,
but a lot of it for me is I've come to
[SPEAKER_01]: realize how much I don't know about this
plant and what it can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, there are cultivars that pop up
that, you know, they're intriguing to the
[SPEAKER_01]: nose, and when you breathe in the smell of
that plant, you feel it in different parts
[SPEAKER_01]: of your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's all those kind of cues that are
involved for me in trying to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: what the particular chemistry of this
plant might be able to do for a person
[SPEAKER_01]: who's seeking hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at one point in the work, I was really
focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like, yes, I want strain-specific
products, because if we find a strain that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually does, sorry, cultivar,
not strain, as Dr. Russo says,
[SPEAKER_01]: strain is something that happens to your
back, Wade.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the name of a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you find a cultivar that's actually
working, then you want to be able to know
[SPEAKER_01]: that particular cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cultivar is going to help this person.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I came to realize at some point,
there's a couple of problems with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, it's hard to have a very specific
version of a specific plant year after
[SPEAKER_01]: year after year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're either talking mothers and clones
or tissue culture, or a very skilled
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder who can create a seed line that
will be consistently that same thing over
[SPEAKER_01]: and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of why I started mixing different
oils together is that it was a combination
[SPEAKER_01]: of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the issues was one of the most
challenging folks that I was trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: work with needed a whole lot every day of
one specific cultivar that just did not do
[SPEAKER_01]: well on my farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: ACDC is a plant that was first selected
here on the coast of Northern California,
[SPEAKER_01]: where the humidity is 40 to 60 percent,
and the temperature never gets above 80
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under those conditions, ACDC is just the
happiest little girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: She produces these big, beautiful buds and
upright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reminded me of one of the old-school bubba
cushions I used to work with years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I never saw that version of ACDC until
I was in an indoor room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of what I was in that room for was
that I'd found somebody who was growing
[SPEAKER_01]: ACDC indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, I got to see how this is
working, because in my garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: it grew like a fern.
[SPEAKER_01]: It couldn't even hold its own weight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meantime, I had this person, severely
challenged by epilepsy, whose parents were
[SPEAKER_01]: utterly convinced ACDC was the only thing
that would help.
[SPEAKER_01]: That particular case, that first year,
I was able to provide them with ACDC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew someone who was growing it indoors
and made a trade with him so that I could
[SPEAKER_01]: give it to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that next year, I was growing it
again, and the family came up to visit the
[SPEAKER_01]: farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I showed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, this is what you want me to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a plant that has exactly the same
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells different, so there's different
terpenes going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the exact same cannabinoids that
are going on in this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we try this for your son and see
what happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were ... I think they had come to
trust me at that point, so they were
[SPEAKER_01]: willing to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That year, I had five different things
similar to ACDC.
[SPEAKER_01]: High CBD, really low THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave them ... What's that?
What were they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those five were Sour Tsunami, a plant
called Electra.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is a cross of Otto and Valentine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Valentine Mother Plant, Otto the Male,
O-T-T-O.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Electra, Sour Tsunami, Harley Sue,
Remedy, and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the fifth one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I had five different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave the family a pound of each of those
different flowers and suggested to them
[SPEAKER_01]: that they try a little ... Make an oil
from each of them and give a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: it to their son in his feeding tube and
see if one of them might work better than
[SPEAKER_01]: ACDC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turned out, in fact, that because they
only had a pound, it wasn't enough to do
[SPEAKER_01]: the extraction process that they normally
did.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, on their own initiative,
decided to mix three pounds together and
[SPEAKER_01]: two pounds together, so they made two
batches.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those batches was so spectacularly
successful at helping him, the frequency,
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity, and duration of his seizures
fell off dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enough that mom called me, like,
wait, I don't understand what's going on,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the seizures have stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just beside ... It was good news.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question then became, was it one of
those three or was it all three of those
[SPEAKER_01]: things together?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know the answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meantime, she tried the other preparation
that was from the other two, and one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those two was Electra.
[SPEAKER_01]: That preparation not only didn't really
help him, particularly when she gave him
[SPEAKER_01]: just Electra, it actually made his
seizures worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we tried to understand what was going
on there, we think it was Turpinoline,
[SPEAKER_01]: because Turpinoline in that particular
cultivar was about five times what it was
[SPEAKER_01]: in the other four that we were working
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of all of that, that's a
long-winded way of saying, I really came
[SPEAKER_01]: to realize I don't really know what is
going to be best for this end user.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, in trying to create a product,
you can't really compound formulations for
[SPEAKER_01]: one person in the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're creating a product for hundreds or
thousands of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm so convinced that the
chemistry that the cannabis plant makes
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot do any harm if it's free of
contaminants and other issues that come
[SPEAKER_01]: with mixing it with other things,
if it's free of contaminants, the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant itself cannot do any harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can take chemistry from several
different cultivars and put them together,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's quite likely that maybe we'll get 80
or 90 of the possible 150 cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: that the cannabis plant makes in that one
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we're finding is
that the cannabinoids, particularly some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the rare ones, have really profound
effects at very, very, very small doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really pretty convinced that the whole
plant medicine concept really is not
[SPEAKER_01]: specific to one cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is really about making salads,
is how I view it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're putting together some of this one
and some of this one and some of this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, you think about what is the
cannabinoid profile that you're shooting
[SPEAKER_01]: for at the end in your product?
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe what kind of terpenes are you
looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's really true is even the
scientists can't tell us for sure what
[SPEAKER_01]: actually is going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I'm not really a scientist,
I'm just, I love this plant, and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: become so convinced it can't do harm,
I really want to offer the widest array of
[SPEAKER_01]: possible benefit to any end user that's
going to consume a product that I would
[SPEAKER_01]: make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I gave up, for the most
part, in medical preparations on
[SPEAKER_01]: strain-specific preparations, because I'm
pretty sure we don't really know what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be best for the folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in trying for the widest efficacy
for the most number of people,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we want the widest array of
chemistry available to those end users.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I got to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me ask you, because we were talking
earlier about how cannabis is so hard for
[SPEAKER_00]: dosage because everybody is so unique and
individual, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is your thought process on this,
on making it not cultivar-specific and
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing in as many cultivars as you can,
is your thought process then, because
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody is so specific, you are going to
be hitting the majority, there'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: something in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the hope, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That diversity will actually be effective
for more people because there is more
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that you chose the word diversity
for this, because that's exactly kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: where I'm coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: In much the same way that you were taking
those inoculations or those samples of the
[SPEAKER_01]: biology at different places on your land
at different times of year, you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get a real diverse selection of the
things that are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In much the same way that we build our
soil in our gardens, I think that through
[SPEAKER_01]: selecting appropriate foods, fermented
foods, the idea including cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: those foods, we are in effect building the
soil of our bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you could think of the plasma,
the intracellular plasma and the liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: that makes up our bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the soil in which we grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That that's where our health springs from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that is full of diversity and
beauty and everything from, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sauerkrauts in your gut to
phyto-cannibinoids from the plants to the
[SPEAKER_01]: herbs that you use in your cooking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, and all of it's coming from
where you live.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are incorporating the biome that you
live in into your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the diversity that we as Dragonfly
Earth medicine farmers are trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: create in our farms is also reflected in
our bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like this is a really important
component of live real food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, I think it's really important
that it be said that cannabis is not a
[SPEAKER_01]: silver bullet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not the answer to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really need to be integrative in our
approach to wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it includes our food and it includes
our attitude and our intention and the
[SPEAKER_01]: place that you come from in your garden
and in your work.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that fits together to make
something that is holistic, is sustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: in the sense of we can continue to do it
while flourishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really Wendy so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will ripple.
[SPEAKER_01]: A large community.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to get it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
