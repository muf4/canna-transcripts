[SPEAKER_00]: What we have here is an experimental pod
Had some people hitting me up talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about sustainability and using things from
you know your area and so mine started
[SPEAKER_00]: cooking and We've got here a cantaloupe
and white bean biology bomb basically
[SPEAKER_00]: Soaked white bean and Then I boiled them
then I let them sit for a couple days
[SPEAKER_00]: until they just started to get a slight
tinge of funk and Then I did my regular
[SPEAKER_00]: avocado tactics on it malted barley Kelp
gypsum crab meal and just went in use
[SPEAKER_00]: biofoss and inoculated with Bokashi little
maple syrup and what you have here is an
[SPEAKER_00]: avocado tech pod sin avocado we got the
white beans in place Given that the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure and the cantaloupe is high in
potassium So yeah, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna go put these down and Get on
some experimental stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason why you can't grow your
own melons grow your own gourds grow your
[SPEAKER_00]: own pumpkins and Use things that are as
local as possible to you like kelp that I
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested off the beach local main malt
company blue ox shout out to them and Just
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to use things that are as close As
possible and you could omit some
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients and add some extra ingredients
depending on what you need so Mixed up a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of the filling I even have a little
bit extra here because I did some extra
[SPEAKER_00]: beans and I'm going to add that into some
old avocado shells they already have up
[SPEAKER_00]: there for some of my other plants,
but Hey, I couldn't be accused of Not
[SPEAKER_00]: being down with the movement and so here
we are Coming up with some different ways
[SPEAKER_00]: for you to use the avocado tech the
biology bomb the fruit drop theory And use
[SPEAKER_00]: it for your garden, so we're up here in
the garden And everything's in veg right
[SPEAKER_00]: now Just reaching the screen on both sides
And I've chosen a spot for the pod here
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath this peach skunk no,
excuse me It's a Cassava which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: cantaloupe Hayes times Bruce Banner number
three by deadpan head short Squat little
[SPEAKER_00]: wide leaf drug cultivar whatever you want
to call it indica And this is the spot I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a drip emitter right here Not too
close to the stock, but in the same realm
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw some worms as I was placing it,
so this is a good spot move the Drip
[SPEAKER_00]: emitter to the side, and it will just
cascade down the edge down below sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: umbrella down keep everything moist
another good sign is there is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal life here on the Top of the
cantaloupe I can already see a hypoaspis
[SPEAKER_00]: miles aka Stradio lepsimetus crawling on
the top here He's saying what's going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: but anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've placed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the spot I like to put it
underneath a Hub of moisture and
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath the plant if possible and trust
me the other plants in this bed will
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit from this as well This is going to
carry this on a lot longer than just this
[SPEAKER_00]: this round even there's a lot of great
minerals in there that will are not even
[SPEAKER_00]: solubilized yet, but Other things in here
other than cannabis are the Husk cherry or
[SPEAKER_00]: the Cape gooseberry down the end and then
we have Minuet and herbus or aka herba
[SPEAKER_00]: Stella, which is an edible Green has a
little salty kind of aspect to it It's
[SPEAKER_00]: great probably sequestered sodium in your
system, and then I have some wheatgrass as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as bush beans yellow bush beans And I
can see some dill popping up here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting Yeah, I toss Seeds that I
think will be beneficial willy-nilly in
[SPEAKER_00]: here and when the system kind of accepts
them wet them and sprouts them It's on
[SPEAKER_00]: them not me so everything's looking great
man and I'll check in soon on this a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple days Three to five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll check in peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back It's been five days And but some
great growth in here Everything is really
[SPEAKER_00]: jumping up to meet the screen some of it
succeeded the screen, but I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: check on the Attack here not gonna flip a
pod today only because There's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: Signs of fungal my face spreading out all
over the place Around the bottom edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you remember, but I
believe they discovered penicillin on
[SPEAKER_00]: cantaloupe skin There's definitely a lot
of activity going on here So yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna disturb it I'm sure that
there's a lot going on under here right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, but I'm gonna wait until that 10-day
mark to really give you guys a View into
[SPEAKER_00]: what's gone on since I put the pod down
but definitely a great sign to see all of
[SPEAKER_00]: this activity happening Several different
strains it looks in various different
[SPEAKER_00]: stages of decomposition, but it is going
around the entire bottom and Also creeping
[SPEAKER_00]: up onto the cantaloupe itself one thing I
haven't studied before is how the shell of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cantaloupe or the skin reacts over
time so that will be another one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: Experiments here to see if it holds
together and holds that humidity dome or
[SPEAKER_00]: if it just collapses altogether,
but hopefully We have a lot of worms on
[SPEAKER_00]: the underside working working that a
Amendment filled goodness of white bean as
[SPEAKER_00]: the primary base That I put down so I'll
keep you posted and check back in with you
[SPEAKER_00]: in a few days We're
[SPEAKER_00]: back All right, it's been ten days
Canopies filled in very nicely throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of companion plants It's doing really
great it's time to check out the
[SPEAKER_00]: cantaloupe tech it's been ten days Wow
Well, I can easily say this is more
[SPEAKER_00]: overtaking with fungi on the surface than
anything else I've ever put Down as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: avocado goes so pretty excited about that
starting to get more of a White bloom and
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of that bluish trichodermis and take
a look Let's get under here and see what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is literally Cemented to the pod.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna remove this fan leaf right
here because it's getting in the way a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of these families actually That's
dill springing up next door Let's give
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing a left I would imagine there's
still quite a bit of filling left because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the sheer density of the film
[SPEAKER_00]: The flesh on the inside so it is sticking
a little bit still a fair amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: filling left, but an awesome fungal bloom
On the inside here Of course, you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: worms writhing around in the bottom if I
can get underneath You know what I can see
[SPEAKER_00]: movement under there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even want to move it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to break it Into fungal bonds
that are there, but we have awesome amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of worms that have moved in there I can
tell I can see from a distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also see micro life It's teeming
straight ellipse scimitas hanging out on
[SPEAKER_00]: top Where the fun guy goes they tend to go
and I think that probably meets feed for
[SPEAKER_00]: them whether to be mold mites or Those
little red orbited mites But yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything just looks great The feed is
going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been ten days again roughly twice
twice as much feed in the pod So I would
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine it'll take twice as long to
decompose that is one handy thing about
[SPEAKER_00]: your Avocado is it just seems to be the
right size This is a jumbo Pod which is
[SPEAKER_00]: fine, you know what this is gonna be for
is a pre flower and going into flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm still in veg I'm probably gonna
give it maybe one more week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me To to completely fill out some
of these spots and reach the screen Same
[SPEAKER_00]: as over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple little guys that are
lagging behind for whatever reason but
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else is just looking raging the
healthy and you can see my clover back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Full bloom you ever grown some
heady indoor clover Good stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so that's what it is I think
we'll extend this out to a 15 and a 20 day
[SPEAKER_00]: check just to see what happens eventually
to this I would imagine that Overtimes
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna get to look like a blown-out
tire and the fun guy will consume
[SPEAKER_00]: everything so Thus far You know,
there may be a little bit of anaerobic
[SPEAKER_00]: activity going on there, but it's it's
it's a non-issue I think you've got enough
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive decomposition going on that
this is healthy for the system and as you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see the Saba from deadpan hand agrees
It likes it and so does its counterpart
[SPEAKER_00]: right next door the dirty Starbucks from
so good seeds Cheers everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll check back I'm back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been about 15 days and We are gonna
take a look at the cantaloupe Tech aka the
[SPEAKER_00]: cantaloupe avocado tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've applied the same principles as I do
the avocado to a cantaloupe a little bit A
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more in line with something
that you can wildcraft yourself You can
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely grow cantaloupes in many excuse
me climates melons per cubits meaning
[SPEAKER_00]: everything of the Cucumber melon family by
herself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to highlight that that can
be used for avocado tech in place of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Meat of the avocado I opted for some white
beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I use great northern white bean So
let's take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what's happened Wow,
excuse me Shell even more overtaken by fun
[SPEAKER_00]: guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did reposition the hose as the pod
started to collapse So it's literally
[SPEAKER_00]: cascading down over the top Which seems to
be Pulling up some moisture, which
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely is helping with the fungal
breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look and see what we got
under here though Again, the filling may
[SPEAKER_00]: break away from the pod It's just
different than an avocado but Again
[SPEAKER_00]: families have come into play and are in
the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to tuck these it's a
beautiful very large Lower fans here don't
[SPEAKER_00]: need to quite remove me Although Coming
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably will do a nice little
defoliation as you can see down here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the under in the under brush We've got
some work to do I like to clean up all the
[SPEAKER_00]: legs on all these plants and Take all the
foliage off up to the screen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see I got a lot to do here
Plants have risen to the occasion and are
[SPEAKER_00]: crusting the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy was a really short broadleaf
variety that Is still taking some time to
[SPEAKER_00]: gain stature, but it's still wide and Has
a lot of nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah the moment we've been waiting for
drum roll,
[SPEAKER_00]: please Millipedes red wigglers All kinds
of funk going on in there looking good
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I can separate the two
Mycelium mat just covering the filling at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point at those red Orbited mites
they're chewing on things strata
[SPEAKER_00]: lepsomatis Predatory mites so you can even
see a partially blended bean there that
[SPEAKER_00]: worm is going after and Just wanted to
highlight, you know, one of the uses or
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons for using Bokashi is that you
know, if you have a big pod like this with
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of filling and any am in aerobic
situation happens This can be a means of
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking it down Anyway, there it is in
action.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this will be a good 20 25 day pod
So you need a long slow release pod this
[SPEAKER_00]: might be your method cantaloupe and if you
can produce it yourself Even more
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable regenerative and all the
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace everybody You
