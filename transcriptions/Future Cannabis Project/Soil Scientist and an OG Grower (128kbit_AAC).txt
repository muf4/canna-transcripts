[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a farm up in Santa Barbara?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Nice Guy LLC is our farm in Santa
Barbara.
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa Maria Line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you growing just cannabis or are you
growing all sorts of vegetables?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we're a cannabis grower up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have seven acres under Hoop House.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing it in large pots, large
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 gallons, 200 gallons?
[SPEAKER_01]: 260.
[SPEAKER_01]: 360 gallon smart pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use worm casting, biochar, peat moss,
obviously some microhyzae and stuff mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something we've done in the past but
it'll be better soil this year than it was
[SPEAKER_01]: last year because it got hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you probably know, when you first
get raw biochar, it has to be primed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be activated because there's a
thin sheen on the surface of the char
[SPEAKER_01]: that's an organic material that's
partially blocking the binding sites for
[SPEAKER_01]: the NPK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unless it's fully activated,
you might expect it to be hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the char is activated, is prepared,
that eliminates that problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you'll probably see this year
or maybe even next year you'll start to
[SPEAKER_01]: see the benefit for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the value propositions of
char is it allows you to be more efficient
[SPEAKER_01]: with your inputs, whether it's water or
plant nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to be more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of one of the bottom lines of
a regenerative farming model is be
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient with your plant nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: No runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we had zero runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Advantage of smart pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a fan of letting it dry pretty
thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, in those size pots,
we are only needing to feed once every
[SPEAKER_01]: five to seven days.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of the beautiful thing of
this, these cocoa media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've basically got two types of media
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a more traditional mix,
peat, perlite, and coia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these are pure cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, we really should leave the peat
in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, again, more of a traditional
public aid condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what some people want.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the difference between we've got these
two right here have about a day's worth of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: These three have about four to six weeks
with the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're taking advantage of that ability
of the char to hold on to nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it creates this system where the plants
release exudates out of their root
[SPEAKER_01]: structures, signaling the microbiology to
mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of using salt-based nutrients,
I'm not saying you do, but salt-based
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient feeders are essentially forcing
the plant to feed with automatic pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: This way, since they're a living system,
the plants get exactly what they want,
[SPEAKER_01]: when they want it, how they want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That allows them to more fully express
their chemo type, whether it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: trypanoid or cannabinoid signatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing consistently boosts of that,
again, because these systems are optimized
[SPEAKER_01]: for efficiencies driven by the plant,
not by the farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have you noticed how your salt nutrient
mixes react with the biochar?
[SPEAKER_01]: You will have to cut back on your nutrient
packages pretty dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of the savings,
part of the efficiencies, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Consistently, 40% to 50% pullback of the
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually down to about 25%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what people would normally expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a fan of the less is more,
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found that over years and years of
growing, actually, indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoors is my expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa Barbara is our first go in a big,
big outdoor situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where were you committed before?
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of San Fernando Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was also in Montana for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on my indoor shows, I became a big fan
of cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically because cocoa, and the reason
for because is the lack of bugs in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's sterilized 800 degrees,
and it's worth the extra money to have it
[SPEAKER_01]: sterilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yes, I've heard it described a
million times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cocoa is like hydroponics on training
wheels.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like it because there's a buffer
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's room for mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing in rock wool for a long time,
you fail a pump, you fail a drip system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overnight, you have a nightmare problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to mention, rock wool is not a
sustainable material.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's extraction from the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are better solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are better solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, cocoa, for me, was the
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it just, it was alive,
number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, it was sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really allowed me to monitor my pH
balance, my feeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's some potassium in there,
but that doesn't hurt me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allowed me, you're training a crew,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, let's face it, we enjoy the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes things get forgot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It provides a measure of resilience in the
practice, in the growing practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which in general, we want climate
resilience.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to have flexibility in the system,
like a reed blowing in the wind,
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't break.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just modulate with your environment
around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can dial it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this obviously provides some water
retention capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is long and short fiber cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've done is we've bundled two
different strains to create, to maximize
[SPEAKER_01]: air-filled porosity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then added the biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we add the base.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the base is, as I said, we take the
char, we inoculate it with beneficials,
[SPEAKER_01]: we add the organic nutrient packages,
and we incubate it for a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And out comes our base.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the amount of base, so do you find
with this, you don't have to use additives
[SPEAKER_01]: of the beneficial bacterias and stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't need like top dress with
combo teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can.
[SPEAKER_01]: All it's going to do is boost the
acceleration of biomass of chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like it's bad, but I don't
know if you get anything better out of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: frankly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't have considered using a biochar
mixing it in just because you're so
[SPEAKER_01]: conscious of being sterile and inert when
you're doing an indoor thing, because then
[SPEAKER_01]: you're monitoring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, we create this mix indoors
intentionally to eliminate pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But couldn't you create something outdoors
where the beneficials outcompete the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a pretty delicate system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure I can actually modulate that
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in theory, with ecological theory,
yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're interested in efficiency here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're interested in creating mixes that
can be scaled, that people can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these are essentially climate
smart soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the narrative we're trying to
describe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to adopt climate smart
technologies, whether it's in
[SPEAKER_01]: transportation like the Prius,
regenerative farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of us have to activate climate smart
technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what this is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is drawdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is based on atmospheric carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, unfortunately, it's pretty hard to
transport a pallet of dirt in a Prius.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so I was on the Prius design team,
literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked for Toyota before I started this
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that took us a long time to dial in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're working now on a hybrid truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still involved with Toyota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once a Toyota guy, you never really leave
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked for Google for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once a Googler, you're always a Googler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, the problem with that whole
thing is you're going to have to get them
[SPEAKER_01]: to have a range of 700 miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until we hit that mark, an electric
truck is just, you know, because I'm the
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of guy, you know, I'll have to run to
Santa Barbara to Salinas and back in a
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a 200 mile range, 250 mile range will
leave me abandoned on the side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: road.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one solution there is the fuel cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Toyota has a fuel cell car out right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're working at Mirai.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next generation comes out in two
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of having a range of 250 miles,
they're going to have a range of 450
[SPEAKER_01]: miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an electric car.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just making the electricity real
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're testing a fuel cell semi,
again, giving you range that's competitive
[SPEAKER_01]: with diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's all we have to do is be
competitive with the substitution fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and then you're off to the races.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm stuck in a diesel truck
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some nutrients that between the
two of you think farmers don't pay enough
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to, like in terms of what their
benefit is to the plant and they kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: neglect?
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed it's mostly silica is what
people leave out of their their regimen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's mostly silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's familiar with your NPK and
your your two step or three step,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, A and B kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I find that most of them have no
concept of the necessity of silica,
[SPEAKER_01]: just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only takes a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pro-tech is an amazing product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, that's the number one
thing I see with most growers leaving out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them are familiar with beneficial
bacterias.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them are familiar with micro-ISA.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're leaving out the silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is the effect when you're
deficient in silica?
[SPEAKER_01]: The silica just it keeps your roots
cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's picking up faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just it just helps
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're able with that little bit of
silica because it's picking up so much
[SPEAKER_01]: better, even with the the micros and your
beneficial bacterias that like my feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: program is a quarter of what most people
would think.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a what?
[SPEAKER_01]: A quarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's saving 75 percent of his inputs by
optimize the efficiency of this system
[SPEAKER_01]: with with smart micro macronutrient
application and living soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I would say that's one of the
missing pieces I see is there are the
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative farmers and then there are
the the salt based farmers force feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants as opposed to activating
microbiology to deliver nutrients on
[SPEAKER_01]: demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't dislike salt based
nutrient programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just 90 percent of the people that I
watch do it overfeed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They feed them to death.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like they look great
through week seven or eight of veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden they're burning
tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're you know, it's it just becomes
horrible really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's feeding them to death.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's loving them to death.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, dude, it's less is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a farmer controlled system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of a biology controlled system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to activate the biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's let's buy a mimic natural systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you activate the biology,
get that plant picking up its nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: really well and then use a feed program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So outdoors, you know, we did us some
serious tests on our soil to see what was
[SPEAKER_01]: in it to begin with and what we can now
leave out of our feeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we had to supplement later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're moving into hemp, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're planting in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, this year we're going into hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got a lot to learn there because
this will be the first year row cropping
[SPEAKER_01]: it directly into the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have our soil tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be using a salt based program
because it's efficient to feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not heavy dosages, not getting carried
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have seven strains that we're going to
be working this year on the hemp side,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the hemp side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, going in blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, literally, you know, I have found
just like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I expect it to be just like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seed we got isn't necessarily the seed
they advertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the strains you're
exploring?
[SPEAKER_00]: And why?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would have to get my list out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, I got two strains out of
the Colorado market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a strain out of Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got two strains out of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a strain out of Spain and we got a
strain out of Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all the uber alas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your farm is where?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's in Santa Paula.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 60 acres we're putting into the
ground in Santa Paula.
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa Paula.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is where?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just this side of Fillmore in the Oxnard
Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa Rosa, Santa Paula, Fillmore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is the idea that you have no idea
what's going to respond to that
[SPEAKER_00]: microclimate?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea what's going to respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to try or what the final
tests are going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, with hemp, we've got to maintain
this ridiculous less than 0.3.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this guy knows a thing about hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're growing 60 acres in Santa Paula this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had mentioned biomimicry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, what are some biomimicry concepts
that are applied to making the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: In our case, we're biomimicking,
we're biomimicking fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fire creates biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the natural mechanism to regenerate
soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you harvest biochar and help out with
like charcoal power plants and stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Say more about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would I, how would I harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, in the burning of
charcoal, you have, you know, all of those
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon emissions that are such a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we could directly harvest those
back out, because they're not bad for
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, you know, You mean power plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like power plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the things that are coming off
the smokestacks, all of that carbon and
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 that's being pumped through the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how do we go about harvesting
that back and putting it directly into a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole immersion industry around
direct air capture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're probably not, yeah,
help yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably going to use that carbon
not to create charcoal, but to create
[SPEAKER_01]: graphene batteries or roads or cement.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of emerging industries
that are going to repurpose, administrate
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon and do something useful with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you're rebranding a problem
molecule, CO2 into a solution molecule,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's for regenerative eggs,
whether it's for next generation cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was just one of the thoughts I had
when I was playing with the, with the
[SPEAKER_01]: biochar for the first time this year was I
wonder, you know, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because, you know, obviously fossil fuels
are with us for a while longer,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if we can figure out a way to make
them not so dirty and reclaim some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon, put it into the growth cycle,
it's a win-win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, what most people are now
doing with that captured CO2 is they're
[SPEAKER_01]: injecting into old oil wells to get more
oil out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the big market right now for CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could, I could see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was just one of the thoughts
I was having, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just in a discussion where a guy's
figured out how to make plastics out of
[SPEAKER_01]: seashells, right, you know, which I
thought was amazing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you have those stacks and stacks
and stacks of oyster shells and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, piles and piles and piles of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you imagine making biochar out of hemp
residue?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we have piles of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Piles and piles and piles of stock right
now that we can't do anything with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we don't yet have the hemp market.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not the processing infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not the processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of making oil for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but you're still left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your main, your main output is going to
basically be oil, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For digestion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not like clothing or.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we don't have that infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I mean, much as we'd like to
bail up the stock and ship it somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: and make a dollar off of that,
we don't really have anywhere here set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you allowed to compost it on site?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do you have sort of some sort of
composting strategy?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, our plan actually will be
pretty much the same thing we did with all
[SPEAKER_01]: of our stock this year off the campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a biochar perspective,
would there be a way to not light it on
[SPEAKER_00]: fire, but to turn it into biochar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not just carbon though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all these micronutrients as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ash of a fire, it's all the other
nutrients besides carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes an awesome potash and just
makes your soil richer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought the whole concept of biochar
is you heat it to just before it does
[SPEAKER_00]: combust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like, you're not like biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're almost making it a coal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is, here's a diagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this, the axis here is temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the low temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is high temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ideal temperature is about 600 degrees
C where you create these highly irregular
[SPEAKER_01]: surfaces with lots of surface area that
provide habitat.
[SPEAKER_01]: For microbiology, the hotter it gets,
you get these ordered sheets, get
[SPEAKER_01]: graphene.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this end, you have these very
irregular, they're called fullerene
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think that's one of the reasons why
biochar is so stable because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: irregular orientation of the carbon rings
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the idea, I mean, the idea is to
like store carbon in soils, like draw it
[SPEAKER_01]: down and store it and then do something
useful with it and designing the charts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's super cool that you're doing
biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for doing that, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's any way we could help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was an experiment we did this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I really found as a problem
this year is our soil was caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like a soil chef.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have a recipe, like,
what are you thinking about as you build
[SPEAKER_00]: up a soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're like, okay, I need this to
give it air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need this for the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need this for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's, what goes into creating a
soil recipe?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the architecture of the soil to
start with, the physics of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can it do what it needs to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The combined chemistry and biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you optimize both of those for
efficient delivery of nutrients to plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have a question, David,
is why did you leave perlite out from this
[SPEAKER_01]: mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we feel like perlite in some ways
is taking up space where a root should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really need perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it really helps with drainage,
you know, and getting that water to
[SPEAKER_01]: penetrate deep into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have the short and long fiber
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really provides that, that air filled
porosity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't find it packed?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, we really don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we would prefer people to use
these and these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because this is a renewable resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I understand the perlite thing,
but you know, I mean even... We should,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you'd be interested, we'd be happy to,
you know, support a trial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could show you how this actually
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd be interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, give me your card.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about it as soon as we get to
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I actually have, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: 240 pots that we haven't, 240,
260 gallon pots that we haven't filled
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't purchased dirt for, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the hoop houses in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just stalled because I know my permit
expires.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't want to invest in soil
if I have no permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of a tough spot because before you
could just do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you were under the radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, now that you've come out,
you're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely killing me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's making me regret.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't turn back the clock?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't turn back the clock.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife called me out for going legal,
you know, for doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, it'll just be a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: She called you out for going legal.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an awesome way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was just like, she saw the people in
charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, she saw that, you know,
we went through so much effort to get
[SPEAKER_01]: permitting and then I like gave it to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She gave up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you came from the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came from, I've been doing this since
1986.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk to me about strains from the past
that you can't find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: True skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The golf ball indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody has it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one, the original Mendo Purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Golf ball indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw it coming out of Mendocino,
Ukiah, that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just absolutely phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it disappeared in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those days.
[SPEAKER_01]: The camp raids were more effective than
people think they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, a lot of grows were left
intact up there, but a lot of strains were
[SPEAKER_01]: lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: By just attrition or by?
[SPEAKER_01]: By both.
[SPEAKER_01]: By both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cross breeding the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, pollination that people didn't
really know where that pollen came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, we had some great sticky
weed in the late 80s, early 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where were you growing in the late
80s, early 90s?
[SPEAKER_01]: San Fernando Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk about the SFV OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I still have that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had it for 27 years, continuously
cloned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's the history of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it actually came in through Point Magoo
Naval Air Station in a backpack from those
[SPEAKER_01]: old Navy SEALs that were working in
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got a cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got a cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a bag of seeds, you know,
directly out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what made that a standout cultivar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Purely a fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the original PK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So SFV OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its original name was PK, you know,
the pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the original SFV.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a pain in the ass to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like an ivy plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was just comparing compared
to your Northern California indica plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that were nice and uniform and bushy and
grew up like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This thing, you switched it into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its initial stretch could be as much as
two or three feet in 11, 12, 14 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maintaining a light height on those was
just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and your bud structure was
nowhere as close together as the indicas
[SPEAKER_01]: out of Northern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it would be like a bud and then
a blank spot for eight or nine inches and
[SPEAKER_01]: another bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was like an ivy plant just
going everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting that plant to respond properly
and get a tight bud structure was just
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really a tough, tough play.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it still is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your farm called?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mr. Nice Guy LLC is our farm in Santa
Barbara.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's licensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: From Half Baked?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need Dave Chappelle as a brand
ambassador.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the soil building.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a fan of worms too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Release worms in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're growing in pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Release worms in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into the pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right into the pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both red worms and night crawlers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Night crawlers will go deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red will stay on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just... And in terms of like,
are you constantly like, I think of kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of the moisture level in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you want to keep it in a bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it to get super dry and
then overwater it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like keep going, blowing past this like
the band that the microbes love.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to live in a swamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I don't water to run off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like we watered our pots every 10 or
14 days all through the off season just to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep the worms alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the worms were doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And breeding and growing and digging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're leaving the soil in those pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are you doing to build the soil
back up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing anything?
Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: We turned it and letting the worms go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Letting the worms do their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, this year, because of the
biochar, I think because of the biochar,
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil was a little bit hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not because of the biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that, as I said,
the biochar needs to be activated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a couple years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guarantee you that certainly next
year you won't have that problem at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have any problem whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it may be the worm castings
that we added in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the char should take care of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just a little bit hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has enough nutrients for six weeks in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this should be hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was my week.
[SPEAKER_01]: One complaint, well, one of my complaints
was our soil was hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you don't want a hot soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's inefficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it creates stress on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking forward to this year
because I know it calmed down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that live release of worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: How big of a granular was the char itself
you got?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it heterogeneous?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it consistent?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's close.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's close to what we see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a little bit thicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit coarser.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can feel it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time we were mixed in, it was
pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we were mixing it old school style
with a bucket loader.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just turning and turning and turning
and turning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the fact that you're using worms
because you're creating worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's silly to have to buy them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just bought worms and let them go and
fed the hell out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do nothing but clean your roots
and take care of the soil and give you
[SPEAKER_01]: love all in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like you drank the Kool-Aid
around bio-mimicry natural soil systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes so much sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It totally makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why waste the money?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why waste the money?
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, you're really championing the whole
regenerative farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get all those little tunnels
that the water can squeeze down in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Win, win, win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Air-filled porosity, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's super exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for doing what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll give you a call and we'll figure
out how to get some soil up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really see this as kind of a transition
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a situation where we can pick
it up by the dump truck load?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either in super sacks or in bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's made indoors, we don't like
using dump trucks, I'll be honest with
[SPEAKER_01]: you, for pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just really want to make sure you get a
clean soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have four-yard super sacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those can be in a dump truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how we had soil delivered out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dump trucks came up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We mixed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually mixed outside, I told you,
old school style, bucket loaders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And did you see any pathogenic behavior
later because of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that's what we're trying to control
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the control of indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Controlled environment agriculture is a
huge, huge opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been at it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really good at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand the problems there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest, this year we struggled
outdoor a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go backwards, can't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even though you're illegal,
you can still pivot from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on getting indoors
permitted.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just haven't been successful yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I prefer to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, I applied, I applied,
I applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually have a Volatiles license out
of King City.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a distributor license out of King
City.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have retail non-storefront license
statewide out of King City.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's King City?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a two and a half hours north of
Santa Barbara.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so it's up in... Yeah, up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: By Builton stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so further north.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll use that as our processing
distribution center.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our first big permitted grow came out of
Santa Barbara.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying for permits in Santa Paula,
San Fernando Valley, for indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you part of any growing association?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I work with Justin a little
bit, but no.
[SPEAKER_01]: State independent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like Ryan Martinez, who was the head
grower for Jungle Boys, he was my best
[SPEAKER_01]: friend since 16.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd laugh because I hadn't this particular
gentleman.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the way the world works.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife and I are up at a show in Northern
California at the High Times event.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hit up the Jungle Boys tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give out A's very often when we're
judging weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we walk in and I'm standing there at
the counter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, honey, check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is an A plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: She like looks at me in shock.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, those three right... I get the
hype, babe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those three right there are A pluses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff over there is kind of a B.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these three right here, those are A
pluses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solid genetics right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like four months later, I'm in another
conversation with a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, oh yeah, do you know who
the head grower for Jungle Boys is?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, it's Ryan Martinez.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just started laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, had to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of five people I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I grew up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a big grower right here in Malibu.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he helped me develop my program back
when we were 18 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: We worked together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Screwing up plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feeding them to death.
[SPEAKER_01]: Live and learn, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This iteration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just died of tears when it just was
like, oh my God, what a small world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Called him up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, hey dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, Adam, what are you doing there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You had lost touch with him?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I had been in Montana growing for
seven years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he came up actually when I set up my
program in Montana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he's my best friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we just had gone our ways and doing
our thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he got married and had a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was down here busy as hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was up there just busy as hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just living your life, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And just a few highs, but not any real
communication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just died of tears when I had to be
one of five people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was either Ryan Martinez, Marshall
Davis, Kelly Bellisimo, who grew that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our jungle boys out of LA?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're huge out of LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've wanted me to come on board with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But their culture isn't exactly my
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a certain swagger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more of a low-key, quiet farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't play with anything white.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think of the emergence of
plant medicines as a viable life strategy,
[SPEAKER_01]: like psilocybin?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to see the research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being in the medical industry for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I jumped into the medical industry,
250 and compliant, right when it happened
[SPEAKER_01]: in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started in 1997.
[SPEAKER_01]: So DC Collective and a couple other
collectives in the valley, I worked with
[SPEAKER_01]: starting in 1997.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in 2006, when Montana went legal,
that's where my family had moved to when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you know what, let's do
Montana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went up there and for seven years,
eight years, we really worked hard up
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Montana was a unique opportunity because
their issuances of medical cards were so
[SPEAKER_01]: restrictive that the people who got cards
were truly sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're doing in your agriculture
practices, what we're championing is the
[SPEAKER_01]: tip of the regenerative egg spear that
will influence the whole industry in the
[SPEAKER_01]: next 10 to 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's something that needs to happen
because the draining of our water,
[SPEAKER_01]: the salting of our fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I suck because I'm a farmer
and I understand salts and it's easy and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's quick and it's an instant fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get it from both sides, that yes,
using them long-term contaminates our
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, but I'm down to a quarter of what a
normal farmer would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I'm still, I'm using alfalfa
pellets and it's another thing I'm using
[SPEAKER_01]: in my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm creating a rich soil of
nutrient-based solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wanna see what's in our soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I show you the pack?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll bring you the labels.
Thank you.
