[SPEAKER_01]: We're really excited about, yes,
like a fertigation system called Rhythm
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're just having installed and so
that can really just dial in some of our
[SPEAKER_01]: systems further.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like we can actually see like how dry
the plant is and what that time like,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, here's when I watered first,
this is my dry back time and the system
[SPEAKER_01]: will know exactly based on the parameters
we set in it when to water it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some other data that we collect,
okay, what's that runoff look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the tissue analysis of the plant
look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the soil holding what's still
inside there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can kind of go back and program and
dial in these strains even further.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we've developed a regimented
system where, you know, we know the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics of the strains, you know,
like my Saturn OG is an Afghani cross and
[SPEAKER_01]: so, you know, I want to borrow that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can actually optimize the system
faster because we have that good data set
[SPEAKER_01]: of collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know it's like, okay, this Afghani
likes this kind of fertilizer blend or
[SPEAKER_01]: this little bit of soil difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we find another strain that might
have another Afghani cross, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, well, we've already got a baseline
for that genetic so we can optimize it
[SPEAKER_01]: faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: By doing that, but I'm really excited
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the environmental control
systems like Link4, we're working with
[SPEAKER_01]: them pretty closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited with kind of the
data collection and now we've hooked up a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of those servers and sensors to a SQL
server database and we can actually pull
[SPEAKER_01]: all the data out of that and mash it up
with like these data visualization
[SPEAKER_01]: software.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the thrust of it is data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that collecting more and more data
about how much water they're using and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth and really getting it down to a very
fine art is really when you get the most
[SPEAKER_00]: production, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The cleanest production also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's repeatability too.
