[SPEAKER_02]: What were you guys surprised most by it on
YouTube?
[SPEAKER_02]: How quick the little guy just got
undertaken.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing that surprised me most was very,
very calculated moves in lawmaking that
[SPEAKER_02]: literally just undercut the farmer,
undercut everybody, and then pretty soon
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody just started going into fear and
backbiting and all this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, kudos to everybody who's surviving
and putting in all the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you research the 1862 Homestead
Act, that was the methods for removing the
[SPEAKER_01]: small subsistence farmer in the way for
Big Ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're following the same protocol to
wipe out the cannabis farmers now,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're doing quick work of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the things that's really
caught me off guard is I knew at some
[SPEAKER_01]: point there would be legal facilities,
and so I just put all my focus into
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing the knowledge that would be
valuable at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really put my bandwidth on much
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of this other stuff really caught me
off guard.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that really caught me
off guard was how quickly we're diving to
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really breaks my heart because it's
so unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, you're going to some of these
trim farms that are doing acres and acres
[SPEAKER_01]: and acres of just garbage, and their
business model is literally to race it to
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom, sustain people at the bottom,
and win out at the lowest quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality drop from last year to this
year has just been remarkable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just trying to be a champion for ...
We can produce low quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can produce more.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to do it in a low quality
fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's big oil producers, dank stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was talking to Tim Blake about oil,
for me, on an oil return, they're doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: through a hydrocarbon extraction,
and we like to see 18% and up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm talking to Tim, he's talking
about 17% and this and that, and I go,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, no, I mean hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh shit, bubble hash at 17%
returns.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would make some freaking oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the genetics and some of the
things people have are stashed and ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to go, but some of those people don't have
licenses yet, and that's the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: change for me to see in 2018 to now,
or 17, is just the remarkable amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that were there, that aren't there,
that are working their way in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pay to play type of thing,
and it's just definitely ... You got to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay on your toes to be in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not coming for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go after it, and that's the
biggest challenge is staying afloat with
[SPEAKER_00]: all the different changes and fluctuations
that have to keep happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're not going to stop,
and whether you're a small farm or whether
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a large farm, adopting
science-based principles for your decision
[SPEAKER_01]: making is the way to survive in the market
as the profit is dropping, because we
[SPEAKER_01]: can't afford to have catastrophic crop
loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to do predictive testing to try to
assess what the tripping points are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be, and we need to mitigate those risks
so that we can still produce a crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can still be profitable, and we can
have an opportunity to make it through
[SPEAKER_01]: these next couple years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing a lot of pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that's taking out farmers is
pests and disease from different clone
[SPEAKER_01]: nurseries.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my hydroponic mentors, he lost six
of the first eight flowering rooms because
[SPEAKER_01]: the clones he got from a nursery had
viruses in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What really blows my mind is how long
these products are being pushed before
[SPEAKER_01]: it's being accepted and dealt with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just recently had a situation where the
grow-off passed out a couple clones with
[SPEAKER_01]: some root aphids, and they immediately
jumped on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They immediately made a public
announcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jodri came out and immediately owned up to
it and tried to make it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the Instagram gangs tried to
mean them off the planet or the earth,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is like the first response.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unfortunate that that's the view that
the community has of that type of
[SPEAKER_01]: situation, because in my situation,
I analyze these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been hired by three nurseries in the
last calendar year to deal with root
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those farms sent out cuts for four
months with black and brown root aphids
[SPEAKER_01]: without owning up to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You finally get the licensing,
you finally get going, and then someone
[SPEAKER_01]: with a shitty conscience gives you some
horrible clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing this across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hats off to Jodri for being the only dude
with balls enough to own up to some shit
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows how to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing would be, fuck,
I forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came from the world of medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a nurse before I decided to do soil
science.
[SPEAKER_02]: In medicine, you absolutely own up to
every problem immediately or people die.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kudos to Jodri for stepping up to the
plate on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sets the bar and the standard for
everybody the way it should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no need to hide any mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You absolutely own that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the proper way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kudos for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin's the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Future Cannabis Project, coming at you.
Thank you.
