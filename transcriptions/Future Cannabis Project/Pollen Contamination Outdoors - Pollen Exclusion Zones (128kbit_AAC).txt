[SPEAKER_00]: You have particular experience in the
dangers of pollen contamination,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, since both feminized and
regular auto seeds exist, I think this
[SPEAKER_00]: would be a good moment for you to make
your pitch for, you know, running,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, not running males outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love you to share the story about your
valley just to make everybody more aware
[SPEAKER_00]: of the dangers of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a pollinated crop and you're
growing outside, you're going to lose 30%
[SPEAKER_01]: of your total cannabinoids and 50% of your
biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seed is a tremendous energy sapping
creation that ends up taking the power
[SPEAKER_01]: away from your plants and reducing the,
not only the profitability, but the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of cannabinoids that you can
harvest outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Oregon, at this point, we're trying
to launch a nonprofit organization that
[SPEAKER_01]: will help in the future in terms of
creating buffer zones between farms so
[SPEAKER_01]: that we don't have issues of pollen
contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Oregon Cannabis Pinning
Association, ocpa.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only thing I'll advertise today,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're really just kind of in a,
we're trying to raise awareness this year
[SPEAKER_01]: and then actually move into a more formal
pinning system for 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: But pollen outdoors is a huge issue and
there are a number of people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: either growing regular male female seeds
or trying to create seed outdoors just
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can produce so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tremendously productive way to make
seed, but we've had to basically go to a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of small time breeders who are saying,
oh man, this is the big rush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure that I can make a
bunch of seed this year and then sell it
[SPEAKER_01]: for next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not knowing that in doing so, not only are
they not going to get a successful crop
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's other people who are doing
that and now you have a contaminated crop
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself with no purity that you won't be
able to sell if you're a moral or ethical
[SPEAKER_01]: person, but you're also going to destroy
all of your surrounding neighbors ability
[SPEAKER_01]: to actually grow a crop and have something
that's valuable at the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really comes down, it's a touchy
subject for a lot of people, but it is
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely in terms of being able to
create an environment that we all can
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to produce cannabis in and an
environment that our kids can potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to produce cannabis in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon is one of those really,
really lucky spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in a sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can grow good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have great breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have good water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have good land, but we really need to
make sure that we can protect that and
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen travels a long ways, long ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that these pollen exclusion
zones, which I've been calling them,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have an actual official name for
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, pollen exclusion zone, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I've been calling it to
people and the first time that Seth posted
[SPEAKER_00]: about this on their Instagram,
it was ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thread was mostly people saying,
you will not tell me what to do with my
[SPEAKER_00]: property, damn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monsanto, you want to control the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get where people are coming from
because I don't like to be told what to do
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it is, it's an economic and
horticultural opportunity for right where
[SPEAKER_00]: almost all of us live here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're seeing is that,
just like Napa Valley, they are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: world class wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are certain things that the
community has all agreed to do and not do
[SPEAKER_00]: so that they don't screw up the wineries
and their ability to grow grapes because
[SPEAKER_00]: it brings so much economic power to the
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, that's what I see for these
beautiful valleys throughout Oregon where
[SPEAKER_00]: they've already got hemp farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a burgeoning industry that is light
years ahead of many of the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of the world that are going to try
to follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have a lead, even though I
don't want anybody to tell me what to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with my property either, I really hope
that those people would keep open minds
[SPEAKER_00]: because the reasons for not growing
pollinating cannabis plants outdoors make
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of sense for the Oregon community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is lost on a lot of
people because they haven't let their ears
[SPEAKER_00]: be open to the argument yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people think it's about control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem with this is that it's not
about trying to prevent people from making
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage people to go do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've said before, it's emancipatory
not only to grow it, but to breed it and
[SPEAKER_01]: then see the outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's part of what makes us human.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all could probably agree that people
have a right to fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have a fire on your property.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool until it jumps your fence and
burns down your neighbor's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, that's your liability.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not your fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone in Oregon has a right to farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't have a right to exclude
other people from being able to engage in
[SPEAKER_01]: meaningful economic activity that not only
is helping themselves, but helping other
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't the general motto?
[SPEAKER_02]: Your fun ends when the other guy's
displeasure begins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you do not have a right to plant
seeds outside, I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have a right to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Period.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's going to impact your neighbor,
you don't have that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also for folks who are thinking about
doing three, four plants in your backyard
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're going to bring in a male,
that's way different than we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about growing acres of regular seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're next door to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had to take, because of that,
and we don't want to stop anybody from
[SPEAKER_01]: having that right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to be able to protect our interests,
we had to make sure that our greenhouses
[SPEAKER_01]: are sealed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only make seed in places that we're
comfortable making.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once it comes out, we still have
to test it just to make sure that it is
[SPEAKER_01]: what we think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to let you know that Seth practices
what he preaches, it is really crazy to go
[SPEAKER_00]: into their breeding warehouses or
greenhouses because they are, they suck
[SPEAKER_00]: you in, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that none of the pollen escapes when
you open it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got all the air being pulled into
a filter so that you open the door and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, and then you're sucked in so
that all the pollen is kept inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cool, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: He had straight hair before he went in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha.
