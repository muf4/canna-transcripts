[SPEAKER_00]: Having a scale and how does that affect
reaching the result of a harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most common tripping points that everybody
seems to be experiencing come from the
[SPEAKER_00]: same root cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody's trying to get to the
end result fast without establishing the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper infrastructure or knowledge base or
mechanisms for analyzing the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have investors that are new to the
industry that want widgets and they want
[SPEAKER_00]: them now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so growers are altering their style.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're watering multiple times through
the day to try and feed the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: push them and coupled with a bad
greenhouse environment that leads to pest
[SPEAKER_00]: and disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's different ways that that
manifests, but that's like the main thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a whole bunch of carts in front of
horses and we just need to like look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the horses for 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a little bit more open dialogue
between the people that actually have
[SPEAKER_00]: growing experience and the people paying
for the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's remarkable how many people buy a
greenhouse with an investor and another
[SPEAKER_00]: guy and nobody that cultivates is involved
in that conversation, which is mind
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a bunch of facility configurations
are chosen and those do not lead to plant
[SPEAKER_00]: health and vigorous harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leads to resorting to chemicals and
failing tests and having crop loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the cost to the operation of,
you know, trying to cram this thing into
[SPEAKER_00]: the hole before everybody loses their
opportunity to find gold?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how that manifests with the customers
that I work with in living soils is we
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of people that are moving from
old technologies, hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutrient quantity mindset,
and they go, you have to use a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: quantity of nutrients to get a certain
plant result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the only way we know how to get
a harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're just pushing on that same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we move from that old,
nutrient quantity techniques to a living
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, which is a nutrient availability
system, and we're relying on nutrients to
[SPEAKER_00]: be produced and available, when we
increase the quantity, we slow that system
[SPEAKER_00]: down and it becomes problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pushing water, pushing feed,
all leads to crop loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question essentially is how does the
different techniques, processes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and practices we're doing negatively
affect us at the regulated scale?
[SPEAKER_00]: Techniques that we used to do on a small
scale were manageable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we're inside of a smaller space,
we can manage the pest and disease that's
[SPEAKER_00]: manifested from the techniques and
processes we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we move up into these larger,
just like Jonathan said, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking acre properties now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you cannot have highly trained
hands-on skill looking at all those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and dealing with things in the way that we
did before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The techniques and processes and things
that we've created an emotional attachment
[SPEAKER_00]: to at the smaller scale, when we move to
the higher regulated process, those
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques are actually the source of our
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the biggest, most difficult
thing to communicate to these growers is
[SPEAKER_00]: that this three-day tea brew that they're
making at high altitude is literally and
[SPEAKER_00]: mathematically the cause for the russet
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you suggest that to people,
they take it as a personal attack against
[SPEAKER_00]: internet heroes and personalities and
their religion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets really deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just math here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can open up a first-year freshman
biology textbook, and we can identify
[SPEAKER_00]: these organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can do this ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to take my word for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can learn to use a microscope,
and you can see why this is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the techniques that we used at the
smaller scale are literally the cause for
[SPEAKER_00]: failure at the regulated scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now we have somebody that is using
scientific methods for analyzing your
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are finding listeria,
and they're finding E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, and they are finding these
disease-causing organisms that fail a
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can understand that conditions
create biological organism proliferation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can understand that the conditions
are creating those organisms to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can avoid that test failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most common problem is somebody doing
a tea brew that's actually brewing
[SPEAKER_00]: disease-causing organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You spread that throughout your facility,
and then you have pest and disease
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem as a community is we don't
have much reference for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just barely getting a reference
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The information has been around for
decades, but it's now starting to pick up
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cannabis industry with the growers
that are trying to find more responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're just barely in the last year
or two starting to get a community
[SPEAKER_00]: reference for these measurements on an
actual scale, like actual understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're just barely getting a
reference for it.
