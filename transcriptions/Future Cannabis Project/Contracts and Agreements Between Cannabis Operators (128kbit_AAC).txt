[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the interesting things for
the audience to know is more about what
[SPEAKER_02]: your business model is, each of you,
and then how you've experienced entering
[SPEAKER_02]: into this heavily regulated market and
when you saw a shift towards contracting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Chris, we'll start with you from the
distribution perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in distribution cannabis for
about four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And up until this year, most people didn't
want to touch contra.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely weren't interested in
exclusivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're still very much in an
industry that's not interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: exclusivity, at least from the distributor
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless, if you're, I think if you're one
of the top leading distributors,
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps, my group's a little bit newer in
this company I'm with now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people still want to see an LOI that
helps define terms, some kind of loser
[SPEAKER_01]: agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's important,
at least, set expectation, define what it
[SPEAKER_01]: is that you're going to be doing in your
service, no matter what segment of the
[SPEAKER_01]: market you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name is Mike Musali, and I'm with
Seven Leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a contract manufacturer based in
Orange County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have a distribution arm,
but for the sake of the conversation,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let Chris talk about
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, me and my partners, we come from
outside the space and we are very used to
[SPEAKER_00]: only dealing with contracts in terms of
making agreements in the supply chain or
[SPEAKER_00]: with other businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, I can't really say it's a new
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is new for us is that as the industry
is developing, we are noticing as a
[SPEAKER_00]: contract manufacturer, and speaking to
hundreds of brands and hundreds of new
[SPEAKER_00]: potential clients, every single deal is a
little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some basics to every contract,
but ultimately every contract has some
[SPEAKER_00]: modification to it, depending on what the
brand is asking us to do and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: goals are of that brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And us as the manufacturer, what we feel
comfortable with performing from a service
[SPEAKER_00]: services perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, good evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Lori Glauser with AvioLabs,
and we have 11 labs now across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: and Canada, and I came to this industry
about four years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I came in, I came also from outside
the industry where contracts were
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we acquired our first small lab
in Bend, Oregon, one of the first things I
[SPEAKER_03]: did was I dug through all the customer
agreements.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was shocked by how many Johnny Grow
from Bend with no other information,
[SPEAKER_03]: no phone number, no email address,
first name only, customer agreements.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really a lot of learning for
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will say over the past four years,
there's been a tremendous amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: additional learning, and I have all kinds
of interesting stories to share if we get
[SPEAKER_03]: there about what improper contracting can
lead to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like hearing that we're all coming from
other industries that are fully fledged,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, multimillion dollar,
if not billion dollar industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an important thing for every
operator in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a discussion that I have with many of
my clients is let's look at same or
[SPEAKER_02]: similar industries, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We are a heavily regulated industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I dare say one of the heaviest regulated
industries for an agricultural commodity
[SPEAKER_02]: that we are producing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, an alcohol bottle,
let's remember, doesn't have to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: child's resistance to it at any point
before it is B2C sales, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no exit bag that is associated
with an alcohol product that is
[SPEAKER_02]: responsible for hundreds of thousands of
deaths a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, for all of those in the room,
this is no big news, zero deaths to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis that is, you know, properly grown
and manufactured.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's important to be looking at those
lessons and listening to these gold
[SPEAKER_02]: standard operators who are pulling from
those experiences and are able to provide
[SPEAKER_02]: you with this level of advice and look
inward.
[SPEAKER_02]: What have you done before?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've entered into a contract,
sometimes it's simple for when you are,
[SPEAKER_02]: where you live, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you enter into a lease, these are
very important terms for what you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we can start there with these
operators is asking with the ABCs of the
[SPEAKER_02]: basics before you even get to contracting
for your business, telling us about
[SPEAKER_02]: getting into the spaces you were in and
what that sort of agreement was like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think different from lawyers,
that's one of the biggest impediments to
[SPEAKER_02]: getting into the space is how did you get
into the real estate you were in and what
[SPEAKER_02]: was that contract and agreement discussion
like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that was the threshold for getting
your permits to operate how you're
[SPEAKER_02]: operating now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll start talking to and looking at
real estate properties and you will find
[SPEAKER_01]: even within specific zoning that meets the
standard, it's a little difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes to find landlords that are
interested in participating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually talked to a group recently and
I said, hey, we're licensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a licensed facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just looking for some extra office
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just need a few offices for some
meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can demonstrate we're compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to have any product there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally just office space.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a very clean, compliant company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy basically hung up on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a commercial real estate broker.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I need is some office space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just looking to have some meeting
space in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they still wouldn't even talk to us
even though we're compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go to actually have a facility
where you're keeping your cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: finding somebody that will participate is
a little bit tougher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the negotiations vary.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first deal I did where I've got my
licensed store, it was a handshake deal,
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple hour meeting and the guy just
wanted a big chunk of cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are a little more
sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you definitely see a variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, I think some of my people were
touring one of your labs today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had some in the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had great things to say about your
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So contracts or I guess the terms of
contracts for properties can vary quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple things to note are you're always
going to need a property in the green
[SPEAKER_00]: zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The zone that the municipality designates
is OK to operate a cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's a few caveats to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is just because a property is in the
green zone doesn't mean that it's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: fit for the use that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for an example, trying to take an
office suite and make a volatile
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing facility out of it,
nobody's going to tell you, you can't do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, some cities will even pass
you through the conditional use permit
[SPEAKER_00]: phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you get down to the building
department and to fire code, you learn
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly that is not a real fruitful
endeavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would do research ahead of time,
understand exactly what kind of business
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to open and what are the building
and fire code requirements in general for
[SPEAKER_00]: that business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as far as negotiating with,
call it landlords, if you're not buying
[SPEAKER_00]: the building outright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Negotiating with landlords, like Chris
said, can be either a very quick process
[SPEAKER_00]: or it could be a very long process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two facilities in Costa Mesa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first was a pretty quick process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second was about a three month
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are going to typically be paying
some X times the regular market price.
[SPEAKER_00]: In rent, because it is a cannabis zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: In certain cases, even hearing of
landlords doing revenue shares or forcing
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue shares on gross receipts of
whatever comes out of their building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not easy to obtain real estate,
which is a major hurdle moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing with contracts, you always
want to leave an out for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if for whatever reason your
municipality denies you your permit to
[SPEAKER_00]: operate, you can get out of a lease and
you're not locked in for the duration of
[SPEAKER_00]: that lease.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've had a couple of properties
that we got into through acquisition and
[SPEAKER_03]: then the municipality decided to opt out
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got to find a new location pretty
quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it takes a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: hard work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from landlords' perspective,
you know, I'm working right now with a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of properties that are looking at
insurances and getting in property
[SPEAKER_03]: insurance for a cannabis business is
really tough as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: They ask for a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a request today for my operating
SOPs just so I could get some pollution
[SPEAKER_03]: insurance, which I hadn't had before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's always something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all really great points and just
lessons that you can learn when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going out and looking at property.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hear the word green zone for that for
edification.
[SPEAKER_02]: That usually means that a city or a county
has identified an overlay zone or certain
[SPEAKER_02]: zones within the city commercial,
heavy commercial C3, C2IL that are
[SPEAKER_02]: allowable for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important to note that just because
it's in a green zone, cities often include
[SPEAKER_02]: additional sensitive receptor uses outside
and above what the state provides,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is 600 feet from schools K through
12, daycare centers and youth centers
[SPEAKER_02]: where children recreate.
[SPEAKER_02]: These can often be expanded to parks,
churches, residential areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're shifting definitions.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's constantly something where Lori says
you have to take the temperature of where
[SPEAKER_02]: you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really want to investigate whether or
not this is the right property for you and
[SPEAKER_02]: your use, which gets me to bringing in
professional consultants and attorneys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you heard from attorneys who want to
work with operators.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a unique perspective for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: To hear from operators when they're
vetting professionals what that experience
[SPEAKER_02]: is like.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you engage with a lawyer,
a CPA, if you're a distributor or a
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturer, even a testing lab,
a third-party waste hauler?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you use a third-party waste hauler?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you haul your cannabis waste yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're talking about fire and
security, especially if you're a
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturer, we're talking about going
through fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you hire a sprinkler consultant?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something I had to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are sprinkler experts, your utility
experts.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are landscape architects that you
need to onboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so whereas your attorney can sometimes
act as your quarterback, these are
[SPEAKER_02]: business decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've got three incredible business
owners.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important to understand what they
look at when they're vetting a
[SPEAKER_02]: professional service provider.
[SPEAKER_01]: Newer people in the industry will make
sure the competent ones will make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: they understand the laws and the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can go find somebody and they
can have a great presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look like they really know what
they're trying out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you meet with them and everything
seems great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can distinguish the people that have
the wisdom and the experience from the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because often, at least in my experience,
especially with attorneys, what you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: find is the newer people, they can tell
you the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's relatively easy to say,
oh, this is going to be a challenge,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is going to be a challenge,
this is going to be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the 10 minutes we've been here,
you've already gathered there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good experienced people, the ones that
you want, are the ones that say,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a challenge, but I know how to
work through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an issue, but we can do this
and this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a real problem and there's
nothing we can do about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to move on, do something
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the key is finding the people that
have the solutions, not the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: can identify the problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that's decently competent can
identify the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely second Chris on what he was
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the proof is in the pudding,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a new industry and there's a lot of
consultants, there's a lot of lawyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, the one thing you can do
to arm yourself is read the regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that sounds very simple,
but you'd be surprised how many people do
[SPEAKER_00]: not do it and they rely on other people to
tell them that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a easy way to cross reference and
double check people right on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as going through building and fire,
the input I can add there is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the project that you have
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're opening, call it a distribution
facility, it's probably going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more of a simple process with
building and fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus opening a type seven volatile
manufacturing facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, like Pamela said,
it's a business decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have experts dealing with
experts of like mind, meaning you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: fire consultant dealing with a fire
marshal of your municipality, chances are
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have a much better
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have much better results
and things are going to work in your favor
[SPEAKER_00]: a little quicker and a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does add up very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, the opportunity cost
of not being in market plus paying for
[SPEAKER_00]: your facility, your real estate,
whether it's a mortgage or rent,
[SPEAKER_00]: that also adds up very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes a lot more sense in the right
situations to bring in extra personnel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just like having employees,
you want to vet out your professionals
[SPEAKER_03]: very carefully.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right about this feedback.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I think back to my first year in
the industry when I provided consulting
[SPEAKER_03]: services to help about 35 or 40 licensees
get their licenses in various states,
[SPEAKER_03]: I've come across a number of other
consultants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if somebody can, for example,
maybe they have 10 years experience
[SPEAKER_03]: growing, that doesn't necessarily mean
they're going to be a great cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: consultant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or if they worked at a dispensary for a
while, does that mean they can necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: work in a dispensary?
[SPEAKER_03]: You really need to make sure you have
people that are well-rounded, that know
[SPEAKER_03]: the regs, that can communicate and work
with you at the highest professional level
[SPEAKER_03]: to get you to where you want your business
to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most important takeaway from what you
all said and what I tell my clients
[SPEAKER_02]: consistently, is to read the regs and read
the information that your consultants or
[SPEAKER_02]: your attorney are providing to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the single best piece of advice
that I can give, that I know that these
[SPEAKER_02]: operators have done, is when I work on an
application for a client, that is your
[SPEAKER_02]: promise, that is your commitment to the
city.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every single word that is in there,
you are accountable for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot tell you when I have had clients
that have not read that, and then they had
[SPEAKER_02]: an article published where city council
members said, I'm so proud of the
[SPEAKER_02]: community benefits plan by my client,
and my client called me and said,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, I'm committed to doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so anything that your representative
writes, if it's a security plan and you've
[SPEAKER_02]: hired a security company and they say
you're going to use ballistic glass in
[SPEAKER_02]: your facility, and then the police
department comes and walks that facility
[SPEAKER_02]: and they don't see it, that is a potential
revocation of your license or a failure to
[SPEAKER_02]: issue a certificate of occupancy that you
have tarnished your relationship with this
[SPEAKER_02]: municipality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whereas you're vetting and hiring very
competent consultants, it is also on you
[SPEAKER_02]: as an owner to be empowered to read these
documents.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are done for you and you're the
operators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure that we'll hear, you know
your business better than I know your
[SPEAKER_02]: business as an attorney.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can ask the right questions,
I can walk the sites, I can read the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations, I can come up with solutions
to the hypotheticals that we presented
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier, but at the end of the day,
I am not running your business and I am
[SPEAKER_02]: not the expert.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you should feel empowered to ask these
questions the tough questions and say this
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't seem right to me and for my
contract.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can talk to the audience about
those moments that you've had about
[SPEAKER_02]: interacting with your professionals as the
professional business provider,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that is always an empowering
moment for operators that they feel
[SPEAKER_02]: uncomfortable doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when working with professionals,
keep in mind that they're really
[SPEAKER_03]: incentivized to get a lot of business from
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that might mean working with the
security consultant that wants to give you
[SPEAKER_03]: the bulletproof glass and the high end
cameras and you end up with a $100,000
[SPEAKER_03]: security system when a $20,000 security
system would work great and it would be
[SPEAKER_03]: easier to maintain compliance going
forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing with HVAC and lighting in your
grow and your dispensary furnishings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be careful about over designing something
because you're committed to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say a lot of it is a balance
between what is required and how
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable you want to make your
municipality feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously we have state regulations,
but in many municipalities, their
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements are even more conservative
than the state regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it ends up becoming a financial
balancing act, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where a city consultant can
really help you identify what the city is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be okay with and what's over kill
and maybe could save you $40,000,
[SPEAKER_00]: $30,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to consultants, my
experience and my group's experience has
[SPEAKER_00]: always been a consultant that knows the
city inside and out and has relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: with current city officials is the person
you want to hire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little weary of consultants that
say, you know, I have all of Southern
[SPEAKER_00]: California and I can get you in wherever
you want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have one here and one guy there,
but as you learn very quickly going
[SPEAKER_00]: through this process, it takes a lot of
people in the city to back you and back
[SPEAKER_00]: your group to move things quicker and get
you ultimately what you're hoping to get
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely echo both Mike and Lori and
to Pam's question about the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically about the consultants and,
you know, maybe stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really kind of follows and echoes
what they were saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for me, the best story I'd have is
when I was getting, I've got a license and
[SPEAKER_01]: store in San Diego and we used the best
consultant in the city to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: has a financial interest in making sure
that the project goes on, also has a
[SPEAKER_01]: financial interest or personal interest in
finding that line where they're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: their job, they're consulting,
they're bringing good value to the table,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're putting in as little work as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would say in my experience,
you want to watch and make sure that they
[SPEAKER_01]: are dotting the eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what Pam was speaking to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're, you know, at the end of
the day, you're going to pay them when the
[SPEAKER_01]: work is done and they're going to go home.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your license.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your business.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it fails, you're still paying them for
the work they did, most likely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to make sure that the work is
done properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a really good consultant,
but it was a really big, really
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated project.
[SPEAKER_01]: We spent 31 months going through the San
Diego city review process.
[SPEAKER_01]: In total, we spent about 800,000 between
rent and a building that had to sit empty
[SPEAKER_01]: and through all the consulting and the
city fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it paid off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very lucky it worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had to be extremely active.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was, I would say probably about
every three months, I'd find something
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty significant that I'd have to say to
our consultant, this doesn't seem right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you sure this is the path we want to
go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you sure this is what we should be
doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes they were right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it was clear that they
hadn't really thought it through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for yourself, for your investment,
make sure you're doing your due diligence
[SPEAKER_01]: to this attorney's point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go ahead, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other point that you made,
which was really good, is payment after
[SPEAKER_00]: the job is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would do two things when you're
approached by consultants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is shop around with other consultants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a reference point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I can tell you, I've heard some
insane numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because we're a new industry and
there aren't a lot of reference points.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing is, make it contingent,
make their payment contingent on your
[SPEAKER_00]: permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you make sure that they are
engaged with you for the whole ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that they don't have 50% of their
money up front.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if things go south or get difficult,
well, they have five or seven other
[SPEAKER_00]: clients where they're collecting all their
other money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you kind of get on the back
burner.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's something, since we're talking
about contracts that you can work out,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's always going to protect you to make
sure that ultimately at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day, you are getting your dollar's value
with a permanent hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every consultant and every lawyer operates
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's important for you at the end of
the day to feel comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know Jay said it, and I keep saying
it because it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love your lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like to talk to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a person that you are consistently
going to have to go back to, ask
[SPEAKER_02]: questions, ask the tough questions,
and sometimes say, I don't know if I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: doing this correctly, what's happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a collaborative effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Chris made a great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody knows exactly what to do in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no playbook.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no let's look at these five
companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grew to a magnitude of Coke and
Pepsi.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did they do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's written that book.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's collaborative.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always like to say cannabis ages in dog
years, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: One year is like seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see regulatory changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see legislative changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see cities and counties having to
re-adopt and change their regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an active and ongoing conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are a passive participant in your
business, your business will not succeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I think it's interesting to
shift the conversation because you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: are all active operators.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is happening as we enter into a more
commodified, commercialized marketplace?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you able to interface with large
chain-like brands or dispensaries at this
[SPEAKER_02]: point and the mom and pop?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the push and the shove from a
distributor's perspective, from a
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturer who's also doing white
labeling services?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you seeing from testing labs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you seeing that there are large swaths
of testing bandwidth that's being eaten up
[SPEAKER_02]: by these larger companies that then
pushing down these small farmers where
[SPEAKER_02]: we've got legislation that's supposed to
be helping and elevating them through the
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from those that are active in the
operations every day, what are you seeing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there market changes?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's still a little early.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this year or this coming year and
the following, so 2019 to 2020,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to start seeing a lot
more consolidation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to see more roll-up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing that lineup now.
[SPEAKER_01]: In retail mostly, a little bit in brands
that are trying to find a home because
[SPEAKER_01]: they didn't get licensed, so they're tying
in with manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we're going to start to see
later next year, some cultivators get a
[SPEAKER_01]: little pinched with their heavy overhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're going to see roll-up in
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's a little early,
but to Pam's point, there are companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're starting to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everybody knows who a medman is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what did you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I know.
You're surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't follow them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're wanting you to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we need that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We need people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need this funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing things that are
demonstrating leadership in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's mixed feelings about maybe how
things are being executed by certain
[SPEAKER_01]: groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need these leaders.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the distributor perspective,
I would say they wield a bigger sword.
[SPEAKER_01]: They carry leverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they come in to make a purchase,
obviously, you're listening a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your retailer needs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything else you need?
[SPEAKER_01]: But from the distributor perspective,
it's not super different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our goal or objective is to provide good
service to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't want to treat somebody
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anybody on my team that does will
definitely hear from me because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: just not how good business is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the manufacturing end, it's a very
diversified playing ground right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are getting an incredible amount of
inquiries for our contract manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: services.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas a year ago, a year and a half ago,
people were still a little bit shy about
[SPEAKER_00]: what does white labeling really mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this something we're really going to
need?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we're going to be able to get licensed
by the time the regulation falls into
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we're seeing a shift in the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do have some big players,
some bigger brands and chains in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry that we deal with and we speak
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a lot of smaller brands that
need licensed homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tough thing for us, we are solely a
contract manufacturer, meaning that we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have a seven leaf branded line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our infrastructure was put in place to
serve brands in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is we want to serve everyone,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nonetheless, even though we have very
high outputs, it's still finite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to make business decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: On what makes the most sense, which brands
should we back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which brands are going to stick around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which brands can we really help grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can't speak for other contract
manufacturers, but with seven leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: we look at the whole supply chain for any
brand before we make a decision whether to
[SPEAKER_00]: contract manufacture for them or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will tell us a lot about the
capitalization of the brand, the vision of
[SPEAKER_00]: the brand, the distribution chain of the
brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The marketing of the brand, the ownership,
the licensing situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the end of the day,
one thing we don't want to do is get in a
[SPEAKER_00]: situation that's uncomfortable with brands
where maybe we produce product,
[SPEAKER_00]: but now it's sitting in our warehouse and
we can't move the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, it's not as simple as
disposing it in the trash and calling it a
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: An interesting point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have your own label.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think for those that are looking at
white labeling and licensing, that is a
[SPEAKER_02]: really interesting point because you don't
compete with your other brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your margins are different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're really looking to establish if
somebody's working with you or white
[SPEAKER_02]: labeling with you, that they're going to
have that shelf space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can speak to maybe those
differences, I think that's an important
[SPEAKER_02]: nuance that when people are shopping
around for potentially white labeling or
[SPEAKER_02]: contract manufacture, I think that's
really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, obviously, you have to know if
you're going to be selling your product to
[SPEAKER_02]: the company or you're going to be selling
it to the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we decided to allocate our
infrastructure to solely contract
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the layout of our facility,
the equipment that we've purchased,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's geared towards versatility and high
volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I mentioned earlier, we are getting
an overwhelming amount of phone calls now
[SPEAKER_00]: from established brands, as well as new
brands trying to come into the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came to the point that we had to
create basically like a 20 to 25
[SPEAKER_00]: questionnaire, I guess you'd call it,
a qualification form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ultimately, we have to understand
everything about the brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Pamela said, we're banking on law.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're banking on longevity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're banking on growing brands with us in
the long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we allocate pipeline and allocate
resources to a brand, we just want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that the plan is in place to properly
grow that plan because we're not 100% in
[SPEAKER_00]: control of that brand's destiny because a
lot of times the brand is already
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-established and we're just the
contract manufacturer for the brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I think consolidation is
inevitable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know it's tough for a lot of the
smaller producers to get their heads
[SPEAKER_03]: around what the future of this industry is
going to be like.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're talking about these
multi-hundred thousand square foot grows
[SPEAKER_03]: out in the desert, and if you've got a
small grow somewhere in NorCal or in LA
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're competing against that,
it's like, okay, you obviously have to
[SPEAKER_03]: have exceptional quality to be able to get
that shelf space and the dispensary when
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody else is going to come in and
provide a really lower cost product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know there's quality is a big
question out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think in the very long run,
that's something producers in the space
[SPEAKER_03]: need to think about.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the last couple years I spent in
Oregon, we saw a number of very high
[SPEAKER_03]: quality small producers really dominate
the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a bunch of big investor-backed guys
from New York and Florida came in.
[SPEAKER_03]: They built their big farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And many of them failed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they failed because they couldn't
provide the quality of product.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I think that was just sort of a
growth contraction phase and we're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to get back into a growth phase.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: But from a testing perspective,
we test everything from the small
[SPEAKER_03]: individual grower all the way up to the
larger growers with whom we engage in
[SPEAKER_03]: long-term contracts with master services
agreements.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of contracts that are quite
detailed and sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about these internal agreements
and contracts up and along the supply
[SPEAKER_02]: chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've set up how you contract to get
your business operational, how you deal
[SPEAKER_02]: with professional service providers to get
you to the point of operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that you're operating, I think it's
interesting to talk about how you're
[SPEAKER_02]: contracting from both the manufacturer,
contract manufacturer, distributor,
[SPEAKER_02]: and testing lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: How these contracts take shape and what
the differences are between, and we
[SPEAKER_02]: touched on it a little bit, a larger scale
operator to a smaller scale operator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how you've seen the interaction when
you start to have the conversation about
[SPEAKER_02]: we need a distribution agreement.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need these types of agreement.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you finding navigating those
waters?
[SPEAKER_02]: And any advice you would have for those
that are starting to have these
[SPEAKER_02]: discussions.
[SPEAKER_01]: To Mike's point earlier about the maturity
of the industry in general right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still very immature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to Lori's point, you can have somebody
come in and it's very well capitalized,
[SPEAKER_01]: very sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these groups tend to lead with
arrogance, which is the wrong approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that leads the wrong direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard to tell who's going to be a
winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all just starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at where we're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just started with licensing and permits
this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of businesses that don't
even have their full, a great majority
[SPEAKER_01]: don't even have a full actual annual
license yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody?
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought some of the retailers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no?
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew for distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So none of the retailers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we look at it in distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say if you're looking to work with
a distributor, same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably better to keep the contract a
little fluid and see how they perform for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now we're still assessing
brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the reality of it is we've got
some very big brands that are doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple that I would say I'm
confident will continue to do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority of the brands, I'd say 75% of
the brands that are the top brands right
[SPEAKER_01]: now, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they going to be around in a year or
two as top leaders?
[SPEAKER_01]: They came out of the gate strong this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually look at a lot of analytics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very nerdy in that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look at real numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pull them out of a system.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a company that's doing a pretty
good job aggregating brand data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And BDS.
[SPEAKER_01]: BDS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you can get access to the
reports, for the retailers where they get
[SPEAKER_01]: the information from, they do have pretty
good numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a relatively flat comparison,
meaning that you've got enough statistical
[SPEAKER_01]: points throughout the state that you know,
OK, hey, we can get relative comparison
[SPEAKER_01]: between one brand and another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's one brand in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't say who.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're doing extremely well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as of the second quarter's data,
they were out selling the second brand
[SPEAKER_01]: three to one in actual dollar sales
volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they came out of the gate strong in
the beginning of this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we see a lot of other brands shoring
up their new packaging, shoring up their
[SPEAKER_01]: operational systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that one brand going to be the top
brand or even a leading brand in a year?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So long story short with us, we have an
LOI.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an agreement that sets out
expectations both sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we supposed to do to perform?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we looking for in return?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're not setting long term contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think testing's a whole different thing
because of the type of service.
[SPEAKER_01]: But where we're at as a distributor and
what I would suggest to anybody looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for a distributor, maybe not set
yourselves up into something super long
[SPEAKER_01]: term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give yourself some flexibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is way too new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Distribution as a segment in cannabis is
new.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even allowed in most states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give yourself some room to breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically on the contract manufacturing
end, we have two directions a contract can
[SPEAKER_00]: take.
[SPEAKER_00]: One would be for an existing brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: One would be for a new brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned earlier, every single deal
is different in some form or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, what are the exact services
that we would perform for the brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, is the brand licensed
whatsoever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would they be providing source material?
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning would they be providing distillate
or biomass or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that something we would be
providing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Number three, if it's, call it vape line,
would they be providing the hardware for
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would they like Seven Leaf to provide
the hardware for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you ultimately have to break down every
part of what the production line would
[SPEAKER_00]: look like and understand who's doing what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's payment terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a deposit up front?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, what is that deposit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when is the remainder paid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it pick up on order?
[SPEAKER_00]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing we like to institute at our
facility to make sure that product is
[SPEAKER_00]: moving through and that we don't jam the
pipeline for production for other brands
[SPEAKER_00]: is to make sure that brands, the
distributors that are working with them
[SPEAKER_00]: can pick up the product once it's ready to
move out within three business days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way we make sure we're not backing up
because we can't keep moving inventory
[SPEAKER_00]: over to our distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just some of the basics that
every contract would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to Chris's point, this is a bit of a
dance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still trying to feel out brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to feel out us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're seeing a lot more of
right now are per order contracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning for every time you order,
this is what the structure looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: versus locking people in our brands into
seven or eight month contracts or year
[SPEAKER_00]: contracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless they're established brand in the
markets, they can prove their volume on a
[SPEAKER_00]: monthly basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that that order is going to
keep moving nonetheless, in which case,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously we can work on pricing a little
bit more because as I'm sure everyone's
[SPEAKER_00]: aware, it all comes down to volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more volume, the better pricing you're
typically going to get with a contract
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't have a whole lot to add
except to just remind everybody who's
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe the counterparty to a contract that
everything's negotiable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So take the time to read the contract,
look at all the terms, and don't be afraid
[SPEAKER_03]: to go back to the person who presented the
contract because it's very likely the
[SPEAKER_03]: initiator of the contract is putting some
terms in there that are favorable to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's wiggle room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody have any questions for our
amazing panelists and operators?
[SPEAKER_02]: I see one in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question was for larger companies that
have employees doing consulting work
[SPEAKER_00]: versus an individual consultant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those employees need to be paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you negotiate a deal for payment
after permitting is in place versus paying
[SPEAKER_00]: employing as you go?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the answer to that would be I would set
it by milestones, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you can keep issuing payments,
people can keep getting paid, but you make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you stay on some kind of a track.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I referred to consultant earlier,
I meant specifically, let's call them city
[SPEAKER_00]: or municipality consultants, consultants
that are going to hold political clout for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean necessarily people preparing
documents for your licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm talking about is more people,
hey, I know so and so in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can help you move your licensing through
two or three months quicker than you
[SPEAKER_00]: normally would.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can help pat this guy back and he'll
scratch your back, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how I would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do it by milestones that are
easily identifiable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the milestone point of view is
very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't be a good lawyer if I didn't
say when you are using a political
[SPEAKER_02]: lobbyist in that capacity, be very clear
about what your comfortability levels are
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be very clear that there is a blurry line,
but once you pass it, corruption is not an
[SPEAKER_02]: unknown part of this industry and that can
cost you your license.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can look no further than the case of
Adelanto or Cudahy or there are a litany
[SPEAKER_02]: of others.
[SPEAKER_02]: If somebody says pay me X and I will push
your license through and this is a payment
[SPEAKER_02]: to somebody I'm not going to tell you,
you need to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: If this is money coming from your business
in exchange for a favor for your business,
[SPEAKER_02]: there is no excuse that oh, I wasn't told
this was just a fee.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will not hold water or get you out of
trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just always want to temper I think
using a political consultant is an
[SPEAKER_02]: important utility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use a lobbyist strategically when you need
to change an ordinance or you need to see
[SPEAKER_02]: more flexibility in the regulations,
both at the local and the state level,
[SPEAKER_02]: but be very cognizant and when you want to
change an ordinance, you are pushing
[SPEAKER_02]: permits forward or currying favor during a
competitive process.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with that little bit of legal ease
disclaimer, I would like to ask our
[SPEAKER_02]: operators to look into their crystal walls
and give you a lens on what is to come in
[SPEAKER_02]: the future and what is one piece of advice
that they would have liked to get when
[SPEAKER_02]: they were starting out in the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I kind of spoke to my thoughts of
the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we are going to see a lot of
consolidation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, okay, here is the piece of
advice I would give.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not a piece of advice I would have
given myself in the past because it was
[SPEAKER_01]: very different in the past, but honestly
now with where the industry is at and
[SPEAKER_01]: where it is going, it is so much more
competitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really believe that if you are going
to be a strong competitor, you need
[SPEAKER_01]: capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have some significant
resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: That does not mean you have to be
sophisticated in gathering that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you are looking at a model,
make sure that you are well capitalized to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a strong competitor because I think
things are really starting to turn up and
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they are going to get a lot more
aggressive and the groups that are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to survive, the companies that are going
to win are going to be the ones that are
[SPEAKER_01]: well capitalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are starting to see a stratification in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the legacy people that came in
that had experience were able to get in
[SPEAKER_01]: early and now new operators are coming in
that are big, well capitalized and they
[SPEAKER_01]: are starting to roll up strategies.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a distributor, what is the difference
or the distinction in how maybe they push
[SPEAKER_01]: on your leverage for terms?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can actually kind of uniquely speak
to that from three perspectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from the distributor perspective,
you do see the bigger groups, but the
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger groups also have a lot more
liquidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there has been a lot of pushback from
distributors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am actually chair of the distribution
committee for CCCIA, so I get to listen to
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of distributors bitch about things
that are frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody is pushing hard from the
distributor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody is pushing back on trying to
lighten terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Retailers need that liquidity and so they
are trying to push forward on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think it has come a long way from
where it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it has come a long way from where
it was just because I think of the growers
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves and how much easier it was to
be a grower and how much less overhead
[SPEAKER_01]: there was in the infrastructure and the
regulatory costs and taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in the past you had a lot of
growers that were just pocketing stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: without paying taxes and they could offer
terms that got passed through.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not quite in that place anymore and
so I think we are seeing a lot different
[SPEAKER_01]: environment in terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from the distributor level,
I think you get kind of the same push.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is just more power because if you
have got a retailer, somebody like a
[SPEAKER_01]: MedMed that says, hey, look, we have five
stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be placing a $500,000 entry order
for this $10 product where a mom and pop
[SPEAKER_01]: shop might say, hey, look, we will buy
$500 worth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to cater to it a little,
but at the same time it puts you in a
[SPEAKER_01]: position because you could over leverage
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I can speak to it a little
differently is because I have a licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: store and it is just a standalone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am actually trying to sell it now or
sell my interest in it because I perceive
[SPEAKER_01]: in the next year we are going to have a
bigger onslaught of much bigger tougher
[SPEAKER_01]: competitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have the leverage and I want
to get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think distribution as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But distribution I think will be more
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is distributors with plenty of
liquidity to get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because somebody is going to come in and
they might say, hey, look, we will fund a
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution company, but nobody is going
to say, well, we will put $50 million into
[SPEAKER_01]: it to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody is going to say, well,
we might put five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you prove it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have got a few distributors at
that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: The distribution growth is going to be a
little more organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The retail is different because with
distribution you say, okay, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have got to build your company.
[SPEAKER_01]: With retail you might say, well,
we want to buy 10 locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have significant capital
outlays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is different in the retail play.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am going to stand alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But separately I have got a retail
delivery company that has had some pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: good success.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been established throughout most
of the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just closed on a deal this week with
a Canadian group that is buying it in kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of this phase deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a strategy that I am leading
where we are going to be developing a
[SPEAKER_01]: statewide presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are actually going to be in four
markets of the state, four of the major
[SPEAKER_01]: markets of the state by the end of the
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't know that it is going to
garner us massive greater leverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can kind of see that there will be
strategic advantages when working with
[SPEAKER_01]: distributors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it all comes back to what I
was saying about the distributor
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is that it just comes down to
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have got to make a business decision
about this group is going to make much
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger purchases.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are going to provide a lot more
profitability and economies of scale when
[SPEAKER_01]: working with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are going to have to do what you can
do to satisfy them.
I think it is
[SPEAKER_01]: inevitable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't put emotion into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me it is just this is what is going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, the smaller guys
are going to get pushed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can look at the pharmacy industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a little bit akin.
[SPEAKER_01]: CVS obviously dominates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have got Rite Aid dominates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still have some standalone family
owned pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they are getting edged out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually know some people that have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are getting leveraged out just by
on economies of scale buying power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now regulations coming into it in kind of
a probably dirtier political way where the
[SPEAKER_01]: big groups are saying to their advocating
politically with lobbyists, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, do we really need these guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not a big piece of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is 10 or 15 percent that I would
like to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: This doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is unsafe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we will see those market
forces always prevail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't put emotion into it from good
or bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just look at it like this is probably
what is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree with Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean this industry is, you know,
everyone says cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are dealing with a commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a regulated commodity now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens in every other industry
that is new?
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually there is consolidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually you have the big boys that come
in with a lot of capital and wipe
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just the way the world works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at least I know on the CCIA side,
some things that the committees are trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to do are put together best practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are real big believers that,
you know, we are only going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the boutique brands and the smaller
players in the market if we all work
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the fact is is that once,
you know, cannabis is deschedulized at a
[SPEAKER_00]: federal level, you know, Philip Morris and
GlaxoSmithKline and all these other major
[SPEAKER_00]: players are just licking their chops to
get in here and basically wipe everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just throw so much money at it that people
can't keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only way to counter that is to have
a really strong community with called
[SPEAKER_00]: middle tier operators or smaller operators
that all work off one another and to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to help support that community as long as
possible at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a reality of where it is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is unfortunately no way around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that it is important that we
understand that the market is huge in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it is more important that I work
with other manufacturers and Chris works
[SPEAKER_00]: with other distributors and that we
partner up and try to figure out how we
[SPEAKER_00]: can work with one another and help one
another versus just compete with one
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there is always going to be
enough, you know, business to go around.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And think about the individuals in this
room when it comes time, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: five years from now when it is federally
legal and all the big companies are coming
[SPEAKER_03]: in, who are they going to hire?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are the people they are going to look
to because they know the plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: they understand the chemistry,
they understand the medicinal effects of
[SPEAKER_03]: this plant that we are all working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we will have opportunities in the
future that it is like we are computer
[SPEAKER_03]: programmers in 1995 and by 2001 Google was
dying for people who understood how to use
[SPEAKER_03]: a computer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think there is a tremendous
opportunity, whether that is starting your
[SPEAKER_03]: business now and just keeping eyes wide
open in the future or just really getting
[SPEAKER_03]: to know the industry extremely well for
the eventuality of where the opportunities
[SPEAKER_03]: are going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please help me in thanking them for their
time and their expertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
