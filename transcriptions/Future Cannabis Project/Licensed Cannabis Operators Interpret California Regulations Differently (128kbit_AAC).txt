[SPEAKER_05]: What's interesting and concerning to me at
the same time is on each question I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: finding that throughout the supply chain
you are interpreting the regs differently
[SPEAKER_05]: and so If you're going to reflect back,
what are what could we do?
[SPEAKER_05]: To make sure and I know you're going to
tell me I know we got to get information
[SPEAKER_05]: out But with all of our other
responsibilities, do you have any good
[SPEAKER_05]: ideas for us where we could do a better
job of explaining the rules?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, maybe it starts with the regs
themselves But you know, I think there's
[SPEAKER_05]: better ways to get the information out and
and one thing that I worry about as we
[SPEAKER_05]: come to the final leg of our rulemaking
How do we make sure we're continuing to
[SPEAKER_05]: communicate and collaborate?
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done it a lot getting these regs out
But how do we going forward make sure we
[SPEAKER_05]: keep that momentum?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd love your thoughts on that You
know, I think there's that agency to
[SPEAKER_04]: agency component, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of the operators are are kind of
wrangling multiple sets of regulations
[SPEAKER_04]: that they have to comply with cultivators
have California Department of Food and
[SPEAKER_04]: Agriculture Open-air cultivators have the
water board the water resource control
[SPEAKER_04]: board They have Department of Fish and
Wildlife and then depending on how they
[SPEAKER_04]: choose to Transport their product if they
have say a self distribution
[SPEAKER_04]: transportation license now they have BCC
right and and so how how Like as a
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivator we digest that body of material
is really challenging and then I find that
[SPEAKER_04]: there's not always the same I don't know
if definition is the right word,
[SPEAKER_04]: but maybe interpretation of specific
definitions from statute So like we're
[SPEAKER_04]: really suffering with the contiguous
premise component, especially as existing
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivators that already built out,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we fit into?
[SPEAKER_04]: that box but BCC seems to have a little
different way of dealing with contiguous
[SPEAKER_04]: premise and say CDFA or CDPH so Those
pieces make it really kind of a quicksand
[SPEAKER_04]: feeling because you're not sure Who to
look to for answers in some of those
[SPEAKER_04]: cases?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think kind of more interagency
communication and sort of Joint
[SPEAKER_04]: educational opportunities Would be really
fabulous You know what I was yearning for
[SPEAKER_02]: in this in this last round of these of the
draft regulations and also actually with
[SPEAKER_02]: July 1 in Lab, there's not a lot of us who
are currently operating I think there's
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe 30 or maybe more licensees now as
they keep adding on but in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: operators it's I think it's less than 15
probably right now and What we're doing is
[SPEAKER_02]: fairly complicated There's a lot of
details and if we get it wrong we can have
[SPEAKER_02]: a serious economic impact On a party
completely unintentionally by making by
[SPEAKER_02]: misinterpreting something and miss
applying it on a COA that then can't be
[SPEAKER_02]: amended And so when those transitions
happen, I said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have been really great from a
collaboration perspective if we just could
[SPEAKER_02]: have gotten the lab operators on the phone
with the regulators to really walk through
[SPEAKER_02]: what what the ask from us was in terms of
Changes to help us understand the label
[SPEAKER_02]: claim thing has been a little over the top
it to understand What it means what has to
[SPEAKER_02]: be what doesn't have to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Be where's the where's the area of
permissions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the area of no permissions?
[SPEAKER_02]: and so I think I guess literally a simple
conference call with the lab operators
[SPEAKER_02]: because we're a small number would have
been amazing and it would have cleared up
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of kind of disparate things between
us which affected the Manufacturers and it
[SPEAKER_02]: affected distributors because our
interpretations affect everybody in a big
[SPEAKER_02]: way now I don't I don't think that's
totally doable for everybody because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot more manufacturers and a lot
more distributors than there are labs So
[SPEAKER_02]: that may not be applicable For each group
but that approach which may mean maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: there needs to be more funding for
outreach personnel that are specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: just about outreach and about giving voice
to that interpretation because there's
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a difference in having a
discussion like with Elena who's been
[SPEAKER_02]: who's an amazing resource on your team to
help Understand the regulations but I
[SPEAKER_02]: think there's people who don't feel like
they have that personal connection to the
[SPEAKER_02]: BCC team or a go-to person and Somehow we
need to create that sense of everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: knows who to go to and that person has the
band With the answer them because there
[SPEAKER_02]: there is a lot of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah You know, California is the only
state that has multiple agencies
[SPEAKER_01]: regulating one supply chain and cannabis
so that's very unique and You know
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously causes lots of problems with
them Interpretation and who has authority
[SPEAKER_01]: over what and I would say you know
something the CDT FA does That they
[SPEAKER_01]: started a couple of months ago and they've
only had a couple but they've invited a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of operators from distributors and
retailers to discuss the just the excise
[SPEAKER_01]: tax and and how the the tax structure is
paid and what's going on and and we ask
[SPEAKER_01]: them questions and they ask us questions
and we kind of just have the sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: Informal back-and-forth conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's been pretty helpful because
that's been unbelievably confusing on its
[SPEAKER_01]: own and So that might be an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's the advisory committee,
which is Very formal and and sort of there
[SPEAKER_01]: by law, but some sort of more informal
Stakeholder licensee conversation and
[SPEAKER_01]: right now since there aren't and a ton of
Licensees it probably would be easier to
[SPEAKER_01]: do at this point than you know six months
or a year later when it there's more
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out as more places and people get
online and I think the other thing is you
[SPEAKER_01]: know going Back to this packaging and
labeling which has just been a you know
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting transition and our different
interpretations of You know what is
[SPEAKER_01]: required I think Having a general
understanding of because we were in the
[SPEAKER_01]: position.
[SPEAKER_01]: I You know the retailer BPG was saying
that we are we're licensed and inspected
[SPEAKER_01]: by the bureau So we're gonna go with what
the bureau says and what statute says and
[SPEAKER_01]: then there's CDPA That has what they have
and then that's what them I think this
[SPEAKER_01]: also comes down to why there may have been
some difference in interpretation We're
[SPEAKER_01]: friends now though and Yeah, so I you know
one of the sort of more specific nuance
[SPEAKER_01]: things would come down to sort of the you
know statute says everything has to be in
[SPEAKER_01]: a resealable child-resistant tamper
evident it's in one sentence and it says
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and cannabis products and so that
means everything from seeds to clones and
[SPEAKER_01]: and the seeds and clones I would say was a
very Interesting question because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what statute says CD pH doesn't address it
the You California DFA doesn't address it
[SPEAKER_01]: um and so you know we are erring on the
side of caution because we're like well I
[SPEAKER_01]: the bureau is the one inspecting us not
DPH so we're just gonna go as as far
[SPEAKER_01]: conservative as we possibly can and then
and that's what I mean the staff kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: they're frustrated with me too Because
that's sort of how I go I'm like we're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna ease up as we realize that we can
but we're just gonna start with the
[SPEAKER_01]: strictest interpretation, but Yeah,
so sort of the the crossover areas and and
[SPEAKER_01]: addressing those and and who has you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you guys looking for when you're
coming in to inspect the dispensary when
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes to packaging and labeling?
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff like that I would As a lawyer I kind
of shift towards you know when Statutes
[SPEAKER_03]: are interpreted greatly for the business
community by case law and case
[SPEAKER_03]: law-informed Different fact in our
scenarios how one would behave The IRS
[SPEAKER_03]: uses decisional memos I think that it
might not be a bad idea to do something
[SPEAKER_03]: like Decisional memos that have an expiry
date on them so that the statute says they
[SPEAKER_03]: change those decisions kind of become But
it would really help us out a lot while
[SPEAKER_03]: we're really the front line I mean if we
fail state fails right so it helps us out
[SPEAKER_03]: in divining how we should go and and I
would absolutely agree one body making
[SPEAKER_03]: those decisions and itself working with
CDPH or working with The other departments
[SPEAKER_03]: to come up with a decisional memo that is
consonant across the board so that we can
[SPEAKER_03]: make a decision for example if I have a
Cultivation license can I?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I package for somebody kind of package
somebody else's flower or just off of my
[SPEAKER_03]: farm like it's really not clear right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So and it doesn't have to be clear and we
don't have to wait for regulators to make
[SPEAKER_03]: that decision But I think in the interim
if the bureau could just make A decision
[SPEAKER_03]: for right now for the rest of this year
our interpretation is that would be
[SPEAKER_03]: acceptable that allows us to Mount this
effort without the constant fear that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're gonna get you know Thor's hammer on
our back and so there's a lot of that fear
[SPEAKER_03]: of how to move and If we can have some
clearance on that it's kind of like an
[SPEAKER_00]: FAQ, but it's a little bit more formal
right so So just an idea to throw out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think It's been great the way that the
agencies are willing to travel around the
[SPEAKER_00]: state to listen to all of us during public
comment and I think it would be you know
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a there's a huge cross-section of
companies some which have staffed up to
[SPEAKER_00]: have policy professionals focusing on the
regs on a daily basis and then there's
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that don't have that resource
and they utilize their industry
[SPEAKER_00]: associations or word-of-mouth or you know
call the bureau up, but it would I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it'd be great if there could be ongoing
opportunities for the agencies to in
[SPEAKER_00]: different parts of the state have
workshops that are designed to focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: their regs and Clarify and educate and I
think that probably you would get a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: participation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of hungry minds I know it's
it might open a new can of worms if one
[SPEAKER_00]: answer at one venue is different than
another answer at another venue So
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously not a perfect solution,
but I think there's a lot of people that'd
[SPEAKER_00]: be interested to to come and hear and
learn This is what we mean when we say
[SPEAKER_05]: this So I completely agree with you it can
be frustrating for us just staffs our
[SPEAKER_05]: communication guys on when people don't
when I call and say what agency do we go
[SPEAKER_05]: to or for us it does get frustrating
because it does even even internally it's
[SPEAKER_05]: difficult to work with two other agencies
and come to decisions and and being
[SPEAKER_05]: consistent also, it's you know,
like you noted we do want to do more
[SPEAKER_05]: outreach, but We're also dealing with new
staff coming on every day and it's hard to
[SPEAKER_05]: keep them apprised of okay These are the
these are the regulations that are in
[SPEAKER_05]: place right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and so we struggle with Making sure
that we're giving consistent Answers and
[SPEAKER_05]: you're not getting different answers and I
think you'll see once we get our final
[SPEAKER_05]: regulation It's gonna make a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have the emergency regulations
the proposed and all that So this is all
[SPEAKER_05]: really very helpful, you know,
I I could I could keep Interrogating these
[SPEAKER_05]: guys more but I think you guys want to
answer some question ask some questions of
[SPEAKER_05]: them But I do want to point out that we
did get approval our budget got approved
[SPEAKER_05]: to have a public awareness campaign We are
going out to bid so we are going to get
[SPEAKER_05]: out there and start having a campaign to
inform consumers of whose license the
[SPEAKER_05]: importance of going to a licensed retailer
and also Trying to bring more people from
[SPEAKER_05]: the unlicensed market into the regulated
market So that'll be something exciting
[SPEAKER_05]: you're gonna see from our communications
team.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're looking forward to that but This
has been extremely helpful to me and I
[SPEAKER_05]: really appreciate you guys Being so candid
with your answers
