[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to expand on the concept
of cultural control that we briefly
[SPEAKER_00]: covered in our first webinar on the 10
cardinal parameters of plant health and
[SPEAKER_00]: vitality and take a deep dive on IPM and
IMM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultural control is environmental control
and it's the foundation of any
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehensive IPM plan to manage the pests
and microbes present in your cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also the oldest IPM method,
but was largely abandoned with the advent
[SPEAKER_00]: of chemical pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bioecology of the indoor garden was
not well understood, creating inconsistent
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical pesticides offered a more
reliable and less knowledge and skill
[SPEAKER_00]: dependent solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as consumers desires for clean
pesticide free cannabis increase and the
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicity of pesticides becomes further
scrutinized by regulators and a scourge on
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment, there is renewed interest
in cultural control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only recently has the pathogen host
environment relationship been understood
[SPEAKER_00]: well enough to harness the power of
cultural control to boost secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolite and biomass production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also serves as a potent risk reduction
technique to prevent pests and pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: and allows cultivators to produce
consistent clean cannabis cycle after
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle without the use of harmful
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick note from the legal
department, due to the federal illegality
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis and the variability in state
by state laws, we cannot make specific
[SPEAKER_00]: product recommendations for your IPM plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pass it over to Jesse to kick us off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Brian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks everyone for tuning in on this
topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the main reasons I'm so
passionate about cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: When my mom was diagnosed with cancer,
it was about trying to find her the best
[SPEAKER_02]: and strongest possible medicine we could.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hit every dispensary, every medical
outlet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we purchased products that had mold,
mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: We purchased products that didn't burn
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purchased products that were clearly
sprayed with pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember one time I was smoking with my
mom in the backyard and she turned to me
[SPEAKER_02]: and she said, oh, this one's a sparkler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Snap, crackle, pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bud was doing things it shouldn't have
indicating that it had been sprayed with
[SPEAKER_02]: something heavy metals, sulfur,
something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I immediately realized the importance of
integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a controversial topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's personal choices, business
choices, and legal parameters.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I had my hydro shop, Oakland
garden supply, we encourage people to
[SPEAKER_02]: bring in leaves and media in a bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put things under the scope and we'd
look at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the two questions I got more than
anything else were, what is this and how
[SPEAKER_02]: do I kill it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And my answer was usually, are you sure
you want to kill it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are we doing to prevent it?
[SPEAKER_02]: As a result, we became amateur
entomologists, microbiologists,
[SPEAKER_02]: and chemists all in a trial by fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: People would come in and want a solution
directly given to them within 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we would have to look them in the
eye the next day and talk about how
[SPEAKER_02]: effective it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea behind this webinar was really
to present the tools and share some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: experiences that I think will further the
discussion on IPM and IMM for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is integrated pest management?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about dealing with and living with
and managing pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with IMM, integrated microbe
management.
[SPEAKER_02]: Treat them the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it probably seems like an
oversimplification.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the truth is, I've used this triangle
and this book to develop hundreds of
[SPEAKER_02]: successful IPM and IMM plans for gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: The triangle on the left illustrates the
progression from prevention to
[SPEAKER_02]: intervention.
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts with cultural control.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the foundation of IPM.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cultural control is about creating an
environment where plants thrive and bag
[SPEAKER_02]: bugs don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the only non-invasive option.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we move to physical control,
which is about traps, barriers,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the physical removal of pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then on to biological control,
which is about deploying beneficial
[SPEAKER_02]: insects and good microbes to work on your
behalf to eradicate pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally to chemical control,
the application of items toxic to pests
[SPEAKER_02]: that don't kill the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I love this book, Hemp Diseases
and Pests, Management and Biological
[SPEAKER_02]: Control, is because it allows you to look
up a pest and understand the progression
[SPEAKER_02]: that you need to take in order to
eradicate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's important to know the tools of
the trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we really think about fighting pests
and pathogens, it's important to start
[SPEAKER_02]: with good genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think this is one of the reasons
why so many people grew Blue Dream
[SPEAKER_02]: initially.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great yielder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to kill, even when it's covered
with mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's really not enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to understand that growing healthy
plants is a science.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these tools are going to help you
refine the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts with some sort of lighting
meter, something to determine the energy
[SPEAKER_02]: that's coming into the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lighting, infrared, UV, they're all
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you need to think about the
temperature and humidity of the ambient
[SPEAKER_02]: space.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to think about some sort of tool
to measure leaf temperature, whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a camera or an IR gun, so you can manage
VPD, your vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you should think about measuring the
gases in the space, specifically CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll need some sort of microscope to
take a close look at bugs, eggs,
[SPEAKER_02]: and leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you can even get away with a
camera, a microscope app.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you need some sort of water activity
meter to determine whether or not your
[SPEAKER_02]: product is safe for final packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, one tool that I like to use is
a refractometer, which essentially
[SPEAKER_02]: measures bricks in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a trick I learned from
commercial gardens that grow grapes in
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern California, which is if you can
get your bricks level above 12,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to be really hard for bugs to
eat your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the healthier plants we grow,
the less susceptible they are to pests and
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also about creating the right
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, creating a clean
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important to clean the garden space
in between runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like hydrogen peroxide or gases
like ozone that really get into the nooks
[SPEAKER_02]: and crannies will help you eliminate the
pest vectors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also important to remember to do this
when the plants aren't in the room,
[SPEAKER_02]: because some of these products can have a
detrimental effect on the secondary
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you need to clean filters,
fans, fertigation lines, and those wild
[SPEAKER_02]: condensate lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows what's in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to clean them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean the plant debris from the space,
from defoliation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dispose of that properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, I think a lot of people know
this, but quarantine your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also quarantine your media as it
enters the facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to treat every plant and every
media that comes into my facility as if it
[SPEAKER_02]: were infected and deal with it
appropriately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I think something that we've all
gotten a lot more used to recently is that
[SPEAKER_02]: people carry pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 10,000 microbes on each hand and
we shell 40,000 micro or 40,000 skin cells
[SPEAKER_02]: every single minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: So SOPs are important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wear gloves, wear hair nets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, think about cleaning the ancillary
spaces like the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Employees use the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go in, they play with their phone,
then they wash their hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when they leave the bathroom,
what's on their feet?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on their pants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they bringing pathogens into the
space?
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about the hallways, the mop sink.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all vectors and they either need
to be cleaned with technology or with
[SPEAKER_02]: elbow grease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, think about cleaning the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: The water that comes into the facility is
usually not the biggest obstacle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the recycled water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about standing water and making sure
that standing water is treated
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriately, aerated, because if it's
not, it's going to develop water molds
[SPEAKER_02]: that are systemic and you'll feed them
directly to your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another way to remember it is start
clean, stay clean, finish strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now that we have a culture of clean,
let's talk about a culture of success.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that starts with scouting with a
microscope, getting positive
[SPEAKER_02]: identification, taking appropriate action,
and evaluating.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a continuous cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep a log of the pests, keep a log of the
conditions, the fertigation, the water
[SPEAKER_02]: into the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these things are important when you
think about historical trends and how
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to eradicate pests for the
long haul.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking more about positive
identification, this is so important to
[SPEAKER_02]: winning the war against the pests that
threaten you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an entomologist that I love her
work and I love what she has to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: Suzanne Wainwright Evans.
[SPEAKER_02]: When she decides to publish her photo book
on positive identification, I would spend
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it costs to get that book because
positive identification is critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, to a lot of people looking at
this slide, they might think, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: look at all those bad bugs, but they're
not all bad bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, the majority of them are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a cautious story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked at a facility in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an outdoor facility and I came into
work one day and there was a Petri dish
[SPEAKER_02]: filled with larva and a note that said,
Jesse, please kill these bugs as fast as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I sighed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked up the Petri dish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I opened it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I walked outside and I sprinkled the
ladybug larva all over the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an inappropriate identification of
a pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's critical that you know good bugs
and bad bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you'll be trying to kill all
the guys that are trying to help you fight
[SPEAKER_02]: the war.
[SPEAKER_02]: Positive identification of microbes is
also important.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a chance to bring in a
microbiologist to talk about which
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes are good and which microbes are
bad, which microbes you have in your
[SPEAKER_02]: compost tea, which microbes you have in
your space.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can take samples and they can give
you a really good idea of what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But furthermore, get to know your shapes
and structures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you start to know this, you can
really do an amateur evaluation and
[SPEAKER_02]: identification under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another story of caution here when it
comes to positive identification is I had
[SPEAKER_02]: a friend who had a 500 light facility and
he said, Hey, Jesse, one of my rooms,
[SPEAKER_02]: we had catastrophic loss in week four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything just died because of root
aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please come assess the situation and tell
me how to kill the root aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to the facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked through the media.
[SPEAKER_02]: I dug through the root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked at every plant I possibly could.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't find larva.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't find eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I found some fungus gnats,
but I sure didn't find root aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it hit me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have pythium.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see it on the stocks of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, Let's go look at your water
source.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we immediately went to his water
source, which is a 250 gallon tank outside
[SPEAKER_02]: of the room that wasn't aerated,
wasn't treated with UV, wasn't treated
[SPEAKER_02]: with anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could see the black mold growing on
top of the water surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I said was, All right,
you're feeding your plants pythium and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to die.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're feeding them a systemic water mold
that's going to kill them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the problem, not root aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the effort all the time and all the
money you spent trying to kill it,
[SPEAKER_02]: root aphids that weren't there were just
simply not effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Positive identification is critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes to positive ID,
let's assume for a second that we've made
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have mites and we have powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: But which mites?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they carmine mites?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they russet mites?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they broad mites?
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, we have a picture of two
spotted mites and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now that we know who our enemy is,
let's learn everything we can about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do every bit of research you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Consult the Hent disease book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at everything you can possibly read
to understand how these things grow and
[SPEAKER_02]: live.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little bit on powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that it thrives in low light
conditions with poor air circulation and
[SPEAKER_02]: excess nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know it's spread by the air and we know
that it's spread faster in high humidity
[SPEAKER_02]: environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also know that it's all around us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spider mites, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We know they feed on these particular two
spotted spider mites feed on chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_02]: rich plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The females lay 200 eggs every eight days.
[SPEAKER_02]: They prefer hot and dry conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cold temperatures cause hibernation and
the light cycles can impact their action.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this gives us the things that we need
to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the pests susceptible to?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do they feed?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do they breed?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do they move?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do they hide?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do we pierce their armor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the first step is understanding how
we prevent this infestation in the first
[SPEAKER_02]: place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to understand cultural control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, for any pest, it's about creating
an environment where they can't thrive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at Inspire, we model every room so
we know where the air flows so we can
[SPEAKER_02]: create the right pressures.
[SPEAKER_02]: We remove oscillating fans and pocket
dehumidifiers so they don't create
[SPEAKER_02]: microclimates or become the source of
pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's about air cycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every three minutes we try to cycle
through multi-stage filtration.
[SPEAKER_02]: First through a MERV 13 capture filter,
which gets everything down to about one
[SPEAKER_02]: micron, then through a photocatalytic
oxidation process, which is essentially UV
[SPEAKER_02]: light shining on titanium dioxide,
which creates hydroxyl radicals that
[SPEAKER_02]: function like a molecular shredder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then NRAC airflow will continue the
airflow cycle by delivering the CO2 rich
[SPEAKER_02]: conditioned air without radical oxidative
species directly to the plant stomata to
[SPEAKER_02]: break up the canopy, which further
eliminates microclimates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, it's about control,
control of the temperature, control of the
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity when the lights are on,
when the lights are off, and during the
[SPEAKER_02]: transitions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Swings in temperature and humidity create
an environment for powdery mildew to take
[SPEAKER_02]: hold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And precision control will allow you to
manage your VPD, your vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_02]: deficit, at every stage of the plant
growth, which will help mitigate the risk
[SPEAKER_02]: of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also important to note understanding
light penetration, temperature,
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity, airflow, nutrient dilution,
watering rate, they all play a big role in
[SPEAKER_02]: the formation and spread of powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get control of your culture and powdery
mildew won't affect the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get control and you'll need to
prepare for a war every single flower run.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the next type of control?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's physical control.
[SPEAKER_02]: What could we have done physically to
prevent the spread of this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first let's check the air pressures
and make sure that we have a positively
[SPEAKER_02]: pressured space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's check the SOPs and make sure that
everyone is wearing gloves when they
[SPEAKER_02]: handle the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to make sure that your master
gardener isn't playing with their pit bull
[SPEAKER_02]: before they come into the shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to make sure that house flies
aren't entering either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows where your pit bull was last
night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And spider mites can hitch a ride on the
back of house flies and get into your
[SPEAKER_02]: facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not the flies that are the
problem, but they are the vector.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the solution?
[SPEAKER_02]: Amputate and remove leaves at the
initiation of outbreak.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had mentioned two spotted spider mites
lay 200 eggs every eight days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by removing those leaves, we can remove
a significant amount of eggs, sometimes a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot more than 200.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, be careful because if we remove
too many leaves, that's going to affect
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant's vitality.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next stage of control is biological
control, which really deals with the three
[SPEAKER_02]: P's, predators, parasites, and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is another opportunity to bring an
entomologist to the party, but the
[SPEAKER_02]: resources are out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me think of my friend Charlie
McKenzie and the CropWalk team who does an
[SPEAKER_02]: IPM audit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll walk your facility, tell you what
biologicals would help you win the war.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this case, we have two spotted
spider mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we might choose Californicus and
Persimilis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both work a little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a little bit different sizes,
but they're both going to eat mites and
[SPEAKER_02]: eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's important to know, because if we
think we're going to bring rove beetles in
[SPEAKER_02]: here, then they're going to live in the
media and not on the leaf tissue and not
[SPEAKER_02]: be quite as effective for what we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can think about biological
control with microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a chance for you to bring a
microbiologist to the party to talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: which microbes are going to thrive in our
space, how we're going to get these
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it T's?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it ferments?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it purchasing individual microbes?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you take a close look at this
slide, you can see we might choose
[SPEAKER_02]: Bacillus pamilis, which is a fungicide,
Bacillus subtilis, which eats powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew, streptomyces, trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of choices here that we can
apply from a biological standpoint to
[SPEAKER_02]: eradicate the threats of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are also beneficial bacteria that
consume eggs and ward off bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a real option for you,
but it takes an understanding of
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiology to deploy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the next step is chemical control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the chance for you to bring
another is to the party, a chemist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this chemist is going to tell us
what's in every bottle and how it works
[SPEAKER_02]: and how it affects the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of tough decisions to make
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to go with biorational
insecticides?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to go with synthetic
insecticides?
[SPEAKER_02]: There essentially are two main camps when
you really break it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The long-term prevention and eradication
of pests fall into the oils and soaps
[SPEAKER_02]: category or the sulfur category.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the major reasons we
differentiate the two is because we can't
[SPEAKER_02]: apply them both at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a matter of just going into the
IPM cupboard, grabbing a bottle and
[SPEAKER_02]: applying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to know how these things work as a
synergy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we apply oils, then we really can't
apply sulfur within the next 14 days or
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll burn our plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's an important consideration,
the chemistry, the makeup, and how they
[SPEAKER_02]: impact the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so which path do we choose?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where it becomes a personal and
business decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gets really tricky.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really about understanding the
interaction between technology,
[SPEAKER_02]: the farmer, the market, and enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of things at play when
determining the appropriate IPM strategy
[SPEAKER_02]: for your cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a delicate balance of risk and
reward, but it's also a personal choice
[SPEAKER_02]: that will affect the business bottom line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So legality, and this is something that
Brian mentioned earlier, federally
[SPEAKER_02]: illegal, it becomes a gray area when
deciding which pesticides and which
[SPEAKER_02]: biological control methodologies to
deploy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Federally, there are no guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: State by state, there are varying
guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's important to know in your state
what you can and can't use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's important because testing is
the enforcement arm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to know what's going to show up
on a test, how it's going to show up,
[SPEAKER_02]: and what's the cost of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you use a substance, you shouldn't,
or you use a substance that's allowed,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you use it at the wrong time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will show up as a fail for residual
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that will be a compromise to the end
product, and it will be a compromise to
[SPEAKER_02]: the brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's often very hard to recover from
something like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And next in making this decision,
it's about understanding the factors of
[SPEAKER_02]: influence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of times when we think
about factors of influence, we think about
[SPEAKER_02]: doing a cost benefit analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does this system make sense for us?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is the risk?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is the reward?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the costs?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's about taking the historic IPM
triangle and incorporating it into your
[SPEAKER_02]: business plan for long-term success.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understanding the modes of action,
how things work, understanding the
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental considerations.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do they work in your space and how do
they affect the spaces outside of yours?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the application guidelines?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the dilution rate?
[SPEAKER_02]: How much does it cost to use it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the timelines for efficacy?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the timelines for your needs?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the stages of development that
you're encountering with your particular
[SPEAKER_02]: pest?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the systemic acquired response?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are the plants going to respond to
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we prep them for a threat?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are the synergies?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do these things work together?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll try and go through them really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So modes of action.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of different modes of
action, and there are good resources out
[SPEAKER_02]: there that break them down in even more
detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: But essentially we're talking about how
are we going to physically kill the bugs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to dehydrate them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to suffocate them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to get them to eat something
that kills them from the inside?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to affect their nervous
system by either over-activating them or
[SPEAKER_02]: slowing their development?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to prevent them from molting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to prevent them from
developing into the next stage?
[SPEAKER_02]: And also I think there's a great picture
here in the lower right corner that if
[SPEAKER_02]: you've read Jeff Lohenfeld's book Teaming
with Microbes or studied with Dr. Elaine
[SPEAKER_02]: Ingham, you'll know that this is a fungal
hyphae that is strangling a root-feeding
[SPEAKER_02]: nematode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty cool mode of action in my book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have the environmental
considerations, just like I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the IPM and IMM decisions you make
will either impact the environment or will
[SPEAKER_02]: be impacted by the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your brand might be more well received if
you choose the least toxic path,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the application environment like
temperature, humidity, and airflow can
[SPEAKER_02]: have a dramatic impact on management
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're playing the microbe and
biological angle, think about creating
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental conditions for them to
thrive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beneficials need habitat.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need a food source.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need appropriate temperatures in day
and night so that they can breed and they
[SPEAKER_02]: can establish for the long haul.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also think about environmental
considerations for the chemistry you might
[SPEAKER_02]: use.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, sulfur is going to be much
more effective in a high humidity
[SPEAKER_02]: environment when the temperatures are
below 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a dry and hot environment, you apply
sulfur, you will burn the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have to think about application
guidelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I apply this product?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a dust?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I spray it on the leaves?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I dose it in line?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do I deploy the sachets of insects?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the personal protective equipment I
need for this application?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the dilution rate per acre per
canopy per plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: The math can get confusing.
[SPEAKER_02]: When do I apply it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do I apply it?
[SPEAKER_02]: In the root zone, the undersides of the
leaves, the tops of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for mites, we know we need to focus
on the undersides of the leaves and for
[SPEAKER_02]: PM, it's going to be all over the plant,
but important considerations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Timelines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Timelines are of utmost importance as well
for reapplication, for toxicity,
[SPEAKER_02]: toxicity to the bug, toxicity to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to understand the time that it
takes the fungal hyphae to develop so it
[SPEAKER_02]: can strangle that root feeding nematode.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to understand how long it takes
resistance to occur in the bug.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to understand that so we know when
to rotate the modes of action.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to understand how long it takes
the plant to build up defenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're building up the defenses to the
utmost capability before these threats
[SPEAKER_02]: come.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to understand how long it takes
these applications to be effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long does it take them to work?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long before we judge whether that
application was or wasn't effective?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the half life?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long does it work for?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's the reentry period for worker
safety?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long do we have to wait before we can
go back into the space and start growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Another factor of influence is thinking
about the stages of development.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, the stage of development of the
plant, then the stage of development of
[SPEAKER_02]: the pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to kill all stages of the pest
development while considering all stages
[SPEAKER_02]: of the growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for something like our two spotted
mites, we're going to want an ovicide,
[SPEAKER_02]: a larvicide, a pupicide, and an
adulticide.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to kill them at every stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the powdery mildew, we want to think
about something that's going to deal with
[SPEAKER_02]: the pustules, the spores, and the fruiting
bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Important to consider all of those factors
and deploy different mode of actions
[SPEAKER_02]: varied at different timelines to be most
effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something to think about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sulfur is going to kill powdery mildew and
mites really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you get into late stage flower,
if you spray your skittles with sulfur,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to turn into rotten eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's important to understand the stage
of development, the application,
[SPEAKER_02]: and its impact on the final product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we get to systemic acquired response.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is essentially getting the plant
to fight back for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has natural defenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with hormones, acids, enzymes,
and microbes, we can trigger the plant's
[SPEAKER_02]: natural responses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love salicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a product that you can apply to your
plant to get it more turgier, to get it
[SPEAKER_02]: more rigid, to have the plant be very
strong and very hard to eat from a leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue and a root zone perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I love to apply seaweed or kelp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the main reasons for that,
outside of the fact that I love to eat
[SPEAKER_02]: seaweed, is it's filled with beneficial
hormones in a very balanced application.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cytokinins, oxens, and gibberellins will
all help the plant trigger its natural
[SPEAKER_02]: defense mechanism and fight off this pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: In reality, what we're trying to do is
prepare the plant for war at all times and
[SPEAKER_02]: allow the plant to defend itself
naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that brings us to synergies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is about how the choices that you
make interact with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do they interact with the microbes,
the beneficials?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do the chemicals kill beneficials?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do they kill the bad guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do they affect the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, synergies, sulfurs and oils,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't spray them at the same time,
otherwise we will burn their plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do your choices interact with your
personal consciousness and how do they
[SPEAKER_02]: impact the bottom line, efficacy,
price point, branding, and the final
[SPEAKER_02]: product?
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, what I usually say
is your IPM and IMM strategy will have a
[SPEAKER_02]: tremendous impact on how your plant grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every IPM and IMM choice you make has an
impact on the pest, the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more that you can prevent,
the less you'll have to intervene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And accept the negative impacts physical,
biological, and chemical control can have
[SPEAKER_02]: on plant vitality, yield, and quality of
your finished flowers and extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to say control your culture or it
will control you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I mean by that is that a lack of
control will necessitate consistent
[SPEAKER_02]: intervention and leads to inconsistent
results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Physical, biological, and chemical control
require training and misapplications do
[SPEAKER_02]: happen, sometimes with disastrous results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas proper cultural control has no
negative impacts on the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: it will never burn your plant and it
synergizes with every aspect of your
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cultural control is environmental control.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the foundation of any IPM and IMM
strategy and the key to consistent high
[SPEAKER_02]: quality harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have good environmental
control, you will always be battling pests
[SPEAKER_02]: and you will never know how many grams per
square foot or hundreds of dollars per
[SPEAKER_02]: pound it is costing you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, I'd love to sort of jump
into some Q&A.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to go through that pretty quick so
we could tackle some real world questions,
[SPEAKER_02]: which we saw a lot of come in before the
webinar as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: First question here from Ben.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't answer how I kill PM and mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a great question,
Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something that I think definitely
takes a conversation with the individual
[SPEAKER_02]: gardener on making the appropriate
approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let me put it this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts with cultural control.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have a clean space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the progression goes something
like this, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get cultural control so we can
prevent this from happening in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get cultural control so the
applications that we take are most
[SPEAKER_02]: effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, I like to start with if there's an
outbreak, immediately go to physical
[SPEAKER_02]: control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remove the leaves that you see being hot
spots for possible vectors, contamination,
[SPEAKER_02]: and spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's about building this castle
cell wall with microbiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had mentioned a handful of beneficial
fungi and bacteria that work against
[SPEAKER_02]: powder and mildew and might work against
mites in the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my feeling is it's all about
diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's throw every beneficial microbe we
can at this plant and see how she
[SPEAKER_02]: responds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's give her every tool in the toolbox.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know enough about microbiology
and plants for me to say, this is the
[SPEAKER_02]: answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, I say, think about teas,
ferments, read some good books that are
[SPEAKER_02]: challenging what we know and allowing us
to really dive into different
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it comes to an actual deployment of
beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in this particular case, let's bring
insects to the party.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what if we're indoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's not an option.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to burn a bunch of ladybugs
and I don't want to clean up a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: dead carcasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the same time, I'm thinking,
give me diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me as many beneficials as I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get them in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they're not a direct impact on that
spider mite, but they're going to help us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil mites or rove beetles, beneficial
nematodes, get them all to the party so
[SPEAKER_02]: they can try and work for you 24 hours a
day the entire time before we have to get
[SPEAKER_02]: to chemical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when it comes to chemical,
I sort of tend to find myself in the oils
[SPEAKER_02]: and soaps category a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think about some sort of extract that
might affect the mites as a nerve toxin,
[SPEAKER_02]: something like pyrethrin derived from
chrysanthemum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would mix that with an oil that would
suffocate maybe another oil or an extract
[SPEAKER_02]: that would prevent breeding, prevent
feeding and prevent the larval
[SPEAKER_02]: development.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something like neem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we need something that's going to mix
those things together and make them more
[SPEAKER_02]: effective as an application.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's surfactant like soap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I like a penetrant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love penetrants to kill eggs,
whether it's citric acid or alcohol or
[SPEAKER_02]: something of that nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when we think about what we just went
over, oils, soaps and alcohols,
[SPEAKER_02]: those are also really effective against
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a pretty good synergistic first
pass of, hey, that's an application that's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to kill both of these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be done appropriately with the
appropriate dilutions at the appropriate
[SPEAKER_02]: timelines with the appropriate
environmental conditions, but they are
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, it's really about
understanding what the ultimate goal is to
[SPEAKER_02]: get great flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we can get environmental control,
we can do preventative applications during
[SPEAKER_02]: the vegetative process, build the castle
cell wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the first two weeks of flour,
take action if we need to from a chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective, and then kick back and let
those plants develop without additional
[SPEAKER_02]: foliar applications that degrade our
product and compromise our quality in the
end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sort of my approach there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like that IPM triangle has been
sort of flipped on its head over the last
[SPEAKER_00]: few decades or so, and people started with
chemical control, but it should be really
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed and started with chemical control
first as a prevent, or excuse me,
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural control first as a prevention
method.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're, we're still
discovering, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I had my hydro shop, everyone just
wanted to come in and buy a poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say like, Hey, think about
talking to the beneficial and sectory and
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing what they have available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to dragon fly earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to mammoth pee.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make microbes research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Elaine Ingham.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a look at Korean natural farming and
one straw revolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look into these other methodologies that
are historically viable and have worked
[SPEAKER_02]: for hundreds of years in other locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understand what's working for them and
incorporate that because it's so much more
[SPEAKER_02]: cost effective with so much less
degradation to your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can take that, that approach of
prevention before intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of a line of last resort with,
uh, with the chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, an interesting question, sort of part
parlaying on the, on the concept of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of microbes and microbiology and pests,
uh, from Anders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's saying some growers seem to be
taking a general clean room approach to
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM, whereas others are utilizing natural
defenses like biologics and beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think a hybrid approach of the two
methodologies is achievable while being
[SPEAKER_00]: practical and day-to-day workflow and cost
effective in terms of production costs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think this approach will lessen
the efficacies of both schools of thought?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I usually say is that every
facility I've ever been into has pests and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're our cultivators out there that
will attest to me walking into their
[SPEAKER_02]: facility and them saying, Hey man,
this room's really clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me flipping over a bug and are flipping
over a plant and saying, but what about
[SPEAKER_02]: these eggs?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are these guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in short, what I would say is it's
really, really hard to have a perfectly
[SPEAKER_02]: sterile environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then on the flip side of that,
there's, there's a benefit to sterility,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and I'm a big fan of trying to
be as clean as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what happens is you get these two
schools of thought and they think that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're diametrically opposed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reality is, is that yes,
so many chemical applications,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's hydrogen peroxide and acetic
acid with Xeritol or some sort of other
[SPEAKER_02]: spray like sulfur, which is going to kill
our beneficials are not going to work with
[SPEAKER_02]: the microbiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used to say this all the time to
encouraging people that were using
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic nutrients in their feeding
schedule to incorporate compost teas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, those synthetic nutrients,
some of these chemical poisons and toxins
[SPEAKER_02]: will kill microbes, but the strong will
survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we kill 60% of the microbes with our
sterile approach, we still have 40% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes that don't care about what you're
throwing at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, yeah, I mean, there's,
there is a marriage in there somewhere
[SPEAKER_02]: that allows for realistic application of,
you know, a sterile environment and what
[SPEAKER_02]: it takes to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at the same time, embracing
microbiology and, and beneficials.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a cost and benefit there,
but yes, I think it's viable to blend the
[SPEAKER_02]: two of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the more momentum you can build
with microbiology and beneficials,
[SPEAKER_02]: the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: That momentum is what's going to carry you
through those last four weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you need to, you can apply some of
these chemicals, sterile approaches,
[SPEAKER_02]: but don't be afraid to mix the two,
see, see who survives and who the
[SPEAKER_02]: strongest ones are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if pathogen pressures are
cumulative, it doesn't make sense to do as
[SPEAKER_01]: much as you can all the way through the
cycle, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we go into rooms where they've
got the pads full of alcohol or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: some other sterilizing media that you step
in before you walk in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see people gown up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that on smaller room grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be a real hassle in terms of
workflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going from one room to another
and the, the movement is, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the duration in a room is short,
then it is really going to hamper your
[SPEAKER_01]: workflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we go to large greenhouses,
for example, they're going to be in this
[SPEAKER_01]: bay for two hours or three hours at a
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, what's that breakeven point
is do we do, is there a breaking point
[SPEAKER_01]: we've noticed in the facilities we've been
in or should we just be doing it all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the place?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think again, it's sort of going
back and referencing that triangle,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about starting with a culture of
clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what does it take to get that culture
of clean and make decisions that are
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriate for that?
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when it comes to plant health,
it's important to think about the stages
[SPEAKER_02]: of physical, biological, and then
chemical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just because you're trying to create a
clean environment doesn't necessarily mean
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to exclude beneficials.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are trying to create an environment
that doesn't have bad pests and pathogens,
[SPEAKER_02]: no Pythium, no Botrytis, no powdery
mildew, no Aspirillus, but those are not
[SPEAKER_02]: the beneficials we're bringing in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, it's like, let's bring in some
beneficials that work on our behalf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try and keep the room as sterile and
clean as possible in between the rums,
[SPEAKER_02]: gas the room to make sure that we don't
have that vector.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, if you think that
you're going to skip those first three
[SPEAKER_02]: steps of cultural, physical, and
biological control, it will be very
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive to continue to apply the right
chemicals and the right processes to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that you have a sterile environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the end, you're probably not going
to achieve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so rare that I've walked into a
facility and I thought, man, it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be hard for me to find a pest here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually, I just walk in and go to the
mop sink or go to the bathroom or go to
[SPEAKER_02]: the doorknob and just like, Hey,
let's do a swab, send this off to the lab,
[SPEAKER_02]: see what comes back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pests are one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's a way to keep them all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you talk about microscopic microbes
and the fact that we're shedding microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: off of our skin at such a high rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I don't see how there'd be any way
to really create an entirely sterile
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, it makes a lot of sense to
foster the good microbes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial pests potentially, because I
just, it just seems like an impossible
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to achieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll say this though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a lot of automation developments
and automation where we're trying to get
[SPEAKER_02]: more people out of that space,
more items out of that space, more vectors
[SPEAKER_02]: out of that space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of having someone come in,
that's wearing gloves and a Tyvek suit,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's four inches too short on the arm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time they brush against the
leaf, they bring on whatever's on their
[SPEAKER_02]: arm.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, now we're trying to get to the
point where it's like, should we automate
[SPEAKER_02]: this completely?
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we have sensors and cameras in the
room telling us what pests are there or
[SPEAKER_02]: where we have an issue in the canopy that
looks different than the rest of the
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we have basically a running set of
mechanical scissors that come and trim up
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis appropriately?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen these things explored.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the reasons is because it's so
hard to keep a room clean and people
[SPEAKER_02]: coming in, they bring in their pests with
them a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, darn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you got to do tissue culture to
make sure your genetics are clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure the media that you're planting
the plantlets into are clean, that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's zero interference from
humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, I mean, I guess I wonder also if
it's a sterile, in fact, a sterile
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, what are you missing if you
don't have beneficial microbes within your
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you, are you growing good,
the best plants that you can?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting the terpene and the
cannabinoid content and the biomass that
[SPEAKER_00]: is potential in the, in the genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think there's a whole nother
webinar of me blab, blabbing on my soapbox
[SPEAKER_02]: about how great microbes are, but the
research is out there and more is coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: The benefits, the yield benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a company that I look at is,
is Mammoth Pea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they work with a lot of people,
they show you, how much more you can yield
[SPEAKER_02]: with the benefit of microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They show you how you can unlock nutrients
in a different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then it's really embracing it from a
synergistic, you know, position where it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like, if you're just going to feed
nutrient salts, do you have the
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriate cation exchange?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have amino acids?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have B1 vitamins?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about thinking about plant health
from a holistic perspective and microbes
[SPEAKER_02]: play a role.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you like it or not, there are
going to be microbes on your plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: even in a sterile environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob and I have talked about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, maybe we bring hydrogen
peroxide gas or radical oxidative species
[SPEAKER_02]: to the plant in order to make sure that
the plant sterile, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reality is that's probably going
to wipe out the beneficial microbes cell
[SPEAKER_02]: wall that we have on the plant or in the
root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's allowing those, those nutrients to
be more available or creating nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: cycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant can eat hundreds and hundreds
of times a day rather than just the one to
[SPEAKER_02]: five times you feed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's again, it's about synergy and it's
about understanding the risk reward and
[SPEAKER_02]: costs and cost benefit analysis there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just really quick question from,
from Pat Jack or just really asking for a
[SPEAKER_00]: little elaboration here about Jesse,
your LinkedIn post about the health of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cuticle and the plant waxes deterring
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's a little bit different
than the systemic acquired response.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plant is essentially, it has these
waxes on it that allow it to
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthesize and transpire and deal
with the external environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I've seen is that, you know,
one of the biggest pest vectors is when
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves die.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that I believe sends off pheromones
from the plant that attracts these
[SPEAKER_02]: negative insects that say, Oh,
this plant's weak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's come eat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the same time, those dead leaves
are a potential habitat for powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_02]: or botrytis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, and this is probably a
conversation that might set Rob off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about accurately controlling the VPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about making sure that the moisture
content in the air relative to the leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue temperature is appropriate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not drying out those cuticular
waxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want them to remain as long as possible
because they're the best defense,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially in late stages against these
infestations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, it comes back to the tools of
the trade, know how to measure what's in
[SPEAKER_02]: your space, know how to measure the plant
and know how to control so you don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: too much wind or too much heat that are
destroying those waxes and making the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant more vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse, you hit the hot button.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I disagree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, the cuticular membrane is a very
important part of plant physiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's receptive to VPD or just
relative humidity of the air and air
[SPEAKER_01]: velocity, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know enough about the cuticular
membrane and what it's sensitive to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That particular article, I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is very good data in that article
that Pat's talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm always very sensitive to leaf
canopy temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see that touched on heavily
enough for my own liking because whenever
[SPEAKER_01]: we talk about VPD around the office or
with anybody, it's how are you measuring
[SPEAKER_01]: VPD?
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw a chart in that article that is the
one that's very popular online.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a static chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: VPD changes constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's different in your entire canopy,
at different heights of your canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to make a best guess with
it, sometimes using the best tools you
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use the cameras.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people have different tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the only thing I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: VPD is absolutely vital for plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant has got lots of vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be able to fight off all sorts of
pests and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the relative humidities go off,
you look at that chart on one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: slides, the relative humidity where you
get into the danger zones of pathogen
[SPEAKER_01]: proliferation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would say we've talked about this
and we will continue to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also think VPD is really important
for BRICS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you really want to accumulate more
sugars and vitamins and minerals inside
[SPEAKER_02]: your plant tissue, it's important to
control transpiration the right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to get to a 12 on the
BRICS scale, you really need to make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're appropriately controlling
vapor pressure deficit so the plant can
[SPEAKER_02]: take up the mobile and immobile nutrients
that it needs and redistribute them
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriately so that you get a healthy
plant from tip to stem to root.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you do that test, it's reflecting
plant health.
[SPEAKER_02]: And VPD is one of the ways to get your
BRICS higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, I would say that this is one
thing I think we totally agree on,
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's VPD or relative humidity or
airflow or whatnot, those particular waxes
[SPEAKER_02]: are important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just something that we should
think about and consider and talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: how to protect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was one of the main things I
wanted to put out there by sharing Todd's
[SPEAKER_02]: article was like, hey, let's think about
these particular waxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's think about VPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's think about humidity and how it
plays a role in integrated pest
[SPEAKER_02]: management.
[SPEAKER_01]: The analog is skin health, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have supple enough skin,
if the cholesterol in your skin goes away,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a problem with some people,
it cracks, and this is an infection zone
[SPEAKER_01]: for your skin, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is true for plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to be very sensitive to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I 100% agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't argue about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant defenses as an IPM strategy,
really building the vigor of the plant as
[SPEAKER_00]: an ability to defend itself against
attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes good sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one here from Francis,
is there an IPM strategy for curing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think a lot of people don't
think about what happens when you cure or
[SPEAKER_02]: the potential for pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really quick aside story is I have a
friend whose dad is sick and had grown
[SPEAKER_02]: weed a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had put it away when it was far too
wet and it developed all kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had all kinds of molds growing on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when he would smoke that cannabis,
he would literally pass out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would black out and wake back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, hey, does weed go bad or is
there something in these rolling papers
[SPEAKER_02]: that's hurting me?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't until we really realized
there's probably a lot of things in this
[SPEAKER_02]: product that you could have dealt with
before you put it in the jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you just would have had an
appropriate curing strategy, you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have the botrytis, the pythium and the
powdery mildew that are all over this
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and it would be safe to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, that's also a thing with my
mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I'm trying to find safe cannabis
early on in the deregulated market.
[SPEAKER_02]: People would sell anything because there
was no testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we have testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just about testing for residual
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's testing for E.
[SPEAKER_02]: coli.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's testing for salmonella.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's testing for asparilla.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are things that can occur in the
curing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, it's really important to make
sure that we migrate the moisture from the
[SPEAKER_02]: interior of the bud to the exterior of the
bud in a linear fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want the moisture to migrate back
in because then that will trap water
[SPEAKER_02]: inside that will become anaerobic and
bring up anaerobic pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to that, we need to make sure
that the water activity inside of the buds
[SPEAKER_02]: when we go to find and finally package
them is below 20%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's got a different signature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people in some counties are even
testing for this, which I think is really
[SPEAKER_02]: cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the idea is, is that if you put
cannabis in an airtight environment with
[SPEAKER_02]: water activity over 20, it's going to
sporulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things are going to grow in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can get the water activity
below 20, then there's not going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not going to be migration inside
the bud that leads to sporulation of these
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens and pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a lot of people don't filter the
air in their curing space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for years I would just hang it in
my garage and blast it with air and then
[SPEAKER_02]: throw away 20% because I'm like,
Ooh, you know, you get in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you start trimming away to roll yourself a
joint and you're like, Oh, that one's
[SPEAKER_02]: moldy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's heave ho on that one and move on to
the next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Knowing that those spores were probably
just circulated in the space without
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriate biological filtration or just
passing them from one bud to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: To that end, moving a lot of air through
the room gets that homogeneity of the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, which gives you some
reassurance that every bud in the drying
[SPEAKER_01]: and curing area is getting a consistent
temperature and humidity around it to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: the moisture moving in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to move a lot of air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have the opportunity to move
air, you should be cleaning it as you move
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no excuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we use a strategy,
you know, trapping with high efficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: filtration and then photocatalytic
oxidation downstream to clean the coil,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also clean the air with the molecular
shredders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also seal that room, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's one of the physical
barriers you can do to create pests and
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know people too, that have had a
handful of spider mites on their plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're like, no, it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not affecting my bottom line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they go to cure and then,
you know, eight days later, we've had
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands and thousands of eggs hatch and
those mites are like, man, I got to eat
[SPEAKER_02]: this really quickly before it dries out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden you're coming in with
a vacuum cleaner, trying to suck webbing
[SPEAKER_02]: off of buds that you think are going to be
sellable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not going to happen.
Yikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Jeff had a question here that I
think was just addressed about how
[SPEAKER_00]: important particulate control is in IPM
and how it's best controlled in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have anything else to add
there, please, please do so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Rob.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was just going to say, I think it's,
it has a lot to do for me about third
[SPEAKER_02]: party testing data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if someone says I'm going to do this,
I need to see the proof in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many times I've been misled by people
selling a product that hasn't been tested,
[SPEAKER_02]: that hasn't been tried, especially in the
emerging cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I had my shop every day, someone
would try and come in and sell me
[SPEAKER_02]: something that didn't work, that didn't
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was up to me to do the research and
find out how it worked, how it would be
[SPEAKER_02]: effective in my facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would it synergize with my team and how I
go about IPM?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the costs to deploy it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, so often people aren't
thinking about the facility and the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation space as a whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden people are like,
Oh, ozone works great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just pump it into your room and it'll kill
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, well, man, I've worked in
rooms that are filled with ozone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've left dizzy with nosebleeds and
thought, man, I didn't have to do much in
[SPEAKER_02]: there today because everything was dead,
but am I dying too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a scary thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's balance between risk and
reward, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some radical oxidative species,
some stress to the plant is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Persistent stress is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use it to clean the room between plants.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do everything else you can to prevent
those oxidative species from oxidizing the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes that you're trying to preserve or
oxidizing the THC you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: preserve.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and the cell wall, cell membranes,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of those things might be totally
deployable in a cloning and vegetative and
[SPEAKER_02]: mother room space, you know, but not
deployable in a flowering space.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, understand how
that's going to affect your other
[SPEAKER_02]: approaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that going to kill the microbiology?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that going to destroy the rhizophagus
irregularis that's getting you bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: roots faster?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that going to kill the glomus mosa that
needs six months or six weeks to develop
[SPEAKER_02]: in order to keep heavy metals in the root
zone and prevent them from going up into
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: These are compromises you might make by
bringing in some other sort of advanced
[SPEAKER_02]: filtration technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good one, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shift gears real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question from Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can one unit be utilized to control both
vegetative and flower stage?
[SPEAKER_01]: One HVACD unit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I believe so.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a distinct calculation that goes
along with a vegetative state room and
[SPEAKER_01]: another one for a flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically flower has got a higher
pound per hour moisture removal
[SPEAKER_01]: requirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same amount of airflow, if the room's
the same size, you'd probably see the same
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of airflow every two to three
minutes we'd be changing the air in the
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to make sure that if you're
going to use one unit, it can handle the
[SPEAKER_01]: highest load in flower and the lowest load
in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many times we get into a veg room and
the minimum stage on the HVACD unit is
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling too much water out of the room and
we need humidifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's crazy, but you've got all
these roomful of humidifiers plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you have to add humidification.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our units don't seem to suffer from
this problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We turn down everything, fans to
compressors to the energy recovery system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can get down to very small zero
moisture removal, just complete sensible,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then all the way up to the high latent
removal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do both, but you've just got to
make sure when you're sizing the unit,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can handle both sides of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think to piggyback off of that too,
thanks Rob, that was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I usually say is, if you size the
system for your flower room, then it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: same space in the same plant count.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be able to handle the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: This question also might be bringing up
the fact that people want to run one HVAC
[SPEAKER_02]: unit for both their flower and veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where it gets really tricky,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because those conditional set points are
so different.
[SPEAKER_02]: The VPD is different for those spaces,
for the stage of growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might have to compromise both
spaces if you think you're going to run
[SPEAKER_02]: one unit for flower and veg, but
absolutely the same unit, if sized
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriately, could do veg or flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, to keep word being there,
turn down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to have the turn down ability
to handle the veg, the lower load in veg,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way up to the higher load in the
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for clarifying that guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a similar line of thinking,
Anders is asking, can some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides, some of the essential oils and
other pesticides being sprayed indoors
[SPEAKER_00]: damage HVAC equipment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Radical oxidative species will tear up
plastics like nobody's business if you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got a persistent one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually what we find is they are,
I think they are oxidative to copper
[SPEAKER_01]: aluminum of some sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: So vaporized hydrogen peroxide,
as an example, is vaporized.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as it stays in the vapor gas
phase, we're OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as it starts condensing and
landing on the coils, you may run into
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your coils are running and cooling
and pulling out, turning vaporized
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrogen peroxide into liquid hydrogen
peroxide at high enough concentrations on
[SPEAKER_01]: the coil, you'll go through aluminum real
quick, is my understanding of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We recommend coil coatings if that is your
cleaning the room IPM strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've seen this come up in a number of
different projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually the answer is just don't run
your cooling coils while you're doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: room cleaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: The temperatures rise up and allow more of
that vaporized hydrogen peroxide to get
[SPEAKER_01]: into the air as you're just vaporizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's another thing about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any time you're using UV lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So UV lights can be used as a surface
cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use them as part of the PCO mechanism
to create the oxidative radicals with the
[SPEAKER_01]: titanium dioxide mesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: UV light will tear apart plastics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you need to have hardened surfaces,
UV hardened surfaces, or metal conduit for
[SPEAKER_01]: all your plastic wiring, plastic sheathed
wiring inside your air handling units.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can get a mile of wiring inside an
air handling unit pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things you don't want to
overlook because you will start shorting
[SPEAKER_01]: out sensors, start shorting out electrical
circuits, and then pop goes the circuit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to add to that too, this is actually
off topic, but it just got me thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: about what these applications do to the
machines in your space, but also to the
[SPEAKER_02]: final product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had been a big proponent of Neem for
a long time and different oils just
[SPEAKER_02]: because they mesh with my strategy and
they have low impact on the environment
[SPEAKER_02]: and the beneficials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I started to learn was that,
you know, I might have a product that's
[SPEAKER_02]: considered fantastic, top tier,
high grade flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I put it through the
extraction process, there've been
[SPEAKER_02]: extractors that pointed out to me,
it's like, man, I'm getting incredible
[SPEAKER_02]: yields out of your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like to the point that I don't understand
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we dig a little bit deeper and we
realize, oh, stylet oil and Neem oil are
[SPEAKER_02]: now part of my extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just another reason to seriously
consider what's going to attach itself to
[SPEAKER_02]: the trichomes, what's going to attach
itself to the secondary metabolites,
[SPEAKER_02]: bond with that and carry through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the casual smoker in low doses might
say, man, I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives it a whole new flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they might say, Hey, I don't,
you know, this isn't as great a product or
[SPEAKER_02]: it might cause more oxidation in long-term
storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what triggered it for me was knowing
that so many extracts concentrate these
[SPEAKER_02]: applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden you have heavy metals,
you have oils in the concentrate,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though you did very minimal
application during the growth stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse, I want to congratulate you for
saying trichomes the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, get one right every once in a while,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get one right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, don't make me say pillow
or windmill, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: With regard to Anders, Anders question as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me think about the quality of
your condensate capture as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're, if you're pulling in all sorts
of weird oils and pesticides through your
[SPEAKER_00]: HVAC CD system, what kind of stuff are you
capturing when you're condensing that
[SPEAKER_00]: water from the air and you know,
what impact does it have on the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: recycle that water back into your plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're not doing foliar
sprays, let me just throw this out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a tube with no light in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you're not going to use your
UV cleaners in the air handler in any
[SPEAKER_01]: configuration to clean inside the
condensate drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Condensate running off of the coil will
pick up all this micro particle stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not pathogens necessarily,
but it's dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these dirt becomes these dirt
balls and these dirt balls become
[SPEAKER_01]: nucleation sites for bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard to get rid of all the
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and anywhere in an air handling
unit or in a room, like we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about, whether you're doing sprays or not,
condensate drain water needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: analyzed and treated and probably purified
in some way, shape or forms before you try
[SPEAKER_01]: and put it back into the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just like you said, if you're,
if any of this oil makes it through the
[SPEAKER_01]: particulate capture system and makes it
onto the coil, the condensate coming off
[SPEAKER_01]: is a stream of water that's going to clean
off that coil and it's going to end up in
[SPEAKER_01]: the condensate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a guy who loves to recycle a
hundred percent of my water, it's one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the reasons why I sort of steer in that
oils and soaps world because the bacteria
[SPEAKER_02]: and the fungi that accumulate in the
condensate drains, I'm okay dealing with
[SPEAKER_02]: remediation through compost tea,
through fermentation, through breeding of
[SPEAKER_02]: billions of good microbes that consume the
bad microbes and outperform them in a
[SPEAKER_02]: space and an environment in the tea brewer
where they're guaranteed to win.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest problems for me is like,
what else is coming out of that room?
[SPEAKER_02]: How much sulfur is coming into that space?
[SPEAKER_02]: What other acids and chemicals are coming
into the space that are compromising my
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to recycle the water and messing
up with my tea or becoming consumed by the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiology of my tea and then
redelivered to the root zone in a super
[SPEAKER_02]: available way that now is absorbed into
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of unhealthy things to think
about when it comes to that perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of interesting stuff to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one from Andy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you had success getting rid of
Fusarium in a cannabis grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think a lot of times people see
it and they're like, Oh man, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: spray hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my only option.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, when it comes to systemic waste,
like fungal colonies coming through the
[SPEAKER_02]: root zone and coming through the water,
you need to go back and get cultural
[SPEAKER_02]: control.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really the only option.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to treat that water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe it's about getting a water test
and understanding what's in your water as
[SPEAKER_02]: it comes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like Rob said, as you recycle it,
let's learn about the microbes that are in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's make sure that we, you know,
remediate with UV filtration or some sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of treatment, ozone treatment or something
in the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then have a secondary process to make
sure that we're not putting ozone and UV
[SPEAKER_02]: into the root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some, some spot fixes that people
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people like to run
systemic microbes, you know, get as many
[SPEAKER_02]: fungal and bacterial colonies on and in
the plant as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can prevent the uptake of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can filter that horrid water as it
comes into the root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the end, it's a water mold and you
need to deal with standing water in the
[SPEAKER_02]: space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Possible drips from condensate lines,
filters, leaks, anaerobic water pools,
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you clean the room and you push
everything into the hallway and you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: clean the hallway, bam, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water molds in the hallway, mop sink,
water molds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like any place where water is going to
stagnate needs to be addressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it comes down to that culture of clean
in addition to dealing with the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's almost no point in going in
and fighting Pythium or Fusarium in the
[SPEAKER_02]: space on the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a, it's a battle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, attack the source, not,
not, don't, don't put a bandaid,
[SPEAKER_00]: try and put a bandaid on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you get control of the culture,
then your applications to take that
[SPEAKER_02]: Fusarium and Pythium, Rhizoctonia,
anything like that out of the picture will
[SPEAKER_02]: be that much more effective because
instead of battling the incoming of new
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, you've stopped that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you can let good microbes take
hold or good chemistry ward off the
[SPEAKER_02]: effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the end, you know, a lot of times I
see people go to tissue culture after that
[SPEAKER_02]: experience and they think, Oh man,
I need to remove the epigenetic material.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get back to a stasis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to start from a genetic beginning
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not battling this with the cuttings
that I maybe got from my mom, because if
[SPEAKER_02]: you fed your mother plant that same water,
now you should think about getting rid of
[SPEAKER_02]: all your mother plants or treating it with
systemic bacteria and fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim is asking, how do I determine if
something is a nutrient deficiency or a
[SPEAKER_00]: pest?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in a lot of times it comes back
down to scouting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, when I walk into a facility,
I like to take a look at the canopy as a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to find plants or spaces that look
a little bit differently than the rest of
[SPEAKER_02]: the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I immediately go there and
address it with my microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look on the leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look on the backside of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look on the stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look in the media.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for larva.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always my first spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like let's find the pest that's
killing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can't find any pests, if I can't find
postules, if I don't see the black dots,
[SPEAKER_02]: the initial formation of powdery mildew,
then I think of fertigation as the
[SPEAKER_02]: remediation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, okay, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this emitter on these group of plants
working?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we delivering the appropriate amount
of nutrition?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a nutrient lockup?
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, if you go through those steps
and you can't identify a pest on the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: or in the space, then it's probably
nutrient or environmental related.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go back, change your fertigation
schedule, think about what that might be,
[SPEAKER_02]: what might've caused that, try and link
that up with some pictures you see,
[SPEAKER_02]: and get a balanced delivery of fertigation
back to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what I would do is say, come heavy with
seaweed, because it'll trigger systemic
[SPEAKER_02]: acquired response, and it'll be a bunch of
micronutrients to help your plant recover
[SPEAKER_02]: as quick as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're losing emitters,
you know, a good control system is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to tell you that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're tracking, like we do moisture
removal across the course of a day,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're stacking it on day on day on
day, we know if we're getting to the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of the cycle and the water transpiration
rate starts to fall off, that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably an emitter problem or some sort
of watering problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll be the first place to look and
we alarm off that on our control system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's ways to just kind of
get that one in the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a good control system,
I'm not sure about the other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times like, you know,
it just ends up being, depending on your
[SPEAKER_02]: fertigation, it's a salt buildup or a
buildup in the lines or glomulin or
[SPEAKER_02]: something preventing that plant from
getting the appropriate dose of nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the large scale, that tends to be with
a professional fertigation approach that
[SPEAKER_02]: tends to be like the number one problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can go ahead and take a look
at changing the dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if the rest of the canopy looks good,
isolate that space, isolate that plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: think about what's specifically wrong with
the controls, the physical and cultural
[SPEAKER_02]: space for that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pat makes a good point about
identifying the damage to the plant tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: as being a good way to tell if it's a
pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in a lot of ways I can spot a pest
from a few feet away.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's speckling on the top side of the
leaves, depending on the size of the
[SPEAKER_02]: speckling, I'm like, oh, you have mite
issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see the lines in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got, you know, some sort of leaf
miner.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a big juicy bud outside in
one little brown spot, you've got
[SPEAKER_02]: caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go quickly, spray some bacillus
thuringiensis, spray it in the morning so
[SPEAKER_02]: it has time to work and not be affected by
the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Release some trichogamma wasps.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, think about the local hatch
rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of stuff you can do to sort
of, you know, take a look at the damage
[SPEAKER_02]: and get a really good idea of what's going
on due to the damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you might not always find a pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pat's actually absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you do see the damage, that's just
another sign and indicator of what's going
[SPEAKER_02]: on in the space.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Final, final question here and we can,
we can call it a wrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the advantages of PCO over UV and
also HEPA versus MIRV 13 versus MIRV 8?
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I mentioned before, we use UV in
PCO.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is activating the titanium dioxide
catalytic reaction to disassociate water
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules in the air, create these OH
negative hydroxyl radicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for that eight inch window,
we are creating a very highly oxidative
[SPEAKER_01]: air stream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight inches, just downstream of our
cooling coil that anything running through
[SPEAKER_01]: it in that eight inches, it's enough,
it's enough exposure to the oxidation to
[SPEAKER_01]: basically shred the molecule casing on a
virus or even tear apart VOCs and odors
[SPEAKER_01]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's different than UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So UV light requires a dose over a long
period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, UV is a good surface cleaner,
but if I'm going to try and get a particle
[SPEAKER_01]: of air that's traveling at 500 feet per
minute through my air handler and 1100
[SPEAKER_01]: feet per minute through my duct,
I need 40 feet, 60 feet of UV light at a
[SPEAKER_01]: high intensity throughout that entire...
Now again, UV light, great surface
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaner, not so great particulate killer
or particularly, you know, disabler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you just need so much of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know those systems are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's your preference, fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just, I don't understand what,
you know, the maintenance costs associated
[SPEAKER_01]: with having such a high intensity UV
light, changing the bulbs all the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: having access into that duct work and just
see it being problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the difference between UV and PCO.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that made sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of filter, you know, particulate
filtration, HEPA, MERV 13, MERV 8,
[SPEAKER_01]: the lower you go, so HEPAs are MERV 16,
or yeah, HEPAs are MERV 16 plus,
[SPEAKER_01]: MERV 13 and then MERV 8, the lower the
number, the more of the smaller particles
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to get through.
[SPEAKER_01]: A MERV 13 is not perfect at capturing all
of the particulate that we want to stop,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, one micron or above,
but it does a very good job of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: HEPAs, you know, there's a balance point
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to spend a lot more energy
moving air through a HEPA filter,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has just got smaller holes,
which is why it's doing so much more
[SPEAKER_01]: particulate capture than you are in a MERV
13 filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you know, MERV 13 equivalents or
HEPA equivalents, have the lower pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: drop, and we prefer to use those instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a balancing point.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never expand the rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just, they're a sieve to the things
that we think are a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: MERV 13s do a really good job,
and with the PCO downstream during the
[SPEAKER_01]: coil cleaning and the Airstream cleaning,
I think we've got a pretty good one,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good balance between energy
consumption and air cleaning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that was supposed to be the last
question, but you know, when we announced
[SPEAKER_02]: this webinar, I got a handful of questions
from legacy growers, from my friends in
[SPEAKER_02]: the industry, from people that asked me if
I was going to sort of tackle the
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation about my microdosing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's an important thing to
talk about, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first heard the term microdosing,
it was, you know, I immediately thought,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do some mushrooms and go to work,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be more creative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a great idea to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I realized that my friends were
talking about, you know, microdosing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Eagle 20 and Tetrasan and Forbid
and Merit WP and these banned substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I came from an industry where we had
to use what was available.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lack of regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lack of study and there was a
lack of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we grabbed for the things that were
commercially viable in commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture and we utilized them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you utilize them inappropriately,
there are huge consequences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you'll fail a test.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have to destroy product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be a brand black eye.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might pass a test when it comes to
buds, but then you're going to fail a test
[SPEAKER_02]: when it comes to concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's my real cautious tale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here I've been growing cannabis for a
really long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before I knew any better, I used
banned substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I decided that I was going to
have a family.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been with my wife for over 20 years
and it was really, really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I couldn't figure out why it was so
hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were trying so much, but we weren't
having kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I realized was maybe it has
something to do with this stuff getting
[SPEAKER_02]: absorbed into my skin, into my body.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are these systemic pesticides doing
to me as a person?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I completely stopped.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got away from every pesticide that I did
not understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything that I thought may or may not
be banned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And six months later, my wife and I had
our first kid miles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, yeah, you do whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a personal choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a business choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in reality, there are consequences
that you might not be thinking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just my personal story.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't resonate with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't resonate with everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reality is, I think that is the
reason why we were unable to have children
[SPEAKER_02]: for so many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for sharing that, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't heard that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you wonder what the impact it has
when you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A flower with banned substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: You turn these chemicals into awful
carcinogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hate to end it on that note.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys want to tell a joke before we
sign off?
[SPEAKER_02]: IPM is not a joke, Brian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing I want to do on YouTube for the
rest of that history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, great job, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for your time.
