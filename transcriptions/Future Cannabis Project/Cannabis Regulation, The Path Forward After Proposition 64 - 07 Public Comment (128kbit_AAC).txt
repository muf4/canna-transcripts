[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go ahead and move on to public
comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we could have everybody line up that
wishes to give public comment,
[SPEAKER_02]: please sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning, Glenn Backus for Drug Policy
Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: RC4 partner Drug Policy Action was part of
the drafting committee for Prop 64,
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the steering committee for 64,
and the second largest donor to 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like Drug Policy Alliance to be a
resource to the committee, to the members,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to blow up my phone.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, additional public comment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, my name is Regina Wilson,
and I am the Chair and Executive Director
[SPEAKER_04]: of California Black Media.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just like to echo Assemblymember
Ridley-Thomas' comments.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do believe that there is a deep concern.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe earlier, Mr. Joyne Sawyer also
pointed to the lack of outreach to the
[SPEAKER_04]: actual community, so I hear a lot of local
governments talking, but the community's
[SPEAKER_04]: not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I represent over 22 African American-owned
media outlets.
[SPEAKER_04]: Zero conversation, zero invitations to any
of the meetings to be able to talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's affected our community in a way that,
I mean, many of you know how the war on
[SPEAKER_04]: drugs has affected our community,
and I just believe that I'm hoping that I
[SPEAKER_04]: can work with the committee in some kind
of way to talk about how public notices
[SPEAKER_04]: can happen within these local communities.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that they're a part of the regulatory
process, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, thank you, appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to take a lot of partnerships
as we continue to move forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this time, let me ask if there's
additional public comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hearing and seeing none, let me turn it
back to members on the dais for concluding
[SPEAKER_02]: remarks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just thank the Chair for putting this
together, and thank everybody for their
[SPEAKER_03]: comments, and really appreciate the
update.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to stress again, personal
experience working with everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: associated with the regulatory process has
been very positive, and I look forward to
[SPEAKER_03]: continuing to work with them as we go
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms. Caviar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, I'd like to thank the Chair as
well, and to say that it is interesting to
[SPEAKER_05]: me to see how smoothly this is moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought the January 1st, 18 day was
crazy, and people have worked really hard
[SPEAKER_05]: at trying to make it work.
[SPEAKER_05]: The best way to do regulations is not
through the emergency regulation process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that we had people here that
represent really important interest in
[SPEAKER_05]: this industry, saying that it's been a
good process so far I think is really
[SPEAKER_05]: outstanding.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot more work to be done,
and they haven't seen the regulations yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's maybe premature, but I want to
also recognize and acknowledge the hard
[SPEAKER_05]: work that's gone on by not only the
Department of Public Health, the Food and
[SPEAKER_05]: Ag, and also the Bureau, but everybody
that's working on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a miracle that we've got this far in
that people are nodding their heads and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's going in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just say thank you as well to
everyone that not only participated,
[SPEAKER_02]: but everybody that came in to meet with us
individually as well, all the different
[SPEAKER_02]: stakeholders of groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, local police chiefs, police
officers, people on the beaten.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was really everybody from every
walk of life, and so we do appreciate the
[SPEAKER_02]: impact that it's having.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do want to thank my two co-chairs
and all the assembly members.
[SPEAKER_02]: By my count, I think we had over 25
assembly members attend this morning's
[SPEAKER_02]: hearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I want to publicly acknowledge each
of them, which was Assemblymember Wood,
[SPEAKER_02]: Caballero, Steinorth, Brough, Mathis,
Waldron, Grayson, Quirksilva, Gray,
[SPEAKER_02]: Lackey, Cooley, Bloom, Eggman,
Daly, Holden, Chu, Gibson, Burke,
[SPEAKER_02]: Lamone, Arambola, Quirk, Jones-Sawyer,
Aguiar, Curry, Baker, Mr. Sebastian
[SPEAKER_02]: Ridley-Thomas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I forgot anybody, I apologize,
but I think that was a good showing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of interest here in the
legislature about not only how this is
[SPEAKER_02]: unfolding and the framework we put around
it, but the public safety aspects as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's around edibles or the amount
of dispensaries or where they're located,
[SPEAKER_02]: also transportation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is definitely a concern here and
something that we want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: one, it's not in the hands of children,
but also that we're making sure that our
[SPEAKER_02]: communities are safe and that this is done
responsibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll continue to not only work on
this in our policy hearings, but probably
[SPEAKER_02]: even have another informational hearing
just to see how things are going along the
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, I will conclude the joint
informational hearing between the Assembly
[SPEAKER_02]: Committee on Business and Professions,
the Assembly Committee on Health,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Assembly Committee on Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all for being here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
