[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm actually super curious to hear
about you guys' thoughts on Caring,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're a single season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess maybe where I've talked with him
about this, and it's something I talk with
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people about, is when we're
producing the majority of our volume in
[SPEAKER_00]: October, really, for most of us,
maybe September and November, but in this
[SPEAKER_00]: small window, what are our different
methodologies that maybe an indoor or even
[SPEAKER_00]: all-year greenhouse growers aren't really
worried about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course they process, because they're
moving in before the next one's coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for us, it's like, I've been thinking
about the levels to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaving herb untrimmed on the stalk with
all the leaves is the least invasive,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it gets more and more invasive
all the way to pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how it degrades the product faster and
faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trimmed units, all the way, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eighth jars, pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, kids, take it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was wondering what you guys'
thoughts were on this storage of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product and degradation for us,
where the majority of the flowers are
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing in in October, maybe September,
November.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's this small window, and we're
working across the whole year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maybe a greenhouse or certainly an
indoor grower doesn't have that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're working through these batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're working through these batches to
get to their next batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that I see that by keeping our product
on the stalk with leaves, minimal oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: in a room that's taking care of humidity
and temperature-wise, it's going to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: best way to store the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, so we go to trimmed
units that at least are congregated
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when we move to eighth jars,
they've got a lot of air space in them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a further oxidation,
faster oxidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then pre-rolls just got awful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grinding it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just wondering what you guys'
thoughts are on storage and curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and the curing and maybe how
terpenes or the structure of the flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: different cultivars factor in to the
longevity or when you introduce them to
[SPEAKER_00]: the market or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one thing I think is important about
[SPEAKER_02]: especially long-term storage, we do one
harvest a year, so we plan to store it for
[SPEAKER_02]: a whole year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should last that long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a big part of it have to do with it is
how has it been dried and has it been
[SPEAKER_02]: bruised.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so whether it's trimmed or not,
I actually prefer to store it trimmed
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's smaller and it takes up less
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's important that if you're going to
store it trimmed, it's properly dried and
[SPEAKER_02]: not bruised.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't like to store weed that's
squishy because I feel like a lot of your
[SPEAKER_02]: color degradation happens from too much
moisture in the herb permeating for too
[SPEAKER_02]: long of a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also that has to do with the bruising
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's been bruised by a rough trim
job that's been cut into the bud or too
[SPEAKER_02]: close, you're not going to be able to keep
that fresh look for quite the same amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even in the handling during the
harvesting process, you can really affect
[SPEAKER_01]: how that flower is going to dry in the way
you handle it from the minute you cut to
[SPEAKER_01]: the minute it hangs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sooner and as smoothly and
delicately as possible as you can get that
[SPEAKER_01]: flower from cut to hang, there's a big
effect that's going to have on how it
[SPEAKER_01]: drives.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you want to cure for long term,
we have noticed that when we keep things
[SPEAKER_01]: on the stem and don't trim it all the way,
it does preserve it really well in the
[SPEAKER_01]: right environment as you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it's properly cured out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in that state, it's properly dry and
it's not bruised.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like a big part of it is what
happens after the harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that going to affect the long term
storage?
[SPEAKER_02]: So every moment of handling has an impact
on how it's handled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we have dry flowers that are
covered in little tiny balls of resin on
[SPEAKER_02]: little tiny stalks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so too much resin being knocked off,
too many leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even in the trimming, I feel like too many
leaves being left on with the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not cleanly trimmed and the leaves
will affect the.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, and I see I see that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and that's kind of where I go into
structure and maybe even terpings as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I notice that with the certain
cultivars, certain varieties that I work
[SPEAKER_00]: with, that they have an ability to store
much better than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, if we're talking about nose,
I do notice that there's certain varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: like I see it with a lot of my sours that
I don't really want to consume them right
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I typically don't in that type of
realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that after a few months, they're
really prime for me to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other ones that certain I see it
a lot with citrus with the orange where
[SPEAKER_00]: initially I'm like, wow, that's that's
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really different than than other
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that amazing feature,
that single very specific nose,
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of flashes off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those varieties, yeah, I might like
to get to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different terpings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, terpings are molecularly so volatile
and so sensitive to the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they do evolve over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes a minute to really see where
it's going to settle out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the art of the cure is
letting it cure into its really optimal
[SPEAKER_01]: proportions of where everything
molecularly is is going to sit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to hold that some some terpings are
extremely volatile and others turn into
[SPEAKER_01]: other ones that are also really
interesting over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're talking about how the
flavor changes over time, we'll go through
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole year and we'll taste our
cannabis that we're storing and watch it
[SPEAKER_01]: change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we love it at different stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it does change a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it in all those different forms of
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get like in addition to the
different experiences you're getting with
[SPEAKER_00]: between your varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you're getting even more
experiences and variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's that's a cool thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them transform very richly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them at 10 months, they're just
getting to like where I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is getting better and better and
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really hitting its peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even know it could be like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, when you get it again,
then next year comes out and I feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a year long thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an experience that goes the whole
year until the new flowers come and then
[SPEAKER_02]: you get excited about them because they're
fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't mean that just because
depths start coming out now in the early
[SPEAKER_01]: summer, I don't think that means that the
outdoor suddenly isn't good at nine or 10
[SPEAKER_01]: or even a year, which it depends on how
good of a job you did at your job,
[SPEAKER_01]: which used to be which it is part of our
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when you're putting out batches
all the time and they're going straight to
[SPEAKER_01]: market, it's a totally different scenario
as far as the cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even have the opportunity to do
the kind of cure that you would to make it
[SPEAKER_01]: really amazing all year long.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a myth and a fallacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also like you have to say,
I'm planning to try and cure this to store
[SPEAKER_02]: for a whole year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a small root cellar.
[SPEAKER_02]: We we store everything we're not like
immediately smoking in, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it stays at like a fifty five in the
dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it definitely I feel like if you
want to go longer than a year,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you need to think about separating
the resin and curing just the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, one thing that like just from
like my experience and like how we'd looks
[SPEAKER_02]: and what what I see is like a lot of
people trim too close or too loose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also don't dry it quite enough to
get past the first few months,
[SPEAKER_02]: because for the first few months it looks
really great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then after that, you know,
like maybe it'll get dry, but it wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: dried to preserve the color and the
freshness to to last, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like if it's a little squishy and
you leave it like that from drying,
[SPEAKER_02]: that I think will degrade quicker than
shelf life than something that was a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit more dry at the beginning where
it kind of locked in the freshness,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I feel like with cannabis,
you know, it's not tobacco, it's not like
[SPEAKER_02]: a leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're actually what you're
curing is the resin on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and that's where all the flavor comes
from and all the cannabinoids and and some
[SPEAKER_02]: of that is intermingled with the with the
plant tissue, but most of it is just in
[SPEAKER_02]: the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you are curing, you're not
necessarily curing the plant material,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're curing the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for like a long term storage,
if you think about resin as your main
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredient, like component, then that you
want the plant material to be like less
[SPEAKER_02]: emphasized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I think that that plays back
in the dissipation of the chlorophyll that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting with that long term dry and
and texture as opposed to structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like structure ties into the
visuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about that a lot,
but like I I see with texture a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's when I start breaking down,
it's kind of clogged up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's a good, good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like that, that when it's when it's
been dried really slowly, you get to this
[SPEAKER_00]: point where the stem snaps and you're
like, wow, it's incredibly dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet somehow this kind of magic trick has
happened where it's still gooey on the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus when it happens the other way and
people are like, no, it's totally dry
[SPEAKER_00]: because the flower feels so dry,
but you know there's still moisture in
[SPEAKER_00]: that stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That product's degrading in a few months
and they're bagging it like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your stems have to snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like hard and yet at the same time have
that kind of suppleness to the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that translates into some of
that's varietal differences, but some of
[SPEAKER_00]: it into how it's going to break the
feeling of how it's going to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily just like whether the
whether it's oily or sticky in the in the
[SPEAKER_00]: resin, but the actual plant material
that's left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has this certain part that it peels
apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, if it's actually really cured out
the way you guys are talking about versus
[SPEAKER_00]: when they it's dried too fast,
it like it kind of crumbles in this
[SPEAKER_00]: certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I notice it and it seems I don't know if
that's in relation to the chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something that I think what
they're talking about about this this
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenon of the product that's going to
in a three or four months just be totally
[SPEAKER_00]: fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just seeing one one thing that I
correlate with that is the texture,
[SPEAKER_00]: the feeling of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's the same variety as the one
over there, but there's it breaks down in
[SPEAKER_00]: a more crumbly fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know exactly what that is,
but it's something that I see that that
[SPEAKER_00]: tends to tie with the product browning out
faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the preservation of the
integrity of the cellular structure and
[SPEAKER_01]: the handling and the damage and the
bruising are also ways that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: negatively impact that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think the brittleness could be an
impact that is similar from, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and a lot plays into it and picking it at
the right time definitely plays into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I think, you know, when we're
thinking about drying, we're thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: about about nine days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I think five days is very
fast to dry them in five days.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're never either fully dry or they're
too dry and, you know, like powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then 14 days is too long and too soft.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't mean you're still not drying and
curing them out after the nine days
[SPEAKER_01]: because because then at that point you're
like putting them in some kind of getting
[SPEAKER_02]: them ready to trim, putting them in a tote
or a bag and then burping them from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're burping a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're still releasing
constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not, you know, they're still a
finishing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, when you're talking about oxidizing
and things like that, I'm a strong
[SPEAKER_02]: believer in fresh air flow constantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I always have a window open in my
dry room, you know, like just cracked like
[SPEAKER_02]: if there's not fresh air, I feel like
that's when you can get stale and kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: wreck your cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there has to be good flow to the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super essential, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'll even crack two windows on both
sides of the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Air flow, I think, is really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Air movement is very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, keeping your flavors fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were you saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we sort of got into a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking about texture when you're
breaking butt down and what you're looking
[SPEAKER_03]: for when you want to roll joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just this this texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's so many variables that I'm
not going to speak to specifically what I
[SPEAKER_00]: see, but I just I do like for most kind of
see somewhat difficult for me to break
[SPEAKER_00]: down by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I just usually herb that can crumble
out really easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could be just that the structure of
that variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to make this a universal
blanket statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I if I see two varieties and they
were both they're both the same variety
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have that textural difference is
really extreme.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where one is difficult to break apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one, maybe it's even still
sticky, but it just somehow is able to
[SPEAKER_00]: crumble down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like what they say about the structure,
the structural.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's like a point where like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it because the weed should be a little
firm or like it shouldn't be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, really squishy, at least in my
opinion, you know, people have different
[SPEAKER_02]: opinions, of course, but like at least if
you're going to store it all year long and
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke this one harvest, like all year
long, it should be more dried to be more
[SPEAKER_02]: firm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: We start and then it will crumble a little
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the question becomes also like,
what environment is it going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced into when it like when you do
bring it out?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, I don't know the specifics and
say a pine palm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like when you guys bring your herb,
if it's been stored in a dry, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmed or untrimmed, is it typically
going into a more moist environment in
[SPEAKER_00]: your house or in your bedroom or in your
whatever?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, our general climate is more dry.
So.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you were talking about like a nine
day drying, can you talk about now the
[SPEAKER_03]: next stage of curing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you curing different cultivars for
different amounts of time?
[SPEAKER_03]: And can you talk about some of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're very small, so we kind of some
are cured longer just because it takes the
[SPEAKER_02]: next step.
[SPEAKER_02]: Processing things gets, you know,
takes a little time to pull out the jar of
[SPEAKER_03]: what we're smoking right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us its story into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're smoking is pink cashmere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we harvested this on October 14th.
[SPEAKER_02]: From there, we dried it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hung for nine days.
[SPEAKER_00]: What temperature and humidity,
roughly?
[SPEAKER_02]: We usually I go for as cold of
temperatures as I can manage.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't use a lot of power to manage the
room, but it's a dark room and basically
[SPEAKER_02]: we keep it at 45 and 55 temperature or 55
degrees at 45 humidity for nine days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until the stems snap and then we'll take
it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and then usually what you will do is
you'll take it down and you'll put it in a
[SPEAKER_02]: in a bag or a tote and enclose it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually we'll do that for like three
days or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the molding moisture that's
still in it will come out, come,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like it'll rehumidify in the
container from its own thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to be careful about not
letting your product mold by just
[SPEAKER_02]: forgetting about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in those short amount of time after
that and then you'll open that up,
[SPEAKER_02]: leave it open for a little bit,
let them dry out and you'll just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: keep doing that until they reach like an
equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_02]: That now they are like at a stable And you
remember how long this took?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and the thing is we're doing it
with all of the strains as they come down
[SPEAKER_02]: and so this didn't get trimmed until a
couple weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of late November.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, late November.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about that earlier,
how John was how you want to wait until as
[SPEAKER_03]: late as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my philosophy on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As close to sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think his point, I think some of the
factors that he's talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: like whoever is doing the processing,
being really careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like particularly how you're talking
about the scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the scissors aren't too close to the
flour or too far away from the flour and
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're touching the flour as little
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more of that stuff that happens,
I think, provided that the flour was grown
[SPEAKER_00]: well is that that it allows it to after
it's be trimmed to still preserve itself
[SPEAKER_00]: and not start showing this because I think
some of the oxidation that I see and we
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about is the micro abrasion from
the scissors and the fingers that touch
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bruising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bruising.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like if you if you drop an apple on
the ground, it's going to bruise,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you do rough it up and it's not
going to keep as long as something that
[SPEAKER_02]: you and you keep well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I guess the difference between the
wet the wet bruise and the dry bruise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like if we're using totes for
harvesting, how much is stacked in?
[SPEAKER_00]: How vertically are they truly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there like the first ones that are put
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that that that corner is at a pressure
point?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long are they left in that bin between
when they're harvested and when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: hung?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there there's ideals that none of
that would happen, but if it does,
[SPEAKER_00]: how can we at least mitigate it to be as
least damaging to the product as possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually prefer to use flexible
containers on shelves, but nothing is like
[SPEAKER_01]: stacked too high or heavy or flattening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's a series of shelves and all
of the usually we put them in like a food
[SPEAKER_02]: grade bag that's not translucent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we can easily open that and close
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is for when it's dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, once you take it off and it's still
on the stem and on the leaf ready to be
[SPEAKER_02]: trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like transferring between your garden
and the dry room as quick as possible
[SPEAKER_01]: baskets so that they're not stacked up
high and we hand we just cut and carry the
[SPEAKER_01]: basket.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not very far, just right from the
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right next door.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually snow sleds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're snow sleds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the perfect shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like the long skinny ones.
They're just long, flat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a toboggan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not like a toboggan because a toboggan
goes like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But similar in that it's like shallow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what you had on site.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shallow and long so you can put.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you would almost pick them though in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like that design.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: We liked it because it was like long and
you know you could you could put more and
[SPEAKER_02]: fill the whole thing but not stack them
too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that I think about a fair
amount is when we're cutting branches how
[SPEAKER_00]: we put them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when we use bins like I really like
when you guys just start off as vertical
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible because if they go at an
angle.

I've stacked a bin and I don't take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damage is those first flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what you had on site.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shallow and long so you can put long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just cut your colas and you can
just cut your colas and lay them like a
[SPEAKER_01]: bouquet of roses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can just lay them without having
you know you can just make one cut to lay
[SPEAKER_01]: your colas down and then you're not
they're not heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I mean because it makes a difference
and then we don't we don't cut so much
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's sitting there all in a pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just we cut like you know all the colas
or however far we're cutting and to the
[SPEAKER_01]: basket and then that gets hung.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't pile like tons of stuff up for
hours before it goes into the dry room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: To us it's like a little bit like roses
and wine and tea you know because like
[SPEAKER_02]: roses you want to look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're beautiful flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not just like I mean you can be

flowers and they're gorgeous.

[SPEAKER_02]: They're not for making hot dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just you know but they they're
beautiful and we like to preserve that
[SPEAKER_02]: beauty you know and that's important to
us.

like when we try to make sure we make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that is done in a gentle way so
that resin isn't being rubbed off or
[SPEAKER_02]: shaken or anything like that knocked
around and dropped too much.

some dry sieves.
