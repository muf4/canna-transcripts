[SPEAKER_01]: So, as I was putting together this
presentation, I realized that I have a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always have a lot to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very grateful to the panel before me
because I just assumed that more people
[SPEAKER_01]: would be talking about plants and their
responses to their environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there actually hasn't been that much
discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Corinne, thank you for introducing the
concept of DLI, which I have here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some slides here about plant
responses, but I just planned on skipping
[SPEAKER_01]: through them pretty quickly, but I might
actually need to talk about them a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit so everybody understands why it's so
important, what we're trying to control,
[SPEAKER_01]: and why it is so energy-intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, why the heck are we growing indoors in
the first place?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all of these reasons, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, we can grow anywhere we want,
anytime, regardless of climate change,
[SPEAKER_01]: regardless of season.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can grow in Vermont, and we can grow in
San Diego, and we can grow on Mars for
[SPEAKER_01]: that matter, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's a big piece of why it's so
energy-intensive because we are literally
[SPEAKER_01]: controlling the weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're controlling all of the inputs that
we need to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we don't necessarily have all of
these resources available to us wherever
[SPEAKER_01]: we are, whether that's good soil,
good air, good CO2 levels for that matter,
[SPEAKER_01]: good sunlight, consistent sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, by growing indoors, we can be very
predictable, we can be very consistent,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can have very safe food, and it can be
available all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, controlled environment agriculture is
just like what it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are controlling the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned earlier when I introduced
the panel, my aha moment was working on a
[SPEAKER_01]: mushroom farm where the farmer couldn't
control his greenhouse humidity to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, this is what I want to do,
help them control their environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are controlling all of these
variables, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Irrigation and nutrients, lighting,
climate, air quality, ultimately for
[SPEAKER_01]: quality control.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to remind everyone that farming,
whether it's indoors or outdoors or a mix
[SPEAKER_01]: of the two, is a business, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The productivity, the product that farmers
are growing, they are selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: To us, the consumer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To you, the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, they have a very vested interest
in reducing their cost of production so
[SPEAKER_01]: that they can have better margins,
so that their bottom line is greater,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, they have to think about their
customers, their markets, their
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they local?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they growing lettuce or tomatoes or
cannabis or berries, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is the market for those things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, ultimately, greater productivity
should result in greater profitability.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that depends on how many resources
they're using and what the cost of those
[SPEAKER_01]: resources are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as markets change, as we have more
market pressure in terms of resource
[SPEAKER_01]: utilization, if they can lower those while
they're also increasing productivity,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a very profitable business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, common ground, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I broke it into sort of three
categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grower slash farmer, the consumer,
which is pretty much everyone,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether you are a grower, a non-grower,
a government, a utility, a regulator,
[SPEAKER_01]: a teacher, an engineer, you're a consumer,
and you care about all of those things,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what, I mean, we want better yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want available products, higher
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to get sick because I smoked
it or ate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, government, of course,
is concerned about consumer safety,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We want, growers want fewer consumables
because that's less things they have to
[SPEAKER_01]: buy, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And consumers don't want chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the government doesn't want pollution
or chemicals if they can avoid it,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're interested in labor markets and
jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want a good market price, the grower
does.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, if they can have a more
consistent and predictable product,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can potentially drive the price
themselves and have a better shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: placement, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Low operating costs, low prices,
low resource use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same, same, same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether we call it optimization or we
call it efficiency, it's about doing more
[SPEAKER_01]: with less.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are all in this together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm going to talk about a few plant
responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I was planning to go through this
really quickly, but just look at this
[SPEAKER_01]: slide, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Light has a huge impact on the plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: On the way it looks, on the way it
produces, on whether it's fruiting,
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering, or vegetative, on, I don't even
know, temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stomato opening, nutrient and water
delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the list goes on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Light is, there's a reason why we have a
lot of focus on light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants need light, period.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would not have life on earth without
the sun, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, nobody has shown this graph either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, this is a general rule of thumb in
horticulture and agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: One percent more light is equal to one
percent more biomass or yield,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, in general, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have learned that not all light is
created equal, but this is a general rule
[SPEAKER_01]: of thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: DLI, thank you again, Corinne.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this is an image of what DLI looks
like, which is how many photons within the
[SPEAKER_01]: PAR range hit a given area, a given
surface area, whether that's the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf, or whether that's the wall over
there, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Air temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Air temperature affects photosynthesis,
and it also affects plant transpiration,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant transpiration in general has a
linear correlation with air temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: and as you can see here for tomatoes,
that it increases pretty quickly with
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature, but then there is a limit at
which now we're gonna get a degradation in
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vapor pressure deficit, a term that is
very near and dear to my heart as a
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanical engineer who's trying to
control both temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vapor pressure deficit affects quality,
it affects yield, and it affects water
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: A slide I don't have on here actually
shows that you can train your plant from a
[SPEAKER_01]: very young age to be drought tolerant by
giving it less water when it's young,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's automatically going to change the
way it grows to use less water when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: old.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can literally manipulate VPD to create
a drought-tolerant crop and use less
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very exciting, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about CO2 for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carbon dioxide, the thing that kills me
the most about cannabis growers is when
[SPEAKER_01]: they pump 1,500 parts per million of CO2
and then hit the break with temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: 70 degrees and 1,500 parts per million,
okay, we saw a chart earlier right from
[SPEAKER_01]: Erico that yes, you could have a lower
temperature, lower light level,
[SPEAKER_01]: and increase the CO2, and it will act like
it's all more light, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can optimize all of these
variables, all these parameters together
[SPEAKER_01]: to really maximize productivity,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's something that's important,
is that every plant has a different
[SPEAKER_01]: optimization curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm showing sunflower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't even talked about sunflowers,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But cannabis, tomato, lettuce,
chrysanthemum, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of these plants have different
optimization points.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we saw a graphic yesterday that looked
a lot different than this graphic.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this graphic, HVAC is using the
majority of the energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about it, HVAC is not
just air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also moving the air around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's potentially using CO2 burners or some
other source, energy sources, energy
[SPEAKER_01]: source of CO2, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: It might even be the air filtration that's
affecting fan power and the use of energy
[SPEAKER_01]: from a fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to talk about these potential
opportunities to save energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other has, I don't know, probably five
subcategories within itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually wasn't going to talk about
greenhouse glazing, except that it keeps
[SPEAKER_01]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wants to know my opinion about
greenhouse glazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to bite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to talk about it a little bit,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could probably give a 45-minute talk
on greenhouse glazing alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to bore you with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try and hit some of the
highlights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, I just want to say this is the
appropriate time to use supplemental
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys see it's overcast and cloudy,
not good light intensity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to hit the DLI that we
want for this crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: This may be not so appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I walked into this greenhouse in Colorado
and it was beautifully sunny outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the lights were on for two reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, because they had horrible control and
didn't realize that the lights were on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, that was the first thing I
noticed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talking about having qualified growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: One story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also this is a triple pane glazed
glass greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at all the structure you need to
support the weight of all that glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just eliminated all the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now what are we doing for energy
efficiency using light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every plant, just like it has an
optimization of CO2 and light and
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nutrients has an optimization point
for how much light it requires.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lettuce, very low light requirement on a
daily basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberry, a little higher because it is
a flowering fruiting plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis, really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bruce Bugby has given presentations where
he shows that they have maxed out over 50
[SPEAKER_01]: DLI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the CO2 and temperature is
optimized, for that higher light
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity, it keeps eating it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have not found the upper limit for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean we should grow at the
upper limit, but it's pretty high even
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So greenhouse glazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do we want to regulate energy
efficiency or energy efficient greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: glazings and what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: For most people, coming from commercial
buildings who are regulating windows,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's about U-value and R-value.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also about emissivity a little bit,
but U-value, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see glass is not looking so
good, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Double polyethylene does great,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's even an ASABE, what do you call
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Greenhouse that is a historical landmark
because they discovered at Rutgers the
[SPEAKER_01]: double polyethylene greenhouse,
okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, right, with decreasing U-value,
we also get decreasing light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's okay, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to point out infrared and UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Infrared is basically responsible for the
greenhouse effect in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glass is opaque to infrared long wave
radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the sunlight comes in and it
bounces around, it loses energy,
[SPEAKER_01]: turns into infrared light, hits the inside
of the glazing and bounces right back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great for winter, cold, climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's glass, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Double polyethylene and plastic may be not
so good at doing that, which is great if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to trap all that long wave
radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it to escape.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what about UV, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark talked a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you did, did you?
[SPEAKER_01]: About stretching the PAR, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But also stretching the wavelength at
which plants like to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not just for photosynthetic reasons,
but for quality reasons, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: For pigmentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jen from Gotham Green says that she
doesn't get red leaf lettuce until she
[SPEAKER_01]: opens up the windows in her polycarbonate
covered greenhouse because now we're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually letting some UV into the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is what causes that red
pigmentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about UValue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty big difference,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: 36% energy savings on cooling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's looking pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun just exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any savings that we thought we gained from
a UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is UValue on the envelope?
[SPEAKER_01]: 12,000% difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think UValues are great if you're in a
cold, cloudy climate, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's gains to be had by saving heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we're doing this in a warm,
sunny climate, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe there's another option.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if we add shading to block out the
sunlight when we want to?
[SPEAKER_01]: We did this study.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a project in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we demonstrated is look at the load
reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a glass house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's your glass house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Envelope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Infiltration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now let's put double poly on it
instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2% reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We added a 35% shade and look at how much
we gained in cooling requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: For this project that we did in Texas,
we're actually going to air condition the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to talk about that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're looking for ways to minimize the
size of the air conditioner while they're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing lettuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low DLI plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can like seriously do some fun shading
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you're actually looking at is we
say, hey, when the outside solar radiation
[SPEAKER_01]: is between 250 watts and 570 watts per
square meter, we're going to pull one 45%
[SPEAKER_01]: shade curtain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the result right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is outside solar radiation or PAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is the incoming solar
radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we say, oh, now the outside is 570
watts per square meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's pull a second shade and really block
out the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the result that we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are able.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the DLI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our target is right in here for this
lettuce crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: From January through December.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by having that ultimate shade control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's this yellow bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are able to hit our DLI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single month of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not shading a crop in the winter
when we want to take advantage of
[SPEAKER_01]: sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my piece on glazing and shading.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to, I was really going to
talk about lighting for like a
[SPEAKER_01]: millisecond.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's like two slides up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured everyone would talk about
lighting, but I'm going to make one case,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is photo period control.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is vegetative crops only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we use a lower light intensity
fixture for a longer period of time,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can reduce the size of our lamps,
the energy power requirements of our
[SPEAKER_01]: lamps, and also potentially the HVAC loads
from that light.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but we still, as long as we still
have well watered crops, if we make
[SPEAKER_01]: adjustments to the temperature and even
the CO2 so that the plant plants continue
[SPEAKER_01]: to transpire at about the same rate,
we still have to dehumidify and
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidification is stupidly energy
intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we might be able to gain 35% energy
savings on lighting, but maybe only 10% on
[SPEAKER_01]: HVAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's something.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So speaking of dehumidification,
anyone own a cat?
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to cover all the pets in the in
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a desiccant wheel, a solid
desiccant wheel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any of you who own cats, kitty litter
is what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Heavy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So imagine how heavy this wheel is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with dehumidification and humidity
control in general, what are we trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: do?
[SPEAKER_01]: We are trying to control
evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And evapotranspiration is very important
to the plant for a few reasons.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, number one, water and nutrient
delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't have good water and nutrient
delivery, we get leaf tip burn,
[SPEAKER_01]: blossom end rot, and a whole bunch of
other issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also is responsible for holding the
plant up, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cellular structure of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you don't water your plant,
the plant wilts because the cells are
[SPEAKER_01]: dehydrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the most important things also is
it cools itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: By transpiration, we are evaporating
water, which is an evaporatively cooling
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so plants regulate their temperature
through transpiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And photosynthesis is miniscule.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually realized, I didn't talk
about moisture removal efficiency,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I am talking about moisture removal
capacity for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're closely related.
[SPEAKER_01]: But moisture removal capacity depends on
the equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also really depends on the room
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single dehumidifier is rated at
these conditions, 80 degrees and 60%
[SPEAKER_01]: relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: For all the growers in the room,
any of you growing at that condition?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care what you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no one growing at this condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the ramifications?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a grower and you're like,
I need to dehumidify.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to Google, right,
dehumidification unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you Google it and you say, oh,
okay, so my, let's just say you know what
[SPEAKER_01]: your evapotranspiration rate is and how
much dehumidification you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you say, oh, I need about,
to remove about 20 pounds per hour of
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need two dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But wait, you're in vertical farm and
you're trying to grow at 70 degrees and
[SPEAKER_01]: say 60% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's moisture removal capacity is now
seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need three, not two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you, you're operating a drying room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're at like 60 degrees and 50% relative
humidity, three pounds per hour,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need three.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I do that mouth right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Three times six, eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I did it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the reasons why growers are
having a hard time with dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily because they don't
know that they have to dehumidify.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because they don't understand that
the cut sheets that they're looking at are
[SPEAKER_01]: not giving them the full picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And manufacturers are not giving away this
data readily or at least to the public,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, for a really good reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give them, I mean, it's an okay
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are actually doing their own tests in
facilities where they're controlling
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is, is that there is no
standard for rating dehumidification
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment at any conditions other than 80
degrees and 60%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Keith, I'm pretty sure that you guys
are involved in trying to come up with a
[SPEAKER_01]: different rating system.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the dehumidifying, dehumidifier
equipment manufacturers are working on
[SPEAKER_01]: this right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can be of better service to all of
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dehumidification, there's no way around
it, is just intense, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to remove moisture, we have to
drop the temperature to below the dew
[SPEAKER_01]: point, to way below the dew point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dew point, for those of you who don't
know, is the temperature at which dew
[SPEAKER_01]: forms, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically to actually remove enough dew
from the air, we have to drop the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature to less than 50 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a project right now where we have
a chilled water system at 36 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's so much moisture being
pumped into the room that we have to drop
[SPEAKER_01]: the temperature that low to remove
moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not delivering 36 degree air to
my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna freeze them, so what do I
do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I reheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just use all this energy to remove
moisture and I'm gonna use all this energy
[SPEAKER_01]: to control the temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what about desiccant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, desiccant has the opposite problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, we heat the desiccant to recharge it,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sucks out the moisture and then it's
holding onto the moisture and to dry it
[SPEAKER_01]: out, we heat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now I don't wanna deliver 120 degree
air to my room, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I cool it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so where is the potential to save
with dehumidification?
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, heat recovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some manufacturers who are doing
a really good job at doing hot gas reheat,
[SPEAKER_01]: run around loops, any way that we can
recover the energy that we're removing
[SPEAKER_01]: from the moisture and from cooling and
putting it back into the air without using
[SPEAKER_01]: practically any heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any extra energy at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Economizers, well, okay, no, not
economizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a second on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heat exchangers, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can have an air to air heat
exchanger where we can recirculate back
[SPEAKER_01]: through like this piece of technology over
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we removed heat and moisture and then
we're gonna return through this return
[SPEAKER_01]: loop back across that heat exchanger and
pick up that heat that we sucked out with
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, we're using outside air
indirectly through an energy wheel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're using the outside air to pre-cool
and pre-dehumidify before it goes across a
[SPEAKER_01]: cooling coil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, dogs, dog people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little less shy than the cat people,
go figure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do we have fans?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, there's a lot of reasons we have
fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have fans to distribute that cooling
and that heating from our various
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment to get it into the room,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And remove that hot, wet air and send it
back to the air conditioner, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: But also we have air movement across the
plants themselves, in the space
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To break up the boundary layers,
this little pocket of air that forms
[SPEAKER_01]: around the leaf, remove moisture,
remove heat from the plants or from the
[SPEAKER_01]: lamps, take away the waste product called
oxygen, right, and deliver even CO2 to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Air movement is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the only time I directly pick
on Title 24.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the sub-measures is fan
efficiency, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which actually, I mean, I'm not paying on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think this is still a good plan,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they say that the circulation fan
should have a minimum efficiency,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, of some watts per square feet,
or CFM.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how they figured out the
potential savings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd actually like to know the answer to
that, Kyle, perhaps, just so that I can,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the next slide, I could do the same
analysis, or I'll just give it to you and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do the analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, but the incremental cost is 50 to
$500.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about a bigger issue,
air filtration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have any air filtration people in
the room?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, really, do we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snake oil salesmen.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking to the National Air Filtration
Association in Phoenix next month,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm gonna be having a get real
conversation with them about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those of you who have been duped into
installing HEPA filters, I'm really sorry,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're using an unnecessary amount
of energy to clean air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or to remove constituents that aren't
really harmful to your plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: or at least that you don't really care
that much about.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you care about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mold, powdery mildew, botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your regular old run-of-the-mill MERV 11
filter can do that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still recommend MERV 13, but,
okay, can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not need a HEPA filter to remove
viruses and viroids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, there was a paper that was written a
few years ago that looked at the energy
[SPEAKER_01]: savings potential of different air
filtration media based on fan power.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also looked at the cost of
replacements, and how much more costly and
[SPEAKER_01]: labor-intensive it is even is to have a
more high-efficiency filter that you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, ultimately, if you can reduce the
pressure drop across this filter by having
[SPEAKER_01]: a larger screen, basically, you are going
to gain a lot in fan efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I did a little back-of-the-envelope
calculation for a project that we did,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, and we had this indoor facility,
okay, requires six 30-ton air conditioning
[SPEAKER_01]: units.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we use a HEPA filter, it will be
equivalent in fan power to 250,000
[SPEAKER_01]: kilowatt hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: MERV 13, 95.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some real fan savings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: The incremental cost, maybe, actually,
there's a savings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so now onto my other opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about equipment sizing and VPD
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: VPD, again, really near and dear to my
heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: This next section is especially for my
growers in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: VPD, by the way, for those of you who
don't know and are not familiar with my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite tool in the toolbox, this is a
psychrometric chart, and VPD is the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between the saturation vapor
pressure at the plant leaf at the stomata
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the vapor pressure at the room
temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The longer this line, the bigger the VPD,
the drier it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you have a room, okay, and you have a
good engineer who has figured out that
[SPEAKER_01]: this is your sensible and latent load.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sensible load is managing temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Latent load is managing humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, your contractor, or engineer,
doesn't really know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not familiar with indoor plant
environments, and they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really trust myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm just going to double the size of
the equipment, right, and just cross my
[SPEAKER_01]: fingers that we're going to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and so, they pick this unit,
and this is the airflow, is 4,000 CFM.
[SPEAKER_01]: To meet this 4,000 CFM, 4.7 latent tons,
but look at how much sensible we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We almost have three times the amount of
sensible load, which means we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: really overcool and really have to reheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so common in the industry to
oversize equipment because, A,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't know what's going on,
or B, because you don't have good
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions to start with, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, these are some of the options
I put up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can upsize the equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can add standalone dehumidifiers,
which we know a lot of growers are
[SPEAKER_01]: band-aiding, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can reduce the temperature of the
coil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, from 42 degrees down to that 36
degrees, okay, squeeze more moisture out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could increase the thickness of the
coils, but that's going to increase fan
[SPEAKER_01]: energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else can we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's change the conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, when we have a higher VPD,
as I talked about before, we have higher
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiration rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants use more water, which means we
also have to remove more moisture from the
[SPEAKER_01]: air.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a lower VPD that's more humid,
your plants don't use as much water,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's less moisture to remove.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, okay, so this is the chart that we
have on our website for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have it also for strawberries,
lettuce, tomatoes, okay, if you guys are
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in calculating your VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this was your original condition,
75 degrees and 50% relative humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, and I've been able to convince you,
or you've convinced yourself that maybe I
[SPEAKER_01]: could do 75 degrees and 65% relative
humidity, and rather than having a VPD of
[SPEAKER_01]: 1.5, I'm going to have a VPD of 1,
which is much more standard for most
[SPEAKER_01]: horticultural crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are closer to the saturation curve with
our new system, which makes it easier for
[SPEAKER_01]: our equipment to dehumidify.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also going to be less moisture in
the room because the VPD is lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what is the result?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, now we have a 12 ton unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are right size, we're right there for
the sensible and latent loads,
[SPEAKER_01]: and look at the fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's now 2,500 CFM.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saved, saved, saved, and your plants,
I bet, are also going to be happier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy plants, happy HVAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about an economizer, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, another 45 minute lecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk about it for like 30
seconds, okay, because this is,
[SPEAKER_01]: woo, this is a lot of data, okay,
a lot to get through.
[SPEAKER_01]: We looked at, I think, 10 different
locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm only going to present three here,
very quickly, just to show you what the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity is, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, here's climate zones that ASHRAE has
defined, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's hot, humid, hot, dry, cold,
humid, cold, dry, temperate, and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very hot, very humid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you know ASHRAE created a new climate
zone zero for very hot, very humid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ugh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, and it's probably going to get
worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so, dry and cool, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this is Denver, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where your temperature and
humidity set points are to hit a one
[SPEAKER_01]: kilopascal, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this is a tomato or cannabis,
this is your lettuce, okay, and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like the temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of low and dry during the
daytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as you can see, the dew point,
okay, so this is the hourly bin data.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how we read the dew point,
is this horizontal line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at how many hours are below the dew
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason this is important is because
even if it's cool, but there's moisture in
[SPEAKER_01]: the air, what are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to cool, yes, but we're also
going to humidify a space that we want to
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidify.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if all of these hours are below that
dew point temperature, that means we get
[SPEAKER_01]: to dehumidify, and that's the energy
intensive process, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about Orlando?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whew, it is tough in Miami and Florida and
Hawaii and Abu Dhabi, right, to dehumidify
[SPEAKER_01]: or use the outside air to condition our
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because look at how high this dew point
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should not be using economizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some mixed air, but really,
if we were going to mandate economizers,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say don't do it to poor Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, can we use the outside air to
dehumidify?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, just quickly looking at lettuce versus
tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Denver, the answer is a resounding yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice and dry, but in Orlando,
probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm so glad that Caitlin taught me
about odor control yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm the only person that ever
talks about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, a little story.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple years ago, I got a phone call
from a grower, a potential grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: new grower in Boulder, and he calls me up
and he says, hey, Nadia, I'm building a
[SPEAKER_01]: new 30,000 square foot greenhouse in
Boulder, and the greenhouse costs half a
[SPEAKER_01]: million dollars, but I'm being told the
air conditioner is going to cost two and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half million dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, pull out my calculator, and just real
rough, bag of the envelope, 1,000 watts
[SPEAKER_01]: per square meter, right, and 30,000 square
feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, yeah, 800 tons of cooling,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Multiply that by just $3,000 per ton,
and yeah, two, three million dollars,
[SPEAKER_01]: that sounds right to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Odor control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone from the city of Boulder?
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn, really want to talk to you about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what's happened since our
conversation a couple years ago in the
[SPEAKER_01]: county.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Boulder has a very strict odor control
ordinance.
[SPEAKER_01]: These growers were smart enough to know
that a greenhouse in Colorado is an
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have plenty of sunlight, it's dry,
it's cool, they should be using
[SPEAKER_01]: conventional greenhouse technology,
but they got a complaint from a neighbor
[SPEAKER_01]: down the road who happens to be an organic
farmer putting shit on his field that they
[SPEAKER_01]: were concerned about odor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Boulder told them, you have to seal it
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sealing the greenhouse for odor control
created an energy monster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're air conditioning the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is nuts, and there are so many people
out there who are looking at true blue
[SPEAKER_01]: sealed greenhouses, not semi-closed
greenhouses, but sealed greenhouses to
[SPEAKER_01]: prevent odor from leaking out and air
conditioning it like it's a well-insulated
[SPEAKER_01]: warehouse building.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, when people say, do greenhouses use
less energy than a warehouse?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'd like to think so, but not if
you're gonna do this, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You might as well just go into a
warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe add some solitudes or find a way to
introduce outside light, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not black and white.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just for a moment, because Caitlin did
talk about measuring VOCs, this was a
[SPEAKER_01]: study done out of Iowa State a few years
ago looking at harvested flour,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we have known for a long time that
there's about 20, 25 VOCs, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mersene, limonene, pionene, blah,
blah, blene, okay, that produce odor.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they determined is that there's
actually 220 VOCs and what was shocking is
[SPEAKER_01]: that the VOCs that were the most offensive
to our nose, that we were most sensitive
[SPEAKER_01]: to, they could barely detect with mass
spectrometry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are so tuned in to the smell of
cannabis that there barely even has to be
[SPEAKER_01]: any there and we find it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It finds us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, how do we control something that we
can't even measure?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we do, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have all these carbon filters with
recirculating fans, which there is
[SPEAKER_01]: literally no logic whatsoever to how many
you have, how many you install.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talk to a different manufacturer or a
different person with the same
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturer and they're all gonna give
you a different recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, here's this greenhouse, 450,000 cubic
feet, okay, in Boulder because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: guessing that they're not just air
conditioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really wanna make sure that they
don't get a complaint from their
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, they're also doing activated carbon
filters and look at how much energy
[SPEAKER_01]: they're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything we just saved by switching from
HEPA to MERV, we just lost through odor
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have to show this video because
one of my favorite videos, odor
[SPEAKER_01]: neutralizer masking people in the room,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: They say that the essential oils are
non-toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will share the MSDS reports with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always say, this is also 24-7.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there is too much of a good thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just keep thinking about all these oils
getting sprayed into the environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: a slipping hazard, walking by,
all getting flushed down into our
[SPEAKER_01]: waterways, and by the way, privately,
neighbors will tell me that they probably
[SPEAKER_01]: think maybe the smell of cannabis would
have been less disgusting than the smell
[SPEAKER_01]: of Febreze being sprayed over their
neighborhood all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't say that to the county board of
supervisors, but they'll say it to me in a
[SPEAKER_01]: phone call, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Monitoring and controls, just real
quickly, there is a problem in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry with good control systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have horticultural control systems that
can't control and can't communicate with
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial HVAC systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have commercial control systems that
are like, irrigation?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was in a facility in Michigan,
and we literally were looking at six
[SPEAKER_01]: different sensors in the same exact spot,
giving different readings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, what are we controlling?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one's right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more research, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Engineers and manufacturers, let's face
it, regulators, utilities, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: don't understand plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't understand the occupant of the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a person.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a green thing, and it's not an alien.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it feels alien.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers don't understand energy balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't understand psychrometrics,
VPD, HVAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: HVAC operation's very complex,
and plants are living, dynamic organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have feet and hands and can't
walk over to a thermostat and change the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to be able to respond and predict
to what the plants need when they need it,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need better help defining metrics
and defining baselines and benchmarks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are a lot of different metrics
that I hear getting thrown around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually realized yesterday,
I didn't include a big one, which is like
[SPEAKER_01]: watts per gram, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or energy input.
[SPEAKER_01]: Input per output.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I mean, is pound per light dead?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have to keep using this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this going away?
[SPEAKER_01]: No?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I see some giggles, some smiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: But remember again, this is a business,
and we have to be focused on profitability
[SPEAKER_01]: and the cost of the resources and the cost
of production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who talked about footprint yesterday?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so excited you talked about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cale?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, okay, anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Floor area of this greenhouse is 9,000
square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go vertical, and now we have a canopy
area of 35,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we ask for an energy use intensity
and we have a limit, are we talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy area?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we talking about floor area?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we talking about illuminated area?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we, because guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can stick the light right over the
plant, and that's your illuminated area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome, my HVAC system is conditioning
the entire volume of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so you look at this floor plan,
you're like, oh, that's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you realize, oh, crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things are stacked 30 feet up in the
air, and they're just packed with biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, is this our square footage,
our footprint, or is this our footprint?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, research that's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Active groups, all of these have been
mentioned today, actually, which is so
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad that there's so much awareness
in this room about the research going on,
[SPEAKER_01]: about people who are trying to define
these metrics, these benchmarks,
[SPEAKER_01]: these baselines, and trying to help
growers optimize what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: SCRI is the OptimIA group that is led by a
bunch of academics and academic
[SPEAKER_01]: researchers, and they're going into
vertical farms specifically to find the
[SPEAKER_01]: optimization points for light,
CO2, temperature, water, air flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, thank you,
Derek, for all your guys' work.
[SPEAKER_01]: ASHRAE is trying to fund a bunch of
research, and then we have this standard
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, ultimately, energy efficiency comes
down to optimization for the growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it all comes down to being able to
control our inputs and our outputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these things are about control,
one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Control, control, control, control.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, there's 10 controls up
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can we all agree on?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's complex, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grateful, again, for all the speakers who
have come up here and said it depends on
[SPEAKER_01]: the crop, it depends on the location.
[SPEAKER_01]: Location meaning the climate, the market,
all sorts of things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can increase the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more research, and ultimately,
I do believe that it's possible to
[SPEAKER_01]: optimize and be more efficient while also
increasing profitability for the people
[SPEAKER_01]: growing our crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: The end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry I went over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew I would, but I feel like I went
through it pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about one more round of applause for
Nadia?
[SPEAKER_00]: What an asset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only does she have the best
information, she also can deliver it in an
[SPEAKER_00]: insightful way and help the process at the
right time and get us all on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: page.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, thank you for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Derek.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for putting this together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
