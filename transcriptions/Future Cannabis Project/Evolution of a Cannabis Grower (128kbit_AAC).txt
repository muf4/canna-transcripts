[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the game now, you started in
a closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me you know what diamond lights are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah yeah yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so if you don't catch that this is
what it was and then you just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand where it all started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You picked the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they liked GH because my workers that
liked to party too much couldn't read the
[SPEAKER_00]: labels because the vision was blurry,
but they could tell that there was a pink,
[SPEAKER_00]: a green, and a red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, that was some really simple
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was designed for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for me, I got into doing a lot of
work for large, I used to run large diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most of the Wheaton Humboldt was
all diesel driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would come into these massive
diesel operations, no Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these were all, you know,
two, 300, 400, up to 400 light operations
[SPEAKER_00]: that were black market diesel driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would come in to put in all new
operational systems so they could remove
[SPEAKER_00]: workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because fundamentally there was families
that ran the projects and it was always
[SPEAKER_00]: workers that came in that caused problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to hire workers to come in to
do leaf and work and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would put in automated systems that
would allow these guys to be able to turn
[SPEAKER_00]: valves and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was working on R&D.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had, so right around 96 when computers
first really started being used heavily by
[SPEAKER_00]: people, I was able to get ahold of an old
Pentium 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went and took an adult ed class on
spreadsheets so I could learn how to use a
[SPEAKER_00]: computer so I could do spreadsheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I had so many black market
operations running that I realized that I
[SPEAKER_00]: could start isolating variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started isolating variables to
find how do we get into two plus pounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time a pound of bulb was
astronomical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I was blown by a deuce because I
started finding the combination of factors
[SPEAKER_00]: that let me do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had the varietals that achieved
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all these other operators that were
big would say, hey, if you come in,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to give you X amount per light
if you can get us into these numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would need my own cultivar base to
provide it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started providing cultivars for these
large diesel operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next thing you know, I'm spending
way more time doing nursery operations for
[SPEAKER_00]: all these massive diesel guys because they
were the best clients you've ever seen in
[SPEAKER_00]: your life because they were as pro as
anybody's ever been where you had four 60
[SPEAKER_00]: day cycles that had to run from,
as soon as it rained, you'd turn the
[SPEAKER_00]: diesels on because it could mask the sound
of the generator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it was all subterranean and
buried and ventilated systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were cautious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as soon as it rained, you'd have
sound cover and fog cover to cover up the
[SPEAKER_00]: waste gas coming out of the jenny's and
the sound from the jenny's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as it warmed up and the
helicopters came, you chopped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had four 60 day cycles and these
guys would lay out their calendar and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could literally deliver the 3000 cuts to
each one of them on that date.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no deviation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Campus show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was when all outdoor wasn't even
humble humble got wiped out outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then guy goes to DA comes in early 2000s
and says, look, 99 is something I'll work
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when everybody started pioneering
the 14 pound plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went from doing indoor work that I
was involved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I started doing developmental work on
cultivars that had the framework to go big
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I remember when blue dream was only run
indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still know the first guy in Humboldt
that ran it outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he came and said, Kev, I got 11 pounds
off my, I'm like my weed and we were like
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, bro, I got 11 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the next year we're all running
blue dream and we're all running blue
[SPEAKER_00]: dream blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
