[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things I wanted to talk about
was, you know, I had like my mixed martial
[SPEAKER_05]: arts analogy where, you know, someone's
the college wrestler at Ohio State and
[SPEAKER_05]: they get into MMA and, you know,
when it comes to a ground game,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're amazing, but they need to learn
how to box, they need to learn how to
[SPEAKER_05]: kickbox, jiu-jitsu, maitai, all these
other kind of languages to get in the ring
[SPEAKER_05]: and fight.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in growing plants, I feel like,
you know, there's not one right way of
[SPEAKER_05]: doing it and people are kind of
gravitating towards different languages or
[SPEAKER_05]: methodologies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, for example, Korean Natural
Farming and we have our, hold on a second,
[SPEAKER_05]: we have our Master Cho.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, Scott, I was hoping you could kick
it off and I want to talk about kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: the roots of Korean Natural Farming in the
50s in Korea, you know, in a specific
[SPEAKER_05]: period in time and geography and how
you've seen kind of the cannabis community
[SPEAKER_05]: embrace it, you know, here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: and any issues or concerns you have with
how you see people applying it practically
[SPEAKER_05]: here in the U.S.?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so, well, I'll start with the
preface.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm a huge advocate of any
sustainable strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a huge advocate of any regenerative
strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a huge advocate of anybody that wants
to pursue low cost, sustainable solutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel that, you know, I've got some
friends that are big into K&F and they've
[SPEAKER_03]: met the Cho's and I feel like,
you know, they were in essence trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: communicate the same message.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's some obstacles with
context with K&F that are really
[SPEAKER_03]: problematic in the regulated space
especially.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then there's also some problems with
just cultivation in general with some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the K&F for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my biggest obstacles with it is,
you know, there's the issue of having
[SPEAKER_03]: enough raw materials within your own
product or property or farm to create your
[SPEAKER_03]: ferments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most humans are relying on some
outside source to provide either the
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit, the vegetables or the milk or the
sugar or whatever the inputs are used to
[SPEAKER_03]: make those K&F ferments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we work in the cannabis
cultivation space and we take flour and we
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrate it into oils, you know,
the flour might pass, but the trim is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to fail and the oil is definitely
going to fail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we see phenomenons in other areas
of cannabis where we take a large amount
[SPEAKER_03]: of biomass and concentrate it down into an
oil or other product and you see
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticides, chemicals or compounds that
were in that flour that become higher
[SPEAKER_03]: level of detection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think one of the major obstacles
to K&F right now is, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah and I have worked with large organic
farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen pretty good ideas to the
cheating that goes along and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's study after study that shows,
you know, I remember one where they took
[SPEAKER_03]: some produce from outside the United
States that was deemed organic and like of
[SPEAKER_03]: the 12 products, all 12 had something that
shouldn't be on it, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have a industry wide issue with
contamination.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have an industry wide issue with
unregulated agricultural activities that
[SPEAKER_03]: are using other products that they
shouldn't be doing that people in the
[SPEAKER_03]: effort to apply regenerative tactics to
the cannabis space or then concentrate in
[SPEAKER_03]: these pesticides and applying them to
their plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm kind of curious as to what maybe
Lydia has seen in her analytical work.
[SPEAKER_03]: The obstacle with K&F is I suggest these
concerns I have to people that do K&F and
[SPEAKER_03]: they go, well, I'm trying to save money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not going to spend $150 to test for
pesticides on my ferments, which makes
[SPEAKER_03]: perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes perfect sense, you know,
but like I saw one the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I haven't had a case of a K&F farm that
then sends their product in for testing
[SPEAKER_03]: because yeah, it doesn't make sense
financially.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I saw on Instagram the other day
where a guy had a bunch of bananas and it
[SPEAKER_03]: had the sticker on it, the PLU sticker.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could read it very clearly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was 4011, which is conventional banana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there's a nine before it,
it's organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so dudes fermenting conventional
bananas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look into how bananas are
grown, like they actually take a plastic
[SPEAKER_03]: bag that is infused with pesticides and
insecticides.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as the banana flower starts to
shoot shoots, they wrap it in the
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticide and it grows inside of a
pesticide bag because they're so ridden
[SPEAKER_03]: with pests.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think there's a considerable
disconnect between the agricultural
[SPEAKER_03]: process, the areas of contamination and
how that then affects your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just, you know, I haven't seen a K&F
garden survive more than a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: harvests in the regulated space because of
these phenomenons.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's something that nobody's talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's the history of pesticides,
but there's also the issue of sort of the
[SPEAKER_01]: way that they're using it ecologically and
microbially speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the balance of that may or may not be
scientifically sound as far as results and
[SPEAKER_01]: what they get, how they use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other issue is in just being
able to make the products consistently
[SPEAKER_01]: with knowing what the end product,
does it have alcohol in it even?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, those kinds of things that I
think if you're using it in a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: space or any space that you actually need
to sell the product and have a good
[SPEAKER_01]: harvester need that money from the
harvest, it would be good to know and get
[SPEAKER_01]: that process down so you know what you're
making.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think that, you know, I come from
a business background.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I come from, you know, what Sarah's
saying is that, you know, part of being
[SPEAKER_03]: regenerative and sustainable is that your
business needs to be regenerative and
[SPEAKER_03]: sustainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, one of the core
components of our business is helping
[SPEAKER_03]: farms stay in business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in order for organic or sustainable
practices or the regenerative movement,
[SPEAKER_03]: to be sustainable and have an impact on
the market, we need those farms to make it
[SPEAKER_03]: more than three harvests.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need these farms to stay in business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I think that's been one of
my gripes that people, other people in the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry have a large objection to how
vocal I'm being.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think people understand where
I'm coming from is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: if there's bad advice given to farmers
that puts farmers out of business,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that's not sustainable and we
need to first be a business that can make
[SPEAKER_03]: it from harvest to harvest to harvest so
that we can stick around so that we can
[SPEAKER_03]: produce products on the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our voice can be heard so that we can
actually make a lasting impact on the
[SPEAKER_03]: market wide.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if all of our farms are going out of
business because they're concentrating
[SPEAKER_03]: banana pesticides, like that does not help
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say, I mean,
there are some tenants that go along with
[SPEAKER_02]: KNF, you know, that are similar to farmer
culture, that are similar to regenerative
[SPEAKER_02]: ag is, you know, you're being able to use
indigenous microorganisms, not using
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic herbicides, pesticides,
fertilizers, you know, improving your
[SPEAKER_02]: growing environment, creating a more
sustainable culture as best you possibly
[SPEAKER_02]: can with your facility is going to lead
you down the proper direction in the long
[SPEAKER_02]: run.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we see a lot of issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if we're not even talking about
cultivation, we see an issue with the
[SPEAKER_02]: sourcing of chocolate and using chocolate
for edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that results in, you know,
heavy metals failure or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're talking about Cavendish bananas,
you know, how many different types of
[SPEAKER_02]: bananas do they regularly ship around the
world?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like literally three.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Cavendish are the ones that are
the most popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because, you know, we all know
the reasons why ag works the way that it
[SPEAKER_02]: does.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, trusting that the source of
the material that you're getting is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that you're not going to have an issue
is poor planning, you know, in no offense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not something that, you know,
if it were me, even whenever I'm buying or
[SPEAKER_02]: recommending that someone purchase a new
bat of pesticides, it's like you make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that you get that material tested in a
laboratory against the standards that you
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to be up against as a
cultivation facility trying to get your
[SPEAKER_02]: product to market because mistakes happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, manufacturing mistakes happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are problems where things get
adulterated and they're not meant to be
[SPEAKER_02]: even without it being the intention of the
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's just something that,
you know, I've seen a lot of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, as we all know,
it's like the horror stories of using
[SPEAKER_02]: municipal compost, you know, and using
that material to start a compost pile and
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're going to be dealing with is
totally different than if all of your
[SPEAKER_02]: materials come from your land,
which, as Scott was saying, turns into a
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty big sourcing issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see the reason why I don't work with KNF
is that I don't think I'm qualified at
[SPEAKER_00]: this time where my understanding of using
fermentations to drive my plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: direction to me is too risky with this
crop at the level that I need to perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know farmers that run KNF operations
that are succeeding in terms of their
[SPEAKER_00]: products do pass COA and their killer
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are also some really dedicated,
hard-working, driven to understand those
[SPEAKER_00]: methodologies type people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the reason why you see it
fall off is that someone throws that word
[SPEAKER_00]: on top of it, KNF, and automatically,
oh, it must be, it's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they approach it and they don't
understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where you start sourcing
regular bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find out that you don't have enough
diversity on your property to do
[SPEAKER_00]: fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to acquire material from
somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're picking up stuff that's
covered in insecticides, fungicides,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, because it's just ag products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know people who are successful with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that I think at the top of
the food chain with that would be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: in our world, Chris Trump and the crew
that rolls are under Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing some fire, and they're
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that it's way more in-depth
than people want to admit, and that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to say that there's a level of
professionalism in every aspect of what we
[SPEAKER_00]: do as cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to kind of define your
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can have ideas of how other things
operate, but you have to work with what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're good at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you start to play a little of
this, a little of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What Eric said the other day, you guys are
talking about, that we're going to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: operation, and they're really going to do
10% of the operation correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of the 90% of the operation was
going to be half-assed, and we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: just wing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same situation here,
that just because it's organic doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean it's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just because it's organic doesn't mean
it's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just another method of working with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that when people start to put
the buzzwords on, it makes them feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to do something so,
like you're competing for who's most
[SPEAKER_00]: organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to deliver a crop to a
customer consistently, profitably,
[SPEAKER_00]: and morally.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Aquaponics, you've got to have a water
scientist on board, and that's a whole
[SPEAKER_04]: other thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: People want to do aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did it in our office.
[SPEAKER_04]: On a small level, it fucked around,
and it was super difficult on that level.
[SPEAKER_04]: So trying to scale up, and I even watch
vegetable farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife did a class in Florida with a main
aquaponics farm that did it in
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouses, and it's totally impressive
and super sustainable.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the level of risk and how hard it is
and how you got to be so sharp to do it is
[SPEAKER_04]: unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can tell why people don't do it in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's just not... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve raised a good aquaponics,
Steve, as the podcast and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: long dreads to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kidd's a fish wizard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's a fish wizard, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, what I got from him in
the last time we were hanging out was that
[SPEAKER_00]: he has to use a composite system in order
to get the yields that he needs,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can't drive the fertility from
the fish end of it safely or the fish end
[SPEAKER_00]: up becoming damaged from too much
concentration of ammonium in their tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you end up having a sick fish
population if you want to drive the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to use a hybrid system of
mineral nutrition in some form of pot
[SPEAKER_00]: that's put into the irrigation system
where it's aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a pure aquaponics system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use aquaponics to drive
wheatgrass, but wheatgrass has a far lower
[SPEAKER_00]: value of nutrient load than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every one of these systems is
incredible if you just admit that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have limitations in specific areas and you
address it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people get romanticized with this
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even they get romanticized with scale
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like once I got my Venlo, I'm going to be
somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you're going to be fucking
bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That alone doesn't make you somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that these organic
methodologies, as fascinating as they are
[SPEAKER_00]: today, to me because they are art,
you have to admit that, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the ability to ferment
everything in my woods and close my loops
[SPEAKER_00]: and do this operation in that way and make
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use an organic bottom end and I
charge it so that I have a bacteria base
[SPEAKER_00]: that's solid so my base level of fertility
is consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can get analysis done so I know I'm
within range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I utilize that phyloscape
technology to get around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The environmental stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just admitted to myself that when
I'm 70, maybe then I can be a fully closed
[SPEAKER_00]: loop farmer because I can start to grow
all the products that are needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in Columbia, they were growing
all these products that they were using
[SPEAKER_00]: for their ag in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they got into cannabis,
they just had to increase the acreage of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things that they were already
producing to use as ferments because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how they operated naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for them, K&F situation made total
sense because they were already really
[SPEAKER_00]: following it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was more like Columbia natural
farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't copying Master Cho.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were copying how they've been doing
it since the dawn of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you just have to be really
honest about your situation and just say,
[SPEAKER_00]: look, there's a lot of ways to get to the
destination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose the one that's going to work for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not in competition with each other
for who's coolest with their grow
[SPEAKER_00]: technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honesty isn't the first policy in
cannabis, it seems.
[SPEAKER_04]: The ego is the best policy or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either you don't want to spend shit and
show everybody you can grow great weed,
[SPEAKER_04]: or you want to spend everything and show
everybody you can grow great weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a lot of in-between.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the one consistent thing, I would say
what the biggest problem with cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: becoming extremely successful is that once
something becomes popular, people don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want to fall out of that cool click.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't want to admit they didn't
go well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so everybody just keeps smiling and
saying everything's fine like that meme
[SPEAKER_03]: when the thing's on fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because nobody wants to be the guy that
didn't do it well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's systemic across the board,
which I keep saying is the number one
[SPEAKER_03]: throttle on evolution of the industry
wide.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as people can be authentic and
honest about how bad things aren't going,
[SPEAKER_03]: we can start talking about how good they
can go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people aren't quite ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not big ag like that yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: When shit's going wrong in strawberries,
everybody's talking about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: When shit's going wrong in sugar beets or
grapes or any of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when I was a kid, they had this
weird phenomenon going through sugar
[SPEAKER_04]: beets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was wiping everybody out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all the farmers, all the companies,
everybody rallies around this shit to fix
[SPEAKER_04]: it and figure out what the problem is and
kind of do a reset.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just we're not in that category as
much as that's the part of big ag we
[SPEAKER_04]: should be in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody really gets together and really
does these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of these people share these
trials that are being done.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a guy that's really, I mean,
he's a big ag guy, moved into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he loves cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a great way of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't a big ag guy trying to get in it
for the money.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was already in big ag, wanted to be
into cannabis and bring what he knew and
[SPEAKER_04]: learn what he can.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so basically, I actually was talking
to Peter about this guy and saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: we should get him on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I talked to him about it the other
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like, fuck no, I can't go on
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The company I work for won't let me talk
to anybody about shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just like, well, that's,
fuck, he would be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've learned a lot and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's not the company itself,
well, it's the company itself holding back
[SPEAKER_04]: even good people within that company to
share that information.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, it's kind of crazy how bottled
up it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just quickly sticking on our KNF topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris Trump's actually confirmed for next
week.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Scott, just quickly, can you touch on
the use of rice to kind of collect and
[SPEAKER_05]: grow things?
[SPEAKER_05]: You had mentioned something about rice and
kind of concerns there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also kind of how Master Cho,
from your perspective, has evolved his way
[SPEAKER_05]: of thinking and how he thinks about things
differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're going to get onto Elaine
Ingham and the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think one of the things that I
think is really missing from the KNF
[SPEAKER_03]: community is a little bit more solid
foundation of the entirety of the soil
[SPEAKER_03]: food web and how these things interplay in
the root system of plants and lead to good
[SPEAKER_03]: results or bad results.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one of the objections that Dr.
Elaine Ingham has had is the concept that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're taking a strategy from Korea using
rice, which is something that naturally
[SPEAKER_03]: exists in that region.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're using it to catch organisms and
using that to be their inoculum,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I think Kevin nailed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they're doing Columbia natural
farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, okay, so those Colombians have
adapted these same principles of using the
[SPEAKER_03]: available materials in their environment
to compost them or ferment them down that
[SPEAKER_03]: they can then use for healthy plant
growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's something that's being
missed in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when we take rice, which is
something that doesn't naturally occur in
[SPEAKER_03]: the forest of the redwoods, and we put it
into the root system or soil or mulch
[SPEAKER_03]: layer, whatever it is they're doing with
it, they're harvesting organisms from that
[SPEAKER_03]: environment that are suitable to
decomposing that material, not necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: organisms that lead to healthy plant
growth within that environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the KNF community just objects to my
objection and nobody really opens a
[SPEAKER_03]: textbook to even see what they're doing or
takes Dr. Elaine's microscope course,
[SPEAKER_03]: which again is contradictory to the KNF
principles of being low cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just have this kind of obstacle
where the entire KNF community,
[SPEAKER_03]: from my standpoint, is neglecting a major
portion of soil biology that's easily and
[SPEAKER_03]: readily found in textbooks that you can
read up on and understand how these
[SPEAKER_03]: systems work, what these organisms do,
and how they do or do not positively
[SPEAKER_03]: affect plant growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're kind of in the wizardry side,
which I'm down for wizardry, but you can't
[SPEAKER_03]: live on wizardry and deny the law of
gravity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, even the tea brewers have a little
wizardry too, a little sprinkle of this
[SPEAKER_04]: and a sprinkle of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, everybody gets their wizard hat
on sometimes, but you're definitely gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: break the internet on this one,
Scott.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might have to unblock some people or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even belong to the internet
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't belong to the internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I come from Southern California and I was
raised by skaters, surfers, and gangsters.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't okay to be fake.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got called fake every day if you
didn't drop in on the ramp properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not gonna participate in Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like the bar scene of fake
asses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to participate in that
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Post-COVID, I got no time for this shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got no time for this shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: None.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just quickly, give me your perspective
on ferments and alcohol and mastered
[SPEAKER_05]: shows, evolved thinking and water.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you end go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess, so what Peter, I guess to
catch up the live listener, I don't at all
[SPEAKER_03]: want to speak for the shows necessarily,
but to my understanding, like the
[SPEAKER_03]: evolution of KNF has even been to like the
JDOM or JDOM, which is a son, which to my
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding that's been communicated to
me by KNF people, it's more of a
[SPEAKER_03]: water-based ferment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was kind of shocked to hear that
the people here in the United States
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to grow cannabis are doing like
sugar-based ferments, which leads to a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of alcohols.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems that the Cho family
themselves are evolving to a water-based
[SPEAKER_03]: ferment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know the intricacies of that,
but what I do see is an evolution from the
[SPEAKER_03]: Cho family on their own process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we need to say that same evolution
within the cannabis space of their
[SPEAKER_03]: process, because, you know, my wife and
I's job is as a lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were trained by a scientist to
identify organisms, whether you're a KNF
[SPEAKER_03]: garden or a living soil garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we do this analysis and put these
organisms into different categories,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's very clear indicator of success or
bad outcome, regardless of the type of
[SPEAKER_03]: farm you're at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there's these, phenomena in
the root zone that are very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to dig through it last night,
but we got so many damn textbooks at this
[SPEAKER_03]: house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there was this one, we were both
flipping through books like, where's this
[SPEAKER_03]: quote?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to quote science,
you got to be accurate or else they rip
[SPEAKER_03]: your shreds on the internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But nonetheless, this whole paragraph was
speaking about all the functions of plants
[SPEAKER_03]: that stop under an anaerobic condition in
the root zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is important because major
metabolic functions stop working under
[SPEAKER_03]: decreased oxygen conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a whole bunch of other compounds are
produced.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, so we run this lab where
people send us soil samples from the
[SPEAKER_03]: smallest garden to the biggest garden,
living soil, non-living soil, hybrid,
[SPEAKER_03]: KNF.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by far the weirdest plant symptoms
come from the KNF sector.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, nobody that's doing a living soil
farm calls me because their stem turned to
[SPEAKER_03]: gush and the plant fell over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, nobody in hydroponics has ever
called me like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's some really,
really weird plant phenomenon that are
[SPEAKER_03]: happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe it has something to do with
the horrendous amount of alcohol that are
[SPEAKER_03]: being poured on the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm going to second that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's, cause I like,
I think what happens is the internet
[SPEAKER_03]: starts to rebut me saying that I'm saying
everybody needs to be on my camp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: At all.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm saying is if you're going to
engage in organic activities and talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about biological concepts, you should
familiarize yourself with these functions
[SPEAKER_03]: and foundations from readily accessible
textbooks in the library.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's not just my information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's major complications with the
strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not saying it can't be done
because we've assisted some farmers that
[SPEAKER_03]: have had some pretty good success with a
hybrid approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's definitely an increase in
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's definitely an increase that comes
with using some of these KNF functions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you cannot ignore foundations of
biological concepts that are just as
[SPEAKER_03]: absolute as the law of gravity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my two cents.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would just say, you know, what,
what to echo kind of with Lydia and what
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin was saying, just whatever you're
going to do, whatever system you resonate
[SPEAKER_01]: with, just make sure you take the time to
quantify what it is you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, why you're doing it and you
don't waste that effort only to find at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of the harvest that you failed for
whatever pesticide that you didn't see
[SPEAKER_01]: coming down the pipe because you
overlooked something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that happens to all of us that
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a major learning lesson for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all in a great big learning lesson
right now on that, but just quantify what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it take the time, spend the money to
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you know, at the end of it,
you could, you know, definitely miss
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and fail testing and not get that
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't fail testing, you just,
you have it off crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the product isn't right, it doesn't
have a home anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The low shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is what I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gives me the right production at
that location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that direction always has
to be specific where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's in terms of scalability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never intend to scale that operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is always meant to be the size it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm cool with that for its duration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can use that as a specific,
but anytime you go to any operation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you have to identify the people
have the ability first to even run and do
[SPEAKER_00]: what they intend to run and do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think that there's people who
are brilliant and they know how to make
[SPEAKER_00]: these systems work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's shortcuts that occur
because people don't understand that that
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't a shortcut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That if you do this, you will get this
problem as a result.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there hasn't been enough experience in
the U S for operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, it'd be interesting to go to
Korea and see people farm and ask them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, do you use KNF?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what, like, how do they approach
farming in their culture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what I get kind of caught
up in is how does the, how do the people
[SPEAKER_00]: in these, these other countries that don't
have commercial ag to the same degree we
[SPEAKER_00]: do in the way we approach it, how do they
generate the products?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was what was so interesting about the
Colombian situation was they was scaling
[SPEAKER_00]: out the crops that they were going to grow
to create the products they needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had full control of what they did
as an input and they knew exactly why I
[SPEAKER_00]: asked them, why, why do you grow this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, this is what we get from
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we get from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had a full strategy and had been
based off of success.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that, like, for me, my farm
isn't, isn't developed to that degree yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the people that I know that are having
success when you go to their properties,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's almost like a plant oasis to where
they have so many different things growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in such a balance that they can create
these balance systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and I, I strive for that as
my long-term goal, but I know that I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: jump right into it and succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too much of a risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be a progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like we talked about last time,
you start off with something, you prove
[SPEAKER_00]: the concept, you increase it exponentially
until you've reached, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the full max potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're just, if you're just moving
through time and space, running as fast as
[SPEAKER_00]: you can, you can run right into a fucking
wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and our core message is we're trying
to keep these regenerative farms in
[SPEAKER_03]: business.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, Kevin's taken the strategy
he is because he knows it ensures his
[SPEAKER_03]: survival in the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're trying to keep all these people
in business so that we can make a broader
[SPEAKER_03]: impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if we have all of our organic
farms, go out of business because they
[SPEAKER_03]: planted in a first year, Hugo culture,
like that ain't, that's not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we need to, we need to develop
systems that are actually repeatable,
[SPEAKER_03]: that actually lead to sustainability of
your business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, that's why I like Kevin so
much.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a business mindset.
[SPEAKER_03]: I came from a business family as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I'm on the regenerative camp,
but I'm always looking at from a small
[SPEAKER_03]: business survivability standpoint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we have to start with being
successful and repeating that that's where
[SPEAKER_03]: sustainability starts for me, you know,
and I, a lot of times I see farms make it
[SPEAKER_03]: to the commercial scale and a lot of them
have hired us to help them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they go so far to the regenerative
that it's not practical for their
[SPEAKER_03]: survivability in the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have to start with survivability in
the market and inch our way towards full
[SPEAKER_03]: sustainability of our property,
or it's just going to be a boneyard of
[SPEAKER_03]: stories of what almost was.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because I can tell you the hydro
facilities, they're not slowing down.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're ramping up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, unless some of these
regenerative farms figure out how to be
[SPEAKER_03]: profitable to make an impact on the market
or how we community wide figure out how to
[SPEAKER_03]: communicate strategies that lead to
regenerative opportunities and
[SPEAKER_03]: sustainability, you know, what impact are
we actually going to have and how do we
[SPEAKER_03]: actually get there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.
