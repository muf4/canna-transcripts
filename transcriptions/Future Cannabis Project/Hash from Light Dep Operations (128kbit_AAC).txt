[SPEAKER_01]: Well, nowadays you have a lot of places
pulling for harvest and forever flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never done there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've turned it into factory agriculture
because there's lights in the greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're bringing in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're throwing away all the soil that's
spent, you know, and there's factory farms
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a huge change.
[SPEAKER_01]: The resin's definitely not as good.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a farm, Frenchy refuses, right,
to wash anything from a farm that does so
[SPEAKER_01]: many harvests because the attention to
details, not... Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, everyone's so concerned with the
money of flipping and flipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but they don't have the choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them, they have some investor
breathing on their back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one who didn't take investors,
they don't have the fucking money to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is only 400 license that
have been given in the state of California
[SPEAKER_00]: since they started to give license,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 400, like final license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else, it's make-believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expensive make-believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they don't want to give a
provisory permit next year, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: tough luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nowhere to go to complain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have the most, in those 400,
it's only the big player.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very unhealthy because they have the
money to bribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they were talking this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab, if like a big boy work with a
small lab and he's the only customer and
[SPEAKER_00]: he's not happy about whatever and he step
out, they're dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that's a mean to blackmail,
like the big boy are the mean to blackmail
[SPEAKER_00]: you in a level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we keep fighting between each other,
the way it's going on, that's how you win
[SPEAKER_00]: a war.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's by dividing where you're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been divided like never,
ever since legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
