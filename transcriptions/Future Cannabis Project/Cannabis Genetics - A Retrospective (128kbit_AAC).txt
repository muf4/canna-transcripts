[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've been in it for a handful of
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been in it for some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that the common ground we have
is both coming up in the Bay Area,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, myself in Marin County and kind
of being a part and seeing the scene as it
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Waldo's were around before my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But talking about strains in specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like things have changed a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, well, let's roll it back a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there was a time when there
weren't strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And true did come up in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the last 15 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before that, I was on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first long stretch of period of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have strains of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had source countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would talk about Jamaica and you
would talk about Colombia and you would
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about Nepalese temple balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would talk about red Lebanese hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would talk about cherry oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would talk about.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talk about tie sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all what came off the ships.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So well, if you were lucky, it came off an
airplane because airplanes tend to
[SPEAKER_01]: preserve the preserve the quality of
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpenes get very degraded by salt air.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the days of Colombian weed,
when we were getting like massive amounts
[SPEAKER_01]: of Colombian coming in, there was there
was weed that was flown in.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was airplane weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was really beautiful,
super terpy, really sticky, not super
[SPEAKER_01]: compressed and very expensive,
like twice as expensive as what we call
[SPEAKER_01]: the boat weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the boat weed would be pressed into
bales and it would just be trucked up in
[SPEAKER_01]: these freighters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, you know, they were in bilges.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were exposed to salt air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they got oxidized, lost a lot of
their terpene content because they were
[SPEAKER_01]: bricked up in order to get more into the
boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be could be more reasonably
priced.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were also they kind of fell apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a lot of shake in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was there was plain weed and and
there was boat weed back in the days
[SPEAKER_01]: before there was even strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that it's so interesting to hear that,
because myself, you know, so I'm a born in
[SPEAKER_00]: the 70s, but came up in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being in northern California,
even though we had a lot going on in our
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard, proverbial backyard,
as you know, we would always talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: brick weed or ditch weed, the stuff that
was coming in bricks over the border from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the top shell for us in this was
just to to identify my my generation was
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really like at that point,
you know, this was after Acapulco Gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is before the cushions got crazy
and some of these other, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: long before cookies and and skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these other crazy genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to your point, it's interesting
because we had the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was kind of like there was the OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a great and we just
classified them as it's either it's brick
[SPEAKER_00]: or it must be Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so do you know, do you know who who
would we consider the Johnny Appleseed of
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is the guy most responsible for the
fact that we actually have strains of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that we're working with today?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an excellent question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you who I think the cannabis
candidate is a guy named Neville
[SPEAKER_01]: Shoemaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville Shoemaker started Neville's
original seed bank, I believe,
[SPEAKER_01]: in 1984.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville, very, very interesting cat,
dual Australian and and Dutch citizenship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lived in Australia, developed a passion
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the first guy that went all over
the world collecting land, raised strains
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis, indigenous strains of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urban poison from South Africa and so on
and so forth and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was the first guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the first guy that bred a lot of
what we call the first generation of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis hybrids now from those land race
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Neville was like like a lot of us
then he was struck by what I call divine
[SPEAKER_01]: madness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just so fucking sick of cannabis
prohibition, of being closed into this
[SPEAKER_01]: box, of being denied something that was
our right, that it made us kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were just determined we weren't
going to take it anywhere.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Neville went out on a limb and he
started sending thousands and thousands
[SPEAKER_01]: and thousands of cannabis seeds to the
United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Via mail order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Neville's original seed bank and he
was the first guy that sent seeds to the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in the middle of the 1980s when
Ronald Reagan and his crazy wife,
[SPEAKER_01]: Nancy, are on the warpath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Daryl Gates, for your program of
1983 in L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all started right here where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Neville is living in the Netherlands
where he's doing this, completely legal
[SPEAKER_01]: for him to be sending cannabis seeds all
over the world, including to the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States under Dutch law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not legal under U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they're considered novelty,
like we know some of the Canadian seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not according to the DEA,
because what they did and this was a,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, one of the darkest chapters in
the war on cannabis is that Neville went
[SPEAKER_01]: to Australia to visit his daughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because they could not arrest him in
the Netherlands, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: authorities, the DEA, arrested him in
Australia on a conspiracy warrant in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And had they been successful in that
prosecution, my friend Neville would be in
[SPEAKER_01]: prison in the United States to this day
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was how many charges they had stacked
up on him for sending cannabis seeds to
the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: To people who needed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was going to get life in prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville, fortunately, you know,
we had to kind of be wily in those days to
[SPEAKER_01]: survive and help each other out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow, Neville managed to escape from
the Australian jail that he was being held
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Managed to get a passport and somebody
else's name that got him out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: country and into the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ever since then, and this is decades
ago, Neville has been a prisoner in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big jail, but he hasn't been able
to leave the country because he's afraid
[SPEAKER_01]: that if he does, he's going to be arrested
by U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: authorities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even in this day and age, the last time
I talked to him, he did not want to come
[SPEAKER_01]: to, he wanted to come to the United
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wanted to see this because he's one of
the guys most responsible for this amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, this whole cannabis renaissance
that's happening now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the beginning, however,
of a long and difficult saga for him that
[SPEAKER_01]: basically wrecked his personal and
financial life and separated him from his
[SPEAKER_01]: family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he endured years and years and years
of persecution, had a lot of his work
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriated by by other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of the most tragic chapters
in the war on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Neville, right, Neville should always
be remembered as the guy who first saw
[SPEAKER_01]: over the horizon, who understood that
there was going to be such a thing as
[SPEAKER_01]: modern cannabis genetics, went out and got
those land-raised strains, preserved them,
[SPEAKER_01]: combined them, a true visionary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And such a great story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, now that segues into a question
out for you, because you've built such a
[SPEAKER_00]: great brand and offer such a phenomenal
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've supported the small boutique
coop growers over the years up in northern
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of those strains, it's they've
kind of got a little diluted, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, are there do you ever feel like
there's a point where I'm I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know myself being a little bit of a seed
hunter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a true Acapulco gold and supposedly
ecstasy out in Amsterdam has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to stop and see if they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a true non backbred, crossbred
northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to find that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think there's some potential in
finding those original, true, pure strains
[SPEAKER_00]: in this day of crazy cookies and cushions
and every other thing that's going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: the trendy space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a race against time,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people like Neville and people who
have come after Neville, who have made it
[SPEAKER_01]: their business to to go into the farthest
valleys and the highest mountains on this
[SPEAKER_01]: planet and find indigenous land,
raise strains of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, you know, folks are doing a
very good job of preserving those those
[SPEAKER_01]: original genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I I think that what we've seen
since the seed bank is a is is is one
[SPEAKER_01]: really great thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is that the overall quality of
cannabis around the world is much,
[SPEAKER_01]: much, much higher than it ever was before.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the course of the last three decades,
the cannabis consumer has been exposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: a much higher quality of cannabis,
steadily increasing quality of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's also happened along the way is
is that there's just been a huge amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic crossbreeding and hybridization
until there's an awful lot of strains out
[SPEAKER_01]: there that are awfully much like
everything else that's out there that
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have a lot of distinctive character
to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nowadays, I always tell people if
they're going to bring me flour and I have
[SPEAKER_01]: to ration myself smoking flour because
I've smoked so much flour in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: My lungs are bearing the load.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be really special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always tell people, bring me the ugly
bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't bring me the perfect round,
dense, lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see something ugly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if it's ugly, most likely it's
going to have some kind of distinctive
[SPEAKER_01]: character in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's and I want to see
distinctiveness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that we're also seeing a real
shift in what people are breeding for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are becoming more and more
sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the early days, breeders didn't have
any access to analytics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only way that you could test your
product was by seeing how potent it was by
[SPEAKER_01]: trying it and smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was good for building your THC
content, but not very good for any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other 400 cannabinoids or hundreds of
different terpenes that are out there.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a story that illustrates that when I
was co-founder of Steep Hill Laboratory,
[SPEAKER_01]: the first cannabis analytics laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we ran our first 2000 samples of
cannabis from California's medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis market, all came from Harborside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only 10 of them had measurable quantities
of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because every grower was trying to
maximize their revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way that you maximize your revenue
is by maximizing your potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the process of maximizing potency
without even knowing what they were doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: people selected out CBD from the genetic
pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Harlequins, the Suzy Qs,
the Charlotte's Web, I mean, the ACDCs,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm a medical advocate and have
been for your cancer survivor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do look at it from a medicinal
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been a fan of either high CBDs
or at least a one to one to get a bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: that body and mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those just weren't the thing because
they had been weaned out so much to your
[SPEAKER_00]: point through the 80s, the 90s,
this whole influence.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to build CBD back into the cannabis
genetics pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody had been selecting for high
potency and had just inadvertently,
[SPEAKER_01]: without even knowing it, without trying
to, had eliminated, basically eliminated
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was that was disturbing to me
because like you, I understood the
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic implications of that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that there that there would be
millions of people who would not get the
[SPEAKER_01]: profound therapeutic benefits of CBD and
particularly people like children with
[SPEAKER_01]: intractable epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually had to do things that we
didn't ever do in any other program in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to get CBD back into the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first went to growers,
like after we got these results,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, my God, I got to get more
growers to grow CBD rich cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go to them and I say, hey,
I want you to grow this cannabis that's
[SPEAKER_01]: rich in CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would be like, dude, what are you
talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want me to grow weed that doesn't get
you high?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens if you get rated?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is back in George Bush days.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens if you get rated and you're
not here and I'm going to sell the weed
[SPEAKER_01]: that doesn't get people high?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did something we never did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is we paid growers in advance for
weed that had not been grown yet so that
[SPEAKER_01]: they would grow CBD rich cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we had to do in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
So that's what we did in the beginning.
