[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, Lance Lambert here coming to you
from Barcelona, Spain for spandibus 2019
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden it's getting really smoky
around here and it could be because I it's
[SPEAKER_01]: literally almost 420 but also because
we've got The one the only the man the
[SPEAKER_01]: myth the legend.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Ed Rosenthal here with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing Ed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice so beyond being a good friend and a
fellow in the industry I want to get Ed on
[SPEAKER_01]: camera and just get his take on Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell me this isn't your first rodeo
You've been here before.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what have you seen?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've talked you like Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a nice city, you know How
much have you seen this place change in
[SPEAKER_01]: the last several years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's grown tremendously and it's
much more sophisticated than it was just a
[SPEAKER_00]: few years ago Very similar to being to
some American shows And what do you think
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean this is You mentioned like a US
shows even Canadian shows But US shows
[SPEAKER_01]: more so where it's either business to
business or consumer but here especially
[SPEAKER_01]: in Europe It seems they overlap the two
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just a common thing that you
see Well, well, I think that the American
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is more segmented right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah But I think that there is That in
America right now the grower is has been
[SPEAKER_00]: left behind sort of at the shows and I
think that that will change Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there is a growing demand for
cannabis very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very true So what is your take?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how things are here more than
anyone social clubs versus coffee shops in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Netherlands Versus us only having
dispensaries in the US and Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your take on the social club?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's a good model for?
[SPEAKER_00]: mainstream per se I think that coffee that
social clubs The coffee shops are both
[SPEAKER_00]: good models and we have that in California
We have lounges where people can use it
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice So what's happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean that's The thing I think about
it's domestic and international how many
[SPEAKER_01]: pubs and clubs that you pass where alcohol
is is obviously the the open option for
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption But for those that rather
consume cannabis not alcohol It's just
[SPEAKER_01]: tough, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just so much Where there is a
communal opportunity or social opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really difficult to have a pub type
scene where it has been before the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis clubs started opening And I think
that that's really a healthy Phenomenon
[SPEAKER_00]: and the reason why I said you use the term
healthy Is because I don't think that
[SPEAKER_00]: drinking a lot or social drinking Which
often leads to overindulgence is really
[SPEAKER_00]: good for people Yeah, I'm not saying you
should be outlawed or corrupt or anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: but people should at least be given a
choice and that's what's happening Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what else?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think is the the future of?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis on a global scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a good question asked being that
we're Kind of the epicenter of Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that it's happening all over
both in South America, Central America,
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada and then over in here in Europe You
know each country has its own laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and then also in Malaysia they just
came out and said they were going to
[SPEAKER_00]: execute a person who was giving kids THC
and CBD for epilepsy and there was such
[SPEAKER_00]: protests that they're changing the laws
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow And that's something you not expect in
Malaysia because they're up there with
[SPEAKER_00]: Singapore on capital punishment and crime
But they decided wait Maybe he doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have victims.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a good segue You know
something that happened is I'd say a gift
[SPEAKER_01]: over the holidays We weren't expecting but
for Thailand and South Korea to announce
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're gonna move forward to medical
I mean is that something that you imagined
[SPEAKER_01]: in your lifetime?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't even know if I imagine
Asia coming around to cannabis even though
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a better part of where this all
began I guess you can say but what's your
[SPEAKER_01]: take on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sense Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I as always appreciated Ed as a
friend and a colleague in the industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know You really are in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are a true legend.
