[SPEAKER_00]: How do we preserve true medical in an
adult-use market?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very big challenge, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some that really want to be
dedicated and are passionate towards
[SPEAKER_00]: producing medical products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the standards of purity for both
of those products today certainly look to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the same, which is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone is entitled to good, clean,
pure products, so I don't think that
[SPEAKER_00]: bifurcating that in some way may make a
little sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my opinion, it's good to have clean
things for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We shouldn't have a different type of
purity limits for all of our products out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the medical-minded operator might
find it challenging to find shelf space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might find it difficult to reach all
the patients that they're after.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may see more of a delivery network
being set up where you can have patients
[SPEAKER_00]: come into a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may need to travel further away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not sure where all the licensed
dispensaries are going to end up,
[SPEAKER_00]: geographically speaking, how many there
might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Los Angeles is still going through the
process of creating their new ordinance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't decided or discussed really
if they're going to have limitations or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're seeing a great resistance
to accepting a large number of
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of Southern California
locales that have said, ban it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna wait to try and see what this
looks like before we start permitting
[SPEAKER_00]: these things in any fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be locally permitted before
you get a state permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're gonna see this unfortunate
time where patients today are accessing
[SPEAKER_00]: things in today's current medical market
as that one gets forced into the regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see different operators show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see locations move.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see different product types show
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's patient that's finally found
what's working for them may unfortunately
[SPEAKER_00]: be disconnected from that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge challenge and not fair to
any patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's a great answer
other than try to make sure the product
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're relying on the brands that
you're relying on are moving towards
[SPEAKER_00]: adopting the regulations are finding some
sort of way that they don't get their
[SPEAKER_00]: supply disrupted in the new system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is, where do I manufacture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do I have it distributed?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I get distribution hooked up?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I make sure I'm compliant with all
the testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know that my product type is
actually compliant with the new
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a few things that you have to deal
with on top of new business practices and
[SPEAKER_00]: other problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The level of requirements for operating in
this space based on manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations are rather stringent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are extremely detailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to absolutely write every single
thing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be redundant in what you're adding to your
batches so that someone's signing off on
[SPEAKER_00]: what some other operator actually added to
it and weighed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The requirements for that are I think
unfortunately going to push up the price a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you add tax, when you add testing,
when you add things such as operating
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions that require tons and tons of
paperwork and lots of diligence in that
[SPEAKER_00]: regard, it inherently adds cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moreover, add to cities that are trying to
tax on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're adding square footage or gross
receipt taxes on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to raise the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's medical patients are not
reimbursed by healthcare for their cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: this medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may see the market balance that with
people that say, I'll push down towards
[SPEAKER_00]: commodity pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we all have to compete with the
black market pricing, which are guys who
[SPEAKER_00]: are not paying taxes or doing any of the
regulatory standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be a little bit of a give
and take, but there's only so much that
[SPEAKER_00]: will actually be able to be given because
your costs of doing business are simply
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go up to be able to comply.
[SPEAKER_00]: How that whole piece of the pie basically
today gets split between taxes,
[SPEAKER_00]: local taxes, regulations, and new
requirements for operating, how much will
[SPEAKER_00]: be left for the businesses that are there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the longer term minded ones,
the ones that are going to invest in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future, are probably going to be a lot
better off and able to weather those
[SPEAKER_00]: storms and make it in the long sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are today's patients acquiring
medicine from people who are operating in
[SPEAKER_00]: that fashion, it very well might be a no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be very difficult for every
patient to not be disconnected from their
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine as regulations roll out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there will be a significant
challenge in finding new access points or
[SPEAKER_00]: the number of access points the retail
outlets or delivery systems that are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be set up through the retail outlets to
getting medicine into a patient's hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, the numbers of estimates are
hundreds to a thousand or more different
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary points inside of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that number is going to
significantly shrink.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see many locales trying to rush
to permit a large number of dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're even willing to do one or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some are saying, let's just keep them
all closed off and make them delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: only.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will see those distribution points
limited in number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be harder for patients to get
access to their medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the only solutions around
that will be who's driving that and
[SPEAKER_00]: delivering it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, there will be increased cost by
having that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's definitely going to be a
lot less than what we see today.
So thank you very much.
Thank you.
