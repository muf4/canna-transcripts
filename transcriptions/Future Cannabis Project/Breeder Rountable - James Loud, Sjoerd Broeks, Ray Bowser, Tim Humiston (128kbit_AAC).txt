[SPEAKER_02]: And we are live on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for joining us, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's Breeder Roundtable is emceed by
James Loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's me, Peter Severi, and I'm going to
hand it off to James.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, James, take it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I wanted to start off by
talking about viroids and viruses and
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like Joseph, that's kind of his
expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have been kind of
wondering about hoplite, especially I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like that's one of the more common ones
that people are having problems with and
[SPEAKER_01]: have recently identified.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we had sour diesel back in the day,
and around 2003, the sour diesel cuts that
[SPEAKER_01]: were going around had problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like almost like something we
really couldn't identify, but it was like
[SPEAKER_01]: a dudding disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're finding out that a lot of
those sour diesel cuts have hoplite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Joseph, I guess you can kind of fill
everybody in on your experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: not only with hoplite, but with genetics
that are being made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as through seed, what
pathogens, viruses and buroids can be
[SPEAKER_01]: transferred?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so hoplite, like you said,
has been around for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: When it started really becoming,
I think, a more widespread problem,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in California, in like the
mid-20s, I started working in cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: tissue culture in 2016.
[SPEAKER_06]: And basically, or in 16, 17, this was when
Dark Heart and other companies were doing
[SPEAKER_06]: like early research, like Humboldt Seeds,
or yeah, or Filos, Dark Heart,
a couple other companies were all kind of
hunting for what was going on.
And they basically had to do RNA
sequencing, which is basically just like a
sequencing technology where you go looking
for specific sequences of diseases,
and then they found hoplite and buroid.
This really common disease in hops on the
West Coast of the United States that
presumably jumped over into cannabis.
They're all cannabisier, they're related
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in 18, or 19, I believe, two papers
were published by Filos and Dark Heart at
[SPEAKER_06]: the same time, positively identifying
hoplite and buroid, and linking it to
dudding diseases.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically, duded, unfinished flower that
doesn't have normal cannabinoid content,
[SPEAKER_06]: stunted growth, increased rooting,
and vegetative propagation, and like
[SPEAKER_06]: really weird modeling and variation of the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: These symptoms show up very differently in
different cannabis varieties.
And what's the real kicker about hoplite
and buroid is a lot of people have it as
asymptomatic infection.
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically, this thing spreads around
through unsanitized tools, and then some
[SPEAKER_06]: stress happens, and then flower starts to
dud.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the biggest thing that I preach
nowadays to everyone that I talk to is
[SPEAKER_06]: tool sanitation, and this concept of if
you're sharing the same scissors on
[SPEAKER_06]: plants, it's just like sharing needles,
and you transfer a lot of things
[SPEAKER_06]: throughout a group of unsanitized tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some mutual friends that have
had issues with hoplite that have pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much destroyed their library or did a
majority of their library, and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: were saying sometimes it basically
expresses itself, and sometimes it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes you can test, and you can
have it, but it's not expressing itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been doing PCR testing for hoplite
and buroid and other viruses for the last
[SPEAKER_06]: year and a half out of my lab,
Ploidy, Inc., based in Berkeley.
[SPEAKER_06]: And hoplite and buroid is the most common
thing that we find.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I can't talk about people's results,
but I talk because hoplite and buroid is
[SPEAKER_06]: so common, and it's throughout,
it's in multiple states, and it's all over
[SPEAKER_06]: the country.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's an industry-wide issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like you had asked about, it's
seed-transmittable.
We don't know exactly the rate of how
many, or what the percentage rate of if an
infection infected plant provides seed,
how much percentage of that seed is
infected.
In hops itself, that percentage is
something around 8%.
So the thing that people always want to
ask is, okay, if I have it or if I'm
scared of catching it, what do I do?
The most important thing, like I said,
is tool sanitation.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to prevent spreading of diseases
in your grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: The second most important thing is if you
have a symptomatic plant and you can
[SPEAKER_06]: afford it, get rid of them, because
they're only gonna cause you problems down
[SPEAKER_06]: the line.
[SPEAKER_06]: As for, like you said, James, people that
have it, hell, I had a grow that had it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to tear down all the genetics and
start from scratch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Working with companies that are actively
testing for it, doing your own independent
[SPEAKER_06]: third-party testing of your own plants is
the best way to basically source new
[SPEAKER_06]: genetics and preferably from like tissue
culture background or source, and then
[SPEAKER_06]: start cleaning and keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, how about tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can tissue culture, in your opinion,
remove the hoplite virus from the plant?
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remediate it through Maristem tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Different companies have different
techniques.
They do different pre-treatments.
[SPEAKER_06]: But everyone fundamentally goes through
this Maristem tissue culture process where
[SPEAKER_06]: you dissect a microscopic stem cell niche
out of the apex of a growing plant and you
[SPEAKER_06]: regrow a couple hundred cells into a new
plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you test those new plantlets and
tissue culture.
I've done this for years.
Several companies have been doing this for
years successfully.
It's a pain in the ass.
It takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you have to successively do it
because the first half didn't eradicate
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's totally a fixable problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I always talk to people about if you
want to invest in tissue culture
[SPEAKER_06]: remediation, you've got to make sure that
you don't put it back in a bad situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of growers basically,
I've seen all sorts of tool sanitation
protocols from great to poor.
And I think everyone can always be
constantly working on improving sanitation
[SPEAKER_06]: and preventing the spread of disease in
their groves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's just a given for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's perfect and it has to be an
ongoing constant thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And quarantining, a concept of quarantine,
isolated blocks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of people are going to move
away from your vegetative population,
[SPEAKER_06]: at least if you're keeping moms on site.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to kind of keep things
compartmentalized.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you have a peripheral problem in
room A, you can keep it out of B,
[SPEAKER_06]: C, and D.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so I think Tim is on the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have any experience with hot
blatant or having to deal with viruses and
[SPEAKER_01]: buroids?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you guys are like a real farm up
there in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys are as far as it gets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys have clean plants and clean
medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we actually just did a round of
tests with Joe not that long ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we actually had a pop-up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And luckily, we do already segregate
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: We use separate scissors and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a pretty easy fix for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing that caught us off guard,
we sent in a couple cultivars that we
[SPEAKER_03]: thought had it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we sent in a couple that we
thought for sure weren't displaying
[SPEAKER_03]: anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the end of the day, it kind of
fooled us.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the ones we thought had it for sure
ended up testing clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to say it doesn't have it,
but it wasn't found on the first test.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one of our ones that we haven't
had any issues with wouldn't think we had
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it actually popped up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we keep things in a pretty stress-free
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of them stay asymptomatic.
[SPEAKER_03]: But luckily, no, we haven't had too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is just something newer that
came in on us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We brought in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope we dealt with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll find out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do some more tests to make
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think it's something that should
be on everyone's radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a lot of people that
are just ignoring it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, as long as you're clean,
you guys are fairly clean with your
[SPEAKER_01]: practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you guys have dirt on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you guys are farming and maintaining
clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are real farmers, which that's
one thing I love about your farm,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so as far as I guess we can kind
of move on to talking about some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other stuff with colloidal silver,
reversing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it looks like short's in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just trying to get off this farm we're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_05]: The way is off the highway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fully organic, reused soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so short's been working with Femini
Seeds for what, 20 years?
[SPEAKER_01]: More than 20 years, probably 25 years,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but not really actively.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I was working with the Flying
Dutchman when Dutch Fashion started to
[SPEAKER_05]: make Femini Seeds and everybody laughed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a joke at that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of like culture a little bit in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's gotten a lot more consistent.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think once you get over that
learning process and figuring out,
[SPEAKER_05]: like with breeding, you've got to know
which pollen donors do well with which
[SPEAKER_05]: selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same with that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's come a long ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: The selection process, understanding the
plants, all that's come a long ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think even like with what Tim's
doing with colloidal silver that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of been working on, we plan to
release some stuff here in the not so
[SPEAKER_01]: distant future.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Tim can kind of touch base on the
nanotechnology, one milliliter to one
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon of silver, as opposed to the
colloidal silver that we made in
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration back in the day,
or silver nitrate with SCS silver
[SPEAKER_01]: thiosulfate, which I think was commonly
used mostly in Europe, along with
[SPEAKER_01]: colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can touch on that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's probably been about a decade that
I've been working to try to kind of get
[SPEAKER_03]: away from STS and some of these other
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of started with reworking
colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of what's on the market advertises
colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually isn't a colloidal at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an ionic silver, which tends to have
problems when it's kind of going through
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll bond to other molecules and kind of
fall out of suspension.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so colloidal silver has always kind of
got a bad name.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a while back, started to take a deep
look at that and really learn what a true
[SPEAKER_03]: colloidal is and then how to produce it in
a really consistent basis and getting
[SPEAKER_03]: nanoparticles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm actually coming up in James's
book here.
[SPEAKER_03]: At some point, there's a chapter in there
that goes over, gives specific
[SPEAKER_03]: instructions on how to actually make a
really effective colloidal silver that
[SPEAKER_03]: works as good, if not better than STS.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now we've kind of taken it to the next
step.
[SPEAKER_03]: In that research, I found out some other
things and now we have a true nanoparticle
[SPEAKER_03]: silver that I'm producing and that we're
gonna be launching here soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one's actually really exciting
for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about just as safe as colloidal
silver.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, no silver is totally safe,
but not as safe as colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've gone into a concentration point
where you're mixing one mil to one gallon
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's just crushing the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exciting for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just something new, something safer,
something simple, one part, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: no mixing and it's stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can mix it with well water.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can mix it with well water.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can, you know, use the spray day after
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to start over fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: No keeping stuff in refrigerators.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you don't want it too much in
the light, overdoing it with sort of UV
[SPEAKER_03]: light or anything of that nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as long as you can pretty much keep it
generally out of the light, the stuff's
[SPEAKER_03]: stable and it will just keep on rocking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've honestly never seen anything
like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, with STS, there's several steps
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: With making it with the traditional
colloidal silver, unless you're making it
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself, it's really, it's hit or miss
and it's probably not the smartest thing
[SPEAKER_01]: to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think it's just the simple
solution moving forward and colloidal
[SPEAKER_01]: silver is just so much safer than silver
thiosulfate for people to be handling as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you process your plants, you know,
post-harvest after you've harvested your
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, if you do any sort of, you know,
you don't want silver thiosulfate in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, whereas colloidal silver at those
concentrations are not dangerous.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the worst comes to worst,
you're killing like some of the micro life
[SPEAKER_03]: on your skin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously you want to keep that
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I still recommend,
you know, proper protective wear and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I've been drinking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you become feminized?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly what I was going to mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I avoided COVID though, completely
with the CS.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only way to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're excited about this product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really can't wait to get it out on the
market and get it in some more people's
[SPEAKER_03]: hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a real game changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds really interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got some small breeding pods set up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll definitely get some in your hands
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been making seeds in a spot up
north where we use Tim's spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned a valuable lesson on doing
large scale production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I decided I was going to spray my donors
in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can totally do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It requires a lot more labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Tim, when he was helping out,
he suggested that, and it's just a game
[SPEAKER_01]: changer, is that you take all your mails
and you put them in one place,
[SPEAKER_01]: spray them, bring them out in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you're not taking up your space
with your donors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have them pollinate your receivers
and then pull them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially with something like we're using
Techline, where you can actually take
[SPEAKER_01]: emitters and put the emitters onto the
Techline, into the pods, right off your
[SPEAKER_01]: Techline that's providing water for your
other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little game changers.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you experience scaling, man,
it's a whole new world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's an understatement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a more controlled climate for that
period of time as well, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're able to spray them more
evenly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not walking steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it takes a lot less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Labor to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can control the donors a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Overspray can be an issue big time.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't contain your spray,
suddenly you're flipping everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making all kinds of weird seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're doing some of the stuff I'm
doing up there, it's like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been a real learning experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait till next year, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm only halfway through this year,
and I'm like, I can't wait till next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I didn't really do
introductions for everybody, but now that
[SPEAKER_01]: Odie's here, we can kind of go around and
talk about ourselves for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, my name is James Lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys may or may not know me,
but I have a book called Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeding, Beginner to Advance Techniques,
and that should be out relatively soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's available for pre-order on
Amazon still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ed Rosenthal's published publishing
company is publishing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Tim is in the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some stuff from Short in the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joseph is in the book as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Odie has been helping me with some
seed projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of his stuff and photos are going
to be in the book as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Tim, Tim, you want to talk about a
little bit what you do and I'll talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim for a second here, actually,
because I feel like he's the Einstein of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He always comes up with crazy original
ideas and concepts.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, like spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your sprayer is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a pollen sprayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me the idea of by using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little airbrush works good, but then you
can do, if you want to go field,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can actually get a sandblaster and
convert the sandblaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, on that note, if you're just doing
small rooms, one thing that we started
[SPEAKER_03]: doing a while back was using exactly what
James has there, the little airbrush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Handheld airbrush.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put your pollen in the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as this is top loading,
you can put your pollen in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I blend my pollen with rice flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it works extra good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as it's a dry, it works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as everything's dry and it's not
humid, it works great for site
[SPEAKER_01]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something you can pick up on like
Amazon or?
[SPEAKER_02]: eBay.
eBay.
[SPEAKER_01]: eBay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was like less than $50 and it
works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is battery operated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have a cord.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to clean it out good between
pollen, but water neutralizes pollen as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's it called?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a handheld, I think this is a
makeup airbrush gun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they got them for like spreading
mineral makeup or applying mineral makeup.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, where it is a powder actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, it's pretty much the same
application, just different powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then this is the traditional.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys can see here, this is more of
the traditional powder sprayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like for dusting roses,
a plant duster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It requires a lot of pollen for this thing
to work effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp farmers use this stuff out in the
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is way more advanced,
simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely targets it better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I will say if you want to go bigger
and you're going to have to use an air
[SPEAKER_03]: compressor or something, you got to be
really careful that you're not getting
[SPEAKER_03]: anything with moisture in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we'll actually use compressed
gas, either compressed CO2 or compressed
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen, because both of those are pretty
dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you say you just hook it up to a
normal air compressor, you get yourself in
[SPEAKER_03]: trouble because that's going to start
spitting out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and basically moisture reverses the
magnetism on the pollen and it becomes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've experienced that for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were telling me you met with some guys
that were actually applying it with water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did that turn out to be true?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't followed up more on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's what dudes were saying
that they're applying it with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, okay, well, you know,
maybe someone has something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially with the volume, because you
guys are like the hemp stuff that you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: are doing down south is like, you screw up
a couple acres, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of money, especially with the
hemp prices these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so Tim, you want to talk about
your hemp or Kano Organics a little bit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, I could just touch on both.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we have Kano Organics up here in
Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a 30,000 square foot canopy
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're having a lot of fun with it,
you know, winning a lot of awards,
[SPEAKER_03]: just kind of staying at the top of our
game up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got, you know, five, six dope cups,
a couple high times cups, voted best
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse production a couple years in a
row up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, that's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then down south, we have another
company, me and a few other friends,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, helped out found it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is pretty much a contractor for
HGH.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're producing feminized hemp seeds on
on really large scale down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm probably larger than I've seen done
before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's going pretty well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're definitely there's some humps and
bumps in the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a learning process there once you
scale up to, you know, acres wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: And but yeah, that's going great,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a learning process.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're picking it up pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet your neighbors love you.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are literally out in the middle of
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we did that intentionally
getting out really hilly area somewhere
[SPEAKER_03]: that can never be farmed with tractors and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've kind of gotten ourselves in an
area where, you know, large scale humps
[SPEAKER_03]: just not going to happen around us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty ideal for what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, and then short, I've known short
for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've known of short for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been friends for the last couple
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been on a bunch of panels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Tim and I and short have been on
panels together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Joseph as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And short has the Dutch consulting
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's got one of the biggest libraries
of genetics out of anybody that I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he runs some of the biggest greenhouse
facilities in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else you want to touch on that
short?
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a question come up from one of the
viewers about putting a mail donor into
[SPEAKER_01]: with the receivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I think we want to touch on that as
far as it can kind of be a group question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Odie, you can kind of get in on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim and short as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as ratios, if you're doing reg
seeds, I feel like Odie could probably
[SPEAKER_01]: answer that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even back it up and just like start
with mails in general, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: your process of selecting mails and then
into this part of the question,
[SPEAKER_02]: which would be kind of like bringing them
into putting them out to stud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I'll just go in the beginning,
redundancy that I'm sure you've heard from
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts with the stem rub with the males
always.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're also looking for structure and
other things, but it got to have a good
[SPEAKER_01]: nose on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the old school way, I mean,
we can test stuff now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can reverse mails into females.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of interesting things
you can do as far as testing wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the old school way is always rubbing
that stem and getting a good smell out of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also just breeding with it and seeing
what comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if it doesn't come out good,
you find another male.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think a lot of good breeders use the
same mails over and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of good breeders save their mails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a tendency to lose my mails,
but I've saved some over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've saved some for seasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've saved some for a couple years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keeping mails alive also requires a decent
sized nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now as far as you only need a small amount
of mails compared to females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that just depends on the room size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Odie, what is your ratio that you would
use for male to female donor to receivers?
[SPEAKER_01]: So one to eight is what you're saying,
Odie?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one to eight, one male to eight
females is usually where I like to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do about three days worth of
pollinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to do a large window of
pollen flying.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way everything's kind of done pretty
much at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, right about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also dependent upon the size of females,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, and just a little touching on
Odie here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an old school breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started with TGA with Sub and Shane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jenks and all those guys over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's an outdoor breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so his experience with breeding is
definitely outdoor, regular seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he created the Doctor Who.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's done a lot of amazing work over the
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, big seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He makes big ass seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, his seeds are significantly bigger
than the seeds that I make indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just looking right out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll notice that from outdoor
breeders to indoor breeders, the guys that
[SPEAKER_01]: are using the HPS, their seeds are
typically a lot smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had batches of seed where I did the
same cross indoors and outdoors and then
[SPEAKER_01]: ended up with bigger seed outdoors from
the same exact cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Tim, what about you as far as for hemp?
[SPEAKER_03]: Generally, it's like a one to six.
[SPEAKER_01]: One to six.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yours is even more concentrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do you feel like you get more seeds
by using one to six as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: something like one to nine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that you guys have tested that?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just more overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just overdo it and make sure we got
enough.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Short, what's your experience
with donor to receiver ratios?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: like with regular breeding indoors,
you can make hundreds of thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds with one male.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my experience, accidentally seeding
rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: My typical ratio for I do one to 12 with
regular breeding and I do one to nine with
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized if I'm not experienced with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's really interesting on the
donors as far as like if you have tested
[SPEAKER_01]: donors, it's so much easier too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what the donor is going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of breeders out there just
breed with whatever and don't have a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of experience testing this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that reflects in the industry by the
stability of the genetics getting pumped
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and I see the future as companies
advance that we're going to have a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more stable genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think it used to be one percent
male was OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you're talking about any sort of
company that does both seed sales,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to have like that one in a
thousand or one in two thousand or one in
[SPEAKER_01]: five thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be achieved over time by doing
selective breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and I think the Dutch stuff back in the
day, some of it was like called Feminize
[SPEAKER_01]: Seed, but it was like five percent male
sometimes or five percent male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some of the stuff herms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even even today, some of that stuff is
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as breeding outdoors, do you have a
preferred climate or you prefer Oregon or
[SPEAKER_01]: California?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're mostly West Coast now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since I moved to Oregon, I kind of
started doing more breeding indoors just
[SPEAKER_00]: because of humidity factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado outdoors is good and easy because
it's super dry, super dry, super dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: California is kind of in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super wet where Tim's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's California, which I feel is
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Colorado is great for breeding in
the sense that it's dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also the pollen fucking travels all
over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have pollen traveling miles
from some hemp field pollinating your
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff in any sort of outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's very, very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, you know, just depends on where
we're doing the breeding at is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, preferred method, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we feel is going to do better?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, yeah, a dry, warm climate
is preferred for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Tim, do you guys do any redundancy for
your stuff as far as for your,
[SPEAKER_01]: you apply pollen in the field that you've
gathered or do you just go direct with
[SPEAKER_01]: your receiver donors?
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit of both, you know,
because we'll always take the donors after
[SPEAKER_03]: they release the, you know, the majority
of their pollen or, you know, however much
[SPEAKER_03]: we want to release.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll actually take those, dry them out,
collect the pollen, just tumble them in a,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, pretty much a tumbler they use
for like collecting keef and then batch
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll use that on the next round.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just kind of nice to always
have a backup supply, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: as much as we, much as I want to say
everything goes perfect every time,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you get those flips or it just
doesn't work as good as you wanted it to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's nice to be able to pull up pollen
out of the cupboard and get the job done.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Short, your experience, you guys collect
pollen as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then apply it along with as a
redundancy or do you prefer just a...
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we used to, I mean, pollen is useful
and the timing of the tailed donors and
[SPEAKER_05]: the receivers is always a little tricky,
especially when you're getting to know
[SPEAKER_05]: each variety.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to streamline that timing, of course,
having pollen on board is massive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, if you're working on facilities that
produce flower, it's pretty good to be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to control your pollen in a short
amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as you guys preserving pollen,
what are your thoughts on preserving
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen and long term?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I personally, I blend it with
rice flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like rice flour is typically finer
than your traditional, although you can
[SPEAKER_01]: get fine wheat flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I blend it and I do 50-50, although I hear
some people do more and I hear some people
[SPEAKER_01]: do less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Freezing pollen works, but I feel like
keeping the pollen dry is the single most
[SPEAKER_01]: important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on that short?
[SPEAKER_05]: For us, we just open pollinate everything,
so we never use any... Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim, do you preserve pollen long term and
how do you preserve it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a serious library of pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I definitely do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the hemp side is one thing,
but in the THC realm, in that realm,
[SPEAKER_03]: I pretty much specifically just collect
pollen and then apply it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do too much open pollination in
that realm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like storing pollen, keeping it
around for those future endeavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So primarily with that, I'm storing it in
a jar, put it in a silica packet to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to absorb any moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then typically what we're doing is
we're back flushing with some nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_03]: getting all the oxygen out of there,
the general atmosphere out of there,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then get it in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just store it long term in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The real thing, the real danger that you
have storing in the freezer is a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people will pull it out of the freezer and
pop it open and it's cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's humidity in the air and that
moisture in the air condenses on the cold
[SPEAKER_03]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So biggest thing, probably biggest tip I
can give is if you're freezing it like
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you want to get it out, let it get
to room temperature before you even open
[SPEAKER_03]: it up and start messing with it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I store it in plastic and not glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The static can be an issue with plastic at
times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had some trying to get pollen out of
plastic where I just have a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: left and it's just stuck to the side of
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scrape it off and it sticks to the other
side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, you know, pulling my hair
out, stuffing buds into a plastic vial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do males express, do we have a
question, do males express differently in
[SPEAKER_01]: the presence of females?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say we're still talking about
plants here or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, what's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say I've noticed it, you know,
but I've never been looking, I guess.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Odie?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never noticed a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although when you do have a male around
females seem to produce more resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's just for trying to
catch more pollen or what, but I've never
[SPEAKER_00]: really noticed that a male looking
different because, you know, it's good to
[SPEAKER_00]: run your males full term before you
introduce them to anything so you can make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that it's got the structures that
you're wanting to pass along.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've never noticed them really to look
different than being in a room with a room
[SPEAKER_00]: full of females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I've seen females definitely
grow more vigorously around males and
[SPEAKER_01]: males, you know, I feel like they,
I don't know that they express themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: differently, especially if you're talking
about turpene or structure or anything
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have to start paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, something we need to check out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was also a question about
separating males and females collecting
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen and then applying rather than
introducing the male and female or donor
[SPEAKER_01]: receiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can do both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like having the plants side by side
is more effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pollen is magnetic and it will go from
the male to female, direct pollination
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're applying pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's some breeders that are
super successful like Canorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin's Crescent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think he does a lot of collecting
pollen and applying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer having redundancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like both where you actually have
your male and female.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you need the pollen,
you have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just so many different ways to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no right or wrong way in that
sense if you're getting seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say, you know, it does seem that
when you have a male in the room with it
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're letting it fly, direct it off
the mail that you get a better set.
[SPEAKER_03]: Applying pollen, you know, until the
airbrush thing came along, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: applying pollen really...
[SPEAKER_03]: Next thing you know, you're like,
you know, you put enough pollen for the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole room on one bud trying to reapply
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can just let it fly natural,
you're going to have a better set.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I remember people back in the day
taking like mason jars of pollen and a fan
[SPEAKER_01]: and dusting behind the fan where it was
blowing the whole room full of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the most effective way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to take our fingers, me and my
partner Luke, we'd take our fingers and
[SPEAKER_01]: dip it in the little pollen jar,
brush it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we had multiple types of
pollen, we'd lick our fingers between the
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen and dry them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old school hippie style.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that works, but it's not as effective
for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the good old fashioned paintbrush
flick, you know, it's still fairly
[SPEAKER_03]: effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you'll see guys actually
painting it on with the paintbrush,
[SPEAKER_03]: not realizing they're getting resin glands
all over the paintbrush.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to flick it, you know,
kind of flick the paintbrush and that
[SPEAKER_03]: method still works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess another great question,
how many seeds do you get per plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think that's just it varies so
much on the size of the female plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, calyxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timing is huge on that one just due to the
fact of if you do it too early,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't get that many seeds and if you
do it too late, they're all deformed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's hitting that pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: The window is important, getting it in,
you know, and everybody has a different
[SPEAKER_01]: take on that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you pollinate on week three and a
half, week four, week four and a half,
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere in there works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pollinate later, but the thing is,
is your plants, the later you go,
[SPEAKER_01]: the later you have to go to finish all the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but yeah, I mean, it's a tough thing
averaging, you know, indoors I've averaged
[SPEAKER_01]: 2,000 to 3,000 seeds per plant on a good
pollination and on a bad one, I've gotten,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, mix and match 500 per plant and
auto flowers, 2,000 per plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great number.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're hitting 2,000 seeds per plant on
auto flower, you're doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Auto flowers typically are smaller,
but you know, those kinds of numbers are
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if you have 500 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it's a lot easier to
quantify it on like a per square foot
[SPEAKER_03]: basis, a canopy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because again, how do you know the size?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, plants can be, take up three
square feet, they could take up 60 square
[SPEAKER_03]: feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you got nine Skittles plants per
square foot and Skittles is definitely one
[SPEAKER_01]: of my favorite plants and it's not for the
structure, it's for the terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I think we can kind of touch on that
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on Skittles,
Tim?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you grow a lot of Skittles and
you grow some amazing Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, it's a bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's literally one of the hardest plants
to really get to do what you want it to
[SPEAKER_03]: do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just finicky, you know, too, doesn't want
too much water, doesn't want too much
[SPEAKER_03]: food.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took us probably five or six rounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: before we really kind of got it down to a
point where we could run it, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: in a production environment and have it be
worth our time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I feel like it's just the evolution
of OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, OG Kush for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like Girl Scout Cookies was the
same finicky bullshit and now we have
[SPEAKER_01]: Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, the Skittles work isn't
done though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like Skittles will evolve into
something that has, I mean, it already has
[SPEAKER_01]: evolved into many, many cool things like
the Crème Rosé Skittles that you made,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like rosewater candy with hopefully
better structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that needs to be pheno hunted a
little more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, unfortunately with those ones,
the ones that had the best turf profiles,
[SPEAKER_03]: again, just started the structure just
degraded, got worse and worse,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the turps got better and better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And next thing you know, I was back at a
Skittles structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I stayed there because the turps were
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a rough thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you love turps, you got to
prioritize turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like, you know, that's kind of
what happened in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Years ago, why OG Kush got messed up was
because they were going for more of the
[SPEAKER_01]: structure on the OG Kush and they ended up
with something that was like a white widow
[SPEAKER_01]: OG Kush that didn't have any gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and OG is all about that gassy turf
profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you get the pie and the lemon
and the gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to have that chemi gas,
you know, what evolved from like we saw it
[SPEAKER_01]: in 91 with like chem dogs starting in the
earlier 90s, that pungency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the Europeans have kind of got
back on track for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all of them, but a lot of them,
especially with the gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're seeing gas over in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was over there earlier this year,
there was a lot of gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Ray, Ray works with a lot of
fruit forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he was doing dessert strains before
they're even called dessert strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has one of my favorite, Dr. Who Fino's,
it's called the grape high chew.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to talk about that at all,
Ray?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just really fruity, we get a lot of grape
that comes through on that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruits are my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think every breeder has more of their
own thing and palette that they like to
[SPEAKER_00]: use, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for us, it was more fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: My kids like dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, we have the sweet Irish
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, with the fruits, they're nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to get straighter from,
but we've been working on them for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grape high chew is just a specific cut
that we found really in the first seed pop
[SPEAKER_00]: we did of the strain when we made the
cross so many years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's so many different Fino's of
the Dr. Who and I know you made a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds when you guys made them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to talk about the lineage from
that and you know, kind of how you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: piece that one together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Who is mad scientist, which mad
scientist is medicine woman by sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: tooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicine woman was created by a gentleman
in Oregon, Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a let me think here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm drawing a blank right at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been kind of a long day and I just
smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dynamite dynamite by D 13 hash
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynamite is a great fruit, Fino.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so that to sweet tooth came out
with our mad scientist, which is kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: fruity funky that we did well with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won two cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Oregon at the OMC is with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we hit that with our time wreck
mail that when we were testers for TGA in
[SPEAKER_00]: the very, very beginning of it all time
wreck was one of the new strains that
[SPEAKER_00]: dioxide had created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were fortunate enough to be one of
the testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found a male that we really liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, it'd be okay to go ahead and read
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started reading with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we, the name wise just kind
of work a mad scientist in a time wreck,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the, the, the Fino's turned out
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did like 30 something 40 something
females, the first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every one of them was like super
fruity to rotten fruit to rotten fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those rotten ones are awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, geek farms, they found one that
really goes back to the hash plant
[SPEAKER_00]: lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a funkier taste to it than
fruity, but it's really, really stony.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you know, it was just as all
crosses more and more novelties than
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them do good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that one doesn't really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's done really good for several
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, it's been around a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been crushing the norcal scene for
quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, it does well wherever,
wherever, wherever it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've reached a point now to where we've
had an unfortunate, had a bad winter and
[SPEAKER_00]: lost all of our males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dr. Who and Quantum Kush and all those
will no longer be made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you make them feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, you got my attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm enjoying up there working on all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm waiting to see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it's interesting and I
can completely see the future of this on
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial large scale levels going to be
feminized autofem seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, autofem, regular fam, full term,
doing these hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did semi-autofem seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that has a huge potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's all these different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, it's like, I can't wait for the
next five years to see what people are
[SPEAKER_01]: crushing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like another thing with
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're breeding feminized,
when you're doing selections, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: selfing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't always self, but you can self.
[SPEAKER_01]: Selfing is the most ideal way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're getting rid of 50% of the
allele.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're working with half the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you're making something that's more
stable, meaning less phenotypical
[SPEAKER_01]: variation, you can achieve that a lot
faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the only thing we need to do is
actually learn how to tissue culture
[SPEAKER_01]: autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a comment for someone who's
watching, hopefully, from DSG Labs,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of my and Joseph's good friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to work on that ASAP so we can get
the tissue culture autos going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's going to be a game
changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: For production, for making stable lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because right now, with autos,
you can't keep an auto around for more
[SPEAKER_01]: than one term.
[SPEAKER_01]: It finishes, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The future is to be able to breed with one
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're basically selfing it on itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way to achieve that would be
through tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's any tissue culture people
watching, there's a lot of big money that
[SPEAKER_01]: would be paid for being able to tissue
culture an autoflower plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jay, from Finest, he died around this
time last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Him and I were in talks of trying to
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He thought he had a solution for it,
and then ended up dying like four days
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did he tell you what it was?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he actually did.
[SPEAKER_01]: He told me that it actually needed to go
into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said the carbohydrate, you had to have
the BRICS levels, the carbohydrate in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant at a certain point before you
started to do the tissue culture
autoflower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so he talked about this idea of like
re-vegging in tissue culture.
I find it super interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: A Canadian group came out and actually did
exactly this in photoperiod flowers,
[SPEAKER_06]: in photoperiod plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where they took plants made from the
flower and basically re-insuced those
[SPEAKER_06]: floral tissues back to get vegetative
growth in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the ground was then laid to like re-veg
a flower plant in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: People just needed to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, with all the accelerated
breeding we're doing, I mean, it's
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these companies like EnerGene and
guys like Eric Mather, who are doing these
[SPEAKER_01]: advanced breeding, they're finding markers
and then using those markers to breed
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're able to breed with a small
plant rather than having to grow the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants big.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely part of the future,
not only patenting genetics, but just
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at the end of the day,
what we really want to be doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're so hyped up on these F1s,
the future is creating stable lines and
[SPEAKER_01]: then making your own F1s from your own
stable lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what all the big companies are
going to be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be creating IP and that
IP is created from making your own stable
[SPEAKER_01]: lines with your own genetics and taking
those to whatever it is, whether it's an
[SPEAKER_01]: F7 or an F9, and then adding heterosis
within heterosis is hybrid bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you take two stable lines that don't
have heterosis because they've been inbred
[SPEAKER_01]: and inbreeding actually makes the plant
weaker and more susceptible to problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take those stable lines, you breed
them together to create your own F1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way of the future, in my
opinion, and that's kind of what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: working on a small scale compared to some
of these big companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what I'm working on with a
couple companies and Marlon Asher and I
[SPEAKER_01]: are working on some stuff in St. Vincent
and Trinidad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to get rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about to launch a seed company in
Spain before the whole COVID thing hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Tim and I are working on some
seed stuff, hopefully that he's knocking
[SPEAKER_01]: out and we got some big news coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't break it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, we're not going to break it now on
the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to happen before we break the big
news.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll break it on your show.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, but it's going to be big.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be so we got some game
changing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, my book's coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these guys are pretty much in my book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got some really cool stuff,
not only about feminized seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just about breeding in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Tim's Mr. Mr. Mr. Wizard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some of his cool ideas in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I want to hear you had mentioned
kind of Odie being kind of about fruit
[SPEAKER_02]: forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want I want someone else first to talk
about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Tim, what do you think James is
about or Odie or Shord?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, tell me in your mind, like,
what's James all about?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're hunting finos right now of
James's stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think every single pretty much every
single cultivar had the word gas in it,
[SPEAKER_03]: the name actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gas is what got me in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cat piss first and then cat piss
disappeared.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been smoking since 91 and we had
cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem dog was chem dog and sour diesel were
like game changing strains for me because
[SPEAKER_01]: you could smoke them down to the roach and
they still tasted amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to this day, it's totally stuck
with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love I love gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's now we're at a point where you
can't just be gas because there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking million OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's got to be something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to have gas with fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm all about complexity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you know me, you know, I'm a chef as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've owned restaurants and been in the
culinary industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all about layers of complexity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think those things are important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And gas is almost an essential layer for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give me on on the food side with your
food analogy, a food that you like that
[SPEAKER_02]: that you like to cook that has lots of
layers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are those layers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Food that I like to cook with lots of
layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, you can do that with
anything because food, you actually layer
[SPEAKER_01]: the dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're if you're making a plate,
you have seven components.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to layer texture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to layer flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have complementary flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you want each one of the flavor
flavors to stand out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked at Chez Panisse years ago and
it's very rustic style and they use a
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral amount of ingredients,
but the best ingredients you can get in
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen ingredients as close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, maybe some of the places around the
area in the Bay Area have better plating,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you will not find fresher ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they do is they layer the
flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they're using a couple of different
herbs, you taste all those herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just in there to enhance the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not 50 ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like my layers to be subtle sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like sometimes stuff to be bold.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm more leaning towards the
subtleties, whether it's in alcohol,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's in I don't smoke tobacco
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even tobacco, I like the subtleties
with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think all these guys are tobacco except
for Joseph.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think Joseph smokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But oh, yeah, you were talking about one
one type of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can you can do that with pasta.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do that with pizza.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love sushi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sushi is like one of my favorite things in
the world to eat and also to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for noodle soup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge in the Vietnamese and even burritos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you want to.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The broth for like a good pho broth has a
ton of complexity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's what you want is that
complexity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, ramen is an example of
something that has like a creaminess where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not adding dairy to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love those kind of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has a thickness in a mouth feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things are important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also with cannabis, you know,
I think that the new wave is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: creaminess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people have talked about fruit
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a big thing with like the
sherbets and then even going blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: muffin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another great one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all these hitters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then moving forward, I feel like the
new thing is like cream, the creaminess of
[SPEAKER_01]: the smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so who wants to analyze short?
[SPEAKER_01]: So short likes yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: He likes quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: He likes trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Short is not the biggest smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've smoked with him at least two
times in the last three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, he's not the biggest smoker,
but he knows cannabis more than anybody I
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the greenhouse facilities that
he's run and just watching him analyze
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and people.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a you know, he's a macro guy,
but also he's able to spot out the micro
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think my guess would be he likes all
cannabis plants that produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he can be dispassionate when it comes
to like flavor and smell and taste,
[SPEAKER_02]: because he's focused on other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say that he's like a gas or a
fruit forward or a Dutch strain guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He likes turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: He likes he knows turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can identify plant problems before
their problems, which is an amazing art
[SPEAKER_01]: and teach other people to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's, you know, as far as also
picking out breeders and what's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a good breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like he has a knack for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's done it a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the scale that he's worked at and been
able to work at has given him the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to pick up other things that a
lot of people don't have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Sjoerd, what do you look for in a
breeder or someone you want to work with?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, most of the breeders that
we're kind of working with now have a wide
[SPEAKER_04]: range.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Ray loves, you know, kind of fruits,
a rotten fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've grown a lot of raised seeds out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can grow them in a field and be really
happy with the results.
[SPEAKER_04]: But within each population, there's enough
differences, slight differences to really
[SPEAKER_04]: be able to choose something really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Karma genetics is all about the sour
diesels and the gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really encompassing the widest
range possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to answer the question about what I
like, I like grease.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we used to make a lot of
hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know the resin glands have to have a
certain consistency to make good hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I really like that grease that just
drips.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when the day gets hot,
those trichomes are leaking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of reminiscent from the
old Afghani strains and that kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: kerosene, caramel, chocolate.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really what I look for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how about Tim?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me about Tim.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want someone else to tell us about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll tell you a little about Tim.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's worked in California and he's worked
down in South America.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as what he likes, he likes stuff
that gets you ripped.
[SPEAKER_01]: He likes terpy, terpy, terpy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's a sun grown sort of guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He likes that greenhouse turf profile over
that indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like he's on the hot modern strains,
but also using the old school stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: alongside it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like he likes gas too a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He likes fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He likes that pungent, skunky smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a big proponent of wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that they do some wedding cake
crosses that are amazing up there and
[SPEAKER_01]: gelatos.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of us are huge gelato fans too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, gelato, Pluto.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Pluto.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pluto is a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real Pluto.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only one I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you pretty much nailed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got a question about breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember how Oakland Indico was similar to
OG Chem if I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had Oakland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the Indico from Oakland that
was gassy and it probably did have some
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of, it wasn't, oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Oakland had this back in the day,
and this is in the 90s that I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably lived 94, 95, which is forever
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's almost 30 years ago, which is
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had this Indico and it was,
it had a pungency to it, but I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: say that it was Chem or OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that the one I'm thinking of
is definitely more of like on the skunky,
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghan, like acrid, pungent stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of that stuff going
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to go down this to, not to Santa
Barbara, but to Santa Cruz and get this
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found out it was skunk number one years
later, but it was actually, we called it
[SPEAKER_01]: the strawberry because it was all those
strawberry sized nuggets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They called it strawberry, $60 an egg,
straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to buy an ounce, it's $60 an egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going back to those prices too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions for us, Peter?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we got to wrap it up pretty
shortly here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, just for me, kind of what's a,
like, I know you guys have big libraries
[SPEAKER_02]: and access to stuff, but what's like a cut
you've recently gotten from someone else
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're having fun playing with right
now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got creme rosé skittles from Tim.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what did I, I got something from short
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just got some stuff from Odie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the, I can't remember what I got
from Odie, but I'm actually not allowed to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about what I got from Odie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with the other stuff, like what are
you psyched to explore with them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with Tim's creme rosé skittles,
I just, what I get excited about is when I
[SPEAKER_01]: find something novel and that seems to be
pretty rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people, you know,
there's a million gelatos out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's literally, there's a whole bunch
of gelatos that are the same fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a million, you know, we see these
different ruts cuts and gelato cuts and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's, there's all these similarities.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I like is finding something that's
absolutely novel that I've never tried
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It usually blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that creme rosé skittles from Tim,
creme rosé is a strain from a fishinata
[SPEAKER_01]: from Leo.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And put with the skittles, you get this,
this candy flavor from the skittles,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it's complimentary with the,
with the rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually rose water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hadn't tasted rose water,
like actual rose water in cannabis ever
[SPEAKER_01]: before in my life until I tasted that
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tasted rose, like rose petal,
but not that intense, like rose oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you smoke the joint down and you're
at the end of the joint and you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck, it still tastes like rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good one, Tim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we need, now we need to get the
structure better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got, I got a bunch of those beans.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to just sort through them and find
a winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some of those we popped,
so we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just quickly going down the line,
Tim, what's something you've got your
[SPEAKER_02]: hands on recently that you're having fun
with?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you want to do with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's a good, um, question to
be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, we, uh, we're hunting a bunch of
James's phenos right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just getting into them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, besides those, you know, we a while
back closed our doors to new genetics
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's just sketchy out there with
all the viruses going around with
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that that's able to come in on
these.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we, you know, we have a huge library.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just kind of working through our
own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, at the moment we are doing a pretty
significant hunt right now, a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: James's stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know we're going to find some real
winners in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, I can't say I have anything
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we got some, some Pluto kind of
bag seeds that we're going to see,
[SPEAKER_03]: see what comes of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, yeah, I'm just excited to see
what pops out of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I could, I could probably answer
you better in about two months,
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly what I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm kind of in the same boat
really having brought in much very new
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of digging through some old stuff
that hasn't been played with that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I find it more interesting than a lot
of the newer stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's something, what's something from
the archives that you're going back to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so at one point in time heroes of the
farm and I did some collabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think I'm going to dive back into a
few of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a, a blood wreck back cross that
we did that I'm going to dive into right
[SPEAKER_00]: at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a lot of back, back crossing
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as I said, we lost our males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of in the middle of looking
for what we're going to work with next and
[SPEAKER_00]: figured back crossing our main mothers
back out would be a good start where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're a little bit more true as we go
forward and work with them more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, but you know, we did some smaller
batch seeds here recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: That some really nice stuff came out of,
we did a lemon G by Dr. Who.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, those turned out fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, so just some of that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Joe, I can't talk about any of that
actually right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Joe, that was short and sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but I can't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, shored because you have a big
library, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've consolidated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, when, when we do, um, female
hunts, we usually run them three times
[SPEAKER_04]: from clone and usually end up on about
0.3%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but really looking for primary
flavors, you know, everything washes out
[SPEAKER_04]: so quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So getting back to real primary flavors,
um, to work with, we're running a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: sour diesel BX threes right now for
breeding and seeing from karma genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: and seeing how they, um, cross with other
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so far it's, uh, you get a really
nice range from sour like the guava gelato
[SPEAKER_04]: with the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a really nice range.
[SPEAKER_04]: The complexity throughout.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so the sour stuff is really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, but the base thing is to really,
how do you get back to basic flavor
[SPEAKER_04]: profiles without ending up with 1985 swag?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that's kind of the challenge at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I, James, you got a wrap,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause everybody has to go, uh,
yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, thank you, James.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to the, uh, everybody else on the call
and the 150 people still tuned in,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, we appreciate it and, uh, we'll see
you actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so basically tomorrow we're doing
something on IPM tomorrow night.
[SPEAKER_02]: We may do something with, uh, Josh
Rutherford, uh, Nick Reisden and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, Kevin Jodry and then Sunday with
Clackamas Coots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but anyway, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, James, you got a lot of beans in
front of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want you, I want you to send me some so
I can, uh, film like popping them and
[SPEAKER_02]: growing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots, lots of beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm going to kill the live stream.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys see you later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Okay.
