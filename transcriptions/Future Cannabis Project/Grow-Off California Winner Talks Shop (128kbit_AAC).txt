[SPEAKER_01]: You won the SoCal Grow Off last year,
and where did the genetics come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was from Dark Heart Nursery.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was the Grapefruit Romulan,
and then that was the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you didn't know it at the time?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everybody had their ideas,
but we were way off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how many clones do you get?
[SPEAKER_02]: We get two.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was funny because when we got there,
we didn't have the money order.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to find the money order, we went on a
mission walking for blocks to find a
[SPEAKER_02]: place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the time we got there, it was funny
because I'd saw Heavy T or Tyler at the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just before we started doing
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was always fun for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that whole contest was really for
me to see what I could do against him in
[SPEAKER_02]: my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a fun little aspect to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just seeing him pop up randomly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get two clones and you bring them back
and not knowing what it is, how does that
[SPEAKER_01]: affect you in terms of a grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like being a chef, I would
consider it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to cook and I think that a lot of
good chefs out there, you can give them a
[SPEAKER_02]: different stove top.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can give them a different pan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they know enough to where looking at
how it's searing, looking at how it's
[SPEAKER_02]: cooking, they already know when it's close
to done just by feeling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, part of being a good grower is
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So over the years, it's knowing little
things like that, is knowing the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: structure as it grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew immediately it wasn't a very
stretchy plant, we'll call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was definitely a long veg, but in that
long veg, I think with different varieties
[SPEAKER_02]: of strains, they would grow a lot more
lankier in that time period, which was a
[SPEAKER_02]: nice thing that it stayed so squat because
for me at the beginning, I thought the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole contest was based on who can grow
the best biggest plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, it was just, I think
everybody's mindset in, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: since 2010 yield, everybody, it was a big
thing to hit two pounds a light and then
[SPEAKER_02]: people were hitting three pounds a light
and it was a big thing for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, it was like, okay, I started
out growing big plants originally because
[SPEAKER_02]: when I would have a personal grow,
to be perfectly legal, it was six plants
[SPEAKER_02]: in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, okay, well, six plants,
one plant per light, I got six lights,
[SPEAKER_02]: here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people are thinking, oh, I'll put six
plants under one light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it became, okay, so we're able to
grow and for me, everybody learns from
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna say the guy's name because
he was a real, I call him Old Man Hickory,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he was a family dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would have never thought this guy grew
pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember walking into his garden for
the first time and it felt like a scene
[SPEAKER_02]: out of Jurassic Park.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been growing for a long point to that
time and to see somebody growing these
[SPEAKER_02]: monster plants that were just kind of
trellised out and just these huge colas,
[SPEAKER_02]: it blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think when I saw that, I was like,
oh, this makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started to grow any genetic one
plant per light and just knowing the veg
[SPEAKER_02]: time of them and how to manipulate the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just needed to fill that four by four
square under that thousand watt and we
[SPEAKER_02]: knew that we were gonna get at least a
pound and a half to two plus pounds off
[SPEAKER_02]: this one plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And between two people, we could have 12
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was kind of a loophole for us in a
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people, like for me, sometimes people
smoke, I think chain smoke cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that I chain smoke, but I love to
smoke just the act of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I'm medicating, I think that unless
I grew enough, it wouldn't have been worth
[SPEAKER_02]: it to me to just grow one light and six
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: After seeing this, it just blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I saw the contest, I was like,
okay, I've been doing this forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is gonna be easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that everybody was so focused
on the quality and the potency and these
[SPEAKER_02]: other aspects when it came down to the
results, because we yielded so much more
[SPEAKER_02]: than even the second place competitor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think maybe they got a half a pound and
we got almost four pounds off this one
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, which it was cool to see the
Colorado contest kind of step it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw even before this contest,
a lot of people were really focusing on
[SPEAKER_02]: getting these huge yields off one plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's really cool that for me,
most people have always said, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't grow a big plant because it wouldn't
be as potent as a plant that's smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's philosophies where people
would say, well, growing a smaller,
[SPEAKER_02]: more compact plant takes that plant's
energy and puts all of this into one
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller bud, meaning it may be more
potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that we stretched it right to
the deadline when we turned it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think even the product we turned in was,
it was unflushed because it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it still needed at least about
another seven to 10 days before we pulled
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because of the deadline with Essie
Labs and the laws, everybody's hands were
[SPEAKER_02]: tied, we had to do it by the 31st.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, still being able to get third place in
potency and fourth place in the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was huge to me because I know we didn't
finish the plant how we wanted to,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the yield was just, what, over three
pounds over even second place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, that to me spoke a lot because
you got situations like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I talk with people that are in Michigan
and having a large, full, mature plant
[SPEAKER_02]: count stipulation where you don't see that
the same in other states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, being able to grow larger plants is
a huge advantage for people like that
[SPEAKER_02]: because then you're actually increasing
the amount they're able to produce as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it was a cool way to,
I guess, showcase something that I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: doing for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I've been the guy that
worked behind the counter in the hydro
[SPEAKER_02]: store and you're always giving people
advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was always that crazy guy that would
grow one plant per light and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'd be like, no, show them a picture of
it, Jerome, show them a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would show people pictures and
they'd just blow their mind that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think a lot of,
you know, what people don't believe is
[SPEAKER_02]: possible is because they've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the more this competition
actually grows, they're going to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to actually bring people in there with
cameras and really go into detail about
[SPEAKER_02]: their growing practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's be honest, some people aren't
going to give away all their secrets.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for me growing at least cannabis
has always been about for what I could do
[SPEAKER_02]: for my sister who passed away from cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, at the time we had to spend
centuries, but it wasn't tested and it
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't as strict.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you knew that there was harsh
chemicals and there was things that we
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't even know to this day that were
happening that we could have prevented for
[SPEAKER_02]: people to get the cleanest medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me to do that was to grow it for
her.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she wasn't a smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, so you know exactly what's in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's the peace of mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not many people get that experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get something we'll call it stepped
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never have the opportunity to get
quality medicine right from the grower
[SPEAKER_02]: themself right to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very rare for people to have that
experience because even in today's date,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have a product that's being produced
at a legal, you know, clean facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that product's then being sent for
testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the time it's packaged,
it's been touched and moved so many times
[SPEAKER_02]: that you lose kind of, to me, that visual
aspect of quality that you get when you
[SPEAKER_02]: actually get it right from the source.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like anything that's fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a slight and subtle difference
that only the people that would know will
[SPEAKER_02]: know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the thing that people need to
be educated about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, to grow clean cannabis,
you know, I've always wanted to do as
[SPEAKER_02]: clean as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it always didn't make sense to,
well, we have an indoor grow, but we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to take outdoor elements like cocoa
or soil and bring them indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, that wasn't necessarily the most
sterile thing that I could do.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as a common sense factor,
to me, is I wouldn't take something that
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily is, for instance, Coca-Cola.
[SPEAKER_02]: They let it sit outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets heated.
[SPEAKER_02]: They turn it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's shipped around.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are things that are not necessarily
isolated to know that that was probably in
[SPEAKER_02]: a processing facility where they have rats
running around the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, Rockwool, because it's spun at
such a high heat level, I think they say
[SPEAKER_02]: it's at 700-some-odd degrees, you have a
very sterile substrate, to me,
[SPEAKER_02]: that comes from an organic source being
it's spun rock, come down into like a
[SPEAKER_02]: cotton candy kind of substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that your preferred grow medium?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so, just because of the sterility
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we factor in ecological and
environmental factors?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, with that, there's a
lot of water consumption savings in
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit to that because you're able to
necessarily not use the abundance of water
[SPEAKER_02]: you would have in deep water culture,
undercurrent systems, where they use an
[SPEAKER_02]: ample amount of water, and at the end of
the cycle, or for that reservoir change,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have excess water that you're dumping
down the drain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people hear drain-to-waste systems
or feeding systems that waste water
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's actual runoff coming out
of the bottom of the pot, you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: really think about how much water it took
to saturate those plants, how much water
[SPEAKER_02]: you're actually wasting, versus,
you know, people use, what, 40 to 50
[SPEAKER_02]: gallons of gallon reservoirs per
four-by-eight table in old school days
[SPEAKER_02]: doing these flood and drain systems,
when to me that doesn't seem logical
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're topping that off through
the week, and then they're just dumping it
[SPEAKER_02]: down the drain, and that's a lot of wasted
water and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, depending on how that's set
up, different states have laws and
[SPEAKER_02]: stipulations about the chemicals that can
go down the drain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them have different type of
systems that collect this runoff waste so
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not contaminating where we're dumping
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, I believe, and I could be
wrong, I believe California doesn't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: law on this, so we kind of just dump it
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the ocean is where a lot of this
goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're ultimately all trying to
do the right thing, you know, at least you
[SPEAKER_02]: could always just hope that people are.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the end of the day, you know,
we want to have this plant broken down and
[SPEAKER_02]: isolated into ways that we can actually
save people's lives and use it for a
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit, you know, and I think that
realistically I would love to see cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: get to the point where you pay for your
health insurance, you pay a five to ten
[SPEAKER_02]: dollar copay for expensive medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If people didn't have to spend,
let's say, two, three, four, five hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: plus dollars a week on their medication
going to a dispensary and paying these
[SPEAKER_02]: taxes, you know, and it was worked out
that way, I think everybody would benefit
[SPEAKER_02]: from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for me, I've always been the
person that knows how to do it in my head,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least the right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's kind of cool to be
able to answer people's questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've always worked, you know,
whether it's doing the podcasts and things
[SPEAKER_02]: and speaking at different events.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I almost wish I never had to
work for anybody in particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost fun to just consult with
different people, because as much as
[SPEAKER_02]: they're learning from me, I'm learning
from different situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you kind of talk about your own
evolution and things you've experimented
[SPEAKER_01]: with?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing kind of SoCal Indoor,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that kind of your main?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know if it's SoCal Indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I base everything on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's all about common sense for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me to optimize anything as far as
plant growth, you don't have to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: scientist to realize the faster you can
get a plant to go through the water and
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients that are in the media itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: More rapidly, the plant's going to grow
just as fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the thing is, is it's always been a
being able to grasp whatever system it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest thing, well, minus like
obviously deep water culture in true
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroponic cell systems where the roots
are suspended in water, where you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: play the saturation game, whether it's in
soil or cocoa or rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're always looking at the drying
time period and the wilting points of this
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and not letting those roots dry out
too much to create a lockout.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's good and bad stresses that you
can give to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, common sense is obviously get
them to drink as fast as possible,
[SPEAKER_02]: have the most root mass as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning for me, you know, you look at the
different types of potting containers,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's a smart pot or an air pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole philosophy for that is a root
printing pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the science is, is when the root tip
makes contact with the air, it causes that
[SPEAKER_02]: to necessarily die off at that point and
stop growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also creates supplementary root
systems that branch out causing a much
[SPEAKER_02]: denser root system where you don't have
the spiraling of the roots choking the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant out at a certain point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you can extend the
longevity of the plant's life in a smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: container, which with irrigation,
you know, you can obviously cut down on
[SPEAKER_02]: the amount of transplanting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a huge part of,
you know, people using rock wall blocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you transplant them from the clone
stage, they're in the same container until
[SPEAKER_02]: the time they die, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's not that stress of going
into a different environment for the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and there's a lot of benefits to
that, you know, as far as the cleanliness
[SPEAKER_02]: to me and being able to clean a room after
and the different types of cleaning
[SPEAKER_02]: methods that go into a soil or cocoa room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a lot of different problems with
drains clogging up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biofilm and sludge accumulating with a lot
of different organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not saying I'm against organics,
but, you know, there's benefits to it and
[SPEAKER_02]: a true sense of nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're collecting data and you're able
to take a plant and take that plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: actually plant it, let's say every square
inch of the entire earth and collect the
[SPEAKER_02]: data, don't return, let it do its own
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to see where this plant
thrived the most, collect the data there
[SPEAKER_02]: and try to recreate that in an indoor
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, plants will be able to
create their own food, whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental or it's the plants
themselves being able to break down the
[SPEAKER_02]: foliage or whatever type of forms of
compost that are there naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's occurring there in the soil is
meeting those beneficial microorganisms
[SPEAKER_02]: that we create teas and additives to try
and simulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of them are actually beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you take those that are in nature and
you try and create a tea to brew those
[SPEAKER_02]: specific species of fungi and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, all these things are just basically
chelating nutrients to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe in it in any type of
environment, whether it's hydroponic or
[SPEAKER_02]: not.
[SPEAKER_02]: A plant having its own sugar production,
you know, from its roots, we have
[SPEAKER_02]: cellulase that needs to be broken down by
cellulose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, or I'm sorry, cellulose that's broken
down by cellulase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the plant creating its own
sugars to feed those beneficial organisms
[SPEAKER_02]: with its own form of carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have different types of additives we
can add to feed these, which help them
[SPEAKER_02]: colonize at a much faster rate,
assuming that the higher colonization
[SPEAKER_02]: rates of these microorganisms were able to
benefit the plant by feeding it faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my way of saying, imagine having a
milkshake that's really hard to suck up
[SPEAKER_02]: the nutrients with a straw and then giving
your plant a bigger straw.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, in turn, you're optimizing
all the other elements, whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature, humidity, lighting,
and all these things go into the benefit
[SPEAKER_02]: of the rapid growth that you see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, that's why when people are
so stuck in one way, it's a terrible thing
[SPEAKER_02]: to see because I think I can get better
every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, is if you aren't that
person searching out these different
[SPEAKER_02]: aspects, like for me, seven, eight years
ago, telling people about LED technology
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're just kind of like rolling
their eyes, I've been using that
[SPEAKER_02]: technology for years, especially in like a
vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always a difficult thing finding
the right way to do it in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never had the success that we have
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as people are switching over to LED,
we see the benefits with that with
[SPEAKER_02]: electrical consumption, we see substantial
benefits for different, for instance,
[SPEAKER_02]: like we have DWP here in LA and Southern
California Edison, and different states
[SPEAKER_02]: have their different power sources,
but they're creating different rebate
[SPEAKER_02]: programs that if we're consuming so much
energy with a thousand watt amp,
[SPEAKER_02]: or a thousand watt ballast, and we design
that for HIDs and switching LEDs,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're giving these people huge benefits
as far as rebates to pay for these lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's helping the owners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we get into people that have been
doing this for years that were brands that
[SPEAKER_02]: have been struggling to stay afloat with
all the loopholes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for instance, different cities have
stipulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see all the time where they're asking
these 20 light rooms all of a sudden to
[SPEAKER_02]: shut down because they don't have a CO2
monitor that can only be installed by the
[SPEAKER_02]: contractors from the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's $28,000 per room.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you tell somebody that's already
struggling at that point to come up with
[SPEAKER_02]: this money?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a sad thing to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, it's going to evolve
to a point where I'd like to see all these
[SPEAKER_02]: companies survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, unless that
company is putting the money into the
[SPEAKER_02]: technology to research exactly what we
need in the plant, we need to figure that
[SPEAKER_02]: out because now we're just now integrating
lighting systems with infrared and
[SPEAKER_02]: ultraviolet light, which to me was a no
brainer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, if we get to the last
couple of weeks of a cycle, we were
[SPEAKER_02]: putting in 10,000 KUV bulbs and getting
this spike.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, it's like plants naturally have
defense mechanisms and people know as
[SPEAKER_02]: resin to be one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And different resins, for instance,
like especially a lot of people that grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's certain strains that I just have a
negative reaction to around like I get
[SPEAKER_02]: itchy or my skin gets red or irritated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can only accommodate that to
what's in the plant naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as they have these resin glands,
we have to think not only do they get us
[SPEAKER_02]: high or medicate us, but they deter things
that they would sustain in nature where
[SPEAKER_02]: they originated from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, we get burned, our skin from
ultraviolet light.
[SPEAKER_02]: A plant creates more resin content towards
the end of its cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when it's developing the resin
when finishing by creating its own
[SPEAKER_02]: sunscreen, protecting itself from
ultraviolet light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a no brainer to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the further we actually bring
in real gardening practices, a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people always call them strawberries or
tomatoes walking into a hydroponics store
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to get advice from somebody that
was growing in their closet or whatever it
[SPEAKER_02]: may be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether it's a Dosatron system,
which is what from car wash industry and
[SPEAKER_02]: agricultural industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're just like, oh, this is the next
greatest thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is things that have been around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's the big gold rush for
a lot of companies to create the next
[SPEAKER_02]: gimmick.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all these things have already been
implemented into large systems already,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether from greenhouse or large scale
farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we're going to we're going
to see, I would at least hope all the hype
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of stop at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then was so you mentioned LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're growing with LEDs and you've
grown with them for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you said you're flowering with them,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or right now we're converting a lot of
them to the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been doing a lot of experiments with
a company called Progrotech, and they've
[SPEAKER_02]: been doing custom lighting for us that
we're going to basically take to a
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll speak a little bit, but we'll be
developing the second research facility at
[SPEAKER_02]: the University of Gainesville,
Florida, to to research cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're federally licensed research
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where is the first one's in
Mississippi?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will be literally this will be a
little bit high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's going to be a lot different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we put a lot of thought in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, for me to to meet some of
the scientists that are involved with it,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually, it was just past M.J.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biscon, I actually was introduced to some
of the people involved with a company
[SPEAKER_02]: called Medicinal Genomics.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I sat down in a meeting with
Brian McKernan and a few other guys there
[SPEAKER_02]: from the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was almost a match made in heaven,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know till about 12 hours later
when I called back for another meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really cool to be a part of
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's it's really a dream of mine
because for me, I've always wanted to be
[SPEAKER_02]: the best at whatever I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I love golf.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's you know, I always tell my nieces,
it's like, look, if you don't like sports,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you want to get involved in something,
golf's a great thing because if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: good at it and get paid to take a vacation
and get paid every week and it's you
[SPEAKER_02]: against the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's you and everything that you do,
you can't take away from you that you
[SPEAKER_02]: accomplish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, being able to grow a
superior product or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: something that makes somebody feel better,
even if you don't hear it, that's a great
[SPEAKER_02]: feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say for the grow off specifically,
kind of what was your setup?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems like LED lights and like what
like are you using BIOS?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we used an LED.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me explain the process for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started out the first half of flowering,
meaning the first four weeks for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just called it a nine week cycle,
just in case.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we really should have ran that
plan about 10, 10 and a half weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for instance, the first four weeks,
especially having a higher orange red
[SPEAKER_02]: level of light with an HID, HPS like a
Gavita light.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, I took advantage of getting this
plant to stretch out and cover a massive
[SPEAKER_02]: area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, getting those reds in there
was huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why, you know, at the time I
used a black dog LED for the second half
[SPEAKER_02]: of flower specifically because it being a
full spectrum light incorporating the
[SPEAKER_02]: ultraviolet in there as well was great to
finish the plan, especially to bring up
[SPEAKER_02]: resin production after I already got the
plant to stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, you know, that's why with
the Progro tech, one of the things that
[SPEAKER_02]: drew me to the company immediately is the
full capability of tuning the spectrum,
[SPEAKER_02]: meaning I can go ahead and take the red
levels and tune it down by, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a five, 10 percent ratio, the white blue
levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And them being able to custom integrate
infrared and ultraviolet light into this
[SPEAKER_02]: as well, I think that what people are
going to see, what I've always noticed
[SPEAKER_02]: with LEDs, especially for veg,
it was nice because we were able to double
[SPEAKER_02]: stack by controlling the height level of
the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that really came down to the
frequency of the lighting itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jair was one of the guys that brought the
Gavita to life to market years ago when
[SPEAKER_02]: nobody was using double ended lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the first times I had met him,
he was showing me the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, what is this thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And after he explained it to me,
what I took from that was we needed to
[SPEAKER_02]: increase the frequency of the light for
people that have been growing a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started with magnetic ballast.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are these huge white boxes that
would hum and get hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not many people today that are growing
probably even know what this is,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they operated at such a low frequency
that if you took a picture of your grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: back in the day, you'd see these little
wavy lines and you can never get a great
[SPEAKER_02]: shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care who you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never had a great shot of your garden
without getting these little wavy lines,
[SPEAKER_02]: even if you took a video.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we noticed, I compared this to
like, for instance, we all had flat screen
[SPEAKER_02]: TVs 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's changed besides the 1080 high
picture, it's always been the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the Hertz level or the frequency of
the lights blinking themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, the first TV is operating at
like 60 Hertz.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I took from that is if you watched
high definition, fast paced motion action,
[SPEAKER_02]: like sports, it would pixelate and you'd
see this ghosting effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as that increased to 120, 240 and
beyond, you took that away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what this does as far as the frequency
of light for a plant is that is measuring
[SPEAKER_02]: the times that that light blinks for every
one second.
[SPEAKER_02]: And operating at such a low frequency,
let's say, even if it's 240 Hertz,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're looking at something going to a
hundred thousand plus Hertz when we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going into like the type of technology
that Gavita brought in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that we're looking with LEDs,
you're operating at such a high frequency
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're optimizing the amount of light
that the plant's actually getting every
[SPEAKER_02]: one second.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people don't realize those little
things like that made a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you bring up the frequency and
you can actually manipulate the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrums of light, you can manipulate the
type of growth you get from the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning, whether it's tighter intranodal
spacing, a more compact plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: or even being able to take a plant that
wouldn't be so compact and would stretch
[SPEAKER_02]: typically, and being able to slow down the
vertical height of that by manipulating
[SPEAKER_02]: the spectrums.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with some of those scenarios,
can you talk about how you're dialing to
[SPEAKER_01]: achieve specific effects?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, everybody's got to work within their
limitations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your space is your space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether you have a four by four tent,
a four by eight table, or a row,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're always at the limit of your space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And knowing the amount of edge time needed
into accommodating for me, what I like
[SPEAKER_02]: about, see, when I say rock wall,
I use a loose rock wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard to really explain to people
sometimes because grow down themselves has
[SPEAKER_02]: made very different types of rock wall
over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was something that they used to make
that was granular absorbent, granular
[SPEAKER_02]: repellent, now also known as grow wool.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make like a cube style and a chunk,
which is probably about 60% bigger than
[SPEAKER_02]: the actual cubes, which we'll compare to
like a crouton.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being able to know how to stuff these in
the pot, the density at which they're put
[SPEAKER_02]: in there, and knowing the plant's drinking
habits are huge, and that comes into
[SPEAKER_02]: experience when you know certain plants
have a slower veg time, meaning they may
[SPEAKER_02]: just take a longer time to grow to the
size you need them to fill a canopy with a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain amount of plants or the amount of
times it drinks, you could really put
[SPEAKER_02]: together a room with multiple different
genetics and customize the media so that
[SPEAKER_02]: this way it dries out, whether it's just
evaporation of natural moisture into the
[SPEAKER_02]: atmosphere itself or the plant absorbing
that moisture through the root system,
[SPEAKER_02]: we want them all ultimately to dry out at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And being able to optimize the amount of
times you get them to drink, you can take
[SPEAKER_02]: a plant that doesn't necessarily drink as
fast, and manipulate the way that that
[SPEAKER_02]: potting media is put together,
maybe it's a lighter mix where it repels
[SPEAKER_02]: more water from being held on just
naturally for a longer period of time,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it will dry out at the same time as a
pot mixed with maybe a more absorbent
[SPEAKER_02]: style concoction, we'll call it,
of the loose media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have your little rock wool cube,
what's the rest of the grow media that is
[SPEAKER_01]: surrounding it for you, and what size pots
do you like?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've really liked the air pots,
specifically for me, we'll go back to
[SPEAKER_02]: common sense, there's a lot of root
pruning pots, but to me it's the only pot
[SPEAKER_02]: out there that actually raises the surface
level of the plant itself approximately
[SPEAKER_02]: two to three inches off the ground,
which is benefit for a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_02]: some people are still in old school saucer
systems, we'll call it, where you have
[SPEAKER_02]: runoff that the plant will sit in,
and when you have a pot, old school
[SPEAKER_02]: plastic container, the roots are exposed
sitting into this stagnant water,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll call it, you're in a root pruning
pot like an air pot or a sack pot,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's still wicking this moisture back into
the pot, but it's sitting in stagnant
[SPEAKER_02]: water, it was a great thing for me,
I was like, well, there's multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits, obviously if you're in that type
of a system, it's not sitting in stagnant
[SPEAKER_02]: water, you see rock wool systems even with
cubes now, there's a lot of promotion of
[SPEAKER_02]: these little screen inserts that you put
into the tables, to me it's just another
[SPEAKER_02]: headache to clean later, where it's giving
the roots more air because it's raising
[SPEAKER_02]: more off the surface of the tray,
which this pot does, so there's benefits
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, just the amount of potting
media that you use in comparison to a
[SPEAKER_02]: normal setup where you're using cocoa or
soil, it's just a lot easier for me,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a lot cleaner, you don't have so much
sediment building up into the tables
[SPEAKER_02]: causing different types of pathogens to
occur later on down the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is your potting media 100% rock wool?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay, that's kind of what I was
getting at.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a very custom mix, it's hard to
explain people exactly how it's done and
[SPEAKER_02]: how to stuff it in there because it's one
of those things when I actually train
[SPEAKER_02]: people to do this, we do literally hands
on and you have to feel the density at
[SPEAKER_02]: which you put it in and how it's broken
up, it's a little bit more complicated
[SPEAKER_02]: than it sounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were 100% just in rock wool,
so now I get that, and then you're using,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm blanking because there are a bunch
of, airpots or smartpots?
[SPEAKER_01]: Airpots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Airpots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so you have rock wool and then what
size containers are you using?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for that particular plant,
for the grow off, we did a 12 gallon
[SPEAKER_02]: airpot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started in a one gallon airpot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got four pounds of yield out of a
12 gallon airpot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the past, I've always used
sevens and tens, we went a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not a big pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's impressive.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in terms of the nutrients,
so for me, I think of two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, I want to talk about your nutrient
mix and what nutrients you're using,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then also we've touched on moisture
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, I think of trying to keep the
roots within a band of moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't want it to get super soaked
and then dry them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teetering point before.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it to keep going,
like blow past the band and then come back
[SPEAKER_01]: into the band, blow past it the other
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you kind of a proponent of frequent
small dose watering?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Microdosing the water to keep an even
saturation or a constant saturation where
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not sopping wet, but it's not dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that perfect mixture allows
for the right amount of airflow to get to
[SPEAKER_02]: the roots themselves as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We cut off oxygen to the roots at a
certain point by water logging them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water can only sustain a certain amount of
oxygen level for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at certain temperatures, it depletes
rapidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even it'll fall out of solution when
we're, let's just talk about the boiling
[SPEAKER_02]: point of water, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: At such a rapid rate, we're separating
this, but at let's say a level of 66 to 68
[SPEAKER_02]: degrees, we could actually scientifically
put the most amount of oxygen within that
[SPEAKER_02]: water and deliver that to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're trying to be optimum,
we'll call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finding those small fluctuations
of, well, the nutrient takes this long to
[SPEAKER_02]: mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes this long before the feeding
actually occurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: The variance of the temperature goes up or
down in a certain direction, depending on
[SPEAKER_02]: different variables.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are in cold climates where
they have cold flooring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people don't have that issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, everybody's grows always
going to be different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, you know, there's no perfect
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of grows are almost like
an art because you get a canvas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not always the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And depending on now how the city wants
you to have whatever isleway space and
[SPEAKER_02]: drinking fountains wherever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you design it based on that
to optimize what you can do there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's always going to be different for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter who.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you develop a good recipe to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what's kind of like your
preferred, I mean, you're doing like drip
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're not hand watering the
stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not on the commercial level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the stuff I want to start
exploring more is like blue mat
[SPEAKER_01]: tensiometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're basically these little carrot
looking tensiometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically they you can set it so you
kind of have your moisture level you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to achieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's less moist, they'll release
water or water plus nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's, you know, once it gets to the
optimal moisture level, it'll stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like let's say, I mean, think of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say a greenhouse grow, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you have one end of the greenhouse
that's maybe a little more shady.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other end that's hot and sunny.
[SPEAKER_01]: The air is blowing in one direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have kind of if
everything gets watered the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have it's damp and moldy
and mildewy over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too dry over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you have kind of each little
carrot steak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as long as companies make these
affordable for larger operations,
[SPEAKER_02]: because we've seen a lot of that
technology and, you know, it's not very
[SPEAKER_02]: cost effective when a lot of these systems
are, you know, 10 plus thousand dollars
[SPEAKER_02]: for the monitoring equipment, plus an
extra thousand dollars per sensor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make sense because to me,
the raw materials obviously don't cost
[SPEAKER_02]: that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the irrigation front, on the,
I guess, let's say commercial front and
[SPEAKER_01]: the personal grow front, like what do you
like?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you exploring?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, every situation is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was left up to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'd love keeping my custom
Rockwell mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like using the air pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it really is tailoring to
the grows and specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, some people are stuck on
their ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for some people that are in ownership
to have employees that their success is
[SPEAKER_02]: based on past experiences and being
familiar with what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're kind of at the risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see a lot of people getting the run
around where everybody is a master grower
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: They walk in and they're failing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I see it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was a master grower in a 10
foot by 10 foot square space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm running a one acre greenhouse
and putting the owners and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: into debt and making them feel like
they're not going to make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of the day, it doesn't
matter what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about how to scale it and be
successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think if people will,
you can grow it any way you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think at the end of the day,
it's what makes you comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, I can't always be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can recommend the system for
somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unless they have the people that are
competent enough to see that out the way
[SPEAKER_02]: it needs to be done, without any screw
ups, we'll call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to put faith into systems that
will be bulletproof, we'll call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, whether that's just simple
things like I had a conversation with
[SPEAKER_02]: people the other day about, is it better
that we go to powder nutrients versus
[SPEAKER_02]: liquid nutrients?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's advantages to both.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, well, you know, let's ask
ourselves, well, with the powder
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients, there's a couple of variables
that could change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning, let's say the scale that you're
using isn't properly calibrated and or
[SPEAKER_02]: it's real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning, you're calibrating a certain way,
but you don't necessarily know if that was
[SPEAKER_02]: calibrated or in calibration correctly,
which can cause your measurements to be
[SPEAKER_02]: off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two, if you have somebody that's weighing
it themselves, you have to look out the
[SPEAKER_02]: way it's, you know, being done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning, a lot of people will necessarily,
different products can't be in
[SPEAKER_02]: conjunction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning, an A and B aren't in the same
container because they need to be mixed
[SPEAKER_02]: separately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you take certain concentrations
when you're weighing out powders and you
[SPEAKER_02]: put an A in there and you have residue
from the A still in the container and you
[SPEAKER_02]: have an employee that just fills it back
up with B, you have to ask yourself,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, how do we eliminate small issues
like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: We go to a liquid fertilizer where it's
very simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to worry about the
consistency being off or contamination of
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients creating a lockout.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just little things like that is
based on the help that you have and have
[SPEAKER_02]: hired.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, from my experience, it's always
been the best to find people that had no
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge of the grow industry whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in fact, I call him a protege,
but you know, one of the best people I
[SPEAKER_02]: know in this industry, he came from
Craigslist.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knew nothing about growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: His family was, you know, not from the
United States and barely spoke English and
[SPEAKER_02]: hated that he smelled like weed coming
home every day and, you know, from working
[SPEAKER_02]: in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy now can, you know,
build an irrigation system for you and do
[SPEAKER_02]: all these cool things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't because he was arguing,
he sees a common sense factor,
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care how you do it, but every
situation is gonna be a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and the thing is, is when you
have people that always know what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing, they go into these situations based
on prior knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of science behind this,
whether it's the water pressure delivering
[SPEAKER_02]: the water to the emitters, the amount of
flow rate the emitters are, the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: things that are actually dividing this
water out, meaning it's an octabubbler or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever type of system you have,
calculating the amount of water and how
[SPEAKER_02]: much pressure and, you know, just even the
PVC pipe size, all these things matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, this is no different from
any other industry that's been doing
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just now that people are seeing it as
less taboo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're getting the people that are
real professionals getting involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's gonna put some people
out of jobs if they don't get out of their
[SPEAKER_02]: mindset of their way is the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to open your mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you were doing the two plants for the
grow off, did you just bolt them on as two
[SPEAKER_01]: additional plants of a commercial
operation or was this like at home or?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is a commercial operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you basically like, you know,
your commercial irrigation system,
[SPEAKER_01]: you just added one for each of those two
pots and?
[SPEAKER_02]: I originally only planned for a four by
four section for the plant.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I didn't see it using very
much more than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even with that four by four section,
technically we had about 50 inches almost
[SPEAKER_02]: in each direction for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, for instance, the plant
wasn't a very stretching plant whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even by the end of week three,
I think I have a video I could send to you
[SPEAKER_02]: where we took the tape measure out and it
was already about 52 inches in diameter in
[SPEAKER_02]: all directions, only three weeks into
bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know, it covered quite a bit of
space, but you know, I think that going
[SPEAKER_02]: back into this and you know, once we do a
competition that involves more of the
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial operations again, it'd be nice
to, you know, I already have some plans
[SPEAKER_02]: for it, but you know, I'd like to put,
you know, a room together where maybe,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, maybe we put like four to four
to eight plants over one line and really
[SPEAKER_02]: make a spectacle out of it and see if we
can get, you know, 10, 20 pounds off a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then those two plants were also on the
same nutrient regimen as all the other
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I didn't grow them both out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I killed the second plant through the veg
because halfway through the veg I already
[SPEAKER_02]: knew which one we tagged was the all-star.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once we tagged them, I didn't need the
other plant anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were talking about liquid
nutrients, dry nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you using for nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you making a home blend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you buying from a leading
manufacturer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've been very fond of Mills
nutrients for a while and it really
[SPEAKER_02]: started back in the day where my
philosophy was is you're changing the
[SPEAKER_02]: additives to manipulate the growth
throughout the stages and seeing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, working in the hydroponic
business to see it all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a veg and they have a bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, I was like, well, they have an
A and B that works for veg and bloom and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're just actually changing the
stimulants based on the plant's needs
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout its cycle, which really makes
sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, knowing the secrets of the
industry, it's like a lot of products
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't necessarily just developed from
scratch.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just re-bottled.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another large ag product that's
re-bottled and packaged and sold to you
[SPEAKER_02]: for 300% more.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You worked in a hydrostore, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know all the secrets.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the sad thing is, you know,
knowing all that too, it's no different
[SPEAKER_02]: from any other industry, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if people didn't really pay
attention so much to the marketing and
[SPEAKER_02]: hype of certain items and really looked
into the actual products, they'd see that
[SPEAKER_02]: this is really no different.
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, you know, I could be wrong,
but I'm pretty sure the DuPont family and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that own several different
entities of products.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these different companies that are
large manufacturers own so many different
[SPEAKER_02]: products that we would never realize it's
all the same company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're against wine, you should be
against them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, everything gets like that when
you perfect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody perfected a nutrient to the point
where they could sell it to large scale
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: My hat's off to them because if they're
sitting there buying liquid fertilizer at
[SPEAKER_02]: our prices in this industry, we wouldn't
see farmers using any of that stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: whatsoever.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there anything else you're adding
in at various stages of the life cycle?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a weekly tea regimen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do my own teas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have my own IPM that I integrate
into the plant cycle, whether it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: for preventative preventative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we, we talk about responses
in the plant and I don't want to give out
[SPEAKER_02]: too much information about what I use,
but just, just to put it out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's something called systemic acquired
reaction in a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what this really is, is how do we tell
the plant that it's under attack,
[SPEAKER_02]: just like a human body has its own immune
and defense system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody's is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people have better tolerance to
getting sick than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants are the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, is how to trick your
plant into doing what you needed to do
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the cycle and how to manipulate
those reactions out of the plant is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is, is all part of, you know, trial and
error.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think all plants will react differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, these are, these are some
secrets that I'll keep to myself,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, you know, I've done a lot of,
we'll call it nerdy experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, I've done everything you could think
of by trying to simulate gravitational
[SPEAKER_02]: pull effects in vibrations to root systems
to different types of frequencies of
[SPEAKER_02]: sound, you know, you name it, different
types of music.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did rooms with rap music rooms with
classical music.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've, you know, and did you notice a
difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your plants like to jam out to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Me personally, my favorite thing to use in
the garden is a just old school radio AMFM
[SPEAKER_02]: frequency type thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, I feel like there has to be some
kind of voodoo to the, the frequency of
[SPEAKER_02]: the sound coming in through reception and
the frequency of an old speaker being a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit more higher pitched.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll call it than a lot of the,
the new age.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll speakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there a study on like the sound of
birds chirping in the morning?
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen much of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What my, my favorite studies were looking
at tectonic plates and vibrational sound
[SPEAKER_02]: patterns and what they do to sand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look up different university research
and certain frequencies will make the sand
[SPEAKER_02]: develop certain patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that really had something to
do with opening up the plants actual we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: call it skin or it's pores, whether that's
to transpire or to being able to absorb
[SPEAKER_02]: more CO2 levels more effectively.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all studies that, you know,
I'm interested in, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there's a lot to vibration
and sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so first of all, with the T's that
means you're introducing sort of microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: and okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not a just a pure sort of
synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so you know, people could say
organically derived, synthetically
[SPEAKER_02]: derived, but to me in all aspects,
it's not about what we think it's about
[SPEAKER_02]: what the plant can absorb most
effectively.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think in a medicinal quality
standpoint for me, how a calcium or
[SPEAKER_02]: magnesium is derived is pointless because
I want to have the cleanest, most
[SPEAKER_02]: available source.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like the same difference
between calcium carbonate and calcium
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calcium carbonate is a much needs to be
broken down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very slowly absorbed or readily
available to the plant compared to a
[SPEAKER_02]: calcium nitrate, which is already chelated
in a form that the plant can absorb
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, when it comes down to
organic or not, to me, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about just raw minerals and
nutrition, just like a human body.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we need certain types of nutrition or
minerals to do whatever it is we're
[SPEAKER_02]: training ourselves to do, at a high or
competitive level, which we're doing with
[SPEAKER_02]: plants in an aspect where we need to
obviously maximize profitability for the
[SPEAKER_02]: people that keep things running.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, we want to create a
substantially better product than anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in doing that, you know, you have to
look at all those key factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have different tea brewing
strategies for different phases of growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like are you more fungal dominant early?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you more bacterial dominant later?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as far as the teas, I think that
it's a very simple tea is necessary for
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody, whether it's and this is where
it's going into like what I use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a lot of products out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just put a few out there that are very
similar products like Extreme Gardening
[SPEAKER_02]: has Mycos and Azos and there's Great
White.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's Life Powder and a lot of these
different inoculants have relatively the
[SPEAKER_02]: same agents in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: People need to realize that that powder
you see is a carrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not necessarily what the plant's
absorbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a talc.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pharmaceutical grade talc that this
biology could stick to so you could
[SPEAKER_02]: transport that into the water and suspend
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I think that a lot of these
beneficial microorganisms are a way for
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant to help them chelate and
effectively uptake nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there is benefits for them as
far as immunity and defense in them,
[SPEAKER_02]: but at the same time, when you get
microbiology in an indoor system and
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody's system is different,
you have a lot of problems with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So running a clean irrigation system to me
is a lot more beneficial on a large scale
[SPEAKER_02]: project versus going fully organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, you just have a lot of problems
down the line and a lot more maintenance
[SPEAKER_02]: issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it's about how to use those teas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that using them in accordance to
where you are in the plant cycle,
[SPEAKER_02]: meaning a weekly cycle, we typically
increase our food regimens as we increase
[SPEAKER_02]: the amount of time the plant grows,
whether it's from beginning a veg to end a
[SPEAKER_02]: veg, beginning a flower to end a flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: By increasing those nutrient regimens,
for me, you also have salt buildup.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is we need to realize,
obviously, as an accumulation of salt
[SPEAKER_02]: builds up, you're going to create a
possibility for plants to lock out
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to flush out those excess
minerals.
[SPEAKER_02]: By releasing these bonds to me,
teas, this is one thing I can guarantee
[SPEAKER_02]: you, the best time for me and anyone to
apply them, in my opinion, would be when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're actually flushing your plant or
leaching those out on a weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what better to have these
beneficial microorganisms that are in
[SPEAKER_02]: there that could help chelate and break
down these minerals that are accumulating,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're not having to add food at that
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a large scale agricultural project,
you're going to have to, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_02]: I always like to splash these on top of
the plants and not running them through
[SPEAKER_02]: the irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have somebody that goes through
and literally hand feeds tea, and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about a micro dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not- Are we talking foliar or into
the rock wool?
[SPEAKER_02]: Into the rock wool itself.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do any foliar spraying?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as far as foliars, one good tip
I could say is depending on your
[SPEAKER_02]: situation, there's different technology
that I've been able to incorporate now to
[SPEAKER_02]: cut down on some of the uses for different
types of foliar sprays, whether it's to
[SPEAKER_02]: prevent different types of fungal or
different pathogens from attaching
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody's environment is going to be
a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people are getting more
into the preventive aspect of knowing that
[SPEAKER_02]: your room may look clean but you bringing
in outside contaminants is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having a good practice of making sure
that you don't bring them into the grow in
[SPEAKER_02]: the first place is critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as with large scale grows,
it's hard for people to say, we're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to have these things hand sprayed.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these systems, big systems are a
beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so automated.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have track systems with fogging
machines that will literally spray
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you need to spray when you need
to spray it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people, for instance, that actually
manually apply these, great ways to cut
[SPEAKER_02]: down on the amount of application rates
would be to atomize this or use paint
[SPEAKER_02]: sprayers a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning you can have a little bit go a
long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of going through five to 10
gallons, you may go through one to two
[SPEAKER_02]: gallons of foliar spray depending on what
type of application you're applying it
[SPEAKER_02]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: But getting down to the application of
foliars, I like it throughout the veg
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try and not do it past maybe week three
or four of the bloom cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even in that, it really depends on the
situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know you have strains that are
finicky, meaning that they are a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit more prone to pathogens or mold,
then yeah, you have to keep a regimen of
[SPEAKER_02]: different types of chemicals, we'll call
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's something organic like a,
I think Marrone was one of the sponsors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they make products from Regalia,
Grandivo, Venere, all products that I use.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other great products out there
that necessarily would kind of contradict
[SPEAKER_02]: that because let's say you use something
like a plant therapy that has alcohol and
[SPEAKER_02]: different types of extracts in it and
citric acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't necessarily apply that to
something that you put beneficial
[SPEAKER_02]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say you're spraying a fungal
dominant tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not gonna spray plant therapy right
after.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of pointless.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just depends on what you're going
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people with a lot of
different applications, whether it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: type of protection equipment, whether it's
the respirators, the protective clothing,
[SPEAKER_02]: being able to simplify all those practices
for people is one thing that everybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: getting better at.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no perfect way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's situation is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, it also depends on the
people you have, they're actually doing
[SPEAKER_02]: the applications.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting back to the initial grow off
topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically it was almost like an Iron
Chef competition where like you ran out of
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, I'm sure everybody felt the
same way where it's like, oh, I could have
[SPEAKER_01]: just done that one last thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they did originally give us a date
that was further out, but because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: law change, it was out of their control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though we properly planned our
schedule to pull down on a certain date,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was out of our control at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: What ultimately, I forget you said this
earlier, but what ultimately was the
[SPEAKER_01]: strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Grapefruit Romulan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Describe what you saw at the, you know,
as these, you know, buds started to
[SPEAKER_01]: develop or you, you kind of had a general
sense of what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I had my guesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a sweet smelling plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It put it this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smelled a lot better growing than it
smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sad to say it, but I call it the boofy
kind of a boofy strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing special about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there's a lot of strains out
there that are nostalgic for very
[SPEAKER_02]: different attributes of it, whether it's
the color, the smell, the taste,
[SPEAKER_02]: the high, the effects of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we can joke about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's strains like blue dream that
people will be like, Oh, get that out of
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's strains like green crack
that people are like, what's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are like, Oh man, no more of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: People loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think strains like OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, OG Kush, you can get any strain
that's named something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just by smoking, if it is really an OG
Kush, it's going to taste very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by putting all these different names
on it has always been kind of a joke to me
[SPEAKER_02]: over the years that people do this because
we've lost sense of what truly what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all kind of the same planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that people that are breeding and
doing their own phenohunts will realize is
[SPEAKER_02]: they all came from a seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all very different, but they're
similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we get different types of attributes
out of different phenotypes, meaning the
[SPEAKER_02]: structure and the way that the calyxes
grow, the structure of the leaves and how
[SPEAKER_02]: they form, the amount it yields,
the potency of the plant, how tolerant it
[SPEAKER_02]: is to environmental conditions and or
different types of attacks from mold or
[SPEAKER_02]: bugs, you know, and being able to hone in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's where your tissue
culture is a great thing, where we can not
[SPEAKER_02]: only clean up strains that people have
damaged over the years by using toxic
[SPEAKER_02]: chemicals that in some case that were out
of our control.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make the comment people complain about
equal 20, but they use spinosa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spinosa was labeled organic, but it was a
neurotoxin in combustion to inhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was labeled organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still buy it as organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people say organics healthier,
sometimes I'm like, well, is it mercury
[SPEAKER_02]: organic?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's certain things that will
just kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you said this was a purple punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a purple punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so talk to me about I view cannabis in
the same way I view music.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is the Katy Perry strains,
which may be the most popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, popularity in my mind doesn't mean the
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's like the Miles Davis of
strains or the, you know, experiment like
[SPEAKER_01]: something that you like a lot that's not
being played on every major L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: radio station.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you talk about just from what
you're seeing snapshot in time 2019,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's becoming popular in the L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: market?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then can you contrast that with just
what are you personally into right now in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of genetics and breed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what's exciting you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, who's your I'm excited right now
artist who's up and coming versus the the
[SPEAKER_01]: purple punch or the blue dream or the?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm just happy that people are over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just there's still people that are diehard
O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush fans, but forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh, it's not O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see the times are kind of changing
and where people like more exotic flavors
[SPEAKER_02]: and in meaning there's so many good weeds
now that people are finding what they like
[SPEAKER_02]: the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, you know, you go over to a
friend's house and they have whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: strain it is and you have whatever strain
it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've never tried this strain and now
you like this strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before it was like, let's just put it this
way, black market days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go over to your, you know,
person's house to pick up a bag of weed or
[SPEAKER_02]: even at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, 13 different types of O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush and like three others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think that now people are
seeing better variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see that people are really into colorful
strains and more of a kind of exotic
[SPEAKER_02]: smells or fruity smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that really goes to the point
where they're all very similar in THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think until we really feel out full
spectrum of what's in that plant that
[SPEAKER_02]: makes us feel the way that we do that we
like that may be somebody else doesn't,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's all about flavor for me at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'll smoke enough to get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care what strain it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I view kind of where we are with
cannabis right now is as alcohol came out
[SPEAKER_01]: of prohibition kind of everyone was so
focused during alcohol prohibition on
[SPEAKER_01]: highest proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you had kind of like your whiskeys and
your bathtub gin and your grain alcohols
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of like a fine craft wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sort of came later on, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like 1935.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always those crafts, but you had
to know the people right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking of the general public.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for me, like you, like I could drink
six glasses of wine and my goal is to get
[SPEAKER_01]: drunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can appreciate each one.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're saying is, you know,
your cannabis doesn't need to go up to 11
[SPEAKER_01]: on the THC scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just smoke a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you're more focused on,
what I'm more focused on is kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: the flavor, the terpenes, the kind of
overall quality of the experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, but I feel like there's still a
lot of the market who is kind of THC
[SPEAKER_01]: driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, this one's 90 proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, do you want, and that's to
say like, okay, all alcohol gets you
[SPEAKER_02]: drunk, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: At a certain point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to me, I've never really liked the
taste of like, people love whiskey and
[SPEAKER_02]: bourbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me it's like, it burns when you
drink that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, it's like, okay, if I'm chasing
this effect, don't I want it to taste good
[SPEAKER_02]: and not be so harsh?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the thing is, is well, we look at high
concentrations of THC and concentrates,
[SPEAKER_02]: for instance, some people don't like vape
pens cause it's real harsh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know for me, at least with vape
cartridges, the more you smoke them is
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like that old effect you would get
from a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of get this cough, I feel like,
or you smoke dabs and it's 70 plus percent
[SPEAKER_02]: THC, but there's people out there that can
just do dab after dab after dab,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they can't smoke three joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: They've consumed so much more THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that already tells you that everybody's
slightly different.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that difference?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we need to really focus on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's your preferred, do you like
rolling joints?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like, I like everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, I got off the, you're like,
okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like tapas, a little bit of
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, getting involved with
different companies and just getting
[SPEAKER_02]: involved into the testing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lot of people don't realize,
like I had an argument today with
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, look, papers, blunts,
hemp wraps, to me, the ultimate goal in
[SPEAKER_02]: life would be to smoke weed wrapped in
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't change the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we need to do because in a
real, real health aspect, is it really
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy to smoke paper?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not, whether it's rice paper,
hemp paper, or any paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about kombucha paper, which is now on
the market?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the thing is, is all these things
have a subtle taste difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like the same argument with
people be like, Oh, I only smoke with big
[SPEAKER_02]: lighters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's cause you like the taste of the
lighter fluid.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you change the lighter on them,
they could taste the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you tasting?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not tasting the weed completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's almost like a mixology at
that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even if you go into like a hemp
wick, you know, it's like even the hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: wicks have their own certain flavor
profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you put them out, you're smelling
this kind of burnt smell in, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: at the same time when you're trying to
inhale your weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, finding out what,
what really suits people don't chase after
[SPEAKER_02]: the THC content because that's just like
going to the bar and saying, I want the
[SPEAKER_02]: strongest thing you have on the menu.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care because that's the effect I'm
chasing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't care what it feels like to get
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think, you know, when people are
really getting approached in that way that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to say, yeah, give me the
strongest thing now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, realistically, if I gave you a
glass of wine, that was 12% alcohol and
[SPEAKER_02]: 14% alcohol and you drank six glasses of
each, you're probably not going to see
[SPEAKER_02]: much of a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is a breeder who you respect and
what's, what's some of the new genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're excited to play with?
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the people I'm going to mention,
it takes me back to working behind the
[SPEAKER_02]: counter and seeing where they got to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today.
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, the, the vault seed bank
guys were a long time customer of ours
[SPEAKER_02]: through a company called green coast
hydroponics and where I originally met the
[SPEAKER_02]: owner of that company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just seeing the, the evolving,
you know, times for everybody and seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: what they've been able to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really cool because the strains that
they're able to create, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's people that they have promoting
these strains for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, people that I looked up to,
like people like be real or, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody's heard the song.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got five on it and you got people like
the, the young mouse coolado strain or
[SPEAKER_02]: whether that's the strain for me or not,
you know, I'll say it's not bad,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's, it's some people are like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people aren't just like any other
weed, but I think that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what they've been able to do to this point
and seeing the whole kind of progression
[SPEAKER_02]: of it's almost like watching your kid grow
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see somebody start at one level where
you mentioned the word IPM to them and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're like, what the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: To seeing where they're at today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really cool to see people evolve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I know that a lot of people
do a lot of marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and at the end of the day,
there's so many different strains that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's really hard for you to say that
one's better than the other because really
[SPEAKER_02]: weed is different for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, I always have the strains that
I like in all aspects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't research a lot of the stuff that's
nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, you know, there's strains
that I've had for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea who made them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea where they came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how to grow them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and what are some of those strands?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, see one strain that I really like is,
uh, I have a cut of of, I call it J one,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we've had this cut for man,
probably 2004 or five, something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never really had a longterm mom of it's
always been cloned of cloned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, this is something that we were
given at a Orange County normal meeting at
[SPEAKER_02]: a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the privilege of meeting Jack
career.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mentioned that I love the strain so
much somebody that was there with him gave
[SPEAKER_02]: me a plant of this, uh, years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, it was always a fun plant to
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always liked the taste of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's one of those plants that just
gets enormous buds too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if anybody's ever grown it
or gets the chance to grow one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: strains like a Jack or J one, but you
know, it has those huge pineapple buds
[SPEAKER_02]: like you get from the skull.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, for me before it was just
OG Kush days, you know, there was a gray
[SPEAKER_02]: market aspect of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me it was like, well, I can get a
pound and a half per light of OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_02]: or I can get three pounds a light of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a hundred dollar difference in the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a no brainer, which way I'm going to
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was one of those strains that I just
really started to grow, especially going
[SPEAKER_02]: after the one plant per light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just easy for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I just fell in love with
that strain in particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that, you know, going into a
lot of strains today, I get a lot of that,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, it almost gives you that hint of
kind of like where you get that tangy
[SPEAKER_02]: smell or there's certain aspects to the
smell that I get different aromas from it
[SPEAKER_02]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a fun plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, besides that,
I think, um, I have a new strain that we
[SPEAKER_02]: developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a cross of, uh, OG Kush and,
uh, cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea what we're going to call
it, but we're waiting to see five more
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks and it'll be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, for the second time we ran it
just to see stability wise, but,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, I'm excited about just being able to
be a part of something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We never really knew what we were doing
with the breeding thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we had a dispensary owner that had a
bunch of male plants in his backyard and
[SPEAKER_02]: decided to do his own breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, that was kind of the start of a
lot of the different strains we developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, one of the cultivations I worked
with is no longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So being able to hold onto those strains
was kind of a nice thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just because they're no longer
cultivating themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was actually the, the place that I
originally did the grow off with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, since then the cultivation has
been turned into manufacturing and
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: The suits find it more profitable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it is what it is, you know,
um.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's something that, uh, you remember
from 10, 15 years ago that you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: ah, I wish I could find that again or
recreate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love smoking snow cap was a big one to
me back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a cool strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It, it was just so fresh and kind of like
pepperminty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was a unique smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where did it originate from or what's
the backstory?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was a Mendocino County
strain, Humboldt strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I always loved trainwreck was a big
one back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved the, the kind of lemony.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, smell and taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there was another one when I was,
uh, really getting into growing around
[SPEAKER_02]: 2003, I want to say 2004, we called it
juicy fruit and it smelled and tastes just
[SPEAKER_02]: like the gum did.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there was all kinds of strains back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember one was like a squirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of a version of it,
I believe, but it was just more citrusy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, shit, we used to do the original skunk
number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, white widow, another old one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it was funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: There, there wasn't much to choose from
back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, if people had seeds or if you
knew the person with the cut, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember paying $5,000 to have a cut of
Bubba Kush just to grow the original Bubba
[SPEAKER_02]: back in like 2004.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were growing Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in 2003, the same person that
gave me the Bubba, I had the OG Kush from,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know, that's kind of what the,
the dominating strains were then.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, the Bubba was huge for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually love that strain and I don't
see it ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was all, you're kind of like OC
scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that kind of where your sort of
epicenter is?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I came from Michigan to
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I grew up, we'll call it high school
days more in like, uh, Southern California
[SPEAKER_02]: Garden Grove.
[SPEAKER_02]: Long beach area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you came to California in high school?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, like junior high, just poor junior
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but so cannabis wise for you growing
up was SoCal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was SoCal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're a SoCal boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're, we were highly influenced
in the area I was at by like the
[SPEAKER_02]: Cottonmouth Kings kind of, um,
music scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the people that were
connected into that grew up in that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only that, like, um, just that
whole scene back then was different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was kind of like smoking weed
in your car.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love driving in traffic on the freeway
for an exit or two, cause you can hot box
[SPEAKER_02]: it and not get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it was different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody has different experiences for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of nice because, you know,
I was one of those people that always had
[SPEAKER_02]: a cigarette on me or a cigarette in my car
because, you know, you can't smell like
[SPEAKER_02]: weed and go home.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd puff the thing, blow it in my shirt
a bunch of times and blow it all over
[SPEAKER_02]: myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember, uh, getting a bunch of
messages and post-its in my room for my
[SPEAKER_02]: mom one day about like how I shouldn't
smoke cigarettes bad for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these anti cigarette ad tapes and
pamphlets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I remember just like going to my
drawer and I pulled out this film
[SPEAKER_02]: container with a fat nug in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, mom, I'm not smoking
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smoking this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and what was your reaction to
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, she was happy actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like she'd rather me smoke pot than drink
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more like, look, if you're going to
be doing stupid stuff like that at this
[SPEAKER_02]: age, don't get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, don't let your dad see that
you're smoking pot, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you know, I think that was the,
the start of having a good education about
[SPEAKER_02]: it for me is being open and having
somebody you could be open with at that
[SPEAKER_02]: point of your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I mean, my, my parents,
my mom, I just, her and her sister were
[SPEAKER_02]: groupie hippies, you know, went to
Woodstock naked type shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so they're very understanding people
when it comes to whether it's psychedelic
[SPEAKER_02]: type stuff or just pot in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Jerome, the wife has returned home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to, you're going to be at the
grow off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the 13th?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the 13th or the 14th?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Saturday, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you down in, uh, in your home
turf in like two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
