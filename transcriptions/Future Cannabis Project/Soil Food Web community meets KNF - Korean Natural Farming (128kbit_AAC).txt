[SPEAKER_01]: versus what are we calling it like the
living soil crew or you know the soil food
[SPEAKER_01]: web crew and kind of how they're
begrudgingly coming to at least
[SPEAKER_01]: acknowledge or accept that there's
something interesting with kind of the KNF
[SPEAKER_01]: world whereas initially they dismissed it
and so can you kind of talk about what
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe like what KNF is why the soil food
web people maybe initially kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: poo-pooed it and then kind of how they're
bridging that gap and maybe coming to
[SPEAKER_01]: accept or even eventually become
enthusiasts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so basically what we're seeing that
one of the things that we talk about in
[SPEAKER_00]: these groups especially groups of
regenerative farmers because we really do
[SPEAKER_00]: see a divide between you know the Korean
natural farming and the you know food soil
[SPEAKER_00]: web biological protocols and so in that
divide like how do we come together and
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we acknowledge that both methods
work and where does that misinformation
[SPEAKER_00]: and misunderstanding happen and what we're
realizing is that a lot of the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: followed a lot of Elaine Ingham's work
she's very much a staunch proponent of
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure that your inputs are what you
think that they are and making sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: things don't go anaerobic because
anaerobic is generally bad and generally
[SPEAKER_00]: you get pathogenic things happening and it
can quickly become a problem so when you
[SPEAKER_00]: talk with people who you know kind of
believe in that mentality what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking is that Korean natural farming is
a ferment and since it's not an aerated
[SPEAKER_00]: situation it's going anaerobic and
therefore anaerobics are bad but when you
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to the Korean natural farming and you
start getting into this you see that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not really an anaerobic process it's open
to the air you have breathable lids
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a ferment going on so there's you
know things happening inside with gas
[SPEAKER_00]: exchanges and I think that as time goes on
and more and more people are going down
[SPEAKER_00]: this methodology with Korean natural
farming because it's so cool and it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: effective and it's just a really fun
process to get into they're saying well
[SPEAKER_00]: this works really well and plants aren't
dying and there aren't pathogens so there
[SPEAKER_00]: must be something to it actually and for
me I have my microscope so when I'm making
[SPEAKER_00]: my indigenous microorganism collections
I'm actually looking at it under the scope
[SPEAKER_00]: so that I do know what I'm putting in
there my opinion is you know you can go
[SPEAKER_00]: just as easily really wrong with a compost
tea as you can with your rotten rice if
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't know what your basis of your
microorganisms are that are in there
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't really matter which method you do
you could blow it on either side you can
[SPEAKER_00]: do things different ways and still have it
work out and still have it be beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: just maybe not exactly how you thought of
it originally can you talk kind of with
[SPEAKER_01]: each methodology what could go wrong and
what like what are you actually seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: under the microscope like when someone
messes up the KNF process can you tell me
[SPEAKER_01]: which microbes are showing up to the party
I actually can't tell you which microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: because the microbes are still so small
that even with our shadow microscopes that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're using we we don't know which ones
they are necessarily but I have definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: had inoculations of bad fungi like they're
clearer they're thinner they don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: uniformity to them they don't have these
septums that separate them so what you
[SPEAKER_00]: want with your beneficial fungi is like a
big fat mycelium that's dark in color has
[SPEAKER_00]: little walls basically in between them and
is uniform throughout the whole thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: of a large size so if I have that I know
that I'm pretty good to go learning other
[SPEAKER_00]: things that can be pathogenic like what a
few serum spore looks like is a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good one to know so if you see tons of
those you know you have a problem if you
[SPEAKER_00]: end up with a ton of ciliates swimming
around that's usually not a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: indicator that's an indicator of an
anaerobic condition and that's more on the
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea side that we see that rather
than on Korean natural farming and yeah I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean with most of the ferments that were
made making I mean it just looks like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know happy bubbly things so as funny as
you mentioned ciliates and I remember the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time I you know looked at stuff
under the microscope and I saw these
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes whizzing around and they look so
cool and I was so proud of them and I
[SPEAKER_01]: filmed it and I put it up on YouTube and
people were like yeah those are those are
[SPEAKER_01]: those are an indication of an anaerobic
environment I was like yeah yeah I think
[SPEAKER_00]: my first flagellate I found I followed it
for like half an hour I got the worst kink
[SPEAKER_00]: in my neck I was like this is so cool oh
my gosh but flagellates are good you just
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about kind of after you go through
the KNF process what you're looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: under the microscope to see if you did
well or poorly in in like brewing teas
[SPEAKER_01]: which is an aerobic activity what are you
looking for under the microscope in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of I'm gonna put this on my plants or not
so when I'm doing my compost teas I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for something different because we
use a lot of our own earthworm castings so
[SPEAKER_00]: ideally what I want there is I want some
of those larger microorganisms so I want
[SPEAKER_00]: some testate amoeba in there I would love
to see a nematode but those usually aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: in the compost tea but you know if you're
there in the compost or if they're in your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil like that's a really good sign as
long as it's a you know bacteria eating or
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen the omnivorous nematodes
I've only seen the bacteria feeders and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't think I've ever seen a root feeder
which is really good says something that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing something right with our
composting process and our our earthworm
[SPEAKER_00]: castings but definitely looking for those
testate amoeba still looking for the
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial fungi and then there's a way to
do your counts where you're counting how
[SPEAKER_00]: many microbes in each slide and you're
figuring out what your you know colony
[SPEAKER_00]: forming units CFUs are things like that I
usually don't go that deep into it because
[SPEAKER_00]: you know if I see my fungi and I see my
amoeba I'm a happy camper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I think of these two processes when
you're making compost teas do you kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: have different brews for different stages
of plant growth like maybe you'll do more
[SPEAKER_01]: fungal dominant in the early stages and
you know progressive we move towards more
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterial dominant and then certain
specific bacteria maybe at the end that
[SPEAKER_01]: are known pathogen fighters and then with
KNF is it kind of are you dialing things
[SPEAKER_01]: in the same way that you do with teas?
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually dial it more with with KNF than
I do with the teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the teas I want it fungally dominant
always if I can get it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that cannabis really responds well
to like up to a 30 to 1 fungal to
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial ratio so that's a really really
great thing to see is make sure that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have that fungi in there all the time and
then with compost teas a lot of that we
[SPEAKER_00]: temper it with you know like a little more
heavy on the nitrogen side like green
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses or something like that or we'll
add some fish amino acids or fish
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrolysate not we won't brew that into it
but we'll add it in when we're using it
[SPEAKER_00]: for our drenches and then with KNF you get
it's it's more so Korean natural farming
[SPEAKER_00]: is traditionally a foliar method it's not
meant to be a soil drench you have your
[SPEAKER_00]: indigenous microorganisms you inoculate
the soil with those but all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: ferments that you're making are just for
foliar so it's a little bit different
[SPEAKER_00]: because what we're finding is that
cannabis it doesn't quite have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient cycling that like a tomato does
so tomatoes go through some very
[SPEAKER_00]: distinctive phases it goes through flower
it goes through you know vegetative and
[SPEAKER_00]: then it puts on flowers and puts on fruits
and then it dies but with cannabis we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't ever really let it do the fruiting
part because we want it to be since Mia so
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not pollinating it so you just see
it's got it's got a different kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: rhythm to it especially when it comes to
what we're using and when we're using it
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're finding that and a lot of us have
found different things you know some of us
[SPEAKER_00]: like to continue spraying some of our
sprays further into flower some of us like
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it you know and it later one of our
one of the farmers that we speak with does
[SPEAKER_00]: turns it into a drench at the end so he
stops foliar feeding and starts drenching
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil instead which I've done also when
I started Korean natural farming I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know it was a foliar so I was using it as
a soil drench which worked really well but
[SPEAKER_00]: as a foliar it works much better and a lot
of that has to do with when you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: your seawater your water-soluble calcium
and your water-soluble calcium phosphate
[SPEAKER_00]: normally they're used a very specific
times but we're finding with cannabis you
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of have to tweak it a little bit more
and really read what your plant wants and
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a foliar it picks it up and
responds very quickly so does that imply
[SPEAKER_01]: that you kind of have a mixed process of
KNF on the leaves and sort of tea brews in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil or what's your that's what yeah
that's what we did a lot of last year we
[SPEAKER_00]: did have one area of our garden that was
strictly KNF and then the rest of it we
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of did a mishmash of the two and so
this year we're actually really excited
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got our 8,000 square foot at
full-term outdoor garden that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be separated into eight to ten different
cultivars each one will have ten to twelve
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and we're going to split it right
down into thirds one-third is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: strictly Korean natural farming so we'll
do indigenous microorganisms on the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll do a liquid indigenous microorganism
extract at a few different times during
[SPEAKER_00]: the cycle and then Korean natural farming
implements for the all the foliar the
[SPEAKER_00]: other far side we're going to do a strict
food soil web system so we're going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: compost compost teas and some fulvic acid
as a foliar after the compost tea and I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe that's going to be about it on
that one and then in the middle we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do both so I'm going to use
indigenous microorganisms and compost tea
[SPEAKER_00]: and compost tea extract and liquid IMO for
the for the soil and then for the foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: will do a combination also of the compost
tea and the KNF and we'll just kind of peg
[SPEAKER_00]: it out through the year and see what
happens at the end you've already gone
[SPEAKER_01]: through a season with KNF correct yes and
can you give us kind of a can you
[SPEAKER_01]: distinguish between like pre KNF and post
KNF and turn like what have you looked for
[SPEAKER_01]: or noticed have you had any more bountiful
harvest more terpenes less pathogens
[SPEAKER_01]: what's what do you looking for and what's
happened as a result of adopting KNF
[SPEAKER_00]: methods we've definitely seen higher resin
production so we were I've been very
[SPEAKER_00]: impressed by just the overall quantity of
the resin is way higher than we've seen in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past which I was really fairly
surprised about actually so Frenchy can
[SPEAKER_00]: only will be very happy yes Frenchy would
be French he's gonna love KNF when he gets
[SPEAKER_01]: into it destroy those trichomes
[SPEAKER_00]: everything for the hash so lots more
trichome production healthier plants
[SPEAKER_00]: overall they were just easier they just
seemed to be more resistant to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything we did have thrips last year
which was the first time and I'm I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: I manifested it on accident because I
heard thrips were coming back to cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was like thrips we haven't seen
thrips and cannabis since like the 80s
[SPEAKER_01]: that's crazy well so that was gonna be my
question is that something that was unique
[SPEAKER_01]: to you or was that endemic to kind of
humble overall did the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: overall like thrips kind of hit everyone
last year a little bit more than you know
[SPEAKER_00]: then then we expected or then I've seen in
a really long time and I happen to know
[SPEAKER_00]: Suzanne Wainwright who's one of the lead
entomologists for the United States for
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture most she used to be in like
hanging baskets and cut flower industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and as she sees more of how much cannabis
really needs some help with their
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated pest management plans and you
know IPM strategies she's come into this
[SPEAKER_00]: space and so I actually you know caught
these little thrips and put them in this
[SPEAKER_00]: little vial and sent them off to her and
it's a brand new species of thrips that is
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the West Coast well and I don't
know if it's a trip specifically but I
[SPEAKER_01]: remember there was something that was
unleashed somewhere north of you now
[SPEAKER_01]: you're shaking your head but you know the
story I'm telling right like to combat
[SPEAKER_00]: something else yeah but is that a false
kind of it's a really bad rumor it's this
[SPEAKER_00]: is this is one of those rumors that just
makes me cringe a little bit because it
[SPEAKER_00]: got so widespread and it took me maybe 10
minutes of googling to find the
[SPEAKER_00]: information so what it is is that Caltrans
workers created this biological assay to
[SPEAKER_00]: combat star thistle and tumbleweed and
there were yeah there were two different
[SPEAKER_00]: predator not predator there were two
different pests that they released and one
[SPEAKER_00]: of them was a type of mite but it was a
Grecian gall mite I believe or a Grecian
[SPEAKER_00]: blister might I can't quite remember
exactly what it was totally different
[SPEAKER_00]: species totally different you know very
very different animal altogether and
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody found out about that and went oh
my gosh Caltrans released mites and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: basically where that whole thing came from
but it's not the same might the hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: russet mite is very specific to cannabis
it doesn't go to other plants so people
[SPEAKER_00]: worry about like oh it's gonna go to my
tomatoes and live on my tomatoes and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: never get rid of it and then it'll you
know move back and forth it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually work that way hemp russet mites
very much a hemp russet mite cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiast exactly the proud canvas
enthusiast it does not like vegetables
[SPEAKER_01]: well okay so it seems like thrips hit
everywhere yeah nobody was spared how did
[SPEAKER_01]: like when you were talking to other
cultivators who weren't using some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: methodologies that you were using kind of
what was the the comparison and the damage
[SPEAKER_01]: done or the plants rigorous defense
against the pests yeah I mean that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting thing that I haven't really
thought about too much most people with
[SPEAKER_00]: their thrips it it damaged the plants
pretty bad I mean we had them pretty bad
[SPEAKER_00]: it was they were like you know it was not
hard to find some to put in a little jar
[SPEAKER_00]: but we don't really like spraying
pesticides or anything and we were getting
[SPEAKER_00]: close to the end of the run so we were
just like well you know we'll just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know wash them down with water and
you know try and mitigate and manage them
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit but the interesting thing is
the end result flower was still really
[SPEAKER_00]: good I mean we still had really great
nutrient uptake the plants didn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: suffer at all I mean unless you got up
close you couldn't really even tell that
[SPEAKER_00]: there was that much of a problem and we
did do a lot of predatory releases we
[SPEAKER_00]: released aureus which is a minute pirate
bug is what it's called and so that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: predator we released a predatory wasp and
then we released the minute pirate bug
[SPEAKER_00]: both to kind of help us combat them and it
took down the population it made it
[SPEAKER_00]: manageable but it didn't again it didn't
seem to impact the plants terribly
[SPEAKER_01]: detrimentally so your main strategy was
predatory bugs mm-hmm yeah did you have
[SPEAKER_01]: any friends who had other strategies that
were effective or people still kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like to pretend like things happen that
didn't so like I know a friend there was
[SPEAKER_00]: like oh we totally got rid of our thrips
like by I think they use dr. Zimes or
[SPEAKER_00]: something and I was like that's awesome
and then when I looked at you know one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaves them all no you didn't like
it's almost like everybody just feels
[SPEAKER_01]: shame yeah something and doesn't want to
just come out and say we all got it yeah I
[SPEAKER_00]: have no shame I'm like people are like oh
have you ever dealt with russets I'm like
[SPEAKER_00]: oh yeah plenty of times of course I mean
any time you bring a plant onto your
[SPEAKER_00]: property you're probably bringing russets
in but the great thing is if you deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: them once generally that's all it takes to
get really good on your quarantine process
[SPEAKER_00]: and then after that you're like oh
whatever russets aren't a big deal spider
[SPEAKER_01]: mites easy to take care of what was the
movie the sharks and the like from the 70s
[SPEAKER_01]: the West Side Story yeah two gangs in the
West Side Story or the Bloods in the Crips
[SPEAKER_01]: or any the Celtics in the Lakers being
from Boston what would you say to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: the living soy or the soil food web camp
to get them to give KNF a chance like what
[SPEAKER_01]: what are some of the the compelling
arguments you know it's really there's I
[SPEAKER_00]: actually just spoke with somebody at one
of our regenerative conference because
[SPEAKER_01]: point being two years or how many years
ago did you do zero KNF and yeah like
[SPEAKER_01]: three years ago yeah three years ago so
it's only been three years for you so talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about the finding Jesus and I will be
honest like when I first heard about it I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like Korean natural farming but we're
not in Korea like we're using rice to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect our indigenous microorganisms but
we don't have right like we don't grow
[SPEAKER_00]: rice and then like well actually
California does grow rice but but at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning I was kind of like I don't know
about this this seems like pretty bizarre
[SPEAKER_00]: to me and what turned for me was we went
out to the beach and I collected a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of seaweed and I was talking with my
friend Leighton who's a scientist on the
[SPEAKER_00]: East Coast and I was like okay so I have
all this seaweed like I'm kind of thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: should I dry it out and like pulverize it
and like how much work do I really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do on this maybe I'll just dump it into
compost should I feed it to my earthworms
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what do you think Leighton
and he's like you know what you should do
[SPEAKER_00]: you should ferment it and it was like oh
boy are you going down the rabbit hole too
[SPEAKER_00]: he's like I am I've gone down the KNF
rabbit hole I'm going deep it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting actually like why don't you
just just try it just give a shot see what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens so I took the seaweed that we had
which was a bladder rack and it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: weirdest thing and I loved it it turned
into this like when you poured it it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like thick yeasty cake batter almost and
it was like kind of slimy and gooey and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was just so fun to play with and by the
time the ferment was done I was like okay
[SPEAKER_00]: if this is this much fun like if this is
this cool I have to learn more about it
[SPEAKER_00]: and and then just started using it and for
me I really like the fact that these are
[SPEAKER_00]: all inputs that are made for our human
body as well so as soon as I started
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into that and I made our first or
Oriental herbal nutrient or OHN and
[SPEAKER_00]: started taking that internally I was like
man this stuff is gold this we do not my
[SPEAKER_00]: family doesn't get sick anymore I have a
four-year-old and an eight-year-old and I
[SPEAKER_00]: guarantee you they're swimming in germs
the only one who got a cold in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: two years pretty much has been my
four-year-old who doesn't like the OHN and
[SPEAKER_00]: myself when I was on vacation and forgot
to bring it with me and I knew I that my
[SPEAKER_00]: kids were sick and I was like oh man but
you know it's just like wow if this if
[SPEAKER_00]: this can help the human body this much
against pathogens and diseases and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's got to be good for our plants
and so just you know started using it
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty minimally at the beginning and
again like I said when I first started I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't know it was a full year so I was
like you know making a big huge vat with I
[SPEAKER_00]: had some FPJ and some OHN and a little bit
of um what was I putting in at the time
[SPEAKER_00]: brown rice vinegar and I didn't have
recipes I was just kind of going off what
[SPEAKER_00]: people were saying online so it was just
kind of well that's what I was gonna ask
[SPEAKER_01]: next is what was kind of your original
recipe and then kind of what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: iterative improvement of that yeah the I
don't think I even had an original recipe
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly I was just like you know how much
do we put in guys people like I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: try this much and we're like okay oh and
LAB that was the other one actually LAB
[SPEAKER_00]: was our first first foray into KNF so
that's lactic acid bacteria serum so
[SPEAKER_00]: you're basically taking milk and you're
letting it kind of ferment and turn into
[SPEAKER_00]: curds and weigh and then you take the
curds off and you're left with this
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful LAB that is just phenomenal I
mean like we had a micronutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency I think that's what it was at
some point there was something going on
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was all we had made because that
was the first thing I tried and I was like
[SPEAKER_00]: this was easy like let's do this more and
my husband was like well what do we do
[SPEAKER_00]: with it now and I'm like I don't know what
do we do with the people and people are
[SPEAKER_00]: like I don't know water it in we're like
okay so we did and within two days we saw
[SPEAKER_00]: that micronutrient deficiency just
disappear and I still like I mean you know
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going from memory from a couple years
back so I don't know for certain what
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly else was happening but I was just
like okay this is cool and so then playing
[SPEAKER_00]: with things finally last year I went to
Boise Idaho and studied under Chris Trump
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was where everything started
really making sense because you leave
[SPEAKER_00]: there with this beautiful sheet of recipes
and you leave with all this intrinsic
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge about how to use each recipe and
when to use it and in what ratios and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like okay how do you make fermented sea
water and why do you want to do that and
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you use it for and so then getting
to come back and really start implementing
[SPEAKER_00]: that and doing it the right way and then
having a background in growing cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and knowing how to see nutrient
deficiencies and be like oh I have the
[SPEAKER_00]: input for that that's going to be a little
bit of this and a little bit of that so
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll kind of you know there's some
blending of recipes that does happen now
[SPEAKER_00]: just because I've done it enough where I
know like okay this I know this needs
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium and I know that water soluble
calcium or phosphate phosphate pardon me
[SPEAKER_00]: and I know the WCAP is our phosphate for
this so I know that I'm going to add that
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're not in this particular stage of
development so we're going to add it to
[SPEAKER_00]: this one instead and then I also love
doing side-by-sides so that's been really
[SPEAKER_00]: eye-opening this year as well we did our
seed soak treatment and I did the same
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds same cultivar started them in the
same soils the whole nine yards and I did
[SPEAKER_00]: the SES which is our maintenance solution
or a seed soak treatment I did plain water
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a few years back I'd soaked in a
fulvic acid solution and it worked really
[SPEAKER_00]: well I got really much faster germination
a better germination rate so I was like
[SPEAKER_00]: well if SES is good and fulvic acid was
good I should add them together and then
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll be like gangbusters absolutely
incorrect I absolutely incorrect I was
[SPEAKER_00]: shocked we got the worst germination rate
worse than plain water and the plants did
[SPEAKER_00]: not grow as fast right now I've got some
pictures up on our Instagram that shows
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see this was SES and this is SES
and fulvic the ones that we had just the
[SPEAKER_00]: straight Korean natural farming darker
green they don't have any leaf drop
[SPEAKER_00]: showing they're not picking up any
micronutrient deficiencies the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: had fulvic acid added and this is months
ago months ago they've been treated the
[SPEAKER_00]: same ever since micronutrient deficiencies
lighter green it's having a harder time
[SPEAKER_00]: with uptaking nitrogen the bottoms of the
leaves are yellowing and following off I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean it's it's just like I was like wow
this is so cool to actually see this and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know do a side-by-side and really know
that like it's been developed a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: way and it's probably perfect the way it
is for the most part what do you call that
[SPEAKER_01]: in pharmaceuticals they're like
contraindications or something yes that
[SPEAKER_00]: like these two drugs should not be
together yeah and we found it was even
[SPEAKER_00]: worse for our luffa sponges so the luffa
sponges was an 85% germination rate I
[SPEAKER_00]: think yeah I think was 85% is what we
ended with with the SES and they started
[SPEAKER_00]: germinating within like 24 hours luffa
sponges can take to up to three months for
[SPEAKER_00]: these seeds to germinate I was like oh
this is really fast the plain water we had
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 80% germination rate but they were
last I measured they were a good two and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half inches shorter in average height than
the SES and the SES and fulvic we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% germination rate and they just kind of
like grew up and fell over I was like okay
[SPEAKER_00]: good to know that was that was not a wise
choice FPJ I think is a really good one
[SPEAKER_00]: for people to start with it's really easy
it's pretty hard to mess up FPJ is
[SPEAKER_00]: fermented plant juice so basically the
only difficulty with that one is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're supposed to be up in the morning
before the Sun touches your plants and you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to just take the growing tips of your
plants not the whole plant not the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: if you go off information online or in old
books there's all kinds of different ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it that are not the right way and
one of the first ones I made had like the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots and it was like knock the soil off
but you know gently it's okay if it's in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and turns out that no that's not
really a good idea but yeah like I said we
[SPEAKER_00]: do our FPJs with seaweed so that has this
whole different profile than like the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing mustard tips from the you know
wild mustard that's in our yard a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people do FPJs out of aloe vera so there's
just you know it's just it's so widely
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse and it's so easy to do it's a
great one for people to start getting into
[SPEAKER_00]: but you never spray FPJ alone so you
always have to at least add your OHN which
[SPEAKER_00]: is your Oriental Herbal Nutrient and
that's a tincture so you have angelica,
[SPEAKER_00]: garlic, ginger, cinnamon, and licorice and
you ferment it first with either sugar or
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar and beer and then you do a tincture
and you stir it every day for three months
[SPEAKER_00]: and do different five different
extractions and at the end you end up with
[SPEAKER_00]: this really amazing nutrient solution
that's really healthy for you and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really healthy for the plants and when you
add it to your FPJ it just creates this
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful microbial colonies on your
plants that make it extremely resistant to
[SPEAKER_00]: pests and diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you applying a consistent
concoction throughout the life cycle or
[SPEAKER_01]: like the what was the first one?
[SPEAKER_01]: FPJ?
[SPEAKER_01]: OHN?
[SPEAKER_01]: FPJ and OHN you basically create those two
solutions you mix them and then that's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of your foliar spray for the entire
process or are you adding other things at
[SPEAKER_01]: certain points?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah you can use that that's that's the
maintenance spray so it's brown rice
[SPEAKER_00]: vinegar, OHN, and FPJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your FPJ is one to let's see FPJ is one to
five hundred I think and then OHN is one
[SPEAKER_00]: to a thousand and brown rice vinegar is
one to one thousand so you're using very
[SPEAKER_00]: very minute amounts of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintenance spray you can use up to once a
week anytime doesn't matter but what you
[SPEAKER_00]: really want to do is dial into your life
cycle and the nutrient cycling of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're at the beginning in the
vegetative stage then you want to add some
[SPEAKER_00]: other things to it so FAA which is your
fish amino acid so that takes about three
[SPEAKER_00]: to six months at least to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these are processes that you
know you have to really start them and
[SPEAKER_01]: this is also foliar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foliar yep yep and so you want to start
some of these way ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a pinch we've used fish hydrolysate
instead of FAA because we didn't have it
[SPEAKER_00]: but and then you have your water soluble
calcium and you have a water soluble
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium phosphate and those are used at
different times too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your maintenance solution good to go
anytime you have a vegetative growth
[SPEAKER_00]: solution you have a you know flowering or
finishing fruiting solution you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: changeover solution so that's generally
used like if you were doing light
[SPEAKER_00]: deprivation or an indoor you'd use that
during your transition phase which is
[SPEAKER_00]: usually about a week before your life
cycle changes in a week into it and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you also there's a a ripening formula a
ripening enhancement formula that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of started playing with and
tinkering with a little bit and seeing how
[SPEAKER_00]: to use it and when to use it and you know
what the effects are yeah and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects are because that's the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when those control groups really
come into play like if you put it on
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you don't really know what
worked and what didn't because you put it
[SPEAKER_00]: on everything but if I know that this
plant got it and this plant didn't or this
[SPEAKER_00]: section did and this section didn't and I
have that control group I can come back
[SPEAKER_00]: and really say listen this isn't
subjective this isn't me thinking that
[SPEAKER_00]: this has a better terpene profile or that
this was more pest resistant this is me
[SPEAKER_00]: actually having data to prove it and I
think that the cannabis industry has a
[SPEAKER_00]: very difficult time collecting some
relevant data because we get excited about
[SPEAKER_00]: things and we just go you know hog wild
and do it on everything and we forget
[SPEAKER_00]: about the fact that we now really don't
have anything to show that it actually did
[SPEAKER_00]: what we think it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a big proponent of like at least
just at least you know a few of them leave
[SPEAKER_00]: them alone and see what happens and make
sure that it is doing what it's you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what you think it's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like nutrients are there's
nutrient intake through the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah absolutely okay which is why KNF is
so cool for cannabis because it is so
[SPEAKER_00]: responsive like you really you do really
see changes in a day or two minimum if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing if you're doing it right and
if you're doing it wrong you'll see that
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty quickly too which is nice because
then you can bounce back and be like okay
[SPEAKER_00]: fix it with that whoops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could I mean as an example just to
test things out you could have like soil
[SPEAKER_01]: that's deficient in some critical nutrient
and you're providing these foliar sprays
[SPEAKER_01]: where the plant will the leaves won't turn
yellow the plants like I'm still cool yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: like I may not be getting it through the
roots I'm getting the suppository or so
[SPEAKER_01]: like I'm not getting it through the mouth
I'm getting the suppository but it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still doing its job and then Korean
natural farming also does implement a
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil very much so indigenous
microorganisms is like the base of it so
[SPEAKER_00]: without that you you have a harder time I
mean we did one in I think had a little
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated bed that didn't have you know the
soil wasn't great it was there's one the
[SPEAKER_00]: ends of one of our beds it's just always
lacking it still can't figure out what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on down there but those ones even
with the Korean natural farming they were
[SPEAKER_00]: lacking so we're gonna do a better
inoculation with our indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms this year and see if that
doesn't snap that area out of it but you
[SPEAKER_00]: usually are using these you know mycelial
mats to keep your soils up to health and
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep that fungally dominant as well and
what are you are you growing in like
[SPEAKER_01]: raised beds or pots or in the ground or
all of the above no no pots no pots we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't do pots anymore so we have raised
beds we have mounded they're not like you
[SPEAKER_00]: know hugelkultur yes I actually mother
would pronounce it correctly but I love my
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my hugel beds at home and oh my
gosh the water usage on that is insanely
[SPEAKER_00]: small like I was shocked I watered it one
third of the time compared to the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: my garden I was just like absolutely
mind-blown it's it's so cool and just the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal dominance of it I mean I can like
dig a sample of soil out and get it under
[SPEAKER_00]: my microscope and immediately find
beneficial fungi it's sure like you
[SPEAKER_01]: basically have rotting logs and yeah dank
environment yeah so with the raised beds
[SPEAKER_01]: are you like what's kind of the typical
dimension of a raised bed oh gosh
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody does it differently ours happen
to be four feet by 80 feet okay three feet
[SPEAKER_01]: by 80 feet and so basically what you're
doing there is your and so in that 80 feet
[SPEAKER_00]: how many plants are you getting well our
well it depends I think that we depends on
[SPEAKER_00]: the size so you know generally our light
depth we're using clones and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: planting them every foot to foot and a
half and we have I think two rows that go
[SPEAKER_00]: down the bed and I know that in the entire
five thousand square foot garden we run
[SPEAKER_00]: nine hundred and sixty plants okay and
that's in one two that's in eight
[SPEAKER_01]: different beds but I guess where I'm going
is is the idea here that like a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people historically have done pots where
each plants root system is isolated but
[SPEAKER_01]: you kind of want every all the root
systems to be partying together and with
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbes and the fun you know the
fungal just everything together not like
[SPEAKER_01]: pot one its own eco system pot to its own
ecosystem like silo siloed ecosystems you
[SPEAKER_01]: want kind of everything and then I guess
with with like your like drip irrigation
[SPEAKER_01]: are using like blue mad or anything like
that to kind of keep sort of the the
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture level consistent like you're
using tensiometers or anything the like so
[SPEAKER_01]: do you get scenarios where like you know
the the warmer sunnier side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse maybe is drier in the soil than
like the far end of the greenhouse that's
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe cooler and less light so our in that
180 foot raised bed right so our light
[SPEAKER_00]: deprivation is actually open air we don't
have it enclosed so there is no greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: effect happening we don't tend to see that
much of a difference in I mean we do have
[SPEAKER_00]: drip take irrigation but it's just on a
timer and you know we hand water in our
[SPEAKER_00]: you know our soil drench of whichever it
might be usually at least once or twice a
[SPEAKER_00]: week and really just yeah I don't see a
lot of difference with that and I mean I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know I'm kind of an old-school
farmer people take this they're like oh
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to pH your water and you got to
get your blue mad on your little thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that measures all that and I'm like or you
can just talk to your plants and go stick
[SPEAKER_00]: your finger in the dirt and find out
what's going on so generally that's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of what we do is we we you know watch our
plants and we see what they need and we
[SPEAKER_00]: take it as a you know as part of our
interaction with what we do and with what
[SPEAKER_00]: we love to do and I think that makes a
difference too I think it you know you
[SPEAKER_00]: notice things a lot faster when you're out
there you know if you're assuming that
[SPEAKER_00]: your blue mat is going to take care of all
your watering needs so that you're you
[SPEAKER_00]: know doing something else with your time
and you're not in your garden it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to miss those things and all of a
sudden you know you see these horrible
[SPEAKER_00]: photos of people with like like aphids
like I've seen cannabis covered in aphids
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm like how did it get to this point
like where did that how did you not notice
[SPEAKER_00]: you had aphids before they were so
encrusted that like there's just no
[SPEAKER_00]: salvaging that and when you're out there
you know in your plants with your face you
[SPEAKER_00]: know in the leaves and your fingers in the
soil and you're really interacting it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just you notice things way faster and
that's another great thing with the Korean
[SPEAKER_00]: natural farming is you're in there and
you're like oh you know I this is I got a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a zinc deficiency okay let's
see or let's go check out our inputs and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know figure out which one of these
might have zinc in it and go do a full
[SPEAKER_01]: year all right well Wendy I appreciate the
time it is probably like 8 30 at night
[SPEAKER_01]: you've been on camera all day and I think
we're gonna do a course out of this right
[SPEAKER_01]: we are specific video but you're gonna do
a seminar a six-week two-hour each week
[SPEAKER_01]: workshop and we're gonna film it and make
an online version of it so that people who
[SPEAKER_01]: don't live in Humboldt can yeah come enjoy
and appreciate it so I'm excited for that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited to teach people cuz
it's a it's really easy to get bad
[SPEAKER_00]: information online and you know having
gone through it myself and really made a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of errors at the beginning because I'm
trying to figure out how to do things and
[SPEAKER_00]: people say oh you pull you do it like this
and I'm like okay and like no that's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually that's totally not right at all
maybe one day Elaine will attend one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the classes yes well we she'll be in the
front row she will be in she'll be like oh
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about this I don't know then
eventually I'll get her to scope my rice
[SPEAKER_00]: and she'll be like oh okay it looks pretty
good yeah you you
