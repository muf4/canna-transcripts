[SPEAKER_02]: I think over the last two weeks,
having experienced most of the pain points
[SPEAKER_02]: of the panel, my direct self with my own
two hands, that I think that it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's a little bit more somber
and a little less exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot more reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really wish, and I hate to burst
your bubble, Peter, I really wish this was
[SPEAKER_02]: a packed house because everyone needs to
hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're filming it, but we also have
a bunch of people smoking weed outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they want that cannabis and they
want it easy and they want to buy it from
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern Californians, they want to buy it
from a heritage growing region,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we have to talk about how this
cannabis is going to get down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to talk about how we're going to
work together, cultivators to retailers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to talk about how cultivators have
to, you know, have to adjust.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to talk about retailers adjusting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to talk about distribution
adjusting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to talk about legal adjusting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's all of these different
things that, you know, there's adjustments
[SPEAKER_02]: we have to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really sucks because the lives of a
lot of these cultivators hang in the
[SPEAKER_02]: balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of us are either two weeks
away or two weeks past a big loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we don't have time to fight it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were hoping this would be,
you know, sort of a distilling of some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the retail climate in this area of what
we've had to deal with as Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: California cultivators coming down into
Southern California and the introduction
[SPEAKER_02]: to the retail market and how it is that we
could do this without as much pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before, you know, I go up, here is one
of my favorite people on the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, somebody that, you know,
when they showed up at a meeting,
[SPEAKER_02]: at a Mendocino Cannabis Policy Council
meeting, you know, four years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: we were like, oh damn, now that's pro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have a chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Hezekiah, you know, showed up for us
and, you know, informing the CGA was a
[SPEAKER_02]: really big rallying point for the Northern
California farmers to feel like we had a
[SPEAKER_02]: voice in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, you know, it was the first
introduction to policy for a lot of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Hezekiah coming from a long background
of environmental advocacy work up in
[SPEAKER_02]: Sacramento, it really made it easy for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it made, oh shit, nothing made
it easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gave us confidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that sound?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were outspent 100 to one on most
bills that came through the House for the
[SPEAKER_02]: first two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were victorious on most of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we had, you know, put it this way,
being outspent to that, to that degree and
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to get the victories we were
able to eke out for the small cultivators
[SPEAKER_02]: in Northern California to be able to exist
in this current framework while we had
[SPEAKER_02]: people like Sean Parker putting millions
of dollars to advocate that to Kamala
[SPEAKER_02]: Harris that the only way to stop narco
trafficking was to put it in the hands of
[SPEAKER_02]: four, four large corporations and let the
big boys manage it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we were fucking up as small batch
cultivators and we were cartel and we were
[SPEAKER_02]: evil and we were water extractors hiring
surveys from different water authorities
[SPEAKER_02]: to create this, you know, the stigma
around what it was that we were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've had a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Hezekiah sat up there every day
meeting new people that we were running
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was up there in the face of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really, really proud to have him,
you know, by our side or at our head or
[SPEAKER_02]: wherever he was.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Justin's also excited to have the rest of
the other guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's unfair.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_06]: You piped him up so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a great guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I did take a hit of tarantula before
I came in here and it did have Sativa
[SPEAKER_02]: Keefe on it.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: After the panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Bobby.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby is a I mean OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other day we were trying to figure
out how we were going to do this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And quite a few days ago and Bobby stepped
up big time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's my new Bobby big time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one before now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the new one because at the end of
the day he has a business that he is is
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to navigate all these hurdles and
go through all these loopholes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was able to go to his comfort zone
to say, hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe what it is that you guys are
doing enough to let you guys figure your
[SPEAKER_02]: shit out through us for this event.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it wasn't for Bobby, this event
wouldn't be going on right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it wasn't for somebody to step up and
actually say they would do it like that
[SPEAKER_02]: shit wouldn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's big time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you so much, Bobby.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like, yeah, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we got Eric, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eric is like is number one here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, you know, Long Beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met him and with Susan Soares,
you know, helped her do what she was doing
[SPEAKER_02]: in Long Beach for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: C4 distribution getting in.
[SPEAKER_02]: He he actually threw the first cannabis
event in this space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I found out that he could do it
and Aaron hooked us up with the spot,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, man, we can do it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was really great as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eric.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we got a chance to hang out the
other day and he's been introducing me to
[SPEAKER_02]: different people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I found about, you know,
that he could be, you know, handling the
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution on the panel and that he's
had his own trials and tribulations in
[SPEAKER_02]: Southern California, he is going to be a
wealth of information for us all to learn
[SPEAKER_02]: what's really going on around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have Ariel Clark, who is who
is like what I heard is the gatekeeper to
[SPEAKER_02]: Santa Monica.
[SPEAKER_02]: But not only the gatekeeper, Santa Monica
is somebody that has been holding a really
[SPEAKER_02]: sacred message around you know,
around equal justice and around around
[SPEAKER_02]: native rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we met at a at a Native American
sort of like rights panel, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: something near and dear to my heart,
because every gram of cannabis that is
[SPEAKER_02]: grown in the desert is done with stolen
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're piping and they're going to be
shipping in water from outside of that
[SPEAKER_02]: region.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not belong to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, they might have a thousand foot
deep well, you know, but but soon enough
[SPEAKER_02]: that water is going to be coming from
Northern California and all of our water
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to be shipped into the desert to
large scale commodities grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be produced at around a
penny, maybe two cents, three cents,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and, you know, we need that message
going forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ariel is, you know, like stress
interest in protecting those rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and I definitely believe in
what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for protecting us in this
event, because as our law firm,
[SPEAKER_02]: at the end of the day, that's that's what
we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's who we've got to ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you so much, Ariel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And OK, so basically, here goes and starts
what we figure we'd run through right now
[SPEAKER_02]: is sort of like cultivation to distro.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's that's that's a pain
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Initially, a lot of you know, a lot of
distro companies that are distro
[SPEAKER_02]: companies, a lot of people, you know,
myself included, you know, is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: all right, what are we going to do to try
to figure it out?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not cultivating this year,
so I'm going to try to try to play distro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a fucking nightmare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I got to meet all of these people
that said they were distro.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't distro.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were had temp permits and a possible
joint venture with a guy in a warehouse
[SPEAKER_02]: with a bunch of other guys, usually like
five or 10 of them stacking their license
[SPEAKER_02]: or or their JVs to act as distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as cultivators, it's been really hard
to meet the right distro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like going down the line, I would,
you know, kind of like let's see the
[SPEAKER_02]: easiest way for for a cultivator like one
of these cultivators that might be out
[SPEAKER_02]: here to enter into the legal market to
come in through distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how do we get how do we get to that
basic point?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you know how do we trust a
distributor?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the first thing that you need to
do is understand what a distributor is and
[SPEAKER_01]: what a distributor isn't, because in
California, for the first time alongside
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevada, we actually have distribution
license licenses inside of a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: What that means is if you thought back to
the world of Colorado or Oregon or
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington, they don't have distributor
licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have transporter licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means that they don't have the
right to buy the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So distributors in a normal supply chain,
which California is the distributors,
[SPEAKER_01]: the one who buys the product, issues the
PO to the grower, buys the product and
[SPEAKER_01]: then sells it to the stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what distributors do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best way to figure out if you have
a real distributor is ask them that
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they understand that they're a real
distributor and there's plenty of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you look at the way distributors
in this industry have broken out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it used to be that everybody was a
distributor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you basically have three types of
distributors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have distributors who are really the
brands distribution arm into the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have distributors who are logistics
only distributors, meaning that you do the
[SPEAKER_01]: selling for them and they'll just deliver
your product to the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have full service
distributors who do all of the selling and
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the picking and packing and all of
the distributing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just deliver them the finished
product, so they'll test it, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the three types of
distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious, some of the folks in
different places in the supply chain,
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're seeing from other
distributors.
[SPEAKER_01]: People ask me all the time, well,
what are your competitors doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is lots of different stuff
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I had to spend time trying to
figure out what everyone else was doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't have any time to work on what
I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm curious what you guys see relative
to what I said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think the key to success is to
focus on your own business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good on you for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Worrying about what other people are up to
is oftentimes misguided, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin, Eric sort of heard how do you
trust a distributor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard what's the easiest way to find a
distributor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd question whether or not easy is
the right strategy there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The easiest thing is not always the best
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The easiest thing is to drop your price
and find somebody to take it from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably not the right way to do
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, it's existential for folks trying
to survive at a small scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Eric, you mentioned the three types.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think those are three great meta
categories.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we mapped out distribution,
we came up with 16 archetypal distributors
[SPEAKER_03]: broken into those three main categories.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a lot of different ways of
approaching distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, though, that the question at the
end of the day, Eric and I can disagree
[SPEAKER_03]: about a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a lot of fun doing that at
times.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the first question I'd advise
and the first question I ask of
[SPEAKER_03]: distributors is how many sales accounts do
you have?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your volume?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you moving?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's, well, I thought you were
going to do that, then cool, I'll get my
[SPEAKER_03]: own license.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, I'm not a grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a licensee currently.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up a grower and then cut my hair
and learned to tie a tie.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's growing back because fuck
politics, at least for the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I see it sort of from an outside
perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I recognize that when I say don't take
the easy path, sometimes you have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the nuts and bolts of making ends
meet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to sort of hedge against don't take
the easy path, I'd say don't get attached
[SPEAKER_03]: to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay flexible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay on your toes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sell as little as possible if you're
selling low.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just cover your bills.
[SPEAKER_03]: The market is going to change and grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will not be a simple commodity
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two cents a gram will exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so will differentiated pricing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis flour is not a commodity.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not interchangeable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's going to recover.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to bounce back.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a lot of room to grow,
especially as growers build cooperative
[SPEAKER_03]: supply chains, which I'm going to talk a
lot about today, and increase their
[SPEAKER_03]: confidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Markets run on confidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of market forces that we can
talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, confidence is a
very important market force.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we need to have more of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this dialogue is a great way
to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, to infuse a retail perspective into
the distribution discussion, if you're a
[SPEAKER_05]: producer out there who's wondering how to
make that happen, go to a respected
[SPEAKER_05]: retailer and ask him, who are you using?
[SPEAKER_05]: We have 40, maybe 50 distributors who we
work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And five to 10 of them are actually
professional outfits.
[SPEAKER_05]: You would be amazed at the way that people
drop the ball.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just being able to fulfill your promises,
to deliver things when they're supposed to
[SPEAKER_05]: be delivered, in the quantities that
they're supposed to be delivered,
[SPEAKER_05]: the proper items that are supposed to be
delivered.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's quite basic business.
[SPEAKER_05]: So focus on the fundamentals.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just say from a legal or
regulatory perspective, I just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: echo what everyone says.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that just kind of
generally you find partners that
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the rules and regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are licensed, you're asking questions
about their ability to follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do they understand tax structures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they understand rules?
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting a good laundry list of initial
questions and then making sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're licensed and that you've got the
appropriate contracts in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I'd take a crack at one of the
suggestions that Hezekiah talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is, if you want to get your
product to market, how do you get it to
market?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a couple of frameworks
that we can learn from other adjacent
[SPEAKER_01]: industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think about brew pubs,
for example, and craft beer, it feels a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole lot like craft cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do they make money?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, generally, the way they make money
is they supply to their community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their community starts out as a brew
pub.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one restaurant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they decide that people really
like mine, so I'm going to make more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they figure out that,
well, now I'm producing for a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of other people because I just know how to
produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm going to do is produce with
these seven other guys and we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: pay somebody to market that and get it to
a bigger market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the way you should think about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start start with your own confines and go
from there because the harder it is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get harder as you move away from your
home base.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where that's where leverage doesn't
work anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need the scale or the distance is
going to get in your way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you generally want to think about,
you know, I know it's hard for there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole lot of people in the same place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go find a place that's close by that your
relatives live in and see if you can
[SPEAKER_01]: supply them with their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But find one place first and then a second
place and then a third place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go right to the customer because that's
who's ultimately going to buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, in this business right now
and for the foreseeable future,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be the hard part is getting
to the customer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so since Eric followed up,
I'm going to follow up, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what he said is exactly correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to the customer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget all about the distributor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget all about the retailer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love you both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go meet the people who love your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get to know them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Social media has broken down the geo
geographical nature of the the brew pub
[SPEAKER_03]: model to some degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, you still have to have the
cannabis to consume it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, physical realities do still
matter to some degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: But get to know consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk directly to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many different kinds of
humans and it's so exciting how many
[SPEAKER_03]: humans there are and all different.
[SPEAKER_03]: They love all different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get to know them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find the people that love exactly what
you're doing and love your story.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the partners will be there to get it
in the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I do think Eric hit the nail on the
head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Farmers knowing consumers, the people who
make things, knowing the people who
[SPEAKER_03]: consume things is really good for humanity
in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's especially good when it comes to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I just hit on this?
[SPEAKER_06]: So as the retailer or do you get consumers
saying, hey, do you have this brand?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that sort of gets you thinking
about that brand and bringing them in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if a brand has really has really
garnered a following.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they're distributed exclusively
through a single company, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: that that definitely draws our attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like has was saying, you know,
if you believe in your product,
[SPEAKER_05]: there is someone else out there that does,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: There really is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you just got to find those people,
go to them, drum up demand grassroots.
[SPEAKER_05]: And before you know it, I've got consumers
asking me to stock it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm going to go stock it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very simple.
Simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we jumped ahead a little bit into
retail, but I would I would I would like.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on a journey here.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, we don't want to fill up a gas at
three quarters of the tank or to wait till
[SPEAKER_02]: we get a quarter.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the best journey analogy I could
come up with at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, so brands, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You form a brand, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to have you have five different
strains going into your brand,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it meets the brand ethos.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to have sativa, sativa hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to go down the gamut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to get them all tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're you're you're you're licensing sort
of, you know, multiple small batch
[SPEAKER_02]: strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to see you have to test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're looking at like five thousand
dollars, you know, to test as a brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is a distributor you helping alleviate
any of this for, say, creative in northern
[SPEAKER_02]: California?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we grow to keep genetic
diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we'll keep, you know, eight to ten
strains going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we if we get demand for five of
those and then we have to test all five of
[SPEAKER_02]: them, that that puts us out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how how as a distributor could you see
easing that pain of testing so brands can
[SPEAKER_02]: even get into the marketplace to see what
what performs well?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main answer, the main answer is the
real answer, which is writing a check for
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the product at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we do uniquely as opposed to if
you go directly to the 30 stores that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to put you in, they're going
to write you different checks and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to clear at different times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trust me, in this business, a quarter of
them are going to be checks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of the bags of cash and you're
going to get them at different times.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point is we're going to give it to you
all at the same time so that you can test
[SPEAKER_01]: it in as big a batch as you can test it
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you said five thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our tests cost five hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can do one test for a bigger
batch, that's the best way we can help you
[SPEAKER_01]: do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but the other thing I would tell you
is I would teach you that you want you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't you want to do them in cycles so
that you have a batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to necessarily do the way
that a lot of the rooms in L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: looked two years ago, which is they have,
you know, twenty five different strains in
[SPEAKER_01]: the same room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're two strains in the same room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So does that mean you don't have it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have it at different times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just adjust to to the situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the hard truth is, well,
a, this isn't the distributor 's fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the regulations fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to do a lot more in the state
capital.
[SPEAKER_03]: The regulatory requirements with regard to
testing are bad, not in that they test for
[SPEAKER_03]: things and keep consumers safe,
but in that they force us to test in a way
[SPEAKER_03]: that costs way more than is absolutely
required to keep consumers safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the big reasons I got involved in
the policy side was to make sure that
[SPEAKER_03]: people had good clean cannabis to smoke
because heavy metals are not great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And other things that come from those
types of pollutants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a regulatory problem,
first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Secondly, I would say that we do need to
start coordinating our crops to match with
[SPEAKER_03]: the regulatory requirements a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: 50 pound batch size.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should be growing 50 pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't need to be necessarily all
that you grow, but at least grow one or
[SPEAKER_03]: two 50 pound baseline batches that you can
get into the market at a more cost
[SPEAKER_03]: effective price.
[SPEAKER_03]: A pretty typical brand strategy that I'm,
you know, advising maybe seeing succeed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really hard to gauge success this
early on, but you know, you've got your
[SPEAKER_03]: two workhorse varietals that you grow your
big batch of that you can get into the
[SPEAKER_03]: market at cost effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe you have six small batch
varietals that are coming in behind that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's be fair, 50 pounds is a
relatively small batch to begin with in
[SPEAKER_03]: the face of some of what we're seeing
emerge these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not necessarily all on the
distributor to bring that cost down is the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it is going to require continued
organization and advocacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are things that the growers can do
to to help reduce those costs as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, at the end of the day,
I think we all need to do a much better
[SPEAKER_03]: job of communicating again directly with
consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a cost of growing California's
most sustainable, cleanest agricultural
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that cost is going to be reflected at
the gram, at the eighth, at the half ounce
[SPEAKER_03]: level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Frankly, I'm willing to pay 50 cents more
a gram to know that there was nothing
[SPEAKER_03]: funky that went into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we need to make sure that that is
commonly accepted and understood.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll mention the word again, cooperatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need more cooperation between
producer and consumer as well and more of
[SPEAKER_03]: an open dialogue there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we understand where the cost of the
product at the retail point is going in
[SPEAKER_03]: the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot that can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I wanted to piggyback on what
you're saying has a Kaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like this idea of it almost
sounds like reverse engineering,
[SPEAKER_00]: like what are the rules and regulations?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we have to navigate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Through and and and folks who are in
different segments of the market
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding those rules now granted,
they continue to change so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you're like standing on
quicksand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at some point they're going to firm up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, there are going to be tons
of changes over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, when we're talking about
how do we get to solutions, a lot of that
[SPEAKER_00]: is about information, knowledge,
knowledge sharing through cooperative
[SPEAKER_00]: associations, through trade associations,
as much as we can come together as a
[SPEAKER_00]: community and share information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, things like, hmm,
maybe this is a way I should approach this
[SPEAKER_00]: issue or how many strains I should have in
this room or what kind of issues might I
[SPEAKER_00]: come up against when my product goes to be
tested?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, my kind of my hope for us
all is more information sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for what all of all of we all do
and many people in the room who are
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in the discussion and sharing the
very valuable information.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to touch on the information about
these regulations and such getting out to
[SPEAKER_05]: consumers, I really view it as more of a
responsibility of all of us retailers,
[SPEAKER_05]: myself being a big part in that and
organizations like CGA or the SEC or
[SPEAKER_05]: whomever that's out there interfacing with
regulators.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's it's important for the end
consumer to know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've got all of those touch points,
tens of thousands of touch points.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm doing what I can.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that leads perfectly into my next
question, which is, we're going into
[SPEAKER_02]: retail.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so what as a retailer, could a
distributor do to ease?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not talking and I'm not talking
about the transpose and the manifest and
[SPEAKER_02]: all of those things like to drive traffic
for the brands, because at the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: day, anybody will do anything to get you
the right legal material if you're driving
[SPEAKER_02]: traffic and if we're selling cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what could the distributor do to help
you in brand education and getting you
[SPEAKER_02]: more skewed?
[SPEAKER_02]: That you feel are working better and being
a more dynamic relationship between retail
[SPEAKER_02]: and distribution.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say first off, it's not about
getting more skews.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about doing one skew really,
really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Start start there and move, you know,
expand as you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold your promises as a distributor,
you know, like I was mentioning before,
[SPEAKER_05]: we've got about five distribution
companies that are really, really good at
[SPEAKER_05]: what they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the rest are a pain in the ass to work
with because they don't they don't follow
[SPEAKER_05]: through.
[SPEAKER_05]: On what they're saying that they're going
to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So number one is just learn the
fundamentals of business and keep it
[SPEAKER_05]: simple and do it really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I really can't emphasize that
enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, as a an online business,
I essentially have an e-commerce business.
[SPEAKER_05]: The more marketing that you do for
yourself, like as was mentioning earlier,
[SPEAKER_05]: get on social media and really drum up
demand for your own product.
[SPEAKER_05]: That way, people are already salivating a
little bit when they hit my website,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and once they do hit my website,
give me really awesome like 2018 product
[SPEAKER_05]: shots that I can put up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me lab tests that are really easy for
me to display.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give me product descriptions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell, if you're a farmer, record a video
standing in front of that plant on your
[SPEAKER_05]: farm and I will put it on my website in
the product description so the end
[SPEAKER_05]: consumer can see exactly who the hell was
watering their their flower, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's just all of those things
and keeping it simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one thing not a distributor or a
retailer, but that I think is relevant to
[SPEAKER_03]: this conversation, you know, as I'm
reintegrating into the business community,
[SPEAKER_03]: lovingly known as sell more weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm allowed to say that now,
which I wasn't allowed to before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last time I did it, it's been about five
or six years since I've been in the game.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, frankly, strain names don't
mean anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: The consumers are totally confused by it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got 40,000 strains at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's probably 400 actual chemo types.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody can argue with me later.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love to have this fight.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's really good fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have this really, really strong sense
of pride in our craft.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we want to tell people all about all
the distinctions and the varieties and the
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now, we're also struggling with
something much bigger, which is the fact
[SPEAKER_03]: that we have an entrenched and mature
market that unfortunately hasn't been
[SPEAKER_03]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most consumers probably don't know that
they're getting cannabis from an
[SPEAKER_03]: unlicensed retailer.
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably don't know that that's
supporting an unlicensed supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably don't know that it's
untested, that it hasn't met those
[SPEAKER_03]: requirements we just talked about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as we're looking at bringing
several brands, this being one of them,
[SPEAKER_03]: several cooperative brands, mind you,
I'm only going to represent cooperative
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis from here on out, because I
believe humanity is competing itself into
[SPEAKER_03]: extinction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, as we as we move forward
with this, we're not advertising the
[SPEAKER_03]: farms, the varietals, the strains so much
as we're advertising our retail partners.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys are out there on the front
line.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to the general public to
understand that they are the gatekeeper to
[SPEAKER_03]: good, clean, sustainable cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a fact from now on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yes, of course, the video of the
person watering it is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what about a map of places to get
sustainable cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: What about little stars where every
retailer is?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, well, you can talk about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to stay away from talking about
them, frankly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, this idea of of
highlighting this new emerging market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And trust me, I've got one foot,
not one foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: A part of my heart is in the old world.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of my family, most of my friends
have not made this transition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it pains me deeply to say that what
we need to do is focus all of this
[SPEAKER_03]: attention on the licensed marketplace,
because I do think that there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: injustice embedded in our so-called
legalization initiative.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we've got a lot more work to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the truth of the matter is it is what
it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a pragmatic realist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at this point, we need people to be
going to the licensed stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's going to drive the market
that's going to make it so that people
[SPEAKER_03]: care.
[SPEAKER_03]: Care about our varietals and care about
our Appalachians and care about all of
[SPEAKER_03]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as we look at we will be acquiring a
delivery or a distribution license,
[SPEAKER_03]: expecting operational in March.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we look forward at our business
planning and, you know, it's really about
[SPEAKER_03]: highlighting the retailers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we want to do to help make
this thing work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to say that that's dead
correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The business is about the consumer and the
consumer has today too many ways to get
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it my estimate of the size of the
California demand market at retail is
[SPEAKER_01]: between 15 and 20 billion dollars a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we're on track to do three
billion of that through the white market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The black market channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means the black and gray channels are
between 12 and 17 billion dollars in size
[SPEAKER_01]: just in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eric, can I make a humble request when it
comes to semantics?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we describe it as regulated and
unregulated as opposed to black and white?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you OK with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you why it needs to be this way,
because there's a gray market and in order
[SPEAKER_01]: to get to gray, you have to see black and
white.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what if we have regulated, unregulated
and criminal?
[SPEAKER_01]: You like that better?
[SPEAKER_03]: Much better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like mountains better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I was just thinking about this today
because I'm writing it on paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my preference would be to preface it
by saying this is an economic term and it
[SPEAKER_01]: means something to economists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't make it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate that clarification.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so would that go criminal on black,
unregulated on gray and regulated on
[SPEAKER_02]: unregulated?
[SPEAKER_03]: Criminal is black, unregulated is gray,
and regulated is white.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of flip, reverse,
set one in the center.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I even feel bad even saying what I
just said because it actually doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Criminal will never go white in other
words.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, you don't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not true at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a big moonshine market today.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people that are
considered criminals that aren't.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just broke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they can't afford to get regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: That regulated market is a beast.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so I'll just clarify.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I use these three terms, regulated is
pretty clear, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Regulated means you have a license and you
can prove that you're following the rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unregulated means you would be if that was
attainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Criminal means you have no intent of
participating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the three camps that I see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have seven categories.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm big into archetypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll stick with the three.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, now I want to talk about
differentiation in the marketplace and how
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to happen from the
distribution and retail level and what you
[SPEAKER_02]: need from us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So meaning how do we honor Appalachians?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we honor sun and soil grown
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sun, star and moon grown cannabis,
as Swami would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do we get people to buy ugly weed
that isn't, but to them they're using used
[SPEAKER_02]: to vertically integrated indoors,
filling the shelves of their retailers?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the answer is tell a story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell it about the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell it about the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell it about the experience that you have
when you use the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them about why it's great product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell a story, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A brand needs to be built and brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have three sort of definitions of brand
that I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, a brand is what they say about
you when you leave the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two is a brand is the difference
between the product cost and the retail
[SPEAKER_01]: price.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole thing is brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brands build tribes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want a following, you said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a following.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's looking for brands that have
followings.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what great brands do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have followings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to be in the beer business and I'm
going to tell you a funny story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Narragansett beer was my brand and I would
go out and sell beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We we had three partners and we said for
the last 18 months of the time that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: there, we're going to go to 50 bars a week
each.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would go bar after bar after bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would if I walked into the bar and
they didn't have our beer, I would try to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they did have our beer, I would buy six
or eight of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd line them up on the on the bar and
anybody who wanted a beer, I'd try to give
[SPEAKER_01]: them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know that there was one type of
person who I could never give a
[SPEAKER_01]: Narragansett beer to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody want to guess who that was?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, plenty of women.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other guesses?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, they were grabbing two at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bud drinkers, you couldn't give them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all set.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, really, it's a free beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can afford my own beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, that's a tribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: When when you so the final definition of
brand is you have a real brand when
[SPEAKER_01]: someone won't accept a free version of a
competitive product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a real brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so that's good for what another task
you hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is another thing we have to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing to help create a
differentiation in the marketplace?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying like we're telling the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're we're.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nonstop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We feel like we tell our story all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in the grocery store telling our
story to each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: We practice and rehearse our story.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are so storied.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing down here to help us
create a differentiation in the
[SPEAKER_02]: marketplace?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this goes from distro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what can distro do for retailers?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what can retailers do to the
consumer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at the end of the day,
you know, yeah, we can put it on social.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of us don't go on social.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of us just grow really
good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like, what do we do when it
gets to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do you create that differentiation
in the marketplace?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I'm not saying how do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you helping do that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me start from the retail point of
view.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really about, like Eric said,
crafting a narrative if there's not one
[SPEAKER_05]: that already exists and it really
extracting it from your you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: your producing partner and and then taking
a chance and putting that out there and
[SPEAKER_05]: really standing behind it fully,
you know, and.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes you have to take risk,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: There are you were talking about
Appalachians, Justin, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: how do we really be make that a known
thing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, a distributor, a distributor can
call it whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_05]: A cultivator can call it whatever they
want, but it doesn't matter unless your
[SPEAKER_05]: retail partner is standing behind you and
what you believe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you are a manufacturer out there,
producer out there, you've got to find
[SPEAKER_05]: someone who's willing to take that risk
with you and really carve out a niche in
[SPEAKER_05]: the market and and the people who take
that risk are the people who create new
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful things and create movements.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of it is risk.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's it's really taking a chance
and.
[SPEAKER_05]: Being a godforsaken entrepreneur,
it's what we're all doing out here,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Few things again, not a distributor or
retailer, but I'm going to pine anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of different ways to tell
your story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tell my story to my close friends,
oftentimes with laughter and tears.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tell my story in the legislature with a
lot of strength and confidence,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I tell my consumer my story to the
consumer with a bit of lightheartedness
[SPEAKER_03]: and brevity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so keep in mind that marketing is a
particular type of storytelling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the second and most important thing,
in my opinion, is truth, truth in all
[SPEAKER_03]: things, but truth in advertising.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not all cannabis is great, even if you're
a great grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some cannabis is just not awesome,
and that's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a there's a place in the market
for that, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: The the number one thing that we can do to
damage our brands, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_03]: is describe it as top shelf when it's not
and try to charge top shelf prices for it
[SPEAKER_03]: when it doesn't warrant it.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, only one percent of the
flour grown a year is the top one percent
[SPEAKER_03]: of flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just how math works.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will pay more for the top one percent of
the harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of sore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been smoking well, not going to get
into how long I've been smoking because
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty young, but for long enough to
know the difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't want to get a sore
throat.
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter how pretty it looks,
if you didn't flush it, I'm going to get a
[SPEAKER_03]: sore throat when I smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, really being honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's there's actually a law that
you mentioned, the Appalachians law.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a few words in there that,
you know, they weren't there originally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I put them there and caught some flack
for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But standards and practices, in my
opinion, if we don't have clear,
[SPEAKER_03]: agreed upon standards with which we can
reference our story and fact check
[SPEAKER_03]: ourselves, then it's just a bunch of
marketing drivel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And who cares?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's tell the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what cannabis is about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And truth in advertising, truth in
marketing is what's going to make brands
[SPEAKER_03]: distinguish themselves, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be clear, that standards and
practices under the silo of origin don't
[SPEAKER_02]: make this a pain point discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I can I jump in with another
suggestion?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are trying to figure out how to
tell your story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And has a guy got on the right track when
he was talking about different things at
[SPEAKER_01]: different times in different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the most important things that a
grower needs to figure out is whether they
[SPEAKER_01]: just want to be a grower or they want to
be a grower and have a brand, because
[SPEAKER_01]: those are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you just want to be a grower,
go find a bunch of other growers and get
[SPEAKER_01]: together and find one of them who wants to
build a brand and use all their stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what a co-op is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's ocean spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's exactly what a co-op is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't want to do it as a co-op,
do it as a different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point is, there's lots of ways you
could do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has a guy's favorite ways of co-op.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do it his way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but don't try to do it if you don't
want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't be confused if you're not
getting it right, if you're not spending
[SPEAKER_01]: any time on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, be having a brand to be in a
public figure being a public figure is
[SPEAKER_03]: tricky, especially for underground
growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, let's just be real, especially if
you want to have a personality driven
[SPEAKER_03]: brand like it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, there's not going
to be 50,000 cannabis brands that emerge
[SPEAKER_03]: from California.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how many growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We estimate there were.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's probably going to be a few
hundred, maybe a few thousand.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, a lot of
growers working together is how we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to build the brand network that's
going to make this market work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, please do, please.
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming from that perspective, I have a
collective of 60 farmers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in order to maximize, you know,
our resources and pool our cannabis,
[SPEAKER_07]: and our expertise, we need to have one
brand for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you said, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But here we are faced with a deep
regulation that's in front of us that
[SPEAKER_07]: might just totally hinder that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So do you have any advice or understanding
that might help us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the the regulation that she's talking
about, I think it's five zero three two,
[SPEAKER_00]: which basically disallows the languages,
non licensees, cannot be on a branded
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: A non licensee cannot give specific
direction to a licensee on how they can
[SPEAKER_00]: put together a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically kind of puts aside this white
labeling arrangement and a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: things, because actually taken to any sort
of logical or legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, frankly, analysis, that section
would mean that you like their their
[SPEAKER_00]: issues with contracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So question whether you could even enter
into a contract for a lease, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to own the property.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the whole thing is kind of
outrageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our firm, tons of other firms,
lots of organizations wrote many lengthy
[SPEAKER_00]: pages about why this section is very
problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully this will get kicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if the reason why we saw it
written as such is really because the the
[SPEAKER_00]: agencies really want to see more
transparency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what they're going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made some proposals as to how we can
kind of change the language.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the in the case that you're talking
about, if you're talking about 60
[SPEAKER_00]: licensees, then you are a licensee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that I don't see that you would have a
you would have a problem were I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't know the specifics of your
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if everyone if you are all licensed,
you would not be impacted by the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: section is written.
[SPEAKER_00]: From what I know of what you're
describing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, would it be true if that if the
brand didn't represent all of the farmers,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the farmers are selling through the
brand?
[SPEAKER_01]: And can I do mind if I just jump in here
because she's dead on this isn't going to
[SPEAKER_01]: fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't fly because it flies in the
face of normal licensing, everyday
[SPEAKER_01]: business, whether you're talking about the
media industry or or toys or candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let me just say one more thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can show you how to defeat it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give a share of your stock to
everybody in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One share.
[SPEAKER_01]: You call them an owner and they all own
the license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, basically, if the if the rule
if the rule goes as is as drafted,
[SPEAKER_00]: give me a call and we'll share with you
the way to get around it, which is like
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the point of the rules if we're
just trying to figure out all these ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to get around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But OK, if that's your system,
like we were saying earlier, then we know
[SPEAKER_00]: what your game is and we'll give you what
you want to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that I mean, if we're we
passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my God has a guy like we like
worked on this whole statewide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's regulate the industry program over
all of these years because we care about
[SPEAKER_00]: the cottage industry, because we care
about the small, medium sized operators,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we care about diversity in the
industry, because we care about women and
[SPEAKER_00]: people of color and opportunity for people
to create wealth that have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these like, you know, wonderful,
truthful, beautiful things that make our
[SPEAKER_00]: hearts sing and make us wake up every day
and do the work that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just another example of
regulations really kind of dampening that
[SPEAKER_00]: hugely and potentially pushing a lot of
that side, because then you have smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: or just brands or smaller operators who
can't go and get a license and enter the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I was saying there, you know,
we'll figure out workarounds and hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the, you know, letters and lobbying
and dissatisfaction that we have all
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed in written and many other forms
will will, you know, we'll see some
[SPEAKER_00]: changes in the rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to bring something up here and,
you know, something that I do often in
[SPEAKER_03]: life, which is why did that happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to try my best not to be
negative here, but it's bordering on a
[SPEAKER_03]: slippery slope there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are people who are lobbying for
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are people who believe that since
they have a license, everyone else should
[SPEAKER_03]: be shut out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a tendency in regulated markets to
see barriers to entry as a good thing
[SPEAKER_03]: because it solidifies your control of your
place in the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a very clear understanding in
2014 that there was an environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: crisis and a public safety crisis caused
by the lack of regulation for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I moved to Sacramento to do was to
try to add a third to that list,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is that there is also a small
business crisis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real hardworking Californians are also in
crisis because of the lack of regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a pretty damn good job,
but we could have done better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason that in some ways that I'm
shifting the focus that I am and that I've
[SPEAKER_03]: been so focused on conversations direct
with consumer is that we need Californians
[SPEAKER_03]: to stand up for other Californians.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need everyone to realize and recognize
that our small business owners,
[SPEAKER_03]: that beautiful diversity that Ariel
outlined of all the different boxes and
[SPEAKER_03]: even the people who don't fit into any
boxes, they have a place in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't do a good enough job of making
that message known.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't do a good enough job of making
that the consensus, but we're not lost
[SPEAKER_03]: yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not done yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We still need it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need every single person to tell 10
more that there is a small business
[SPEAKER_03]: crisis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are losing a wealth of value,
frankly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are people who who actually see
it the opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: They see their wealth through a controlled
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see the wealth as something that we all
need to share.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think all of you do, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably why we're here together.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are there are folks who don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so do always remember, you know,
the parable of of of sheep's and wolf's
[SPEAKER_03]: clothing and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're right there the other way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just remember that different people have
different motivations and different
[SPEAKER_03]: intentions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Eric, do you have something in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to open it up to questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have one bit of good news before
you open it up for question.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good news is that the guy that we just
elected governor of the great state of
[SPEAKER_01]: California is a small business guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He ran on small business.
[SPEAKER_01]: His Blue Ribbon Commission report had a
small business clause in it where he was
[SPEAKER_01]: protecting the small business owners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he hasn't been in a control position
like he's going to be in in January.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there's good, good things
happening on the horizon for small
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think any large politician
actually has all of our best interests at
[SPEAKER_02]: heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he was, you know, he's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I'll give him an ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So does anybody have any pressing
questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like some of the best minds in the
biz.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like right in front of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what about research license status?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard it talked about.
[SPEAKER_04]: People claim it's in the works,
but I can't find anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we we've had, I think,
three successive years of bills.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've never actually gotten it out of the
legislature.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason being, I mean, when you talk
about it, it really does depend on our on
[SPEAKER_03]: what type of research you're talking
about, I guess, just to be clear,
[SPEAKER_03]: when you're talking about research on
human subjects, you're talking about a
[SPEAKER_03]: very hyper-regulated activity that we
don't actually have the authority as a
[SPEAKER_03]: state to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it comes to research on pesticides,
it's all going like all of the research
[SPEAKER_03]: that doesn't involve consumers is
exploding right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when it comes to human subjects,
we just don't have the authority at the
[SPEAKER_03]: state level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to jump in and say something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday, I was in Las Vegas for the day
at a medical cannabis symposium,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was a symposium with doctors and
researchers from around the globe who are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing clinical trials involving cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really eye-opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably, I would say, a couple
hundred folks, and everyone would present
[SPEAKER_00]: their research and talk about what they're
doing in their respective country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was interesting to hear about the
barriers in the United States to research
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the scheduling of cannabis
versus how things are in Greece or Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: or some other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really wonderful to have an
opportunity to also talk with these
[SPEAKER_00]: researchers and doctors and talk about how
they can bring from a factually-based
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective and what they find through
their research, how they can help create
[SPEAKER_00]: policy change internationally as relates
to cannabis so that we can see a really
[SPEAKER_00]: well-informed conversation around
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that doesn't speak to
California, but I just thought it was
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a wonderful gathering of very smart
minds that also showed how little the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical community, how much research is
limited because of the status of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: in so many countries, and certainly the
US, and how that community of brilliant,
[SPEAKER_00]: intellectual, healing folks are really
just kind of at their infancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We entered into a new research model this
year, which was exciting, which was a
[SPEAKER_02]: community-driven research project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the CDRPs and people from UC Irvine
and a few other universities are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, that seems viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they weren't worried about the
schedule of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were saying, this is really a
community-driven research project.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing herbarium pressings and
testings, but it's by the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the community that it serves,
so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, not to belabor this point too much,
but just say you're the guys at UC Irvine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to do a study on minor
cannabinoids, and you need 50 pounds to
[SPEAKER_04]: get 10 grams of minor cannabinoids to do
some chemistry on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You usually can't do it on the whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't, from what I heard from these
scientists, is that you can't do it on the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it with certain compounds,
and depending on what the university
[SPEAKER_00]: research institution allows and what the
applicable laws are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's oversight by the feds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they show up to these doctors,
research institutions, and look through
[SPEAKER_00]: everything and make sure everything is
100% legal to the extent that whatever is
[SPEAKER_00]: required.
[SPEAKER_03]: One or more chemicals.
But how do you get them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Isolation processes, extraction processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's distillation.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a number of extraction methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: You turn the plant into a bunch of
individual source chemicals and or
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple chemicals in a compound,
and then research those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I ask a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what everybody,
including you, Justin, learned in 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you expect but you didn't see,
or what did you not see that you expected
[SPEAKER_01]: to see in 2018?
[SPEAKER_01]: You only get one answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go first.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned what I articulated on the last
question, that some folks see barriers to
[SPEAKER_03]: entry as a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent three years prepping for a bill
that we ran that we ultimately lost
[SPEAKER_03]: because the industry was split on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a bill that would have allowed for
sales to take place at an event like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have allowed growers to directly
showcase their products and sell them
[SPEAKER_03]: directly to consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent, you know, in 2014, I started the
conversation with the Narcotics Officers
[SPEAKER_03]: Association of America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not joking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sat down with their lobbyists and said,
yeah, what's it going to take to get here?
[SPEAKER_03]: By 2018, I thought we were there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had local government on board.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had law enforcement on board,
and you know what did it?
[SPEAKER_03]: A group of retailers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the Southern California Coalition,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys were solid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Couldn't quite get on board to support,
but hey, you didn't fight us, which
[SPEAKER_03]: honestly, like, we can disagree,
but the fact that we were lined up
[SPEAKER_03]: fighting with other businesses,
it was a real wake up call for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I grew up in a different world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't grow up where unrepentant
self-interest was acceptable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up in a world where unrepentant
self-interest was immoral.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I learned in 2018.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I learned this,
but it was certainly reinforced.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's that nothing happens unless you
make it happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you've got to get out there and
you've got to be relentless about it,
[SPEAKER_05]: and you've got to get in front of the
people that you really don't want to be
[SPEAKER_05]: talking to and sway them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Be persuasive, and don't give up until you
get what you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Simple as that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I learned I wasn't as smart as I
thought I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Michael.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, things came at me this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this shit comes at me every day
and always has.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this year, it came at me from people
that I didn't think it was going to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, people that have had the
opportunity to come together for the
[SPEAKER_02]: longest time seem to do the cut the nose
to spite the face thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I feel like this year, I learned I
learned who my friends were, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and and, you know, and I and I and I.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, man, I learned I don't know if it's
like there's really like an encyclopedia
[SPEAKER_02]: of what I learned this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't stopped learning like just just
this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just this week, I learned how hard it is
for a small batch cultivator, all the shit
[SPEAKER_02]: we've done for the last three years to
figure some of this stuff out,
[SPEAKER_02]: just to get enough cannabis to maybe pay a
week's worth of employees into the retail
[SPEAKER_02]: market was for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that wasn't that that was a laundry
list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because Bobby had the opportunity and many
times to say, dude, I got a business to
[SPEAKER_02]: run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, like, you know, you know,
good, good model, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to work, you know, and watching
how these brands enter into the
[SPEAKER_02]: marketplace and what we've already had to
face with the Herculean licensing,
[SPEAKER_02]: with building and planning being against
us, our own community against us,
[SPEAKER_02]: our own growers, our neighbors against
like all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then and then to see that,
like just to get a few grams to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke outside, which you're not supposed
to smoke the grabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever happened here today just to
have it happen here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was I mean, it was ridiculous and
nauseating and tiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to take a nap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael wants to take a nap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bobby probably wants to take a nap and
anybody who's involved in the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I learned a lot about what we're really
facing, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I learned the power of politics and
politicians and local government,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, when the MMRSA when when all
those and it was about to pass and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: passes and then, OK, so what's the new
landscape?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do people run businesses?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a local permit to get a
state license.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, who are all these local?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are these local offices?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are these elected officials?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the building and planning
department?
[SPEAKER_00]: What you know, how do you like pulling
permits, dealing with in the Bay Area?
[SPEAKER_00]: We dealt with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in most of the rest of the state,
you're not dealing with local elected
[SPEAKER_00]: officials than these smaller little
offices to go through a whole local
[SPEAKER_00]: entitlement process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is incredible to me that still,
I think 70 percent of local jurisdictions
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't even issuing business licenses for
for for cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that in the 30 percent that do,
it's usually incredibly expensive,
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly politicized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be so well capitalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a snapshot of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a coffee with our the director of
the the Department of Cannabis Regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the city of L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: this last week, and I told her snapshot of
the industry, the dispensaries in the city
[SPEAKER_00]: of L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: that are operating right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are struggling because the
illegal shops, you've got the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: are waiting in line for licensing and you
just kind of go down the line and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: struggle, struggle, struggle, struggle,
struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet who are the ones that make the
choice for people to get a license?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's the voters and it's how we vote
on these issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we voted overwhelmingly for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we also have communities who say,
yeah, not in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it's through, you know,
these neighborhood councils or other kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of local groups or the kind of local
established offices themselves know a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of challenges getting through those
gatekeepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really seeing into in the city of L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: into this whole political machine has been
incredibly eye opening, as well as in
[SPEAKER_00]: other jurisdictions across across the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really the power of the power of all of
that mind blowing brain exploding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just came out with a drum roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: My biggest learning is how quickly the
cream rises to the top, how quickly in a
[SPEAKER_01]: time of turmoil, a time of change,
a time of indecency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Decision and the time of unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cream rises.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you as as my partner, former partner
used to say, when the snow melts,
[SPEAKER_01]: the shit shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: The snow has been melting for a while in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like everything else,
it's starting to become clear who your
[SPEAKER_01]: friends are, who the good people are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody can be good when things are going
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the hard decisions, the ones where
you have to make a trade off that are the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that determine whether you know how
to make the right decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it turns into cottage cheese and
off to the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes into the fridge where everyone
enjoys it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then everyone's like, we're going to
turn the rest into cottage cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you farm, I mean, that's how that's a
long lasting tarantula.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anybody else that has another
question?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you reprise the three archetypes of
distribution again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested in that, too, but it's
published.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go read it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Distribution are doing it themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So direct distribution, logistics only
distribution where the brand might have a
[SPEAKER_01]: sales team in the market initiating the
sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when it comes time to deliver it
and collect the money that's happening
[SPEAKER_01]: with a third party outfit and then full
service distribution, which is you just
[SPEAKER_01]: drop your product off at a warehouse and
the selling and the testing and the
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery and the retail relations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happens with that third party distributor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give the mic back to has a
guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to see if you guys wanted to
hear a poem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, this is something I wrote a
little bit ago, actually a lot of that
[SPEAKER_03]: ago, thinking about legalization and
thinking about what it would mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's every bit as relevant now
as it was then.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even as felons, my friends have grown
and there's no telling when the change
[SPEAKER_03]: will come home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I can't see through the haze and
smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I can't breathe and it makes me
choke.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no telling when the change
will come home.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm feeling that it's soon and it
fills me with hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to get high and do it outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was really kind of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even as felons, my friends have grown
and there's no telling when the change
[SPEAKER_03]: will come home.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want to reiterate,
though, is there's a lot of really good
[SPEAKER_03]: people that have done time.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of really good people that
have had their lives ruined and shattered.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as was noted, 70 percent of California
still doesn't have legalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seventy five of the hundred most populous
cities are still living in those shadows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the cultivation communities are
still living in those shadows.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I started this work, I realized that
there were about fifty three thousand of
[SPEAKER_03]: us.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's less than seventeen hundred people
who have been licensed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you all to realize that we have a
lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: The change hasn't come home.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't see through this haze and smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are going to get there if we do it
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I really want to underscore
the importance of cooperation,
[SPEAKER_03]: the importance of working together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this isn't just about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we're on the verge of extinction,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our planet is dying and we are killing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are the reason for all of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to need to work together if
it's going to get better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's go get high and take that first
step and get started now.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're so inclined, no pressure,
though, if you don't want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a perfect segue into a raffle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo!
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo!
[SPEAKER_07]: Woo!
