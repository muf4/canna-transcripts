[SPEAKER_00]: John has a new company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear about your new company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually a consultant, so I'm a
seagull.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fly in, I shit all over you,
and I fly away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so within that process, it's more of
going through and looking at where a
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing facility is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't matter what the manufacturer
of equipment is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of taking an analysis along the
way of the material before it goes into
[SPEAKER_00]: the extractor, X, Y, Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if it's propane, butane,
tetrafluoroethane, CO2, or I don't care
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I do is, as I see what's
happening before, test that material,
[SPEAKER_00]: then test the conditions that it's going
through, and then testing the material
[SPEAKER_00]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if there's one thing that I'll harp
on, and that is good is not a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you need to know the numbers to be
able to know what is your yield supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so therefore, you're able to find out
where do you have holes in the bucket of
[SPEAKER_00]: the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you fill up a bucket with water,
how many holes are in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, is it leaking out everywhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't realize it through your
decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're losing 20% that you didn't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing it through your extractor,
and you find out that it's channeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So channeling is like a river going
through an extractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the CO2 or propane will find the path
that leaves resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it finds the side of that vessel,
woo-hoo!
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fast pass time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's sitting in the middle,
it'll just continue to go like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado River, and you're just going to
have erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're not going to get to that
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the sort of things to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You quickly find out by testing something
in-house, and it's not that much money to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to go back through and know what
the numbers are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd say that's what synergistic
technology associates does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really looking at process design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you losing money?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can you maximize money?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can you maximize productivity?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not cheap, but it'll save you a lot
more money than he charges you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you take him out to lunch,
you get good comic relief too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's always a bonus.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he's not funny, you're not doing a good
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing a good job.
You're not doing a good job.
