[SPEAKER_00]: Someone had asked the question about a
nursery per square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the question that you answered
and you just broke it down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, they were asking, you know,
how much can I get off of an operation?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's basically just take 60% of the
operation and call it functional,
[SPEAKER_01]: because 40% is going to be workable
movement around stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a conventional property,
we have mother stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a 32 square foot table,
in terms of grid form, can do about 2,000
[SPEAKER_01]: clones a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that one table, roughly,
you know, if we have 2,000 we take and we
[SPEAKER_01]: refine it to, say, 16, we could put 1,600
clones in every eight square foot of
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's about 40 square foot for table and
for subsequent rack to hold it over the
[SPEAKER_01]: course of a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it takes about two weeks to strike
roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it takes about two weeks for the
plant to kind of come back to cuttable
[SPEAKER_01]: form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this rhythm that you work with
once you dial in the size of the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're gridding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the 40% space, which we've taken off
the top, is holding racks, it's workspace,
[SPEAKER_01]: things that let you do transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're in nursery business,
I think a lot of people, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what they do is they produce stock and
then they send you out lists to go look
[SPEAKER_01]: for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, my method had always been to
acquire clients previous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a different approach to moving
plants than a lot of people did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what it did is as soon as I had the
plant ready, we called you and you came
[SPEAKER_01]: and picked it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what it did is it allowed me to
have a much more efficient rotation in my
[SPEAKER_01]: racks so that I didn't have to have so
much redundant holding space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main thing is if you got 10,000
square foot, it means you got 6,000 square
[SPEAKER_01]: foot of workspace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you take that 6,000 square foot and
you divide it by 40, that'll give you
[SPEAKER_01]: 2,000 clones plus 1,600 on a rack per
month.
[SPEAKER_00]: With mom stock, kind of what's,
from your perspective, a healthy mom,
[SPEAKER_00]: like how many clippings you can take per
week?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what were some strategies that
you've used to kind of increase the weekly
[SPEAKER_00]: yield or whatever your measurement of
number of clippings per time period?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the first part is that when it comes
to healthy mom, it's really about hormonal
[SPEAKER_01]: dominance in terms of juvenility,
where the plant is expressing itself as a
[SPEAKER_01]: juvenile plant and its tissue is extremely
herbaceous and its cellular growth is
[SPEAKER_01]: really fast because that's what we want to
capture in a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the bigger, older plants lose that
on the interior and you only end up
[SPEAKER_01]: getting it on the tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you end up having a lot of space
devoted to something that gives you
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively few clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would rather have rotations of plants
constantly weaving through the mother op.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you would take plants and put them
in three gallons, say we get 50 plants per
[SPEAKER_01]: table, that table would take me probably
40 days from planting to cuttable form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I cut it though, I'm on 2,000 plants
a month off that table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to run it for at least two
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd get four cuts off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't cut it every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cut it on a cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so once we build them and the building
part is a part that people don't catch is
[SPEAKER_01]: that you got to come in and you got to
shape them and soft tip them so that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can start to diffuse the hormones and
create the skeleton.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to come in and clean out
the skeleton so that you get the real
[SPEAKER_01]: shape that you want so that it's really
symmetrical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that plant now allows you to have
a beautiful display of clonal material on
[SPEAKER_01]: a grid that gives you an incredible amount
of clones per square foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like these methods because for most
people that are working in their own
[SPEAKER_01]: world, having a very efficient small
nursery for themselves or for their
[SPEAKER_01]: operations is ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, space is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't get me wrong, more square
footage is never bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that for most people,
they don't have unlimited square footage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you got to realize you don't need a
lot of space to be able to generate a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was the question we were going
for?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so happy about talking about clone
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the first question we were
talking on that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: On this topic?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it was rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking about health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the rotation is if I could get four
cuts, four good cuttings off the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: that means that that single plant,
that single three-gallon plant gave me 160
[SPEAKER_01]: clones over a two-month period.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that single square foot was worth
$1,600.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 800 bucks a month per square foot in
mother production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's really effective money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like for me, if you can get four cuts
off that mom and then slide another mom in
[SPEAKER_01]: that you've already started to build.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you build the table, you can have
another table that you're building the
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes 45 days to build a plant,
but part of it is in that early stage
[SPEAKER_01]: where they're in threes, and then they're
saying ones, and you're getting the frame
[SPEAKER_01]: and the structure shaped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can shift it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a four by four of ones is going to be
able to transform into a full four by
[SPEAKER_01]: eight of threes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't need as much space to build
the chain, but the actual square footage
[SPEAKER_01]: per yielding amount of mother stock comes
down to those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so say we go to five gallons of cocoa,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then all we're doing is we're still going
into that same amount per square foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just getting it off of a larger
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like plants that are in the three
gallon range if we're going to do push.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's organically built where you're
doing full organic bottom end,
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost have to go into like a seven,
otherwise I'm having to run too many tees
[SPEAKER_01]: through it continuously.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have enough of a sink to do top
dressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem with seven gallon pots is
that you take the pot right out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: table and you put it on a spindle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had these chairs you sat down in that
had a spinner and the plant would sit on
[SPEAKER_01]: the spinner and you could turn it with
your feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way you could sit down and take
all the cuts off the plant and clean it up
[SPEAKER_01]: and then put it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if the workers having to bend over
this shit, they're miserable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're having good production
from your cloners, you want to make it so
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's easy on them to do the
harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so plants that are too big become
difficult to physically move and spin
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then plants that are too small require
too much of a frequent irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's easier if you're setting stuff
up to where, in our world in Humboldt
[SPEAKER_01]: County, we've had so many power problems
and so many water problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we live in the country, even though
it's got full infrastructure, the weather
[SPEAKER_01]: and some of the issues here shut down your
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I try to create a system where I
always have a little bit of a buffer on
[SPEAKER_01]: immediacy of watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same reason why I came up with
putting the perlite in the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_01]: tray under the Oasis tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not for aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really not the best way to use an
Oasis media or Rockwell is to put it on a
[SPEAKER_01]: secondary drain matrix because it changes
the water height column in the cube
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so that when the plants root,
they have a secondary matrix to go into so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can always lay a layer of
moisture in that perlite grid that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: completely saturate the upper grid but
allows you to have a holdability of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant if you're suddenly having clients
that don't show up for a week or we have
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature that goes up to 110 and they
decide they want to shut the power lines
[SPEAKER_01]: down because we're having fires in a
region around us, which happens here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't like to have plants that are
driven heavy in smaller pots because
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately if I have any issues at all and
I wilt the moms, then what I'm doing is
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm destroying $800 a square foot of
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like with mom stock and mother
operations, once you efficiently build a
[SPEAKER_01]: grid, they're very valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to kind of create a system
that works to fit your trays, to fit your
[SPEAKER_01]: cutters, to fit the amount of material
you're moving through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people when they do nursery prop,
they always build way more than they need
[SPEAKER_01]: because they don't have the business and
then they go try to sell this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not the way you approach
nursery because nursery isn't something
[SPEAKER_01]: you can put on the shelf and hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see it constantly in the ads that I
get bombarded with where you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell me a clone and then you're trying to
sell me a cheaper clone and the picture is
[SPEAKER_01]: like nine, 10 inches tall now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're trying to sell me
something in soil because you transplanted
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're trying to sell me a teen
because you transplanted again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally your nursery doesn't
exist anymore because you spent too much
[SPEAKER_01]: money trying to build an operation that
you couldn't sell the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all that stuff has to fit into your
density and operational characteristics of
[SPEAKER_01]: your mothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I know some nurseries that run
current culture, undercurrent systems,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they get phenomenal root development
in those buckets and the plants that come
[SPEAKER_01]: off the top are massive and they're using
tissue culture derived plants to begin it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that system where I don't know their
square foot numbers, but I know the clones
[SPEAKER_01]: coming off beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no magic way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that each situation has to work
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the greater the degree of complexity,
the greater degree of infrastructure
[SPEAKER_01]: security you have to put into play or if
it backfires, it'll wipe you out good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is a mom in the rotation?
[SPEAKER_00]: In your, in your setup, like before
essentially she gets retired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'd like to see two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see four cuts come off of her.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see it take 45 days to build
her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she lives for another 60 as a,
as a, as a form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can, and then I can take her
and compost her.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a big compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a short, short life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be because the problem that you
get too is that, you know, you've got so
[SPEAKER_01]: many issues in, in cannabis in terms of
pathogens and everyone's experiencing this
[SPEAKER_01]: now where like, Oh, they go, Whoa,
haven't hold a couple hundred thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a lot tougher than holding 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, you get spots where you can't see
pathogens move in and then they just go
[SPEAKER_01]: wild in the operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the bigger, older plants,
because their canopy is so thick there,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where they hide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with smaller plants that you're
cutting, two times a month, you can take
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant right out of the table and then
spray it good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, cause you're going to lay all
your beneficial predation in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bottom line is when you're
constantly cutting plants in a nursery,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're, you're, you're delivering with the
clone, the beneficial predation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It leaves, you don't shake it off when you
cut it, you just cut and plug it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're in the tray, they're in the
build.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when the clone, when the,
when the plants leave, all your beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: predation leaves with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you constantly having to inoculate the
plants within the nursery itself and using
[SPEAKER_01]: something even simple as like a Bronner's
peppermint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to knock stuff down and to make
sure that any soft body insect is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get desiccated using some kind of a good
fogging spray system just makes it really
[SPEAKER_01]: easy when the plants are holdable and
movable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it just makes it really,
really containable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So easy, you know, this, the longer the
plant lives with you, the more,
[SPEAKER_01]: more, more, more at home it becomes and
things start to live in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, that's why you want to flush
them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had moms that I've kept for like
four years nonstop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they had to stem on them the size
of a, you know, like a liter soda bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means, and it was the,
it was, it was like my favorite plant ever
[SPEAKER_01]: because I had grown it for four years at
this building.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just kept bringing it back down in
shape and height.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it almost looked like a sprawling maple
tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it had kind of bonsai up,
but bottom line is per square foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did not deliver the same amount that
you'd get off of a flat platform.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I know you, your nursery just has a
single client, but have you been following
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the nursery market and the
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is nurseries that,
you know, obviously there's a scale of
[SPEAKER_00]: nurseries in terms of quality and rep
reputability, but for nurseries that you
[SPEAKER_00]: respect out there, kind of what price
trends have you been seeing in terms of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if someone wants to buy 5,000,
10,000, 20,000, 50,000 clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of what price trends are you seeing
in the per clone cost?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's funny because I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to be honest, I hear the range of
prices, but I don't know the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers being cut because the,
I know who's producing some good work,
[SPEAKER_01]: but because I don't purchase clones from
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anytime anybody sends me any kind of
like clone pricing lists through on the
[SPEAKER_01]: internet, cause of my email got tied into
through our licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I cut that shit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I don't, I'm not buying anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that you're probably looking and
it depends, but I think that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and something that would be a teen would
be about 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're talking seed stock up to,
you know, your knees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like coming out of plant Humboldt,
I think those plants are closer to like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 25 to 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the, I think the goal of some of the
new nurseries on the tissue culture end is
[SPEAKER_01]: to get them on the $5 range where you're
getting a $5 tissue culture plant that is
[SPEAKER_01]: flawless.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm, I pay attention to nurseries
and operational stuff, but I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in the sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, I'm as deep in prop as I could
be, but not on the sale end of it because
[SPEAKER_01]: of the way I work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: My contract.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of out of the business in
nurseries, but not the tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm involved with other nurseries and
doing tech and assessment and then helping
[SPEAKER_01]: establish the libraries of what you're
actually running and why you're running
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of times with nurseries,
people get into it, but they just go buy
[SPEAKER_01]: plants from somebody, but they don't
really understand why they're buying them
[SPEAKER_01]: and who's smoking it and what you're doing
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the issue is that nurseries end up
producing some really premium products of
[SPEAKER_01]: things that the market doesn't want to
buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it, you know, I mean, for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's pretty rampant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, because I've had so many
years of experience selling products in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and specifically putting plants
that were prior, not heavily pushed into
[SPEAKER_01]: the system and then pushing them heavy,
because I knew the market would take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I get to kind of work with
nurseries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now is to say, look, this is, this is a
really good example of OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the market likes OG Kush, you can trust
that this variety will, will satisfy that
[SPEAKER_01]: market from now until they're done smoking
OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's no question that it's
premium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what it does, it lets the nursery
then be able to say, okay, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that covers our OG old school base.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to have a library set up of
things that are staples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to have a library set up
of things that are burgeoning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we try to figure out, you know,
what is hot, what is the trend and is it
[SPEAKER_01]: worth really catching it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it worth doing the work to develop the
beds, the system?
[SPEAKER_01]: The marketing to get that into play?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it just a fad?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's just a fad, then what you do
is you put a lot of work in and you send a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people into that road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, you know,
the system's only meant to take 20 tons
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's 50 tons.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: What nurseries in California do you think
are doing good work?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think, I think that I like,
I like cultivated out of Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Sergio and his team.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing a nice job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that conception nurseries in
Sacramento, they just came online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're about to, they're going to
turn you upside down with what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to put out on that market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're going to see some shit coming
out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be insane in terms of how
vigorous those plants are because their
[SPEAKER_01]: process of propagation is, it is better,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Sergio's team's doing good work
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're putting out beautiful products and
you can get those at dispensaries too,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is killer because the library that
he put together is premium and the quality
[SPEAKER_01]: of the product he's releasing is premium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know they're doing good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in Hubbell County, you know,
you've got Hendrix, you know, on the,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the north end of the county.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always have a curated good library.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really deal with any of the other
nurseries nearby me because we're in
[SPEAKER_01]: different spheres.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think if you're looking for seed
plants, Jockable out of Brycelin with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant Hum, you know, Plant and Humboldt,
he does all the seed plants so that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting something from seed, fem work out
of different entities that he chooses
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really popular for people who
want to run their six.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's some nice nurseries down
in Mendo that are throwing some good work
[SPEAKER_01]: out, but I don't, I don't go to see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's only, it's only larger
operations that hit me up to talk about,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how do you shape a life?
[SPEAKER_01]: Library?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you, how do you understand market?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know there's some, there's always
good operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this, you have to just go take a
look and see, you know, who's the,
[SPEAKER_01]: who's got the craft background because the
craft background is going to influence
[SPEAKER_01]: completely what the selection of plants
available at the nursery are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise you just collecting shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see people with like 80, 90,
a hundred things on the, on the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, where'd you get it from?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just random shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it may be that thing,
but it doesn't mean it's the one that
[SPEAKER_01]: people got really addicted to,
you know, buying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to, and then, and no one's
run this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see people all the time and I'm like,
did you run the plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, no, we just got the clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, how do you even know it's
the clone?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has to be people that have a
cultivation background where they
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that if you release the plan
into the system, you had some idea of what
[SPEAKER_01]: it did so that you know how to assist the
cultivator on placing it correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some cultivators shouldn't grow certain
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some regions don't take certain varieties
very well in terms of acceptance in the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some varieties are just so damn
valuable that you want to make sure you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't release too much of it into the
system as a nursery so that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: maintain that upper shelf where you can
actually, if you're smart, you can kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: control the movement of certain products.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're the one that's putting them out,
because you only put out so much of it and
[SPEAKER_01]: what it does, it allows you to have these
hotter items that bring people into
[SPEAKER_01]: awareness of your farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're touching something that has
great awareness and people buy it and your
[SPEAKER_01]: label's connected to it, they'll look at
you differently if you are able to connect
[SPEAKER_01]: to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like all that shit is like,
that's what I dig about nurseries is that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, propagating plants is spiritual,
man, because you get into this rhythm when
[SPEAKER_01]: you propagate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing seed work and doing clonal work,
you get lost in propagation and you just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just, it's cleansing to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's so unbelievably focused that you
really do lose track of everything else
[SPEAKER_01]: except what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is an art I love, but the
business in nursery, I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: misunderstood by most because they don't
realize that you're really the market
[SPEAKER_01]: interpreter to where you're having to look
at the stores and the burgeoning markets
[SPEAKER_01]: and declining markets and create your
libraries to fit that reality,
[SPEAKER_01]: not necessarily things that you'd like to
work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the time, the shit that props
great and grows well and is extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient per square foot is not what you
want to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you had Rita Steve on there the
other day, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was hysterical, but he's like,
you know, the good shit never goes big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the purple shit that looks better is
never the strong shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was so accurate because that's just
one of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every now and then all things come
together as this holy grail.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of clonal work, the perp was the
holy grail because the perp gave you
[SPEAKER_01]: fantastic clone rates and it branched
really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you were working with perp,
you knew that every tray you touched,
[SPEAKER_01]: they all plugged.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all very even in height.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have different hormonal
concentrations throughout the canopy like
[SPEAKER_01]: OG does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the trays always look really
symmetrical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything always looked beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did everything you wanted it to do as a
propagator and the market was accepting it
[SPEAKER_01]: like a vacuum cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, you know, that your job in the
nursery end is to find the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: work well for cultivators, just because
you can plug it doesn't mean growers are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to want to grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean buyers are going to want
to buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're good at nursery where you're
and to me, nursery is just somebody who's
[SPEAKER_01]: introducing stock into the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't just propagate material because
in cannabis, there's no bank to go to to
[SPEAKER_01]: get the source material where most
nurseries can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get seed from a common company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put it out in mass of form.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may do their own in-house speciality
production once they get big enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most nurseries are just really
replicating work that they get from
[SPEAKER_01]: catalogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: In cannabis, we don't have these catalogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have these proven cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have the consistency to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where I think you see a lot
of these bigger operations that light up
[SPEAKER_01]: nurseries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when I talk to these guys and I
ask them what was the basis that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: building the library, they're like,
well, these are the plants we acquire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just like, so you're you're you're
investing, you know, 30 million dollars in
[SPEAKER_01]: an operation and all this downstream money
that's going to come from it off the
[SPEAKER_01]: things you have no idea why anybody chose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, that's that that's the
thing about nursery operators is that if
[SPEAKER_01]: you just take a look to see who's the
owners of the nursery, how long have they
[SPEAKER_01]: been doing nursery work?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have a better idea of
what it is that that should be sold in the
[SPEAKER_01]: place, even if they're technologically not
as good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rather have a better plant
produced under less than optimal
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions than the best fucking plant
ever cloned that couldn't sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you need the genetics, because once
you get something that works for you on
[SPEAKER_01]: your hill, you can go find a lab to scrub
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go find a nursery, do licensed
back work with you where they they'll say
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll say, listen, can you I need a grid
of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you produce it for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the numbers?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't even have to do in-house
because really, if you were able to do the
[SPEAKER_01]: math on it and both sides worked in an
agreement, it would work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
