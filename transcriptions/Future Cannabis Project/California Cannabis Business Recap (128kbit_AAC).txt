[SPEAKER_00]: California and Michigan I think represent
like kind of the most interesting place
[SPEAKER_00]: because they had You know really well
entrenched cannabis markets the last four
[SPEAKER_00]: or five years, but they'd always been kind
of a gray market So now that we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: codified market and Michigan's making
their transition now and California had
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing it, you know since Jan one of
last year There's a lot of companies that
[SPEAKER_00]: are kind of making this, you know
transition from A to B And I think where
[SPEAKER_00]: we are right now is kind of in this like,
you know Think of it as a baton pass lane
[SPEAKER_00]: during a relay race where you were over
here doing a prop 215 and Trying to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment 64 and you're trying to figure
out the regs and you know The new regs in
[SPEAKER_00]: California just launched.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a lot of people are waiting to
see what would happen there But there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of growth with new companies in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the old companies haven't made
the transition They've tried this time
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to do it successfully or
they've decided they'd rather stand in the
[SPEAKER_00]: shadows and do what they did for the last
20 or 30 years, which is You know feed an
[SPEAKER_00]: illicit market that largely goes out of
state Michigan's going through the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, those are two markets where
there's actually still room Real
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to open a new canvas business
many other markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say New York or Florida or Illinois
the markets already been carved up as an
[SPEAKER_00]: oligopoly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been state-regulated where the
Whoever runs it, you know, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: health and Human Services or the
Department of Revenue has said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, here's the licenses We're not
going to create any more for the near
[SPEAKER_00]: future So if you're not in you're out and
you know The best you can hope for is you
[SPEAKER_00]: get a job working for one of those
behemoths that we talked about earlier But
[SPEAKER_00]: in California and you think about like,
you know the LA area or LA through San
[SPEAKER_00]: Diego you get 21 million people in a
largely unregulated canvas market that are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure out You know what's next
and can you start something that becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: the next Presco and the answer is that
there's still a chance, you know You need
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of capital to enter now But if
you've got deep pockets and you've got a
[SPEAKER_00]: really good idea and you've got Someone
that really understands branding then then
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a chance right now to enter the
market Greenfield and still make an impact
[SPEAKER_00]: where it wouldn't be in either a very
mature market like Colorado or A very
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated market like New York the color
on Washington might be the best examples
[SPEAKER_00]: of you know, true free market capitalism
at work where you know, you're gonna see a
[SPEAKER_00]: massive wave of new entrance then you're
gonna see consolidation and you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: see it hit Equilibrium and then operate a
steady state going forward California is
[SPEAKER_00]: in that place right now where it's kind of
having that massive wave come up and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching and unfortunately what's
gonna be Tremendous amount of overbuilding
[SPEAKER_00]: in this industry So if you look at what
the BCC and the CDFA have already licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: in California From a consumption
standpoint, you know, you are our supply
[SPEAKER_00]: is gonna be probably seven to ten X demand
over the next couple of years You're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: see a lot of people unfortunately go out
of business because you know So many
[SPEAKER_00]: people tried to migrate from the illicit
market where their addressable market of
[SPEAKER_00]: who they sold to was all the US Now
they're saying okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you get to get legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right We get legal but that means now
you can always sell to California So you
[SPEAKER_00]: went from 330 million people as an
addressable market to 39 million people
[SPEAKER_00]: and so all these you know, northern
counties That have tried to migrate people
[SPEAKER_00]: into the legal side in many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: All they've done is just created a dirth
of available product and you have tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: new entrance that are opening up in places
like Atalanta and desert hot springs and
[SPEAKER_00]: Coachella and you've got this massive wave
that's happening in Santa Barbara County
[SPEAKER_00]: around Carpinteria and then also it's
happening in Salinas and Monterey where
[SPEAKER_00]: the repurposing old greenhouses that we're
about to have Yeah, as I said ten times as
[SPEAKER_00]: much canvas as we know how to to deal with
in a market that ultimately at steady
[SPEAKER_00]: state might be Ten billion dollars a year
across the counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're gonna enter the market if
you're gonna enter, California You have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just on the cultivation side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the processing side It's on the
branded product side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the retail side It's a hyper
competitive marketplace, but the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that succeed in the California market
ultimately I think will be the most
[SPEAKER_00]: successful companies in you know in in
canvas in the country And I think as
[SPEAKER_00]: federal legalization happens then the
expectation is California will start
[SPEAKER_00]: supplying the rest of the country for
canvas the way it should Traditionally
[SPEAKER_00]: always has it'll just do it now from the
standpoint of we've got the best quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the lowest cost of production
We've got the most robust and mature
[SPEAKER_00]: long-standing tradition of understanding
canvas culture Branding is LA centric,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know or New York centric, but in my
mind There's absolutely no purpose or no
[SPEAKER_00]: reason to ever grow canvas in Minnesota or
in Wisconsin Why would you ever produce
[SPEAKER_00]: like in a place where there's massive
fluctuations in temperatures massive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy costs associated with it when
you've got the beautiful California
[SPEAKER_00]: sunshine that you know Can produce in a
mix like greenhouse at a fraction of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost at a much higher quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: For a long time was finding someone to
take their weight, you know These guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: producing so much like some of these
facilities are you know, three four acres
[SPEAKER_00]: under glass You know some of the operators
might have ten of those facilities They
[SPEAKER_00]: might be 30 or 40 acres under glass when
you think about you know What that means
[SPEAKER_00]: in a facility that's turning four or five
harvests a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's massive massive amounts of weight
coming out So those guys weren't going
[SPEAKER_00]: after the upper end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going after let's just be you
know, your your producer your mids or your
[SPEAKER_00]: regs Yeah, and let's just blast it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let's find someone that wants to
take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's blast the entire harvest Let's put
it in you know, like either you know down
[SPEAKER_00]: to distill it or isolate or let's get it
to the clear and you know Send it out for
[SPEAKER_00]: vape carts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's you know, these guys like we're
trying to find buyers all sale I'll take a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand pounds at a time and oftentimes
they're selling it without even doing any
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming without any curing this
flash-frozen out the door To you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the larger buyers, but now those buyers
are starting to say we've got our farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with People are scrambling
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all trying to figure out who's
gonna take my weight And if you know they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't take it then what happens to it,
you know We we just put all this capital
[SPEAKER_00]: under our capex and infrastructure and now
we're going to think about You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: can we actually survive on what we've
built or do we need to scale back and you
know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop any additional infrastructure build
and all the temp license is received from
[SPEAKER_00]: the CDFA back in 2017 or 18, you know Do
we now not apply for for an annual license
[SPEAKER_00]: as a result of knowing that there's no
addressable market to sell into What seems
[SPEAKER_01]: like a lot of them are vertically
integrating and starting their own brand,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not as the ideal situation is
you have a farm Some of it goes to your
[SPEAKER_01]: own house brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're then marketing and promoting some
of it goes to a third party buyer So you
[SPEAKER_01]: see a lot of like a race to build brand I
haven't seen as much as Santa Barbara I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen a scene it where they're combining
forces with people that are brand Builders
[SPEAKER_00]: more out of LA where you're so close.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're 90 miles from from point A to point
B that they're saying Okay, let's let's
[SPEAKER_00]: really think about how do we hold margin?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might not have the highest quality
inputs But if we reduce it down to a
[SPEAKER_00]: distillate anyway, it doesn't really
matter We're not talking about a terapene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile or flavonoid profile We're not
talking about you know, how much THC CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: CBN is in there So from that standpoint,
you know Can we sell to someone that's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna put it into a topical or sell for an
edible or something else where the branded
[SPEAKER_00]: product?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna hold price that's kind of where
the the shotgun marriages are starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen and you're starting to see people
that are saying I just want to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: the following groups because I think
they've got the best path to To top-notch
[SPEAKER_00]: branding if we can share in the economics
We're a lot happier than we would be if we
[SPEAKER_00]: were to selling as a wholesale producer of
flour And so what are some of the friends
[SPEAKER_01]: you're seeing with cultivators because for
example, I talked to one from humble who
[SPEAKER_01]: Never done fresh frozen before and then
allocated 25% of his entire harvest to it
[SPEAKER_01]: this year So it's like you're not just a
flower producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in the oil game.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in the so how do you see sort of
cultivators diversifying their product mix
[SPEAKER_00]: You just nailed one of them and the fact
is that people are doing that now are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing as a hedge, you know And they're
also what used to be like let's try to get
[SPEAKER_00]: top dollar and you know bleed it out 20 30
50 pounds at a time You know send it back
[SPEAKER_00]: East a lot of those same growers now are
saying all right I'll find someone that's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna put a Outputs contract on my entire
harvest or I'm gonna, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: take 25% of the harvest I'm not gonna
worry about you know trying to get it out
[SPEAKER_00]: over the next two or three months and just
you know sell it out so the same way that
[SPEAKER_00]: like You know call ten years ago when guys
first started doing a light depth harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the first black box harvest
They're doing as a hedge against making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that you know, they didn't lose their
whole harvest to you know, either Late
[SPEAKER_00]: season molds mildews and you know other
things caused by rain or cold weather You
[SPEAKER_00]: know now the hedge is do we have someone
else take 25 30 percent of our harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: right out of the gate?
[SPEAKER_00]: The other trend I'm seeing is is groups
really working with distributors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think are being able to get their
product to market whether it's Labeling
[SPEAKER_00]: their product as someone else's so,
you know You look at what Candescent's
[SPEAKER_00]: done in the California market and they've
done a really nice job of buying up other
[SPEAKER_00]: people's Harvest, you know, they go out
there and sniff around for who's got the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest quality farms and then saying
we'll take everything You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll bring it as Candescent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make sure the turf profile is
largely similar to what we're putting out
[SPEAKER_00]: for product You know a but be a different
turf, you know profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go out and source that So they're
doing a great job of that Mikey up at
[SPEAKER_00]: Flocon is doing a great job of that as
well saying, okay Let's let's put out tons
[SPEAKER_00]: of product under the flow counter name,
but we're gonna aggregate You know 50
[SPEAKER_00]: different farms to do it The guys at
honeybee farms are doing a really nice job
[SPEAKER_00]: of getting product out, you know,
so it's The cultivation side still powers
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry, you know, you keep hearing
all this negativity around price
[SPEAKER_00]: compression and commodification of a
flower of Cultivation but ultimately every
[SPEAKER_00]: product that we sell in this industry is
predicated on the producers of biomass So
[SPEAKER_00]: for for those guys, you know finding the
alliances finding who you want to team up
[SPEAKER_00]: with A lot of it's based on either a the
processor you're gonna work with or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're on the distributor You're gonna
work with because ultimately they're the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones that are gonna be able to move your
product for you better than you can do it
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself Unless you're just really savvy
at you know logistics and distribution So
[SPEAKER_01]: you just mentioned a couple of specific
brand slash companies who we think
[SPEAKER_01]: California specific brand show Who are
kind of power players that are emerging in
[SPEAKER_01]: different parts of the supply chain?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you just mentioned some
Brands like Flocon and Candessa and that
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of the public-facing brand you see on
a shelf Like the distribution players
[SPEAKER_01]: who's emerging in distribution who's you
know, who's making moves on the retail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, yeah So on the let's separate the
industry into you know, six or seven
[SPEAKER_00]: different parts, you know, you've got the
flower producers You've got the guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the vape carts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the distributors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the retailers You've got the
you know, some processes are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: column, you know branded products guys and
there's best in breed You know at each
[SPEAKER_00]: level, you know, I think for flower
producers There's some like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: look the candescence of the flow Connors
that have the big reputations,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's craft guys like Palomar craft
cannabis in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just absolutely lights out quality
Who's in the process right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know going through a licensing with
the state?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's other other groups that are you
know, really boutique think, you know The
[SPEAKER_00]: way micro brews are that are producing
really really high quality that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: think of On the distribution side,
you know Coming out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone was talking about what River was
gonna do Harvey ours gonna do They've
[SPEAKER_00]: since been acquired by by origin house And
they're in the process of kind of you know
[SPEAKER_00]: revamping But you know from a logistic
standpoint those guys came out of southern
[SPEAKER_00]: winding spirits They're you know,
a talented team and they've they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: good processes A gentleman named Ross
Haley who used to run general hydroponics
[SPEAKER_00]: in the hydro space has a new new
distribution committee that can't remember
[SPEAKER_00]: the name of it, but Ross has been just in
Powerhouse and everything he's ever
[SPEAKER_00]: touched.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I were to say who do I not bet
against I don't bet against Ross There's a
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some Other distributors I think
have done a nice job in in NorCal I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to think of Sonoma Pacific.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think would be one that's done a pretty
nice job In the vape cart market,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's there's quite a few I
mean the heavy hitters the brass knuckles
[SPEAKER_00]: the Let's see who else Excite I think is a
There's probably five or six that are that
[SPEAKER_00]: are battling out for for market share
pretty well but Market, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's some people that are
doing really really unique things that
[SPEAKER_00]: will ultimately probably be more
successful than the guys are actually just
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing through just large quantity so I
Dosis those doses studying has done a
[SPEAKER_00]: really really nice job of it from branding
And when you think about where this
[SPEAKER_00]: market's going where you think,
you know, you can expect to see Something
[SPEAKER_00]: that resonates across multiple markets,
you know, it's gonna end up looking like
[SPEAKER_00]: dosis packs I think it's done a really
nice job of taking their brand for the era
[SPEAKER_00]: for the We have the packs era and having
other people, you know license with them
[SPEAKER_00]: to fill their carts So there's still you
know, even though they don't directly
[SPEAKER_00]: touch the industry They've done a really
great job of saying we're gonna pick the
[SPEAKER_00]: boutique farms that we think are gonna
produce the best product That's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: represent the packs name the best So
that's you know, two different ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: attack, you know the same thing and then
there's all the guys like the heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: hitters of the kingpens That have gone out
and just said, okay Let's just fill as
[SPEAKER_00]: many carts as we possibly can with the
biomass we're producing or that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: buying in the wholesale market And then
retail I'm a fan of Marty's up at harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he has a nice job from you know
building a really nice store You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't give med men credit just no You
know, there's a couple groups in San Diego
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think are making a planet that you
know Trying to do a roll-up of sorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know lighthouse is making a play for you
know, trying to put a bunch of stores
[SPEAKER_00]: together The retail side where it's too
early to tell someone's gonna come in
[SPEAKER_00]: someone's gonna come in product-mounted
industry and just throw a ton of money
[SPEAKER_00]: California market and say let's put a
hundred stores together Let's be the first
[SPEAKER_00]: any people retail experience that exists
in the California market and it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: as you know It'll be no different than
Chipotle or any other, you know brand that
[SPEAKER_01]: you recognize that it's gonna be terrific
So that company that theoretical company
[SPEAKER_01]: do you think they will go on an
acquisition spree or start everything
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves or?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a combination of the two I mean
build versus buy it's much cheaper to
[SPEAKER_00]: build if you can, you know If you can find
a new town that's just opening up and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay I mean for instance Los Angeles has
had the same 135 or so Retails that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've licensed for a long time and now
there's all this talk about you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding new licenses and that's a question
of who it's gonna go to is gonna go to To
[SPEAKER_00]: minority owners or is it gonna go just an
open market if you can get one of the new
[SPEAKER_00]: wave of LA licenses I think that you know
that that's a pretty coveted license Same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing with San Diego same thing with San
Jose San Francisco But I think it's also a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the smaller towns and you forget
that there's 39 million people in
[SPEAKER_00]: California and just from my drive to San
Diego to here today in LA I passed by 30
[SPEAKER_00]: towns with populations of over 80,000
people You know any one of those in any
[SPEAKER_00]: other state would be a marquee market So,
you know, can you get a market where you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, for instance in San Diego Oceanside
is just opening up Oceanside is a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand person town So in those markets
as they're opening, I think that the savvy
[SPEAKER_00]: groups are gonna say, okay Let's get in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put our lobbying team to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let's hire a K Street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hire five corners marketing our
five-corner strategies and let's let's get
[SPEAKER_00]: the work done so we can actually open a
new market and then once you have and
[SPEAKER_00]: let's get Let's take as many touch points
we can and then the marquee markets where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're already kind of given out then
we'll acquire and you'll probably
[SPEAKER_00]: overpayable pay 5x revenue or something
like that that you know, ultimately we
[SPEAKER_00]: think is worth it because it's given us a
Location that is you know, so
[SPEAKER_00]: recognizable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like having you know An Irma's on
Fifth Avenue like you have to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: marquee sort of anchor stores Like our
company is able to Is it kind of a race to
[SPEAKER_01]: like $35 cartridges or our company is able
to charge a premium for brand name?
[SPEAKER_00]: The name of the game now is is buying
shelf space, you know, if you're a really
[SPEAKER_00]: smart High-volume retail store then that
retail store, you know If they've got 50
[SPEAKER_00]: people competing for the same shelf space
and quality is roughly commensurate Then
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you pick a versus B versus C and
who's gonna pay for that shelf space?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's no different than it is in
traditional retail But now it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: step up and you look at what certain
companies are doing again I'll use dosis
[SPEAKER_00]: as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing this store within a store,
you know, they'll say okay we want
[SPEAKER_00]: Guaranteed that's much self space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we're gonna man up with our
own person We'll still work, you know in
[SPEAKER_00]: conjunction with the retail But we want to
make sure that our guys there all the time
[SPEAKER_00]: and has a store within the store and
they're teaching people about our product
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's happening, you know On the
flower side that's happening on the vape
[SPEAKER_00]: side is happening in the branded product
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're certainly seeing guys, you know
send their reps out to spend an entire day
[SPEAKER_00]: at dispensaries now to you know Say hey
from a brand awareness perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what do you know about Papa and
Barclay?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like can I show you more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I show you our product suite because
we've got this, you know Great set of
[SPEAKER_00]: products that you as a consumer need to
know about if you want to compete in the
[SPEAKER_00]: branded market Branded product side of
this market right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You absolutely have to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You absolutely have to work with the
retailers either by having just a great
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship where you know that your
product sells through so well that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have to carry you or if you want them to
carry you you're willing to You know step
[SPEAKER_00]: up your game and find a way that they're
gonna notice you above the rest and
[SPEAKER_01]: usually that's you know That's money
talking Great question and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: something I deal with beverage analysts
all the time in investment banks and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know when they ask me like it's so funny
because ever since Constellation brands
[SPEAKER_00]: made their investment into canopy
Everyone's asking about it and now Molson
[SPEAKER_00]: Coors has gotten involved and now Heineken
Laganitas has gotten involved and you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have a Heineken Laganitas product
in the Southern California market So,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know beverages like right now it makes
up like 1% of the industry It's such a
[SPEAKER_00]: small category by comparison to anything
else but when you think about Las Vegas as
[SPEAKER_00]: a market or you think about Denver as a
market right now and you think that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, the new wave now is for on-premises
consumption whereas before you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you bought a dispensary and You took it
home and there was restrictions you
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't consume in public and you know
You could only be here to consume or here
[SPEAKER_00]: to consume if you start thinking about you
know Being in West Hollywood and being on
[SPEAKER_00]: the Sunset Strip and be able to go into
places where you can actually consume
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and you're in a social situation
What do we know as a society or a
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption of?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know something that's social and for
us is beverages and it's always been
[SPEAKER_00]: beverages and I don't care what culture
you're in the Japanese Europe South
[SPEAKER_00]: America, you know All of it is beverage
based when it comes to like social
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption of something so You look at
what you know planet 13 is doing right now
[SPEAKER_00]: in Las Vegas And you think that you know,
the next step is they've built out the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary the next step is we're gonna
build out this You know this huge
[SPEAKER_00]: nightclub Well if that gets off the
ground, I think it will and I think Nevada
[SPEAKER_00]: has already said we're gonna allow for
this Then you know, how are people gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: consume there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I would argue it's not gonna be
joints and bonheads, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not gonna be dads It's probably gonna
be beverages So if you look at where you
[SPEAKER_00]: know constellation why they made this bet
in the industry and people say all right
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it a defensive play to make sure that
eroding market share away from you know
[SPEAKER_00]: beer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know at least they own where it's
gonna migrate to or is it an offensive
[SPEAKER_00]: play saying, you know I don't think that
we're gonna see that much degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because you know, this isn't a new
product category This is just a migration
[SPEAKER_00]: of illicit to legal that this product
category is just gonna grow I think in
[SPEAKER_00]: many ways it's an offensive play for the
beverage companies to say, okay We already
[SPEAKER_00]: have this market share and I'll get this
market share too And if we do let's do
[SPEAKER_00]: what we know and beverages makes a great
deal of sense in a social consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: category Does it make sense for people go
to the dispensary and say I'm gonna buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: beverage and bring it home and drink?
[SPEAKER_00]: It by comparison to like everything else
that's available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd argue it's no it's never gonna be that
popular But but in a social setting,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it absolutely will be so I think
that's a trend that we should be watching
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think it really becomes Really
interesting until you can actually consume
[SPEAKER_00]: in a social place
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah We do yeah, I mean we're gonna see
all the three, you know, we're gonna see
[SPEAKER_00]: on top of that we're gonna see the
Unilever's and J&J's of the world the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer products goods companies get in
we're gonna see You know in some ways a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial I get involved as well whether
it's your your ADM's or your Cargill's
[SPEAKER_00]: getting involved But we're gonna see every
major category get involved and that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that all pills of comparison to what
happens when real private equity gets
[SPEAKER_00]: involved What happens when you know KKR
and TPG and Blackstone get involved like
[SPEAKER_00]: those guys are gonna You think a three
point eight billion dollar check of
[SPEAKER_00]: constellation to into a canopy is big.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nothing nothing compared To like
what happens when when when you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Kravitz gets involved and writes a check
into this industry So, you know from the
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint of Cronos I mean tip of the hat
to Jason Adler today and the Gotham Green
[SPEAKER_00]: guys for having the foresight of actually,
you know really putting a company on the
[SPEAKER_00]: NASDAQ and figuring out a way to get that
across the finish line when no one else
[SPEAKER_00]: had and and actually getting out there and
really Working with with Altria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't necessarily know if that's what
the industry wants to see big tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: involved, but it's inevitable And you know
selling that percentage of your company
[SPEAKER_00]: for 1.8 billion dollars in cash I hope I
hope a lot of those guys got very wealthy
[SPEAKER_00]: today and I hope it's a sign of things to
come for a lot of other people we know in
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry because Consolidation is
coming and you know, hopefully we can find
[SPEAKER_00]: cash offers instead of illusory stock
offers from over-inflated companies
[SPEAKER_00]: I would tell them that when they Take a
deep breath and they kind of step away
[SPEAKER_00]: from the offer and speak internally ask
yourself whether you want to be acquired
[SPEAKER_00]: by One of those companies or whether you
want to be one of those companies and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that the the play right now is
finding other groups you really like to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with that you already you know work
in different parts and different pieces of
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chain and Say, you know,
maybe I band together with that guy
[SPEAKER_00]: because we've already worked well together
We already know each other well together
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe we can then Collectively go out
and leverage that by putting some more
[SPEAKER_00]: capital together for us and then make
another acquisition until ultimately We go
[SPEAKER_00]: out on the CSE or hopefully in three or
four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go out on the NASDAQ Because you know
if you're gonna be acquired by a company
[SPEAKER_00]: Corporate culture comes into play you
really have to decide whether or not the
[SPEAKER_00]: people you're selling to Are gonna be
people you want to work with unless you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just you know saying hey I'm out but the
most the operators are being acquired now
[SPEAKER_00]: They're expected to at least stay for two
or three years to help with the transition
[SPEAKER_00]: to integrate their company into whatever
the bigger fold is so I Would say be very
[SPEAKER_00]: careful what you wish for and think can I
actually do it myself?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, can I do it by cobbling
together some assets to build the next
[SPEAKER_00]: billion dollar canvas company?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely true Right and so My
advice to the people that are taking these
[SPEAKER_00]: offers is find a way to make sure you're
not an insider if you possibly can you
[SPEAKER_00]: know if you Can say I'll take it out of
the same role I have but I'll do it as an
[SPEAKER_00]: outside consulting perspective or you know
Over the case may be but trying to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure your paper stays off restriction Hard
to do most the companies won't give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: deal like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they really want you they may But
remember that you know, whenever you're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking in there's certain rules that the
CSE has around insiders and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: period of bleed-out is You know when you
actually have open selling periods because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not able to just walk in day one
and say, okay I was acquired for 30
[SPEAKER_00]: million bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna dump 30 million dollars paper on
the market even if you could There's no
[SPEAKER_00]: chance that coming to acquire you would
let you because it's gonna you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely tank the share price if there's
not a great deal of volume on that stock
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know Do you want to put that much
kind of downward pressure on not just from
[SPEAKER_00]: the perspective of putting that much paper
in the market?
[SPEAKER_00]: But also from the perspective of the
optics that go along with someone that's
[SPEAKER_00]: an insider that's now looking like they're
running for the door so So you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: have said if you're gonna be acquired you
have to have a great deal of confidence
[SPEAKER_00]: that the company that's acquiring you is
Gonna be able to support their share price
[SPEAKER_00]: is gonna be able to to find a secondary
market That's gonna you know continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: take their paper as a certain paper comes
off restrictions for the investors So for
[SPEAKER_00]: instance, you know, they raised 20 million
dollars going into an RTO That paper
[SPEAKER_00]: comes, you know Available for everyone to
start trading on in six months time or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the lockup period is Well,
those people are gonna start, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: selling it out without having to do any
sort of filings Who's buying it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is there is there a marketplace
out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, are you working with a large
investment bank to say hey when that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: comes off restrictions And you know,
it's gonna start flooding the market Are
[SPEAKER_00]: you willing to step in and start
supporting this company?
[SPEAKER_00]: By picking those shares off, you know on
the open market and that's where it starts
[SPEAKER_00]: getting tricky and you have to have a team
that's acquiring you're working with
[SPEAKER_00]: That's savvy enough to think about these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just about the initial pop It's
about how do we how do we keep this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: steady as more and more shares come into
the float?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Alex Coleman and Bobby lady well
enough to know there's no chance that they
[SPEAKER_00]: did that, you know Till those guys are
savvy guys, you know, they're they're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to build something as they go into
their RTO They've got a you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty strong balance sheet and it stays
strong because their acquisitions are
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing off enough cash to support You
know, you know till we'll look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say we're gonna acquire this coming
for 50 million They're hoping it puts 200
[SPEAKER_00]: million in market cap into their business
So, you know, they're not gonna let the
[SPEAKER_00]: the guys run like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that be my hope for the for the
Blackbird?
[SPEAKER_00]: Founders or owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course, you know, ultimately when
you sell your company You're hoping for a
[SPEAKER_00]: liquidity event for you You're not hoping
for a downstream event or you'd like to
[SPEAKER_00]: have the option, you know If you believe
in the company you say from an optionality
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective Am I happy to take some cash
take some money off the table and then let
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest ride because I believe you know
that Ultimately, it's gonna pay me two
[SPEAKER_00]: three four times as much as it initially
did in that case You know that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: expect that the sellers of Blackbird
Objectively looked at it and thought can
[SPEAKER_00]: can Alex Coleman as a CEO of tilt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Take this company to a place that I
couldn't and if I believe in my heart that
[SPEAKER_00]: he can then I'm Making the right decision
by by making this a stock deal if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got overvalued paper and you've got the
opportunity to leverage that overvalued
[SPEAKER_00]: paper to make acquisitions it's You know,
it's your financial responsibility as a
[SPEAKER_00]: C-suite member of these Canadian companies
to try to use as much of your paper as you
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly can But if you're the acquisition
target Be wary, you know, you definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: have to think to yourself does this
management team that's looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: acquiring us Do we think that they're able
to stabilize their stock price?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we think that the froth on the Canadian
market or on the CSE?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is going to continue for the next year or
two to the point where at least we're off
[SPEAKER_00]: restriction We can have our exit if it's a
full acquisition or you have to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself, you know When I rather be
acquired by a group that's gonna pay me
[SPEAKER_00]: Substantially less is still consideration,
but it's a cash deal and that's where you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, it gets tricky we My firm does
valuations all the time for businesses
[SPEAKER_00]: that are trying to either go through an
acquisition or they're trying to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through a series a or series B round And
when they come to us and say well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how did you put this number?
[SPEAKER_00]: How'd you attach it to this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Over here just got offered four times that
much as an acquisition from a Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: based company and I said well Was it a
cash transaction and now it's 80% stock
[SPEAKER_00]: and 20% cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what happens, you know total
consideration if the stock crashes by you
[SPEAKER_00]: know 75% and then where's the Delta and
that's you know, we always try to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: from the standpoint of These Canadian
companies know I think they're overvalued.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's any secret about it,
but it's there It's as smart as it can
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly be for them to use as little as
cash and as much stock as they possibly
[SPEAKER_00]: can You
