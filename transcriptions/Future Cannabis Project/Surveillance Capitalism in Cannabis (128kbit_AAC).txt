[SPEAKER_00]: So we're in the age of surveillance
capitalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem with surveillance
capitalism is what it does is it tries to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest behaviors and data, data that
belongs to other people, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: their cannabis genetic sequences or their
social behavior on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is the behavioral surplus
or data surplus is harvested by these
[SPEAKER_00]: companies and turned and monetized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my big problem in the Filos affair was
my initial and ongoing concern that Filos
[SPEAKER_00]: was saying that they were protecting the
craft cultivator from predatory patents by
[SPEAKER_00]: creating a database that functions as
prior art to protect people from patenting
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that weren't theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem was there was an ulterior
motive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ulterior motive was to aggregate data,
use that data to find markers that could
[SPEAKER_00]: be used to drive a breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's fundamentally dishonest because
what it's saying is we're going to take
[SPEAKER_00]: all the data from all your children and
use it to make designer babies that we
[SPEAKER_00]: sell, where they're fundamentally
competing against the people that they
[SPEAKER_00]: were telling they were there to protect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a real problem with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So surveillance capitalism was first
popularized relatively recently,
[SPEAKER_00]: this idea, by this woman who's a former
professor at Harvard Business School,
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoshana Zuboff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she wrote this book called The Age of
Surveillance Capitalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a big, thick, 800 page,
really, really bad ass book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly well argued.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredibly clearly written.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes this incredibly damning case
that right now harvesting information is
[SPEAKER_00]: big business and people don't even know if
they're being harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's worse than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you buy, let's say you buy an
internet connected thermostat for your
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't read the fine print of
the terms of service.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're actually agreeing to share your
data about how you move through your
[SPEAKER_00]: house, how you heat your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically a lot of information about
your behavior in your house to 1,000
[SPEAKER_00]: different companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's like the history of,
I mean, even when you subscribe to a
[SPEAKER_01]: magazine, I mean, not people don't do that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they would sell your data to the
credit card company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the credit card company would sell your
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like everybody's gathering other
people's data and then selling it off to
[SPEAKER_01]: other people, slicing, dicing,
and selling it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the thing is that it's going to
come to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know why it's going to come to
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because unfortunately, the cannabis
industry is the most naive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're the most easy to exploit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whether it's patent trolling,
whether it's surveillance capitalism,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's lying to people about the
efficacy of compounds produced by the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant, so they mistakenly treat
themselves with these things, it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a seedy time in the cannabis
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's time to clean it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for people to speak out and
protect the innocent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the truth is, there are a lot of
innocents whether they know it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I think the best example
right now, without question, would be
[SPEAKER_00]: Filos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would have concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about if you have an internet
connected app that's controlling your
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizer?
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, every time you decide to
take a hit of weed, it knows how long a
[SPEAKER_00]: draw you took, how much was in the
chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's kind of actually kind of a
little bit more than you might want to
[SPEAKER_00]: share.
[SPEAKER_00]: You certainly don't do that with your
alcohol consumption.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the thing is that you have to
control that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key is I don't mind data aggregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want is informed exploitation by
the person who's providing the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: About what their data is being used for
and the ability to opt out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot of sneaky stuff
going on and it will continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as there's an app connected to
anything, whether it's you growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, whether it's you having the plant
tested by an analytical lab, a genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: lab, there's an opportunity to gather
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best way to suss out whether
somebody's legit or not is, are they
[SPEAKER_00]: gathering data and not shipping a product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Phyllis is a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phyllis wasn't shipping a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just aggregating data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what are you going to use it for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are certain kind of tests you
can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, right now, I get a lot of crap
about my patent that I wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is that I would be concerned
about my patent if the people who own the
[SPEAKER_00]: patent were not shipping a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're shipping a product,
if they're doing what they said they were
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do when they applied for the
patent, which was bring utility to the
[SPEAKER_00]: market, we've got a utility patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the key with a utility patent is you
have to show that you're going to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: utility.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way you can do that, basically,
is by shipping a product or a service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't do either one,
then they're patent trolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this example, what's the product or
service they're shipping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they haven't shipped anything yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're doing is they're trying to do
something very ambitious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they're trying to do is ship
homozygous seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seed that when they plant it,
you get the same plant every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they start doing that, which I hope
they do, and was the intent, then they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not patent trolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're Johnny Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what they wanted to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see if they become that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically applying principles of,
I don't want to say big ag, because that
[SPEAKER_01]: implies like Monsanto and patents and
trolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea of if somebody wants to plant
a consistent soybean crop or corn crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, conventional ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily predatory ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fan of predatory ag,
but I'm a huge fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Johnny Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're kind of an exemplar of how
to do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Johnny Seeds, that's where you go to get
heirloom apples or heirloom grapes or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they just really, they're a very,
very high quality, hippie run ag company
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get 1,000 different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to say that that's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, that's normal phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: No typical variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, what it is is pollen chucking
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not done like ag does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done like underground growers do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a lot of people who are
like former moonshiners who now are
[SPEAKER_00]: telling you moonshiners know how to run
the liquor business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that wasn't true back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not true now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underground breeders are not necessarily
going to drive the future of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that doesn't have to be a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually can be a really good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just about intent and what they do,
not what they say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is that we're now entering
the age where let's stop listening to the
[SPEAKER_00]: crap that comes out of people's mouths
about what they're going to do and how
[SPEAKER_00]: good it's going to be for us and start
paying attention to what they're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that will define this industry,
not what we say about the industry.
Thank you.
