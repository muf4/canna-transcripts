[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any main strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any main strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any main strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any main strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any main strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any main strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any main strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any main strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any main strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Given sort of what the markets demand for
using for that, what are screens that
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd want to like push onto the market
and say, try this, give it a chance?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't even know if we can have
that conversation anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about products these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the new vape pans and the oils and
the infused products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, flour is hard to sell these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're infusing it into a product and
then you just go into the generic sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: or indica, I mean, the only... I mean,
I'll give it props.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fan of their growing methods,
but Jungle Boys, how they've really just
[SPEAKER_00]: killing it with their strain releases and
marketing and how they do their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, it's all up to the brand and
how you can slay that marketing and
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll kind of determine which strains
are popular or not, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wants something new and I'd say
the Cookie Spam especially has been really
[SPEAKER_00]: good with putting out the winter strains
like Girl Scout Cookies, Cherry Pie,
[SPEAKER_00]: they did the Sunset Sherbert, Gelato,
and then the Dosey Dose coming from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think the Cookie Spam definitely has
topped out in dominating the strain game
[SPEAKER_00]: and don't really take too much credit for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they sell seeds or put their
strains out there, but people that have
[SPEAKER_00]: worked with their strains are creating a
lot of unique, fruity, gassy, Girl Scally
[SPEAKER_00]: type strains and it seems like those are
going really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen too much of them,
but you know, I hear Dosey Doe and all
[SPEAKER_00]: these strains online.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you want to learn how to succeed
in the cannabis business, just look at
[SPEAKER_00]: Jungle Boys and take some lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just grow pure salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's all...
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
