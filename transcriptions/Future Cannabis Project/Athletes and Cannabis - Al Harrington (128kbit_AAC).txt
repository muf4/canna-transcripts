[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in Jersey, so the war on drugs
was really real where I grew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I either seen people getting locked up,
or I was always taught to believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or marijuana at the time,
or reefer, how people used to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, where I'm from, was a gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So throughout my whole life, especially me
going to the NBA out of high school,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always afraid of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I got in the NBA, that was the
first time that I saw actually top-notch
[SPEAKER_00]: players actually using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the time, I still didn't understand
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still didn't make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked down on my teammates that
used cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in 2011, my grandmother had come to
see me play when I was playing for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Denver Nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Denver is obviously one of the first
markets to have a medical program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she suffered from glaucoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And glaucoma is always the first thing
that cannabis was that actually healed,
[SPEAKER_00]: was something they considered to heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was able to convince her to try
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was hard, because she was the main
person growing up telling us that weed was
[SPEAKER_00]: a gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was able to get her to try it,
I checked on her an hour and a half later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I went downstairs, she was
downstairs reading her Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I asked her how she was doing,
she said, I'm healed.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, it's the first time I've been
able to read my Bible in over three and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, that correlation was just
crazy that from someone like her,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I always say, if my grandmother's not
going to heaven, we're all going to hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the first thing that she would do
would actually go down and read her Bible
[SPEAKER_00]: to spokes volumes to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, I started to educate
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of that season, I actually had
a knee surgery and got a staph infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was in the hospital for 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had four surgeries in a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at some point, I thought I was going
to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I was sitting in there,
obviously, I'm taking all this pain
[SPEAKER_00]: medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this lady that I had knew in Colorado
came to see me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she introduced me to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she gave me all these topicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gave me tinctures, capsules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ever since that day, I haven't taken
an aspirin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't taken an Advil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't taken any pharmaceutical drugs
to manage my pain away from the game.
