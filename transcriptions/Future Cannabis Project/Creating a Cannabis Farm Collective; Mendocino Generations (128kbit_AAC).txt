[SPEAKER_00]: So about a year and a half ago,
some of my neighbors and friends who we
[SPEAKER_00]: all live in an alternative back to the
land community up in Mendocino County,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were, you know, naturally just talking
to each other about the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people there grow and we're like,
how are we going to survive this tsunami
[SPEAKER_00]: that's coming at us?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even really know what that means
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: To, like, make it through and retain this,
like, natural, like, pretty sustainable,
[SPEAKER_00]: chill lifestyle out in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we continue that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we decided to band together and
actually combine forces with two other
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: One you're going to interview,
Jen, pretty soon, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she was one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started working together to form
Mendocino Generations, which was a farm
[SPEAKER_00]: collective that we started about a year
and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, and we quickly grew from
three farms to we have 43 farms right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm the operations director of
Mendocino Generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We help farmers get compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We help them kind of navigate this crazy
maze of new regulation and rules and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, local and state level,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we help them with marketing and
branding and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we felt like, you know, strength
through unity was like the only way we
[SPEAKER_00]: were going to survive this.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, we all have one unified
goal and voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is definitely difference in opinions
on how things should go and need to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially because of people's personal
circumstances around their permitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that has maybe caused some of the
biggest discrepancy and opinions,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, we're all really
supportive of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so and so over here has a
boundary issue, we're going to help think
[SPEAKER_00]: of solutions or, you know, maybe they just
really want to farm and they are not
[SPEAKER_00]: attached to that land.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could move and we could help them
figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different benefits to
collectively, you know, working together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I get to handpick all the farmers
that are in the group, which is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like interview them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to know them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people come to me word of mouth
or they know one of the other farmers in
[SPEAKER_00]: the group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they've heard about us and they
come to find us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seek us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most people are pretty much on the
same level.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're back to the land, sort of,
you know, hippie folks in Mendo and they
[SPEAKER_00]: fit really well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have good rapport.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go to each other's houses for meetings
and they've developed friendships over
[SPEAKER_00]: time, too, that are, you know,
a bond because of this group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the biggest issues that my
farmers face, I would say at this moment,
[SPEAKER_00]: besides the empty pit of money that just
kind of keeps going down this black hole,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the building and planning regulations,
I guess, would be the biggest problem at
[SPEAKER_00]: this moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just because different agencies
within our local government and the state
[SPEAKER_00]: government, I think they're putting down
regulations on growers, cultivators,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, processing facilities,
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, they don't really understand how we
have been doing business and how this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge change for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like, you know, it takes a lot of,
sorry to be crass, but it takes a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: balls to do what we do and stand up when
it's kind of this gray zone about are we
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we doing it legal?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what does legal mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are, you know, taking a huge
leap towards compliance when really the
[SPEAKER_00]: government and these regulatory agencies
in our local area don't even know what it
[SPEAKER_00]: means to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know how much it costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think we're like money bags and
they're trained to really capitalize on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, until they really
understand that we're real people,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have real lives, we have families,
you know, this is not a cash crop so much
[SPEAKER_00]: as it used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like just basic survival and doing
something that we really have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: passion for and we love so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we're doing it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of the biggest problems right now
with the building and planning department
[SPEAKER_00]: in my county is that they want us to have
any building that has cannabis in it to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a commercial building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us out in the country where we
grow cannabis in my area is pretty rural.
[SPEAKER_00]: People did class K permits a long time
ago, which means the county just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like clean slated them, moved them along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, here's your permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who would have ever saw this coming?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now how do you get your class K garage
or your shop or your dry shed to
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial compliance?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge endeavor and it's going to
cost a ton of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now the county, because of a lot of
us standing up for ourselves and what we
[SPEAKER_00]: believe in and being the squeaky wheel,
you know, the squeaky wheel gets the
[SPEAKER_00]: grease these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you go in and say, hey,
I'm a real person and I have a real
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you help me?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really, I think, open to that and
learning as they go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, they're changing things
a little bit to help us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they've created this AG exempt
category where you can have a building
[SPEAKER_00]: that only touches cannabis, like it
doesn't really have multi-purposes in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: touches cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're helping us by, you can apply for
an AG exempt permit for that building if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's only a single use for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a drying shed, for instance,
or a storage shed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one big change that's happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it's positive for some people,
but for other people who naturally use a
[SPEAKER_00]: building for multiple things, like aren't
going to be able to have a AG exemption
[SPEAKER_00]: permit for that building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're still going to have to go down
the road of commercial compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually that's my case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a building that's like a guest
house on the top and a garage on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom and our cure and dry and like
storage rooms are all connected in one
[SPEAKER_00]: building.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier for powers, you know,
it's easier for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, um, new regulation change is not
gonna actually benefit me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but one of the other great benefits is
like, um, to working with, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: to working with a group is I can send my
farmers to go to these like board of
[SPEAKER_00]: supervisor meetings and say, Hey,
stand up for this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you mention this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Write a letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're all like collectively helping
each other, stand up for each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been really empowering and
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say in Mendocino County,
the local government, and is pretty open
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were quite resistant in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, really not caring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them are actually coming out
to farms now and visiting these facilities
[SPEAKER_00]: and meeting us one-on-one, having personal
conversations who run into them at the
[SPEAKER_00]: grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, you know, reach out at different
events or we have mutual friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's kind of the way we were like
building a rapport with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Oh, these are real people.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: These aren't just like, you know,
crazy dope growers, like giant trucks that
[SPEAKER_00]: have all this money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they think that we all are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I think that they're coming
around, but I think there is still some
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance, especially in these new
departments that are having to get
[SPEAKER_00]: involved because the state is going down
the legal road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these people in building and
planning, for instance, are like anti,
[SPEAKER_00]: but because they never had to deal with us
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once they establish friendship
relationships or rapport with people,
[SPEAKER_00]: we come into the office every day,
ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like here representing 43 farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, Oh, you're a cool person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to help you now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now they're starting to kind of
come around and be more friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like a regular, like a,
it's normal, more normal now.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the state licensing, I'm not really
sure what to say about that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I am nervous about it personally,
and I would say our collective and our
[SPEAKER_00]: farm group doesn't really fit into one of
the licensure categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I didn't really know where to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go with that at this moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, my farm, it's pretty obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but for the rest of it, I'm not quite
sure yet how that looks every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I opened my email or I get a phone call
from somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they say, have you heard about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know about this yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what are we going to do about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, every day it's just like,
I kind of feel like one of those,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like training for the army.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like run through the tires and then you
climb the wall and then you like launch
[SPEAKER_00]: over this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every day it's something new and you
just have to like just roll with it and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you have to be flexible or
you're just not going to survive this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry. Okay.
