[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about within the
cooperative model the value of working
[SPEAKER_00]: with genetics that are being bred on small
farms because of our roots into the
[SPEAKER_00]: culture and how a lot of people coming
into the industry you know they don't they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have access to that so what they're
going to be having more of is more of
[SPEAKER_00]: those you know sour diesels all the
dessert flavors all you know all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's really going to be challenging as
a small craft farmer to compete with their
[SPEAKER_00]: operation costs their efficiencies at
scale and what they're able to bring them
[SPEAKER_00]: to the market and of course as a small
farmer we have the capability of growing a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that's more high quality because
it's at small scale but when it's just in
[SPEAKER_00]: a jar in a glass case at a dispensary all
people are looking at is the jar and the
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and the price and so really again it
all brings it back to the ability to you
[SPEAKER_00]: know have a story tell that story and
convey that to the consumer so yeah anyway
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome I'm really glad you made the trip
up and I'd love to hear what you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: say cool thank you man I appreciate it
yeah I've been thinking about a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these things really ever since I met BAM
I'm sitting in for BAM and BAM and I met
[SPEAKER_01]: each other about four or five years ago at
a genetic conference after he posted
[SPEAKER_01]: something on Instagram talking about
applied genomics in the cannabis space and
[SPEAKER_01]: so the two of us got together we went to
the program we studied applied genomics
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much from 2015 onward together you
know interacting through Instagram and
[SPEAKER_01]: through different social media networks
and at that time we kind of saw what was
[SPEAKER_01]: going on and we wanted to preserve and
maintain what we had because we knew what
[SPEAKER_01]: was coming we knew that big agri industry
was going to be coming in they were going
[SPEAKER_01]: to move into this space and we know what
they've done historically to every other
[SPEAKER_01]: crop and to every other small farming
industry that has ever existed we there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a great chart the chart that was posted
announcing we coming to this event it
[SPEAKER_01]: really shows the impact that that model
has on genetic diversity and that genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity is directly correlated to
cultural complexes it's specific regional
[SPEAKER_01]: place-based cultures that develop things
that are specifically adapted to their
[SPEAKER_01]: environments and that's what gets lost in
the big agri industry model and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what if that takes over and that becomes
just ubiquitous and the only thing that we
[SPEAKER_01]: have in cannabis and that means all of us
are gone and that means that all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: heirloom varieties that we all love and
cherished and all the culture and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that we've built for the last
30 years 40 years that people have been
[SPEAKER_01]: you know engaging in this activity in the
Americas as we kind of like since the
[SPEAKER_01]: hippies and everybody started smoking weed
and really kind of found this thing again
[SPEAKER_01]: we are absolutely in a point right now
where we can lose all of that and there
[SPEAKER_01]: are large capitalized forces that are
designed specifically with that goal and
[SPEAKER_01]: that objective in mind and it's through
events like this and through coming
[SPEAKER_01]: together and building resilience and
cultural competency that we're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to actually resist that the main
reason I'm here today is because of what
[SPEAKER_01]: happened on the internet so a couple weeks
ago Phyllis Bioscience announced that they
[SPEAKER_01]: were going to be entering into the
breeding space if anybody doesn't know who
[SPEAKER_01]: Phyllis Bioscience is please go on to my
Instagram sungrown mids go on to YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: search Phyllis Bioscience presentation
there is a presentation that was presented
[SPEAKER_01]: by Mowgli Homes to investors large
agribusiness investors the Monsantos the
[SPEAKER_01]: Syngentos the Daud de Ponce of the world
and in this presentation Phyllis who has
[SPEAKER_01]: been collecting genetic samples from the
community for the last four years entering
[SPEAKER_01]: them into a large genomic galaxy and
essentially sequencing all of our data in
[SPEAKER_01]: this investors conference Mowgli told the
investors the following all cannabis here
[SPEAKER_01]: today basically sucks it will be replaced
in the next couple of years by optimized
[SPEAKER_01]: varietals Phyllis will be creating these
varietals and according to Mowgli they
[SPEAKER_01]: have a number of competitive advantages
that will preclude anyone else from
[SPEAKER_01]: entering into the cannabis breeding space
specifically their genomic data derived
[SPEAKER_01]: from the testing business as well as a
tissue culture operation which will allow
[SPEAKER_01]: them to scale and gain market share more
rapidly than any of their competitors or
[SPEAKER_01]: any of our traditional cannabis
cultivators Phyllis's competitive
[SPEAKER_01]: advantage will be so great according to
Mowgli that growing their plants won't be
[SPEAKER_01]: optional three in addition to this this is
all being done with the endgame and intent
[SPEAKER_01]: for Phyllis to position themselves to be
an attractive acquisition for the big four
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural companies or to attract
enough investment to scale up and become
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves the fifth big agricultural
company he specifically names members of
[SPEAKER_01]: the advisory board with links to Daud de
Ponce and Syngenta as well as executives
[SPEAKER_01]: with experience in corporate exits their
plan has always been to take our data use
[SPEAKER_01]: the data to then put it into applied
genomics and take all existing plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material and genetic resources to develop
their own optimized varietals what that
[SPEAKER_01]: basically means is high yielding pest
resistant they're claiming varieties that
[SPEAKER_01]: are designed and created through selective
pressures that are not based on genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity on these particular traits and
qualities that we have developed in our
[SPEAKER_01]: specific local regions that we've been
cultivating for decades instead their
[SPEAKER_01]: model is one of absolute uniformity and
maximization of the production that's all
[SPEAKER_01]: they care about it's all about market
share and the margins that they're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: make off of the crop that's all that
matters and that model has historically
[SPEAKER_01]: produced the results that we've seen in
every other industry particularly the
[SPEAKER_01]: grain industry but specifically every crop
75% of it is controlled by the four main
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural industries and to the extent
that there are some anomalies where about
[SPEAKER_01]: 25% of market share is represented by
traditional heirloom cultivators and small
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators those are rare far and few
between and the only reason those exist is
[SPEAKER_01]: because people got together organized and
actually preserve their cultural legacy
[SPEAKER_01]: and their genetic resources failure to do
so literally means extinction that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're posed with right now and so that's
why we need to get organized and we need
[SPEAKER_01]: to get back to our roots we need to
remember how we came here and how we
[SPEAKER_01]: preserved all of these plants and created
all this diversity and the beauty that we
[SPEAKER_01]: love in this plant the cultural traditions
and everything that has brought us
[SPEAKER_01]: together is what we're seeking to preserve
and we need to go back and remember those
[SPEAKER_01]: dynamics specifically right now what's
going on is that legalization has been an
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly disorienting effect people are
scared they're backwards bureaucracies we
[SPEAKER_01]: have to interact with supply chains and
markets that maximize inefficiencies as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to efficiencies that this is
causing anxiety and forcing people into
[SPEAKER_01]: forced decisions and compromises and even
the best circumstances and more than that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're facing capitalized operations with
business plans that are specifically to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell below the cost of production to drive
down costs and eliminate their competition
[SPEAKER_01]: that means eliminating us so we have to
build resilience and we have to survive we
[SPEAKER_01]: have to make it through these next few
years to even have anything to look
[SPEAKER_01]: forward to in the cannabis space it's
moments like this that we need to rely on
[SPEAKER_01]: our culture and our traditions to
cultivate the reliance necessary to
[SPEAKER_01]: confront these conditions we need to get
back to our roots remember that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: always been adaptive and resilient we need
to remember that it was always about
[SPEAKER_01]: overgrowing the system we have a
responsibility to take leadership for
[SPEAKER_01]: preserving and adapting our culture and
traditions to the current context this is
[SPEAKER_01]: our culture these are our traditions that
have brought us together if we take
[SPEAKER_01]: leadership and accountability for them now
we will create the resilience that we need
[SPEAKER_01]: to survive everything we've done
historically is what needs to be done now
[SPEAKER_01]: we've already done this before we figured
out how to grow hundreds of pounds off of
[SPEAKER_01]: six plants when they imposed six plant
limits like we can figure out to do
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible things in very confined spaces
because we're adaptive and resilient
[SPEAKER_01]: people and we just need to remember that
not allow the disorienting fear-based
[SPEAKER_01]: zero-sum sort of dynamics that is being
imposed upon us to take over and allow us
[SPEAKER_01]: to forget who we are and lose ourselves in
this process a key part of this is
[SPEAKER_01]: education these events sorry I'm not great
with mics these events are absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: vital this is how we learn how we find
each other build permanent recurring
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities to elaborate and strengthen
our cultural bonds and traditions we're
[SPEAKER_01]: all becoming forced to become experts on
the fly everything from business to supply
[SPEAKER_01]: chain management to a whole host of things
that a lot of people who started out
[SPEAKER_01]: because they loved pot wanted to grow a
plant that was illegal never thought they
[SPEAKER_01]: were going to be getting into but we've
all had to become experts we've had to
[SPEAKER_01]: become legal experts we've had to become
regulatory experts we've had to become
[SPEAKER_01]: economic experts we've had to become
scientists and that's just rising to the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment that's what we've always done and
that's what we'll continue to do
[SPEAKER_01]: additionally we're being forced one of the
primary issues that we're being confronted
[SPEAKER_01]: with right now is an issue of scientific
illiteracy there are a lot of people who
[SPEAKER_01]: are very smart who were inspired to come
and get involved in cannabis and those
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals are people that we need to
look to now the people who actually
[SPEAKER_01]: understand science and who have been
engaged in the sciences in their everyday
[SPEAKER_01]: lives but also love cannabis we need to
find those people we need to bring them
[SPEAKER_01]: into these spaces we need to encourage
them to become leaders in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: space because we need them now more than
ever we need to develop our own cultural
[SPEAKER_01]: literacy and scientific literacy
specifically one of the reasons why philis
[SPEAKER_01]: was able to do what they were able to do
is because people honestly don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the technology and they don't
understand the science around it we need
[SPEAKER_01]: to demystify plant breeding this is one of
the primary tasks that we have as a
[SPEAKER_01]: community plant breeding seems like
wizardry it seems incredibly complicated
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not it's a very simple process of
observing and engaging with your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that's all it really is and selecting for
things that you find desirable across time
[SPEAKER_01]: that's all we're doing here we need to
encourage people just to get out there and
[SPEAKER_01]: do it do not sit back and think oh I don't
have breeding stock or I don't actually
[SPEAKER_01]: know how to do breeding or that's what
those other people do experts do we all
[SPEAKER_01]: can breed cannabis and most of the
cannabis that was bred throughout all of
[SPEAKER_01]: history was bred by people who didn't have
PhDs and didn't have scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: backgrounds but just instead selected for
traits that they found desirable and had
[SPEAKER_01]: cultural complexes that selected for those
traits and we can look through Central
[SPEAKER_01]: Asia and the cultural complex that arose
around cannabis there and how that had
[SPEAKER_01]: impacts on the genetic resources and why
Afghan plants are morphologically and
[SPEAKER_01]: chemically the way that they are while why
South Indian and South Asian and African
[SPEAKER_01]: strains are the way that they are that's
because they were in specific cultural
[SPEAKER_01]: complexes they were isolated over time and
people selected for traits that they value
[SPEAKER_01]: so in South Africa in South India South
Asia Southeast Asia they were selecting
[SPEAKER_01]: for high THC flowers in the Central Asia
and Afghanistan in the Middle East they
[SPEAKER_01]: were selecting for hashish and we can see
the actual impact that those selective
[SPEAKER_01]: pressures and those cultures had on the
plant thousands of years later and we've
[SPEAKER_01]: inherited that tradition and those
cultural resources now and it's upon us to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that down the line hundreds of
years from now thousands of years from now
[SPEAKER_01]: people don't look back on us at this time
in this place is having fucked it all up
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really what what's going on right
now you you
