[SPEAKER_02]: So I grow a lot of pineapple, and the
reason why I like the pineapple is because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's antifungal, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's citrus, so it's like, it's
antifungal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then what I was going to say was,
you know... And do you live in a sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: moist growing region?
[SPEAKER_02]: I live on the coast, a meadow coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even my inland property isn't really
inland.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes tons of smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and that breeding came from
like decades of farmers coming and saying
[SPEAKER_02]: like, hey, dude, grow cheese and
pineapple.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you're gonna... And now I'm
growing a lot of royal kush, and the royal
[SPEAKER_02]: kush is actually doing phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: In those areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I watch out for PM?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dude, that's so funny you said that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is definitely, like, that's our
front runner right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, it's funny you said royal kush and
pineapple, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very obscure terpene that you never
really see show up as a primary terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called awesomene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just an awesome terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like, you know, it's
O-C-I-M-E-E.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have awesomene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so awesomene, you see in like... So
awesomene, you see either track with
[SPEAKER_01]: myrcine or you see track with terpeniline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the Hawaiian Sativa strains,
they'll be terpeniline and awesomene.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, like, you have this whole group
of the myrcine strains, like where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: myrcine awesomene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's things like papaya and mango,
green crack, dream queen, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then also, you know, you have,
you know, in a similar group, you have,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, in the pines, certain pineapple
kushes, you know, and so in this in this
[SPEAKER_01]: varietal called royal pines, it's a cross
of in the pines and royal kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just tested it from a few different
places in Mendo to be awesomene dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: with very little myrcine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like it's so that I mean,
that's that's such an exciting area,
[SPEAKER_01]: the direction for us where we can help
empower breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And farmers, because it's like if you can
identify all the archetype smells on the
[SPEAKER_01]: road map and then start working with them
to see which ones work better in your in
[SPEAKER_01]: your climates and your Appalachians and
all this stuff, you know, and then from
[SPEAKER_01]: that knowledge, you can start creating and
crossing obscurities where you don't see
[SPEAKER_01]: certain terpenes ever show up with each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that's where I feel like the
real magic is so much of us bringing back
[SPEAKER_01]: what this plant has to offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's through the empowered
farmers and breeders who are geeked out on
[SPEAKER_01]: this Terp subject and who are then,
you know, yeah, like identifying,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, shit, awesomene, phenodominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, a point zero five
percent outlier in the ten thousand sample
[SPEAKER_01]: data set.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like that's unique,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really that's what we're talking
about when we're talking about regionally
[SPEAKER_02]: specific breeding, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that that royal pines is something
we're working on as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got me and Jean and Ben Anderson from
from Emerald family.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing they're like our Emerald
Mountain Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's Mandelbrot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw it.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's Mandelbrot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we've got Jean and we've got the
in the pines.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got me and Jean's pineapple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've got this RK 47.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're so which is which is Mandel's
like Starchild.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have both of those going in because
they're a one number one performers on our
[SPEAKER_02]: specific land.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were bred.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the Jean's pineapple was bred on
the north face of the Kato Mountain in
[SPEAKER_02]: Leytonville.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like, you know, you're getting
it's dark by five and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he's low.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got the old river mountain influence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like it's cold and it's sort of
dark.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and then you have, you know,
so Jean is a perfect grower, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder to work with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mandel grew most of his stuff,
you know, in, you know, redwood,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, duff soil in Kabchi,
you know, so like and an albion to like
[SPEAKER_02]: Kabchi albions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like Kabchi albions are too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, so we're having this,
you know, this like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: cold or, or, you know, low lumen dominant,
you know, you know, pineapple,
[SPEAKER_02]: which becomes susceptible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other strain would be susceptible to
powdery mildew or to bud rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have botrytis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's surprising the pineapple isn't
because it stacks too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have, I have, I just harvested a
greenhouse before I came here and the,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I did, yeah, I did it the night I was
leaving for here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I harvested an entire greenhouse and then
I left my wife, my wife, I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: she's like, who's going to be watching
this and the pigs and the horses and all
[SPEAKER_02]: this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, you know, you got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're pregnant.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was throwing, she was throwing,
she was, she was, she, she fucked up and
[SPEAKER_02]: told me she could do depths.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, uh, seven 15 sweeties.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, okay, I'm on my way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm going to go outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were, so, so we've, you know,
we pulled it in the first greenhouse I've
[SPEAKER_02]: ever pulled in my entire life that had
zero mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not one dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how many oscillating bands I
had in that greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's insane.
Whoa.
Zero mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what's so exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all pineapple.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing is it's like that,
that, that, and then the plants and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, and we, you know, cause you're not,
and you're not, you're not fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: wrestling with nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, you know, being humbled by
nature and helping and being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: connect into it to find, cause I mean,
it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so many people like almost like
kissing the wind, you know, trying to like
[SPEAKER_01]: put, you know, all these random things
cause they wanted like, I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what's going to be good there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like go through so much suffering
and battling and like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: their market says, their market says,
Oh, Hey, um, their market's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Hey, uh, I love sardines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love sardines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love sardines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love sardines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, man, sardines does not grow
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, so like, so like,
you know, Kyle decides like, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: throw in a bunch of sardine two miles from
the coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to, you know, he's not going to
have an expression for shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other thing is too,
is it's like, you know, we're one
[SPEAKER_02]: rainstorm away from screwing everything
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not the bud rot that gets us all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the, it's the, it's the trichome
wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a trichome wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, we're, I mean like,
we're like macheteing plants before a
[SPEAKER_02]: rainstorm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just like, get these things in,
running like new.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but, but it's like, but all
delicate, like we're rushing to be very
[SPEAKER_02]: delicate, you know, and, and, you know,
in getting every, cause after,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, we're just spending, you know,
five, six months, you know, cultivations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So start early in the morning,
like praying to your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, dude, it's such a, such a like
devastating thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dude, when a rain comes and you're not
adequately posted or staked or trellised,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like so devastating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, a thousand pound or I mean
a thousand dollar like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: arm just broke off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically Appalachian of origin,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Appalachian of origin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the origin of how the plant
expressed itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have Te Wa, which comes in and Te
Wa is love, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what I say.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you can't define love.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't define Te Wa.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, layman's definition
would be the epigenetic qualities of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant coming out through the environmental
expression of the person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The environmental impacts, you know,
and, and so therefore, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant expresses itself fully in what
environment?
[SPEAKER_02]: The truth around Te Wa and the truth
around expression, right, is in
[SPEAKER_02]: Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's defined in Appalachian of origin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be the boundary that protects
our ability to grow in soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growing in, growing in a smart pot,
growing in an engineered soil in the sun
[SPEAKER_02]: is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, good, good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did a good job growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got all your smart pots and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, way to not be
indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, now let's talk about how your
plant expresses itself in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking about, I mean,
the numbers get thrown around about like
[SPEAKER_02]: 75.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets totally esoteric because we're
talking about the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about the full mycelium network of
the entire soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: The communication, everything,
the entire environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, they're tapping into each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's, it's internet services.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the IG.
[SPEAKER_02]: For, for plants, you know, and so,
and so now we say, okay, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the, the, the, the, the outdoor
farmer just became a Te Wa farmer,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It just became an Appalachian farmer,
you know, and that's where you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: start to see the reserve quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where you're going to start to see
the hand touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's where you see all the things that you
want to see, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming from a high quality project
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a regeneratively farmed product
coming out of that Appalachian system.
[SPEAKER_02]: The standards are going to be set,
like I said, about 25 engineered,
[SPEAKER_02]: 75 native.
[SPEAKER_02]: That 25 engineered is probably going to,
most likely going to have engineered
[SPEAKER_02]: either on site or within the Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's sharing the same microbiome that
it's inoculated with the same,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, fungal spore and content that
that's, that's native to that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does this mean that people who grow in,
for example, the areas of Humboldt where
[SPEAKER_00]: they always say the soil is so clay like
that I need to use so much potting soil
[SPEAKER_00]: from whatever vendor that they probably
won't be able to achieve Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're, they're not educated.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not educated on the fact that it's
worked to create that living soil
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mineral content, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you live in, if you live in Humboldt
and you have an area that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that says like, Oh my God, my clay soil,
like it's impenetrable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It retains all of the moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way there's no drainage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to use engineered soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I call BS because the idea is
now with regenerative farming,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not now with regenerative farming,
enter in back in regenerative farming
[SPEAKER_02]: practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're engineered soil, engineered soil,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't from a bag, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's human touch soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's like this, you can engineer
soil, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I engineer soil every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a soil farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my responsibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: To my brand, especially growing an annual,
that's not going to be able to grow year
[SPEAKER_02]: after year after year after year of here
in the same hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have six months to grow that one
plant or eight months to grow that one
[SPEAKER_02]: plant that I have to engineer the highest
quality soil derived from my specific tow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes into that now and conditions the
native soil, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now year after year after year after
year after year, my soil, when you dig
[SPEAKER_02]: your hand in it is permeable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't start that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the microbes, all the living
organisms from the wood chipped kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: tree native to your land, you know,
that degrades over two years and becomes a
[SPEAKER_01]: super high humic source, humus source with
all these protozoa and native fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, yeah, it's and it's constantly
feeding organisms and like all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, you know, creating this living
entity, you know, it's like and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you're feeding it, you know, and then and
yeah, over time it then is able to become
[SPEAKER_01]: like I mean, there's there's ways that,
you know, through regenerative farming
[SPEAKER_01]: practices, you can regenerate inches of
topsoil, you know, the most fertile rich
[SPEAKER_01]: topsoil, you know, and it can reverse the
effects of desertification, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when done right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brings life back to the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're living in concert with
the environment of the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it is necessary that we use this
time and place to to push regenerative
[SPEAKER_02]: farming practices or to hold space for
regenerative farming practices to the rest
[SPEAKER_02]: of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your point to the humble farmers who
make that claim, that's why I'm using the
[SPEAKER_00]: big smart pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The claim to the guys that are that are
using the big smart pots is they're lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're lazy in one way because they want
to get the biggest plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the least amount of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mean that they didn't work to haul
their soil in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, in a lot of ways, they probably
worked a lot harder, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: to get all that soil and to build all that
infrastructure to make sure that that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant was able to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hella fast and hella short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because at the end of the day,
we want 15 pounders, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife thinks I'm an idiot because I like
to grow one pounders and I like to grow a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to grow a lot of one pounders in
native soil because I see highest quality
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see the highest quality of my life,
my children's life, my patients' lives
[SPEAKER_02]: when they're smoking my cannabis that's
grown in my soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it's like, yes, it would be
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be great if somebody wanted to
come and just give me a million bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying don't ever give me money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not in it for the money, but I'm
saying I'm not willing to sacrifice the
[SPEAKER_02]: earth, you know, to that capacity for
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to those humble farmers, you're saying
you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start like building up your take your clay
soil and basically slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I say to humble farmers, if you want
to be recognized as Appalachian grown
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, you must grow in soil because
the relationship between soil and sun is
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's at local soil, local,
no, like native soil, your soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when, yeah, when I say soil,
like I don't even add an engineered soil
[SPEAKER_02]: because like, it's like, whatever,
like I, you know, like those are like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so it's like, so it's like,
I mean, I would hope that everyone who has
[SPEAKER_02]: a cannabis farm has a huge compost pile,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like, I mean, it just makes sense,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're participating in that much
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a wood, a wood source,
you know, native to your land.
[SPEAKER_02]: Family tree guys are out on the roads
clearing, you know, PG and E stuff every
[SPEAKER_02]: day out from, trust me, I know like I got
a dump site.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone on my farm has been, I high five
those guys when they stop me on the side
[SPEAKER_02]: of the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they, they all know how to get into
my farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all know which gate to go into.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all know where to dump all of my
chippings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get them to come by and chip up all of
my stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I build my piles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like gold, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is like gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, and that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I have the wood build down
the road that I get all of my sawdust
[SPEAKER_02]: chips from, chip all that in, you know,
mix all of that in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I have, I mean, I have collard
greens with leaves like that big on them
[SPEAKER_02]: grown in like pig shit and redwood dust,
you know, like, like no bottle of
[SPEAKER_02]: anything, you know, just, just pig shit
and redwood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, and they are raging,
you know, and then I look at like
[SPEAKER_02]: engineered soil patches and things of that
nature that I'm like, they're doing all
[SPEAKER_02]: right, you know, but they didn't
homogeneously evolve with my soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: My soil has been active, you know,
on that land.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a participant in my system,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, it is, you know, it's in synergy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no one dominant participant,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all, the equal parts to make up the
whole, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, so that's, that's,
that's synergy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're building synergy and the Appalachian
system standards are going to be around
[SPEAKER_02]: synergistic agricultural models,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: System regenerative, like that's,
that those are going to be the important
[SPEAKER_02]: platforms, you know, going forward for
standards and Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and I'm, and that's,
yeah, that's, that's, that's so humble
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers, you can do it, you know,
just start, start the path.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, should we get Al Franken to do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Humble farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendo farmers too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's all farmers, all farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biggest up to the farmers, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it's, it's where it all comes
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, it's the foundation of
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, it's like,
I think, yeah, as long as people focus on
[SPEAKER_01]: just, you know, not, not, not trying to
focus on how big other people are doing
[SPEAKER_01]: and how big everybody's going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just focusing, doing what you're doing
well and learning more and more by the day
[SPEAKER_01]: from, you know, every day is a school day
and like learn from the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: learn from the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, if you just potting up in the
smart pots with like in ProMix and
[SPEAKER_01]: three-part GH-ing it, it's like,
you're almost in a huge way out of touch
[SPEAKER_01]: with this whole life cycle that the plant
can empower you with and then make you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the best farmer in the world,
you know, but it's like teaming with
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes and understanding the symbiosis
of like this, you know, the systems
[SPEAKER_01]: approach towards how we grow this plant,
how the plant grows up, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, you said it though,
big isn't always better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're growing hella leaf,
you're growing hella stalk, you're growing
[SPEAKER_02]: hella, you know, like these large calls.
So,
I mean, you're growing hella leaf,
you're growing hella stalk, you're growing
hella stalk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, you're growing hella stalk.
