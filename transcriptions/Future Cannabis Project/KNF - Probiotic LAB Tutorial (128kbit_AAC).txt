[SPEAKER_00]: Rinsing with spring water allows for
cultivation of a diversity of local
[SPEAKER_00]: indigenous airborne bacteria to settle
attracted to the starch or sugar in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rice rinse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This rice rinse will set out of direct
sunlight covered in a permeable lid for
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately three to five days depending
on conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Attuning one's nose to the sweetness and
slight sour of lab or lacto acid bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: by smelling this rice wash daily will
allow you to hone your skills at
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting at just the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because conditions such as humidity and
temperature and locality define the
[SPEAKER_00]: condition of culture within this method,
becoming a practice lab maker is
[SPEAKER_00]: essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: It truly is a good time to be a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a time for its friendliness to be
discovered and down the rabbit hole we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lab is an aerotolerant anaerobic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's found in milk and decomposing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used abundantly in fermentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a major player in our own biome and
as with our plant cousins, helps us
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolize our nutrients and maintain a
healthy immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's make some lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you'll need milk, jar, and your
inoculated rice water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's important your choices in milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use any kind of milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want more of the lab solution,
choose a milk that's low in fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to use the fat and what's left
over from making the lab into cheeses,
[SPEAKER_00]: then use as high a quality of milk as you
choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour your inoculated rice water into your
larger jar first, so pouring the milk has
[SPEAKER_00]: the action of stirring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour at one to ten ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using your hand in measuring helps you to
develop the hand-eye coordination to
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve consistency in future intuitive
measuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using a one-third air space is a principle
applied to light ferments and inoculations
[SPEAKER_00]: within KNF or Korean Natural Farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are in essence creating a microclimate
of proportional humidity and temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: conducive to the reproduction of your
inoculations and the extraction capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: of your light ferments.
[SPEAKER_00]: A clear separation between curd and whey
indicates a good collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test with your nose that the aroma is
still evocative of living organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, tart or slightly acidic with
floral overtones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each collection will vary slightly
according to place, time, and conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: and inherent diversity within your
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scrape any discolored surface off the top
of the curd and gently break it up with
[SPEAKER_00]: either a spatula or a slotted spoon for
lifting out of the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lab is effective in making big-sized
fruits and leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use too much, sweetness will drop,
so in the case of fruit, use less lab in
[SPEAKER_00]: the later stages and add WCA at one to a
thousand and SW at one to thirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: WCA is water soluble calcium and SW is
seawater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both are KNF applications and if you'd

[SPEAKER_00]: see me on Instagram at lalagrose,

[SPEAKER_00]: So here at Lala, we use about a quarter
teaspoon minimum twice a day, but remember
[SPEAKER_00]: it's also in our foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use about a cup in our baths.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use it to clean clothes, clean floors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, you know, play, just play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us in April for the next video
release.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be talking about Lala's
balls, Bokashi balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're coining them lab fabbier,
lab fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit our website, let us know what you're
up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can help you amplify.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you here.
