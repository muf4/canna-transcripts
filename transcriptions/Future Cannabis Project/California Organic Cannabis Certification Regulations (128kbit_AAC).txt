[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have proposed regulations for
certification of comparable to organic
[SPEAKER_02]: standards for cannabis in the state of
California Anybody want to give their
[SPEAKER_02]: actually Scott I'd just like to start with
you Give me your thoughts So I read it
[SPEAKER_03]: before the podcast and it seems very
similar in nature to what we deal with in
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture I guess to be clear and
concise is Yeah, we work in the organic
[SPEAKER_03]: sector But I'm not an advocate of organic
certification You know, we've worked for
[SPEAKER_03]: large-scale organic farms that use
glyphosate right in front of us so
[SPEAKER_03]: casually, you know, so to me I view it as
Unnecessarily restrictive which will keep
[SPEAKER_03]: you into a certain type of problem set so
I don't believe that it's not necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: that beneficial it's it's unnecessarily
difficult to navigate as a farmer and I
[SPEAKER_03]: think it's a far better goal that is
community-wide we determine a new category
[SPEAKER_03]: that has merit with the the public that we
inform them on like living soil or like
[SPEAKER_03]: what Elaine is doing with biologically
complete because You know, there's certain
[SPEAKER_03]: products that we use that are too much of
a hassle to get organically certified
[SPEAKER_03]: because of intellectual property on how
they're created and how the nutrients are
[SPEAKER_03]: chelated And they're perfectly fine,
but because they're not stamped you can't
[SPEAKER_03]: use them But if you do use them,
you don't have pest issues and don't need
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of the problem of it You
know, I'm not a big advocate of the entire
[SPEAKER_03]: process personally and I think it's better
to just farm really respectably and don't
[SPEAKER_03]: worry about a label to confine yourself
further to further regulation and and
[SPEAKER_01]: scrutiny You know, I was I was excited to
read it Because you know, you always want
[SPEAKER_01]: to see the positive but you get to about
page 30 of the 66 pages and From that
[SPEAKER_01]: point to the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's punitive It's these are all the
punishments and costs you will incur if
[SPEAKER_01]: you do not comply with this and it was
only like maybe ten pages of material that
[SPEAKER_01]: Directed you on what they wanted you to do
and then it really referred to addendum
[SPEAKER_01]: lists of licensed products that had been
certified By somebody who paid to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to be in that position But it was the half
of the document is punitive and so I read
[SPEAKER_01]: it and I said to myself I said,
you know, I was gonna go grab I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: go for this because I was like,
hey, this would be beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can create this beautiful situation
It's accepted people understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you go through it you realize that
it's it's it's another punishment and an
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction in pricing And so if you if you
start your certification program early,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's this much but each year you go
forward and wait to begin the program It
[SPEAKER_01]: increases the cost of the actual program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's if you're not a first adopter
you're gonna get taxed two or three years
[SPEAKER_01]: into it and there was there was costs on
it that was confusing but it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: lesser the greater of a hundred dollars or
25 percent of your gross and So i'm trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to understand how they intend to extract
the monies from you and how they will
[SPEAKER_01]: structure the fees And it gets to the
point where it started making me wonder
[SPEAKER_01]: did I want to even go through it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, and I was somebody that was
really like hey, you know This is
[SPEAKER_01]: something that could be positive because
it could give us some form of recognition
[SPEAKER_01]: in the in the agricultural world as a
clean product because we have such a
[SPEAKER_01]: stigma even though we're really the
cleanest product in the market Which is
[SPEAKER_01]: the ironic part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well being certified.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that mean you're not gonna fail a
test though?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean you can be certified whatever and
get a heavy metal fucking or drift fail
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then what you know, is it gonna
cause is it gonna get more money?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't know what certification
Has got fetched more money because the
[SPEAKER_04]: price of weed is the price of weed you can
add value There's a story behind it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get more volume sold maybe but Is
any certification saying?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you get this much more money Not yet
So if you compare it to what's going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry already with dragonfly earth
medicine doing the Dempure certification
[SPEAKER_00]: then you have Envirocan And then there's
clean green.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a series of different
certifications that are being offered I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry, what's Bronner's sir?
[SPEAKER_00]: Son on earth Yeah, that one as well
exactly and so there there's multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: options for what's going on in the
industry I really like dragonfly earth
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine Kelly and Josh when they have it
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like everyone that runs with
their crew It just as a personal aside But
[SPEAKER_00]: you know you have people in the industry
that have been in the industry for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time that respect the plant that are here
for For reasons that you know go far
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond just trying to make a bunch of
money And run a large scale process,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're gonna be seeing our adopters of
this just like they're a biodynamic You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, there's there's people that are
doing organics people are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: biodynamics and regular, you know the
regular ag world And it's a small
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage even still and so just like you
guys are saying from a laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective Just because something's
organic doesn't mean it passes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know people go through and they get
organic Products to make their edibles
[SPEAKER_00]: like I was mentioning earlier and they can
still fail the testing requirements that
[SPEAKER_00]: are you know That are put out and mandated
by the state for cannabis products to get
[SPEAKER_00]: to the market So it's one of those things
where I do think it's really important
[SPEAKER_00]: that if you have any interest in the game
You should definitely be looking at the oh
[SPEAKER_00]: Cal proposed regs You can make comments on
it until July 7th Which I encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody that has a commentary about that
specific topic to please You know submit
[SPEAKER_00]: it because they really do seem to listen
is what I've noticed in, California But
[SPEAKER_00]: you know whether or not someone has
decides to adopt that or not doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily mean that their product is
gonna be better or worse than another
[SPEAKER_00]: person's and then additionally as we're
watching the Appalachians project Unfold
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that started years ago And they
still haven't come into a reality with
[SPEAKER_00]: that yet You know terroir and you know the
amount of plants that are actually grown
[SPEAKER_00]: in native soil versus those that are not
which is You know fairly large swing
[SPEAKER_00]: between the two It's just something to
really be considerate of you know Again
[SPEAKER_00]: like those organic certifications they can
cost hundreds to thousands of dollars You
[SPEAKER_00]: know the amount that they're gonna be
taking off your back end when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: already dealing with such difficult tax
haste and issues in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway And whether or not that's right for
somebody's business is a personal decision
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think that it's it's interesting
that after a couple years they finally
[SPEAKER_00]: came out with it I think the naming
conventions Pretty interesting that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're actually using the word you know
organic certification Through the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: California's Department of Agriculture And
so I think that you know at least is
[SPEAKER_00]: within the realm of this conversation It's
gonna be interesting to watch all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: come into reality no matter what it looks
like yeah, I Yeah, one of the hydroponic
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities we work for has an employee
That's a lobbyist and they're actually
[SPEAKER_03]: very active in the OCAL and so I think
what the organic people need to understand
[SPEAKER_03]: is That they need to be as active in their
own certification as their opposers are
[SPEAKER_04]: and I would start there In real ag it's
mostly paperwork though.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a lot of testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean they do check to see where you
store all your shit, but I mean My farm
[SPEAKER_04]: was certified organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went through the whole process is to do
farmers markets many years ago and It's
[SPEAKER_04]: just a big paperwork thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know they come look at the farm go
right on you know but other than that
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no soil testing that they did at
least you know through any of the
[SPEAKER_04]: processes I went through so I mean It's a
watered down at best So have we have we
[SPEAKER_02]: covered the organic certification
standards for the CDFA Yeah, I think Kevin
[SPEAKER_03]: had the best distinct description of the
first three pages or definitions There's
[SPEAKER_03]: nine pages of what to do and then 33 pages
of how much it's gonna cost you and how
[SPEAKER_03]: much trouble you're gonna be like I think
that tells you most of what you need to
[SPEAKER_02]: know right there You You You You
