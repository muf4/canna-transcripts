[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you have put some liquid fish
and some liquid kelp in a sprayer and
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed your crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do this all the time and I never
saw any significant effects and I always
[SPEAKER_00]: wondered why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time I realized that effective
foliars require so much more than just
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying your plants with whatever
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if done incorrectly, which they usually
are, I think that foliars are simply a
[SPEAKER_00]: waste of time and money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to present a few rules of
thumb for foliar sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the first, clean water is the most
critical thing when it comes to foliars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so often overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard from other agronomists who say
that you should have less than about 70
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per million of hardness,
which I think is about five grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue as always isn't hardness in my
opinion, it's actually bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd say aim for less than about 75 ppm
of bicarbonates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less than 50 is definitely ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is because bicarbonates bond
with things that you add to the tank,
[SPEAKER_00]: making them unavailable to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clean water is the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use RO water or municipal water if
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the next is pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aim for a pH of 5.2 to 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a little bit higher,
but if you apply a pH of 8.0 foliar,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just not going to be effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to EC, if you're using
biologicals, aim for 1.5 to 2.5 EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, you could probably go up to about
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, there's two different
units for EC, and one's three orders of
[SPEAKER_00]: magnitude greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your EC meter says 4,000,
it's the same as four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, next, timing and vapor pressure
deficit are extremely important,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably as important as clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foliars can either enter the leaf through
the stomata or micropores, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: located in the waxy cuticle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in an ideal world, you want the stomata
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stomata are never open when the VPD is
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early morning or late at night is the
right time, never when there's a high
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor pressure deficit or when the leaf's
surface temperature exceeds about 75 or 80
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually read in multiple textbooks
that the stomata of dicots are primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: located on the underside of leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, dicots are all the common
crops that most of you probably grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: except grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So except corn, wheat, grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if possible, aim your sprayer on the
undersides of those leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And younger leaves are more receptive to
absorption as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should still cover the entire
plant, but just know that young leaves are
[SPEAKER_00]: better suited for nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, sprayers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprayers are critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: They determine the droplet size and the
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nozzle size of your sprayer is
really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any recommendations for small
growers when it comes to backpack sprayers
[SPEAKER_00]: or handheld sprayers, but when it comes to
larger growers, tractor sprayers in
[SPEAKER_00]: orchards or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to an excellent workshop and
learned about sprayer calibration this
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you need help calibrating your
sprayer, get in touch with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing this involves, doing it well
involves getting a flow meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: an inline flow meter, and determining your
gallon per acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other tip is fill your sprayer with
a kale and clay product, like Surround,
[SPEAKER_00]: and go blast a few rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the kale and clay will show you
how well you're covering your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, TMI on this subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fly flying around just like Mike
Pence thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, understand the particle size and the
charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why is it that an epsom salt foliar at
half to 1.5 tablespoons per gallon is so
[SPEAKER_00]: effective, but iron sulfate foliar is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that comes down to charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're not sure, make sure that
you're using a chelated nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're organic, that would be an
amino chelated product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If nothing else, be sure to use fulvic
acid, which may or may not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But understand particle size and charge if
you really want to have an effective
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the final thing is on formulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Step number one is fill your tank with
clean water, then apply a carbon source
[SPEAKER_00]: like fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next would be nutrients, oftentimes
less is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only apply what your plants need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use tissue or sap test or ID visual
symptoms and apply your nutrients that
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't guess or you're just wasting your
money, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the next, the fourth thing would be
plant biostimulants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seaweed is probably the best,
alfalfa extract, coconut water,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're using, if you want those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next would be a microbial
biostimulant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned, fulvic acid,
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then next I put in biologicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inoculants, teas, PGPRs, enzymes,
whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phyllosphere, the habitat on the
surface of the leaf is so key to disease
[SPEAKER_00]: suppression.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, I put in a surfactant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf coverage is critically important for
foliar applications because you want the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer to be evenly spread across the
entire leaf, not clumped up in drops
[SPEAKER_00]: because of surface tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: In conventional lag, you can use spreader
stickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I spoke really quickly,
but I'm trying to make these videos short,
[SPEAKER_00]: dense and full.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
