[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if I can get this right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how are you and your Bikoshi balls?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just, you know, thriving and ever
fuzzy and how are your bunnies?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really enjoyed seeing what the worms did
to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love all the experimenting and I will
say that a lot of my worm farms are taken
[SPEAKER_03]: off because of some of the inoculation
that you gave me a few months ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you, Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially the rove beetles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think most people on here know that
those are pretty expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to be able to get them and then breed
them saved me a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I kind of understand why that's
happening more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be part of a down the
road disclosure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Brian, for demonstrating that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we going to talk about today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to go into a little bit of
history about who you are and how you
[SPEAKER_00]: arrived at your living soils?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of like passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I'd like to hear a little bit
about how we first became acquainted
[SPEAKER_00]: through your education or your education
over egos platform and kind of maybe start
[SPEAKER_00]: there and work our way into the present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that sound good?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about worm farming today with
rabbits using a specific rabbit called a
[SPEAKER_03]: lion head rabbit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm excited to get into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually have him hanging out with
me right here so I can kind of show how
[SPEAKER_03]: intelligent they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're really fun to just have around
the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been able to actually get mine not
only to be potty trained, but to
[SPEAKER_03]: understand to only poop and pee in the
pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's all these worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been downstairs in the basement,
and he can literally go all the way up to
[SPEAKER_03]: my bedroom all the way down to the
basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously, my kids enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two little boys, four and five.
[SPEAKER_03]: So having a bunny in the house is kind of
fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he just kind of runs around and does
his own thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it improves the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can get into all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so for those that don't know,
my name is Brian Walksman, 303 Organic
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really started out I guess more in
the underground market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I'm hesitant to say that,
but it is the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I learned off of friends and peers and
made a lot of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not ashamed to say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost a lot of crops, full tents before
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, I guess, when I also noticed
that you really have to have the same
[SPEAKER_03]: vision in cultivating cannabis as your
business partners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you don't, it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I even noticed like back in the day,
I mean, we were just growing in like a
[SPEAKER_03]: basement sized tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the plants really started to decline
in health because of the friction of all
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, we were we were arguing
back and forth basically on how to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we wanted to improve the grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just weren't seeing eye to eye.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I started to take a little
bit of, you know, the money that I had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I signed up for Dr. Lane Inham's
courses on soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were pretty expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I felt like it was well worth the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my son had just been born.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had a lot of time, obviously,
to kind of like sit around and grow my
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and educate myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so once I started to learn about her
methods and that kind of stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: she had a like a private chat room where
you could talk to other students and
[SPEAKER_03]: people would talk about other up and
coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, this is maybe eight or nine
years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it wasn't like everybody knew really
even what we were talking about back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And myself included, I didn't really I
mean, I was taking the course,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it was still really hard for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's when somebody told me
about a guy named Jeff Lowenfeld,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I'm sure everybody knows about now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I read his first book teaming with
microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that kind of broke it down for a
farmer from Georgia type, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not I'm not that of an academic,
if you will, but I do love to experiment
[SPEAKER_03]: and do research and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So his book was able to break that stuff
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I started to play around with the soil
food web.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's even a gentleman here in Colorado,
that's pretty well known in your neck of
[SPEAKER_03]: the woods, that does really good work with
like worms and worm farming and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually drove the 90 minutes one way
to get that specific inoculation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I started playing around with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when I really started to
improve my cannabis skills, cultivation
[SPEAKER_03]: skills, I was then able to get a job in a
commercial facility here in Denver,
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really where the organic parts
started to come out in me is because I
[SPEAKER_03]: found out real quickly that even though we
were, you know, all the marketing and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that we were doing was
supposedly medical, there was really
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing medical about the facility that
that was being run.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a lot of things that were
being sprayed and that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eagle 20, forbid avid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I personally know that Eagle 20 was
being spread late into flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those were certain things that,
you know, when you first come on,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, this is your dream job in a way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't want to rock the boat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be honest, I didn't really know
what Eagle 20 was, you know, I just knew
[SPEAKER_03]: that, for whatever reason, the head grower
wasn't was really big on me not applying
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then when I started to do some research
and stuff, I started to rock the boat a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course, you kind of know how
that happens sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had to find another place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where I really started
educating people because I was amazed
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you know, how brilliant some of
these cannabis cultivators were.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they really didn't know really about
like, they knew about brand names,
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say, right, they knew about brand
name amendments, but they weren't really
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about like plants, like what is
really, especially on the microbial level,
[SPEAKER_03]: it didn't seem like anybody really knew
about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's when I joined these social media
sites for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one in Denver was something
called mass roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was on there trying to educate
and made a, you know, a little name for
[SPEAKER_03]: myself on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was this other thing called
do the doobie app.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was really where I felt like I
was able to gain traction is because it
[SPEAKER_03]: was I mean, it was cannabis based.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was gamified.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people really enjoyed it at first.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've ever did you ever
try that or anything?
[SPEAKER_03]: Any of those apps?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like, like many things with
cannabis, it was probably a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they both both companies ran out of
money and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's when I really brought I had this
whole organic cannabis thing, I brought it
[SPEAKER_03]: to Instagram, and somebody already had
that name.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just put the 303 in front of it and
off I went.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and since then, I've, I've seen,
you know, the dark side of what people are
[SPEAKER_03]: doing behind the scenes to now where a lot
of people are really wanting to clean up
[SPEAKER_03]: the industry and growers themselves want
to be proud of the product that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: they're farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would, I would say, you know,
eight or nine years ago, back when that
[SPEAKER_03]: was going on, it was really kind of an
inside secret that the big commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers would never grow or I'm sorry,
never smoke the stuff that they were
[SPEAKER_03]: growing for, you know, some big some
company, some big brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would usually ask back then buy it
from like the underground guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we were craft and, you know,
we couldn't compete against the
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do we, you know, we had to improve
on quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was really the only thing I you know,
it's not like we have a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do we change that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really where I dove into the
whole like organic idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for articulating what is kind of
like a movement that we still get to be
[SPEAKER_00]: like creative within because you know,
we've we've gone through that motion of
[SPEAKER_00]: like, answering to the quality issue at a
very early stage in this game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would say that, you know,
these big big time farmers are big time
[SPEAKER_03]: owners of the these farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they do understand this concept,
I really think that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: as these years go by, their product really
going to stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought we have yet to discover
Yeah, how she's going to express herself
[SPEAKER_00]: given the right conditions like it's night
and day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of brilliant minds out
there that are just popping up,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that maybe five years ago
wouldn't have shown their face three years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago wouldn't have shown their face.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if those people are watching,
you know, come on out of the woodworks,
[SPEAKER_03]: and let's discuss things because I assure
you that it's not I don't feel nervous
[SPEAKER_03]: about talking about cannabis anymore at
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this kind of stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it extends beyond I mean, she's
teaching us how to grow food and how to
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of get realigned with our natural
environment on such a profound level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's been such an instrumental
goddess in teaching young men how to farm
[SPEAKER_00]: and how to garden and how to, you know,
pay attention to their to their natural
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what a blessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also like, yeah, as far as like not
being afraid, but also realizing that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: through cooperation and like communication
that we get to learn the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I've learned so much from you,
Brian, even stepping into your basement
[SPEAKER_00]: that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like a little kid in a candy shop
and seeing your bunnies and how amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I need to know more about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just in that little bit of time,
I picked up so much knowledge just by
[SPEAKER_00]: being, you know, in communication with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's really been my goal for
like, probably like the last three years
[SPEAKER_03]: is just to share knowledge, because I know
that you've helped me in tremendous ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Friends of yours that I now follow on
Instagram, you know, just following people
[SPEAKER_03]: and seeing what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just it just really helps with the
with the time frame.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't imagine if I would have had
this like 10 years ago, if we would have
[SPEAKER_03]: this kind of platform, how quickly,
you know, it's the it's the guys in their
[SPEAKER_03]: early 20s that are actually taking over.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have no shame saying that or in hats
off to them because hats off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: They should be, you know, using technology
and educating themselves on a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: another level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: From my background, I used to play online
poker and it was kind of the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was these young kids that really
understood technology, that were able to
[SPEAKER_03]: educate themselves to beat these old
guards that played poker their whole life,
[SPEAKER_03]: but didn't see that many hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I see that same way, especially with
like the solventless guys and that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're able to educate themselves on a
whole another level.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they might not have been farming for as
long, but their educational level is far
[SPEAKER_03]: superior.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hats off to the, you know,
the guys that are out there that are
[SPEAKER_03]: continuing to educate themselves and
sharing that knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that some of them are going to
always share their secrets, but I do see
[SPEAKER_03]: some of them sharing like tips and tricks
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that goes a long way,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm sure you know as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to smoke the best and the
cleanest.
[SPEAKER_03]: It keeps me sane.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is medicine for me and if I didn't have
it, I probably would be a different
[SPEAKER_03]: person.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoke all day, every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's not the best, but it is
something that keeps me focused and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: able to get a lot of things done and I'm
very productive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that, I wish my mom was
watching this because I know back in the
[SPEAKER_03]: day she used to think that just because
you smoked a lot of cannabis, you're
[SPEAKER_03]: sitting around watching TV.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't even have TV cable.
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very focused on education.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, hopefully if somebody
ever sees that, I could tell my mother
[SPEAKER_03]: that people are successful and use
cannabis as a, they used to pump me full
[SPEAKER_03]: like Ritalin and Adderall.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom would literally, you know,
I would have to take it and show her my
[SPEAKER_03]: tongue and the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reality is the cannabis was kind
of doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I've taken it to where I can
really focus.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing actually a lot more
writing and educational things and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: really helping like really open this whole
new world that I didn't really knew that I
[SPEAKER_03]: could do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's some educational things that
are coming out that I've been working on
[SPEAKER_03]: behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this COVID thing has really kind of
helped Tina and myself who are going to do
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of these live educational classes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we still are going to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess that's like a little plug
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, when we're allowed to
really focus and find things, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a couple of places that are
starting to open up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think in, you know, in the next few
weeks, we might be able to make some
[SPEAKER_03]: moves, but please shoot out to us and like
the DM reached out to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and the DM and stuff on who you
would like to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all about, you know, I don't,
I like having and listening to other
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you and I can obviously be a
part of it, but it would be great to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brian, you're so talented at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to a, before the COVID thing
hit, we were, we were in engaged in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in planning this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went to a Instagram class that Brian
gave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really struck by how,
you know, he had this room full of people
[SPEAKER_00]: and he was definitely giving us knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, he was drawing us
into this participatory event that was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in truth, amplifying everybody
that was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a new way for us to be in
society.
[SPEAKER_00]: With each other to be on that level of
like, when, when, like you do,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you do better, I do, when we all do
better, we all do better, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the practice of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brian, you were so good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just a natural when it comes to
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really thrilled to be working with
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I just, and everybody that I
associate myself with, I just try to
[SPEAKER_03]: always be as genuine as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that carries through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a shout out to Daguerre Forge of
Melovora.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would be helping us out with this whole
dab bar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you guys have ever seen
that, but it is, is first class.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to bring class to some of these
educational events.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some that I've been to around
the country that I just feel like I want,
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to class it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that we're going to be able to do
that with everybody here in Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, yeah, it's, yeah,
cross platform, cross pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's, you know, yeah, let's be microbial
about it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see that rabbit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've always kind of had affinity for
certain things in life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've always named my rabbits after
like, it's kind of embarrassing saying it
[SPEAKER_03]: like gangsters and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is actually Freeway Ross or the
real Rick Ross.
[SPEAKER_03]: For you out there that don't know the
rapper Rick Ross just stole this guy's
[SPEAKER_03]: name and made a bunch of money off of him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to the real Rick Ross.
[SPEAKER_03]: His name is Freeway Rick Ross.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I named this bunny after he's
the smartest bunny I've actually ever
[SPEAKER_03]: raised.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was saying at the beginning of
this, he is potty trained, but he's next
[SPEAKER_03]: level potty trained to where he can go up
and down my house all the way up to the
[SPEAKER_03]: third floor of my bedroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Down to the basement where he poops and
pees on his own.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he loves like, well, he really
loves green beans where I gave him a bunch
[SPEAKER_03]: and he loves like buck choy and Brussels
sprouts and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I make sure that I feed him organics
and then he goes downstairs and he poops
[SPEAKER_03]: in the worm bins for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm using four, four composting
worms, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you, I guess I got to hold them up
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm using four compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a lion head.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're one of the smartest rabbit breeds
out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can almost kind of like this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get the, a special one,
you can get one where they're basically
[SPEAKER_03]: like kind of like a dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I can be like, come on Rick,
you know, or my, my boys like to call him
[SPEAKER_03]: Rick Rick.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Rick Rick, let's go boy, you know,
and he'll run up the stairs and do his
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he is basically feeding the rest of my
basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I'm doing down in the basement is
worm farming for living soil and just for,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, my own enjoyment, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how big, how big is your bunny?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not that big guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the breed was created in the
90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as far as I understand, you know,
that's not really that long ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's still kind of little rabbits.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really highly recommend you guys warm
farm with rabbits, but take the time and
[SPEAKER_03]: spend a little extra money on getting a
lion head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the white dwarfs are actually not
that smart.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be pretty hard to get them
potty trained.
[SPEAKER_03]: And their pee is actually kind of
ridiculous as far as like ammonia and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're probably going to have some
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have to compensate for that in your
worm bins or does it just completely take
[SPEAKER_00]: care of itself?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I, I have so many worm bins.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I have like 15 going.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he'll just run around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he just does his thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he'll poop in this one or he'll poop in
this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I notice he hasn't pooped in a
certain one for a while, I'll just put
[SPEAKER_03]: treats or hay or something in that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, the goal is to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter had a pet rabbit when she was
a baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it got, it bit, but these guys
don't bite, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say that, but they're really
intelligent and they're really sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I mean, as long as you're sweet
to them, they're going to be sweet to you
[SPEAKER_03]: as long as you don't scare them or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have had a lion head that I used to
call Griselda Blanco.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm pronouncing that correctly,
but she would bite for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's why I actually called her or
named her that because she was,
[SPEAKER_03]: she was a feisty little bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: But another, you know, another smart
rabbit, but she would bite it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I love this so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, does he beg for food?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a red wiggler?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually a big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a European night crawler.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're using the bunny poop to feed four
main composting worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we use the red wigglers, which I'm sure
most people are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like, when you know, when you
Google composting worms, that's what
[SPEAKER_03]: usually pops up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those work like the top four of the,
of the potted plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when those red wigglers are turning
things, the goal is to get about,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, 2000 of them at the top there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to turn about seven
pounds of worm casting for you every
[SPEAKER_03]: single month.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: These things are ferocious eaters,
as long as you're feeding them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are all optimal conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, if you're using like,
again, you know, bunnies eat all day and
[SPEAKER_03]: poop all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're just constantly feeding that
worm bin, and if you can get a smart
[SPEAKER_03]: enough bunny, he'll do it for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm up here working typing and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's down here feeding the warm bin.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, back in the day, I had him over,
I built like a cage that was over the warm
[SPEAKER_03]: bin.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, you run into a lot of those
urea, ammonia, nitrogen problems,
[SPEAKER_03]: where it's just, it just, I think salts
and stuff to build up in that P. So if you
[SPEAKER_03]: just put them, and to me, that's not
really humane as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if I'm going to have an animal I want
to enjoy, you know, I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I enjoy having the bunny around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's fun and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't really like that method.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that a lot of people do it that
way, where they just put the bunnies over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, it seems kind of like a
factory.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I might not be getting like the,
I'm sure sometimes he might be like
[SPEAKER_03]: pooping on the side of a, you know,
but for the majority of, of everything and
[SPEAKER_03]: for how much he poops, it is no work.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just does his thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is crosstalk that happens
between, you know, animals and people
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, I have goats and I have a
new Muscovy ducks and it's like this
[SPEAKER_00]: training process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they become like the
communication that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, truly amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they can integrate into your
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next ones that we use are European
night crawlers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those, that's actually this fatter
worm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you guys see that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they really, really wiggle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really all compost owners kind of wiggle,
but they work the middle of the pots and
[SPEAKER_03]: they work in conjunction with the African
night crawlers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why they're called night
crawlers is because at night they come to
[SPEAKER_03]: the top and feed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the reason why I like introducing those
into, you know, as long as probably like a
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 gallon air pot, fabric pot,
there's enough room where all the worms
[SPEAKER_03]: can, you know, work their little area and
there's not any competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have heard that you're using like a
smaller pot that sometimes there is
[SPEAKER_03]: competition or some of them might even
like kind of push each other out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I believe it was Rachel Gagasana was
saying that she's seen like worms eat
[SPEAKER_03]: other worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always just had huge pots as big as I
can, because I try to, I view it as like
[SPEAKER_03]: the stomach for the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I try to have as big of enough stomach
and healthy of a stomach as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're doing like a three gallon or
five gallon, something like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see you having issues,
obviously, because they like to burrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when they're working like the
middle of those pots, they're working in
[SPEAKER_03]: conjunction with those African night
crawlers and African night crawlers are
[SPEAKER_03]: another real workhorse with the red
wigglers, but they're working the middle
[SPEAKER_03]: of the pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Europeans compost things as well,
but not as fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are for me, at least I can get
them to be a little bit fatter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that they're going up and down
as the days go by building those dissolved
[SPEAKER_03]: oxygen channels for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is extremely beneficial,
just to keep the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure everybody here has like aerated
their yard before their front yard,
[SPEAKER_03]: try to improve like the health of their
grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you live in an HOA like me,
so you don't get fined.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of what they're doing,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going up and down, up and down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're aerating, building those
dissolved oxygen channels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at the bottom of the pots is
something that I've really just been
[SPEAKER_03]: working probably like the last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are called Alabama jumpers or
I'm from Georgia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like to call them Georgia jumpers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they work the bottom of those pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they really, they work almost as an
earthworm, but they do compost as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you have a really hard compacted
soil, clays, just buy yourself a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: Alabama jumpers and give yourself some
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll reproduce for themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're all these composting worms,
if the conditions are optimal,
[SPEAKER_03]: they will usually double their entire
population in 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can really start to build,
you know, especially if you're in raised
[SPEAKER_03]: beds, you can really start to build quite
a little worm population for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the lifespan of these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they, do they, cause I read somewhere
that they can be, they take two years to
[SPEAKER_00]: mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that, is that not true?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they, they take about two to three
months to mature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's said that they can live up to four
years, but I would imagine most of them
[SPEAKER_03]: are living between one and two.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, they're multiplying constantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cool thing about worm farming too,
is you're never really going to see a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of dead worms because they're 90%
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as soon as they die, the microbes and
everything, if everything's healthy,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it just returns it back to that
soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like Tina, when you gave me that,
I mean, it was like a bag, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: She was able to give me a bag when I got
back from Oklahoma and I was able to
[SPEAKER_03]: inoculate a hundred gallon worm farm that
I had used probably about a year and a
[SPEAKER_03]: half, maybe two years before that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it had been alive, but obviously it
died.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it gave me that I was enabled.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to inoculate this entire a
hundred gallon from the top.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would just water that in and then
give itself time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these red wigglers started to
reproduce over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I reached out to my buddy,
Frank up in New York.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to him with urban castings.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tina at Chris Trump's great guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ordered worms from him, some of the red
wigglers and the Europeans.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I haven't looked back since.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't take a lot to really start
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you guys, yeah, if you have peers or
something like that, yeah, just help each
[SPEAKER_03]: other out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little bag full and some time and
you can change how you grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tina probably saved me maybe a year,
two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of me trying to rebuild everything that I
had or a trip up to Fort Collins,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, to, to see, you know,
the buddy that everybody knows up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we mention him?
[SPEAKER_00]: You had mentioned him earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is he mentionable?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get this later too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know him as like the worm guy and the
only here's if you guys can figure this
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a company name and he has a phone
number, but he never answered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll get a list out to all these people
that you're mentioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make sure that there's going to be
something attached to all this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm warm farming now too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get worms from you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: And for, for people in this, you know,
I'm not, it's not like I'm not trying to,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, I'm doing it for enjoyment,
but I do want to sell some eventually
[SPEAKER_03]: cause I'll have a bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, if somebody is listening today,
if they would like to get, get,
[SPEAKER_03]: get some, you know, if you're probably
willing to pay like shipping or something,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll ship them out to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you rolled into the contest we're
doing too, we can put, yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll throw out some worms and maybe
some seeds from Duke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Free Duke diamond for you guys that don't
know a shout out to Duke diamond,
[SPEAKER_03]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'd be great to do like a little
giveaway with some of his gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that just got added to the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me about the process of building
these bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like go through a little bit of it step by
step, just cause I feel like, so what,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's in your, what do you start with?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your starting material?
[SPEAKER_03]: Really just Fagnum.
[SPEAKER_03]: I start off with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I know it's going to be there for a
really long time, I'll put maybe a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit of lava rocks on the bottom,
but I don't like to do a lot because like
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, I am more, I'm farming with the
Georgia jumpers and those are going to the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have noticed with some of my pots,
sometimes that I see a bunch of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it just doesn't seem like it's
as healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if the worms are dying
down there or I guess I would have to
[SPEAKER_03]: still experiment, but have you,
have you added lab?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I have before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I had kind of a similar issue with
that bin I'm running and I added about a
[SPEAKER_00]: cup of lab and it completely did away with
it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, uh, you know, when you start
and even when you start like a raised bed,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that there's going to be like
this little hurdle, if you will,
[SPEAKER_03]: of a fungus mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you can reach out to appear,
if you could, um, you know, if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: really forward thinking farmer,
I would have, uh, by the way, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is something easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do is with these springtails.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, these are super cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get these at like, you guys see
me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you can get this as like a reptile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but these are decomposers that are
going to work, um, in a symbiotic
[SPEAKER_03]: relationship with, uh, your composting
worms and they're going to break organic
[SPEAKER_03]: matter down into basically carbon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all know that carbon is like the
currency of the, of the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the more carbon that we have being
exchanged, everything that's going on
[SPEAKER_03]: within the soil food web, the healthier
everything is, the healthier that whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: plant is that you put into the soil,
whether it's tomato or a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that's something that I feel like
Tina myself and other people that have
[SPEAKER_03]: been on Tina's, um, Instagram show,
uh, really believe in is that you just
[SPEAKER_03]: feed the soil, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really matter about the plan
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not, we're not really focused on
synthetics or chelated, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want things to be broken down.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to be, uh, top feeding,
knowing that it's not going to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, some of these amendments
sometimes might not even, uh, feed that
[SPEAKER_03]: slip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're breaking down and we're feeding
for next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're, and we're thinking,
and that's the part that I really like
[SPEAKER_03]: about this on a larger scale for
commercial, um, cannabis cultivation is
[SPEAKER_03]: that a lot of the people that grow in this
manner are forward thinking and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking like, okay, what am I going to do
two years from now, three years from now?
[SPEAKER_03]: How, you know, how good are my beds going
to really be?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, there's guys out there that have
really gotten the fungal aspect through
[SPEAKER_03]: the roof where not only do they have a
cover crop growing, but they have just a
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful, uh, a bouquet of mushrooms
growing out of their raised beds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, I guess I probably
shouldn't say any specific names or
[SPEAKER_03]: anything, but you guys probably know who
those guys are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you go to their Instagram,
uh, you can really see that the healthier
[SPEAKER_03]: that the almost like the more diverse
things that are growing out of that cover
[SPEAKER_03]: crop, the healthier that plant is always
going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the more diversity that you can put
into your raised beds and your pots,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, the easier it's going to be to farm
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really the goal at the end of
the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, is to grow cannabis in a, in a healthy
and, um, holistic manner and give yourself
[SPEAKER_03]: more time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with living soil, like we don't pH
anything, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're using worms to, to basically do that
for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and if there is a pH issue,
the worms will tell you because they'll
[SPEAKER_03]: evacuate the pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty easy to tell if something's
horrific is going on, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: at the end of the day, you're growing with
mother nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really kind of hard to screw up
unless you start trying to add more things
[SPEAKER_03]: or, you know, when I, a couple of years,
when we first started doing this,
[SPEAKER_03]: some of my peers were kind of like,
okay, so now what I'm doing, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they, they felt like they had to always
tend their plants and in my talks and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, I would joke with them,
like go outside, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: spend time with your family, stuff like
that, because I feel like as cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers, sometimes we can get caught up in
those are our babies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are our bond chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I know at one time, um, and even in a
past relationship of mine, I probably
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't the best of a, you know,
a boyfriend because they took,
[SPEAKER_03]: it didn't matter what was going on,
you know, um, they took my attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so I do want to grow really good
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to spread the knowledge that,
uh, you know, growing cannabis with living
[SPEAKER_03]: soil is easier and you're going to,
um, have a better product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, when you first hear that,
it almost sounds too good to be true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the reality is, is there's a lot of
people out there that are, that are
[SPEAKER_03]: showing that this is a, um, going to be a
fundamental thing as a farmer to
[SPEAKER_03]: understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of harder at sometimes to
cultivate the patience that's needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: not add that, that thing that you think
you need to add, like to get away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: mental, like trying to fix everything all
the time and actually allowing for the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, the patients to allow the plant
to kind of come into her own rhythm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I mean, even from like a clone cut
or something, if that plant has been used
[SPEAKER_00]: to a chemical environment, and I'm
introducing it into my living beds,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a good like transition period that
has to happen for them to kind of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you find that this happens for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to even come into like, um,
balance with that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that even then from then on,
if I'm taking clones from that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the amplification happens through
generations as far as it getting used to a
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, it's a patient's game and an
observation game.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, it's a long man or a long person
thinking game, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're, we are thinking a year from now,
two years from now, because we want to
[SPEAKER_03]: reuse the soil and, uh, especially for you
home gardeners out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a few months go by and you don't
have to, you don't have to go to the
[SPEAKER_03]: grocery store anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can literally just whole foods.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch a couple of YouTube videos and you
can make sprouted seed teas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, like with the rabbits in the rabbit
manure, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I found here's the tip is make
like a slurry out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, if there's a, if there's a lot of it,
just put it in some water and make a
[SPEAKER_03]: slurry out of that slurry out of what the
rabbit droppings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once, um, obviously it's
hydrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just drizzle that on top of your,
uh, worm bins and they will go to town.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you take that super, super fresh worm
castings and you put that on a troubled
[SPEAKER_03]: plants, um, and you add some worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and of course I would add the
springtails.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would add rove beetles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do that every time I'm really
inoculating anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you're going to minimize the fungus
net issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and if you do it well enough,
you won't even have them because those
[SPEAKER_03]: rove beetles are vicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have, uh, the H miles,
what is it called now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a skittimus?
[SPEAKER_03]: They keep changing the name of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Predatory might.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my, that's my Georgia education.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I might not be able to, I know about
it, but, uh, academically, but it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what it looks like.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's the beauty of,
um, what Tina, what we're trying to show
[SPEAKER_03]: is that, you know, you don't have to be
this like super educated botanist,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they made me think it was that way
back in the day when you would go to the
[SPEAKER_03]: grow store.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, the synthetic companies were
the only companies that were teaching us
[SPEAKER_03]: how to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have the knowledge and it's really
based on observational skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: How good are you at just looking without
judgment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or without preconceived idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that, that observational skill is
something we all get to develop in doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of work, which has nothing to do
with intellect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has everything to do with heart and
connection and caring and being truthful
[SPEAKER_00]: about what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's so cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's, so take me, so we've got the
bins, our worms are working.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got our different three kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're doing their job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you, so, so you've, so what,
what is your, do you have a recipe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got your plants growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, how do you, how are you integrating
the worm castings and like, are you
[SPEAKER_00]: separating?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you dealing with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you separating the worms putting them?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do all that?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, another thing that, another tip
that I've always shared with the community
[SPEAKER_03]: is this thing called, or I guess the
community now calls avocado tech,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not what I, I didn't come up with it
or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I felt like I was maybe one of the
first ones to share it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, I heard it from you first,
but it was definitely like a secret that
[SPEAKER_03]: we didn't share for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that we're all showing our faces
and stuff, we're sharing with everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically what you do is you take an
avocado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I prefer it to be a little bit on the,
um, starting to mold side, but I still
[SPEAKER_03]: want the flesh in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's like, uh, almost like an art to
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you can speed it up in a brown
bag, but you'll, I personally like to take
[SPEAKER_03]: and, um, put an X with a knife,
like a baked potato and, and kind of pop
[SPEAKER_03]: it open.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why I don't come,
I don't cut it in half is because when I
[SPEAKER_03]: cut it in half, it seems like there's way
more mites that come to it in a faster
[SPEAKER_03]: manner, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, I'm also doing this
for worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there's a ton of mites in there,
sorry, my bunny freaked out, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: jumped off the table there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so if there's a bunch of mites in that
area, the worms aren't going to really
[SPEAKER_03]: populate the way that you really want them
to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I use the baked potato method.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm using, if I'm trying to use the
avocado tech for, um, composting worms,
[SPEAKER_03]: the fats and everything that are in the
avocado, they, they love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every, uh, composting worm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as I understand every earthworm
as well are hermaphrodites, meaning that
[SPEAKER_03]: they're male and female.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the goal is to get them to touch,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as they touch each other,
they all start to kind of ball.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have enough worms in the
system, if you guys check out my
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram, if you scroll back,
I've shown this many, many times,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you can get sometimes, uh,
if you get it enough, like a quarter pound
[SPEAKER_03]: worth of, uh, worms just in like a little
avocado, um, and then think of all the
[SPEAKER_03]: biofilm and all the things that's going on
just in that little center of,
[SPEAKER_03]: of that avocado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then my goal is to get them so
happy, uh, that they're now going,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, once they finished that avocado,
they're now going and searching for other
[SPEAKER_03]: food, but they've obviously started to lay
these, uh, eggs, which I actually have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I don't know if you guys can hold it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, it's like a funky yellow amber
color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you first, like when you first start
living soil, especially if you get a
[SPEAKER_03]: springtails, you're going to freak out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I actually threw away, uh,
a couple of really good genetics,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, when I got springtails, cause I
thought they were, they were mites.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I knew they were mites and
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you guys do a quick Google search
of white springtail mites, everything that
[SPEAKER_03]: comes up on it pretty much on the first,
like two pages is how to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they, at first it seemed like they're a
nuisance, uh, but they're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're working in a symbiotic
relationship and they're honestly the
[SPEAKER_03]: secret to how you're able to speed up that
living soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how many people are watching?
[SPEAKER_03]: 16 people are watching us right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the first time I've ever done
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate that Tina, but for the
people that are watching this right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: the real secret to this right in cannabis
is that you need to improve the calcium
[SPEAKER_03]: uptakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to improve the sulfur,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: You do that with rabbits because rabbits
actually have very high calcium and very
[SPEAKER_03]: high sulfur in their poop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as long as you're feeding them quality
food, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Quality in quality out, and then you're
using worms to break down that poop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't put that poop on your plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because especially on a commercial
setting, there's all kinds of pathogens
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we take that there's, there is a
process and almost like an art form to
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't take any, even though it's a
cold manure, and I should say that a cold
[SPEAKER_03]: manure, like alpaca manure, rabbit manure,
meaning as soon as it comes out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: animal, you can put it on your plant
without it burning it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But because it is a manure, there are
potential for pathogens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't want to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are we going to use?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to use worms, basically little
machines that know how to clean up
[SPEAKER_03]: everything and break everything down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as long as you use that rabbit
slurry in that process, and then use those
[SPEAKER_03]: worms to break that down, those worm
castings better than anything you will
[SPEAKER_03]: ever buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I promise you guys that anything you
could ever purchase, you could spend 1000s
[SPEAKER_03]: of dollars, there's no way you're ever
going to get what's coming out of those
[SPEAKER_03]: worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: What ratio are you using in your soil mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you mind me asking?
[SPEAKER_03]: For the like for the 20 gallons I'm
growing plants in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like you do 20 gallon, what's your
ratio of worm castings going into that
[SPEAKER_00]: soil mix?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I actually don't really start off
that that much with them, because I want
[SPEAKER_03]: them to break down that sphagnum,
but I do top feed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will probably, you know, I don't even
really use like an exact percentage,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I would imagine... Oh, so you're
growing, you're growing inside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: casting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just that's, that's your growing
medium, 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not all castings though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using sphagnum peat moss as really the
base.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using rice holes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using pumice for aeration.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in reality, what am I really using?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing biochar at all?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for you guys that don't know as well,
I got picked up for on Everflux
[SPEAKER_03]: Technologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a VP of soil sciences.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're working hard with those guys to
create really good products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the products that I am testing
is bioflux that's actually inoculated onto
[SPEAKER_03]: biochar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've actually added that to my worm
bins.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, as long as you don't use
too much biochar, it is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, with anything in life,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Too much is a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it comes to growing less is
always better.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of the things I learned when
I was growing aeroponically, I was using
[SPEAKER_03]: house and garden back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were using the full nutrient
strength.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember there was this,
it was called Overgrow, I think,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is like so long ago, it was like the
only place where people would openly talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about grown wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where I felt like they were, you know,
people were really trying to help each
[SPEAKER_03]: other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this aeroponic system, this guy was
like, well, hey, man, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're having that, those that big of
issue, just cut the nutrients back,
[SPEAKER_03]: like dial it back in half.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, myself and the guy I was
growing with at the time, we never thought
[SPEAKER_03]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and we are new growers,
I think we're only maybe, maybe eight
[SPEAKER_03]: months in at that, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're, we thought we knew, we thought
we, we had the best we're using,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the shooting powders and all
these things that cost a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for anybody that's, that's thinking
about growing cannabis that never has,
[SPEAKER_03]: I assure you that just the simple,
cheap, you know, clean, don't use guanos
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff that's, I joke around that
that's like saying like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: your, your, your iPod or something like
that, you know, your CD player,
[SPEAKER_03]: like that's not, guanos aren't really
where it's at anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a mined material.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know sphagnum isn't, you know,
it's not the best material either,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if somebody could tell me a better,
a better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you, did you pay attention to
Layton's?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you watch his interview yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, he's representing this company
that's doing a post-consumer cardboard
[SPEAKER_00]: product that you need to know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get some in your hands to play
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is pretty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could just have this little network
of people that want to help each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really been my MO in Colorado since
day one of not being underground anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're, we're revolutionizing everything
just by being cooperative and letting the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant show us the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love what you're doing there,
Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your, so how many,
Ben, how long did it take you to get your
[SPEAKER_00]: bins going?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how many do you have again?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have, I just have one really big red
wiggler bin because in reality I use so
[SPEAKER_03]: many of those red wigglers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just scrape from the top and move them
around that you don't really need a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I, I have more bins for the Alabama or
Georgia jumper, Alabama jumpers and the
[SPEAKER_03]: African night crawlers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are really the two that I personally
feel like really get the job done.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've grown for many,
many years with just a red wiggler and it
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely my plants looked great,
but having these four in conjunction and
[SPEAKER_03]: having that real biodiversity that you
helped me inoculate with is really what is
[SPEAKER_03]: really what, you know, I'm, I'm running
with right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure other people have seen like,
you can go out into the woods and you can
[SPEAKER_03]: mycelium hunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, you don't have to go and
spend all this money on, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: some of these nutrients that are really
bogus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I actually, I was working
for Everflux is because they're,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're using organic ingredients and it's
a way to speed up that soil life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for you guys that kind of want to learn
more about that, please DM me on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate those guys because they're
behind me on doing a lot of this
[SPEAKER_03]: educational things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of stuff behind the
scenes in these next few months that are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really doing transitional work with
larger farmers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for people who are interested in
scaling up, like it's definitely an
[SPEAKER_00]: industry leader in helping us transition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the product was created in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tried and true on a bunch of,
it works on over 250 different
[SPEAKER_03]: agricultural crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's obviously a product that is feeds
the soil if it's working with that many
[SPEAKER_03]: different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I encourage you guys to check that out
or, you know, reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're using certain products.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could, you could really use Everflux
bio, you know, the bioflux, the teraflux
[SPEAKER_03]: with the biochar and tera, Tina's sorry,
Tina's had teraflux on the mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tina's fuzzy balls.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really start to play with that and
kind of see, you know, that's,
[SPEAKER_03]: we would love to hear what, what you have
to say with that because we're
[SPEAKER_03]: experimenting all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Tina and I are starting to exchange
notes and we're just excited to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, hopefully with this COVID thing,
maybe we do, we end up really do having a
[SPEAKER_03]: community where we are able to stay in
touch more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I know when we would have those live
events, it was like once a month and then
[SPEAKER_03]: we would kind of lose touch for that
month.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we, you know, not everybody can
make it, but now that's everybody's kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of forced to use technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a thing with Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's trade-offs for being real time
spontaneous, but I feel like it tests our
[SPEAKER_00]: like resilience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely test your brain power,
being able to recall everything live like
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got, so we were doing a shout out
to, I want to try some of that teraflux.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some, just, you know, you know
where I live.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to visit and do some chatting.
[SPEAKER_00]: About next, next event, next, next
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I do want to hear from
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone has people that we, that they
want to hear from, we can bring together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like between you and me,
and then the people we know that also know
[SPEAKER_03]: people, we could reach out to probably a
pretty good majority of the people that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you guys would probably be
interested in hearing from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, we, we're really working
behind the scenes for this educational
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if COVID wouldn't have happened,
there would have been a lot more of these
[SPEAKER_03]: live events and a lot of big things going
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe not for 2020, but we definitely
still have big, big plans and hopefully we
[SPEAKER_03]: can do it in the fall or the winter.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get, let's do a, let's do a
consortium of sorts and get some,
[SPEAKER_00]: get some, yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to, I want to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this African nightcrawler.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're crazy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hungry little things.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely getting worms from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you say that I give you an
inoculation, are you talking about that
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit from my weird orange bin of
insects?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are you talking about the balls?
[SPEAKER_03]: You gave me soil and a cloth and you like
roll out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the things are in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, did you get a good healthy population
of the mites and the, everything from
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got something that I had never
really seen like an abundance of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's this thing called orbital might.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you're researching that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your stuff was like crazy with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I put it into one of my worm
bins, they went nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously you don't want to abundant,
but I just put a piece of watermelon and
[SPEAKER_03]: they were attracted to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I would just take them,
and then go down the line for each worm
[SPEAKER_03]: bin, you know, as the days go by,
keep inoculating.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, I was able to inoculate everything
that you saw in my basement from your
[SPEAKER_03]: inoculation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, you know, for people out there that
are watching that, that is, and it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess skill set, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I, I know the things that are
going to speed up populations and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I was talking about that avocado
tech stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys really truly use that,
there's a reason why that really took off
[SPEAKER_03]: on Instagram and social media is because
it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once you see for yourself that
you don't have to go out there and buy
[SPEAKER_03]: 10,000 worms, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You could just go out there and buy a
thousand, maybe 2000, maybe 40,
[SPEAKER_03]: 50 bucks at most, maybe a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then once you have them, that's the
beauty of it is using the avocado tech.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you just really need three months.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as soon as you have that three
months, you've doubled that population.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then now you're off to the races.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can, um, take that avocado with
all of those worms that you, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: got in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I assure you, a bunch of those are now
pregnant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can take that and inoculate in a,
into another worm bin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, avocados are pretty cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I know some people that, that feel
like you don't need to use organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I personally feel like you do,
um, when you're talking about a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: dollars there, when it comes to an avocado
on a larger scale, I still feel like it's
[SPEAKER_03]: worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because you're not potentially adding
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're on a commercial level,
why would you ever add anything that you
[SPEAKER_03]: could potentially get popped for and then
ruin your reputation or your brand or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: When you were trying to still trying to do
the right thing, you just got cheap and
[SPEAKER_03]: went cheap on avocados.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, for you guys that don't know for
anything organic, it will always have a
[SPEAKER_03]: nine in front of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so if you're not sure, like if you're
walking to your grocery store and they
[SPEAKER_03]: have avocados over here and they have
avocados over there, uh, which ones are
[SPEAKER_03]: organic, uh, the one with the nine in
front of it will always be organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Full of tips today, Tina.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm still, for some reason,
I'm still not visualizing this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your bins that are basically
your worm bins that you're feeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: your bunny's pooping on top of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do you transition that to having
plants and cover crops in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's your process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you then take that very pot and move it
somewhere else and plant it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you using some of that and
creating, um, your situation somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I'm always building up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like if I'm first starting a worm bin,
the majority of it's going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: cardboard, uh, brown, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So anytime I add anything green,
especially when it comes to like cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: farming, I add brown to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll add, if I'm adding green,
there's still a little brown in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I'm adding brown, it's just all
brown.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that makes sense because you don't
want too much green in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, uh, you could have potential
like, uh, issues, issues, fungus gnats and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've really minimized the like fruits
and vegetables and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know it's great and,
uh, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're feeding us your bunny,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also at the same time, like if I can't
really bury it down, I will, I guess
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes throw that in the backyard for
like the wild bunnies and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, cause I love for them to come and poop
on my, my yard in the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but the ones downstairs I've found
that if I really keep it where I'm feeding
[SPEAKER_03]: the worms, the bunny poop, and then I'm
giving them actually like a worm chow that
[SPEAKER_03]: I buy from a girl off Etsy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found that not only are the worms fatter
and healthier and everything seems,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's not really any more of those
bug issues because the, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's because the road beetles just take
off dramatically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once you have, I mean,
the other day I saw one that was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: no lie, like this long.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen a road beetle that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this stuff is kind of creating
the utopias and, uh, the road beetles that
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seeing that are extremely large are
the ones I put your because she balls in
[SPEAKER_00]: hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have insight onto that very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to show the bin real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I want to do two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to show you the soil that is
someone just helpfully put in the
[SPEAKER_00]: comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's called pit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I want to show it to you, but I want
to also bring this bin over and show this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, so here's the bin, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's what I gave Brian a little
sample of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then this is where the ball is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you dig in, there's just all kinds
of life in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something flew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, anyway, just thought that I'd
give people something to look at in
[SPEAKER_00]: reference to what I gave you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, big hair poppy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, I'm also cultivating, uh,
these springtails.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you saw them earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but these are just, uh, really
they're, I guess, really well known in
[SPEAKER_03]: like the reptile Levarian world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, they're known for just a cleanup crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so what I use them for is if you can
get a ton of them to, I would imagine it's
[SPEAKER_03]: probably probably millions of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, back in the day when I would
begin to water, uh, my plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: you would see it actually almost look like
snow over the entire area that I had just
[SPEAKER_03]: watered.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was all the springtails that had
just come up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once that water, um, kind of goes
down into your soil, those springtails
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of come back down as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they just take off breaking
everything down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, as you're watering every two,
three days, uh, you're just really
[SPEAKER_03]: increasing that springtail population.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a, uh, a secret for you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this stuff called morning wood,
um, that I use, uh, you can get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, uh, I think the brand name is
like Rupashi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I apologize if that's not correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, morning wood morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's morning wood.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite the name there, but that,
that green stuff there is the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the morning wood and the isopods
absolutely love this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can go and get, uh, just one of
these little, uh, I think this costs like
[SPEAKER_03]: $7 and 50 cents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they put them, um, in charcoal and
then I just put that morning wood in with
[SPEAKER_03]: the charcoal mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I let them sit for maybe like a
week or two and you'll have, you'll have
[SPEAKER_03]: more springtails than you, than you can
imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can then take them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I might not be able to show this,
but you can basically like, there's water
[SPEAKER_03]: on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I just take right, right to the
edge, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, where the water will write to that
edge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the springtails.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you get them where they all bunch
up, they'll just basically jump out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: water into the pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can literally just walk down
the line, um, and put them in the pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and if you need to, uh, move worms and
that kind of stuff throughout your garden,
[SPEAKER_03]: again, the avocado tech is how you do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single worm is going to be,
um, attracted to that avocado.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have like a, you know,
I would set up, if you're going to do the
[SPEAKER_03]: four worms, I would have four different
bins that you're using that in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can, you can combine them as
long as the bins are big.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 20 gallons.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I'm, uh, if I'm really starting
something new, uh, you would use the red
[SPEAKER_03]: wigglers, the African night crawlers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see there's some new people coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: African night crawlers, European night
crawlers, and the Georgia jumpers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you use those four in a symbiotic
relationship, you won't really have any
[SPEAKER_03]: issues growing cannabis, um, as you,
as you progress, you know, obviously
[SPEAKER_03]: continue to educate yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you really understand worms and you
understand adding the springtails,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, that that's really the secret.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and the poop is what in is for me is
really my secret is that's what's,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, really adding that calcium and adding
that sulfur, um, in a very organic way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, uh, you know, using,
um, using IPM type stuff with,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, predatory insects.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love having praying mantis, whether I
have bug problems or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and in reality, I love seeing praying
mantis eating each other because that
[SPEAKER_03]: means I don't have, uh, pest issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very to see those things are,
again, you know, you gotta be proactive
[SPEAKER_03]: with all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes probably two to three weeks for
those praying mantis to hatch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but once they do hatch and they go
through their life cycle, they'll be brown
[SPEAKER_03]: at the beginning and they kind of work the
soil, if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll kind of work the stem.
[SPEAKER_03]: They then turn pink.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then they kind of hide more in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this, I feel like that's when
they get their like, um, ninja skills.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once they're fully green and
fully established, they will go to the top
[SPEAKER_03]: of the plants, kind of like the brown ones
do when they're in brown, they have more,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, confidence, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once they're fully grown, they will
guard that plant, like almost like a
garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will guard dog, uh, at least in an
indoor setting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I will, you know, sometimes you
have to kind of help the garden,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if I see two of them on a plant,
I'm more than likely they probably will
[SPEAKER_03]: fight.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll just move them to the other side
of the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, and I feel like that is just
another way where you guys can be
[SPEAKER_03]: proactive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I know that, uh, we used to use
ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I think it was, um, keep it simple
organics, uh, Tad Husey who, who just
[SPEAKER_03]: wrote an article about all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I encourage you guys to read that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we've now moved on from ladybugs and
now we use green lace wings.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think those are fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys have ever used ladybugs,
you know that, uh, they usually just pump
[SPEAKER_03]: each other, um, and then fall over and
kind of like wiggle like this and die.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so they're not really, uh,
effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the only time I've really seen
them effective is that they would feed the
[SPEAKER_03]: praying mantis, um, when there was no bugs
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, only the larva eat, uh, pests
anyway.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could ladybugs don't do anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you can, or I don't know of
a place where you can, uh, buy the larva,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if you could, that's they look like
little like orange spotted alligator and
[SPEAKER_00]: they bite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, do they?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's painful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, so here's that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to show you the pit moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the stuff I'm going to get you
some sample of for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: To try.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's really like, it's all
cardboard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a post-consumer thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your company should be all about this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cardboard, that would be a way better
mix for the worm bins.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm already putting it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got two different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got this cocoa mix pit moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make sure you get some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would I recommend cow manure?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, I wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's Malibu compost out of
California, uh, that for the most part,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I used to use their stuff and
then something happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there was, I had like a major problem
and I started asking people and they,
[SPEAKER_03]: they had major issues and that's why I
feel like a lot of us that have continued
[SPEAKER_03]: to talk about things.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we're getting away from the
guanos and the like, other than the alpaca
[SPEAKER_03]: and the rabbit really getting away from
any of the manures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And knowing where your stuff is coming
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know your farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know, know your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it local.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, start to act like a natural
farmer and every year your medicine is
[SPEAKER_00]: where you, you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put in a semi truck load of manure that
was supposed to be organic into my outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: garden and something, like you just said,
something happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was something in there and it
literally took me three years to get back
[SPEAKER_00]: to even a level of normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what was in there,
but it wasn't good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that only comes from like
dairy cows.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to minimize that just don't put it in
your bits, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then again, like if you're not sure
about a product, just run it through your
[SPEAKER_03]: worm bins or like, Oh true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just always throw it in worms or,
you know, put some castings in there,
[SPEAKER_03]: get some microbiology going on in there
and kind of see how things work out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tried and true things are really like just
simple ingredients.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like I said, I was using that
sphagnum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe now it's, you know, just a little
bit of that pit moss using some pumice and
[SPEAKER_03]: the rice holes and then adding some of
that, you know, worm castings from an old
[SPEAKER_03]: bin and then just moving on down the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as long as you have some time,
you can build an entire basement full of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, you know, with a hundred dollars
worth of expense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's, it's really, really minimal
as long as you have the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and you know, it does take 90
days, like I said, and that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: quarter of a year is a long time,
but if you're growing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: you already kind of are used to that
schedule anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So get some worm bins going and just mess
around with it and see what you guys you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, how you guys feel about certain
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This avocado tech outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that would work mainly
because most of the worms outdoors are
[SPEAKER_03]: earthworms, but try and see.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The trick I've always just used with
composting worms and it works fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brian, are you using any KNF
applications on your plants in addition to
[SPEAKER_00]: your getting soils right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing a grow trial.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am not, but yes, when I get back to
like my personal stuff, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's I mean, that's like saying,
are you, you know, are you going to put
[SPEAKER_03]: your chef hat on today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to Boise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to Boise?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that in August?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping that I will.
[SPEAKER_03]: My son lives pretty close to there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you need to carpool or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that in there for you guys that
haven't ever gone to anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, I mean, Tina and I have created a
bond.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a few other people that I've
created bonds from because we shared a
[SPEAKER_03]: week together and we all learned how to
grow end of August.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I might not see the person again for
a year, but you follow them on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you feel like, you know, you learn
from each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really what I feel like Tina
and I are really trying to do is at least
[SPEAKER_03]: here in Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully we'll get those live events
back to some of the things we used to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's Chris's Trump's career natural
farming five day intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really like all the past
students, not all, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a good number of us come back and it's
just community building and and yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's, it's kind of like what,
what Brian's good at too, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing people together to see kind of
what happens social experiment of people
[SPEAKER_00]: doing things they love to do together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chris Trump's natural farming class,
Boise, Idaho, end of August.
[SPEAKER_03]: Check out learning from, you know,
one of the best in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, he's natural farming
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural are at soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stewart on, yeah, at soil Stewart and at
Petro farming company.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you try, if you type in Chris Trump,
K and F, I assure you, you will find the
[SPEAKER_03]: right place.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is killing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you do need to get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was worth every penny in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they gave us a really healthy lunch
and then we enjoy the evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to run down the alleyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Downtown.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick story.
[SPEAKER_03]: This lady that was a bartender.
[SPEAKER_03]: She said, Oh, you guys, you guys can smoke
some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she let us go into this back area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think there was like four or five
of us and we just started puffing tough
[SPEAKER_03]: and she came back there almost sprinting.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was like, I didn't know you guys would
be smoking like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: She started freaking out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had to go out in the alley and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Longer story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, we found an exit route like,
and ended up in the alley talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: Preston and then came back in only to
learn that like we had set this trend and
[SPEAKER_00]: like every natural farmer was like
migrating down to the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're like, there are all these
stories emerging like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, really, really that
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really big on canvas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys have more questions or stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up green bean basement,
hot bed, hot box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, hot box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really enjoy, um, you know, talking with
you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't the best get my balls in some worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Katie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Katie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I see you when I come visit Brian?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we like have a weird six foot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you hang out at my house, you don't
have to, you don't have to buy by those
[SPEAKER_03]: rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't wear masks in here or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I come visit soon?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hash out some of these details of
this larger consortium we're going to put
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Could I go over, uh, like what they do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Big haired poppy
[SPEAKER_00]: bio char doesn't quite turn into castings,
but you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, uh, but other things will break that
down eventually.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't you think like, I feel like it
has some kind of, I'm really looking
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm doing the work with the clay
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the bio char ends up having this kind
of electrochemical effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kind of a field that's getting
established through this material that
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of helps everything communicate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like the EEC is affected by bio
char in interesting ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so breeding is with composting worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Breeding is really the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, the goal is the avocado
tech, um, and to make sure that they
[SPEAKER_03]: always have enough food.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that doesn't necessarily have to be,
uh, like fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, contrary to common belief,
the worms aren't really eating the
[SPEAKER_03]: cardboard or eating the fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're eating the bacteria that's
building on the fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cardboard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as long as the, there's enough food
there, um, they, they really can just do
[SPEAKER_03]: their own thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as long as you're using, uh,
like an, uh, fabric pot, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I've tried this before when I was using,
um, like plastic bins and there was this
[SPEAKER_03]: thing that we tried called a worm bin or a
worm in that was, you know, you could put
[SPEAKER_03]: it in, like the castings would come down,
but it was always this mess.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I found that, you know,
using that hundred gallon, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: fabric pot, um, is really the biggest I
can do for my basement because I mostly do
[SPEAKER_03]: this all myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and a hundred, a hundred gallon,
uh, I mean, that thing is huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so I can like, I can move it,
but I can't like really move it around too
[SPEAKER_03]: much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so once I have that, it's kind of
like stable there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now my goal is really just to add
food, um, really get the biology up and
[SPEAKER_03]: start that cover crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because in my opinion, worm farming is,
goes to the next level when you're using a
[SPEAKER_03]: cover crop and almost anybody that you see
on like YouTube or showing how to do worm
[SPEAKER_03]: farming, they are, they're always using
like cardboard to cover it or a burlap
[SPEAKER_03]: sack, uh, which, which, which works,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, worms like, uh, the
rhizosphere, the roots, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Lenningham teaches everybody that
the roots communicate with the microbes to
[SPEAKER_03]: something called exudates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when she's giving off those
exudates, she's attracting all of these
[SPEAKER_03]: different microbes, uh, to her little
area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're not able to attract those.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to actually add those as like a
top feed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once everything starts to build into
that, now cannabis farming is easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I will say that I, um,
right before I was on the Adam Dunn show
[SPEAKER_03]: this one time, I met, uh, Soma's daughter
and, uh, and I think her boyfriend and
[SPEAKER_03]: they were all talking about how they grow
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, in a living soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were also talking about how they
believe that cannabis as a plant on like a
[SPEAKER_03]: metaphysical level, uh, knows that
cannabis has grown in that soil
[SPEAKER_03]: beforehand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have no idea if that's true or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but I have noticed that, you know,
my clones, when I put them in a living
[SPEAKER_03]: soil, that's really, you know,
been worked like, let's say at least a
[SPEAKER_03]: year, the, they perk right up and they get
those praying leaves even at a clone
[SPEAKER_03]: stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I never achieved really that,
um, growing cannabis on a synthetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that lets me know that, you know,
the plant is, you know, when she's on,
[SPEAKER_03]: when she's has her praying leaves,
you need to pat yourself on the back as a
[SPEAKER_03]: farmer, because there's really nothing
else you can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, she's, she's getting ready,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: She's taking in sunlight and she's
creating, um, photosynthesis and she is
[SPEAKER_03]: off to the races.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as long as you continue to build that
soil, um, you know, cannabis farming
[SPEAKER_03]: becomes not as hard as it seems when you
first start out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm going to put a little two
cents in there just because of what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been learning a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a book called, uh, regenerate,
which I've been pushing for a couple weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sawyer G is the author.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I love about it is he goes into
quite a bit of detail around RNA and
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what RNA is, um, in its function,
not only with our immune function,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also a plant's immune functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this cross generational talk,
the cross talk that happens all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it also happens cross generationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of what we're doing for,
uh, our plants that then succeed into the
[SPEAKER_00]: next generation, whether through clone or
seed are having this RNA conversation that
[SPEAKER_00]: is transmute, it's transmitting just an
immense amount of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of, he goes into a neat
description about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a nice understanding to have,
especially in this time of COVID,
[SPEAKER_00]: because our immune functions are different
than I think what people understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more of us that can really
understand this and understand it through
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis plant, because it's operating
there really well, just like what you just
[SPEAKER_00]: said, that it's, you know, they have this
memory from generation to generation,
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of soils they've been grown in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the RNA and the, uh, the roots,
like, you know, when, um, when a root
[SPEAKER_03]: dies, I guess, uh, I learned this from
Minnesota Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you guys know who that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but the, the new root supposedly can
tap into the old root and basically take
[SPEAKER_03]: all of that nutrition that the cannabis
plant before it had taken up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if the roots are old enough,
then obviously, uh, the decomposer start
[SPEAKER_03]: to break those things down and that,
and that, um, obviously builds up in your
[SPEAKER_03]: soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one joke that I learned from,
uh, I think it was Jeff Loewenfels is,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's kind of like it's rough
streets.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the microbial world, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's no, there's not really like a
long life for microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they're here and then they're dead and
they're decomposed and then things quickly
[SPEAKER_03]: change.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, the biodiversity is king.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys focus on that, if you guys
focus on the calcium and the sulfur for
[SPEAKER_03]: the flavors and the turps, uh,
you'll be growing cannabis better than
[SPEAKER_03]: most of your peers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the biochar would be, uh,
still there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And anytime I'm even making mix,
it's not complete worm castings.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not, uh, like I'm not making worm
castings to sell or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just making worm castings to improve
my overall grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it does have, uh, you know,
it's, it's not as clean and pure as just
[SPEAKER_03]: worm castings, but I don't want it that
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that there's a little bit of
biochar in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that those are like almost like a
little hotel, if you will, for microbes
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're able to like go into the
cracks and the crevices, uh, and then
[SPEAKER_03]: multiply and, you know, um, as long,
again, as long as you don't overdo it with
[SPEAKER_03]: the biochar, it's fabulous.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you overdo it with the biochar,
you're going to have some serious
[SPEAKER_03]: problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put one of the, we'll put one of the fuzzy
balls in my worm bin last week.
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't complete.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly what happened the same way,
Jade.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I put, I've actually put two of,
uh, her fuzzy balls in my worm bin,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, just with the red wicklers,
which actually don't eat as fast as the
[SPEAKER_03]: Africans or, uh, Europeans.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they devoured it, destroyed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the beauty of that is all of a sudden,
I saw an unbelievable amount of rove
[SPEAKER_03]: beetles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, um, take that for what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: If, if you're able to have rove beetles in
there and you put a Bokashi ball in there
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're able to get hundreds of rose
beetle, rove beetles, uh, that right there
[SPEAKER_03]: is probably worth $200.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, rove beetles are not cheap,
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to amplify any,
anything that's in, anything that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: part of, it's going to amplify the,
um, that entropic level, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: entropic level, whatever it is,
it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something in the, they're
producing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those facultative anaerobes are producing
a terrestrial form of chitin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what does chitin do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Chitin makes the plant think it's being
attacked, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a plant can't run away from bugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how does she improve herself?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, she improves the overall health and
vigor of herself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And chitin is one of the ways that we
trick our plants into thinking that she's
[SPEAKER_03]: being attacked.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why if you guys have ever messed
around with insect grass, which actually
[SPEAKER_03]: is something that we use at Everflux,
the plants are extremely healthy from that
[SPEAKER_03]: alone, because it's almost like a flu
shot, if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: They think they get attacked.
[SPEAKER_03]: She grows healthier, greener, stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are exoskeletons made out of?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're made out of chitin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a source for them to produce
big ass bugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't have to buy like super
expensive stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you can get crickets online.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would take dead crickets,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I could buy like a ridiculous
amount of them for like, I don't even
[SPEAKER_03]: know, maybe 15 bucks, 10, 15 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I put them in a like emulsifier,
like a magic bullet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just grind them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's basically insect grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's probably a tenth of the cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I said, there's many, many ways
and if we continue to have these talks,
[SPEAKER_03]: Tina, I'd love to just continue to educate
people because it takes months,
[SPEAKER_03]: years to really understand all this stuff
and know that like, hey, you can grind up
[SPEAKER_03]: crickets, and it's not gonna be a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, before we all started educating
each other, there were little things that
[SPEAKER_03]: like I would be terrified back in the day
to put a bunch of bugs into my even if
[SPEAKER_03]: they were dead into my growing medium,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I will what happens if I probably
have silly questions or silly thoughts of
[SPEAKER_03]: what would happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, once once you have that microbial
life and you have the worms going on,
[SPEAKER_03]: now you get to experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you might mess up, but who cares,
throw some more worms in there,
[SPEAKER_03]: throw a little worm castings on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get so because the diversity ends up
balancing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's you know, when you're when you
have a diversity that's inclusive of a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily that your aim is to
get rid of the bad ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just to overpopulate them with
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really does balance itself out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, nature wants to live, nature wants
to thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nature drives through abundance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the beauty of most beneficial insects,
whether they're in the soil, or they're in
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant itself, is they work in a
symbiotic relationship with one another.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's usually the alphas that emerge that
are the problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as long as you know, you got your green
lace wings, got your praying mantis up
[SPEAKER_03]: top, you got your predatory mites,
and then you got your rove beetles,
[SPEAKER_03]: you got your, I think it's skittimus now
that H miles predatory mites, and your
[SPEAKER_03]: worms, everything else seems to pop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it was a green bean asked the
question, like best way to decompose in
[SPEAKER_03]: your soil is to start off with really high
end compost, get you know, spend spend the
[SPEAKER_03]: money and get, you know, some really
quality compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally, I used to work for a
buffalo, which was like a bison compost
[SPEAKER_03]: company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had a bunch of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I started with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like maybe that was part of
that secret too, is that I was using bison
[SPEAKER_03]: compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the time I was using Malibu compost as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was using mushroom compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, love that rabbit, rabbit compost,
rabbit manure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that was it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, as you progress as a farmer,
you start to notice like, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: add all those things, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you start to use less and less like I,
I used to be big on making all these teas
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was fantastic, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But as you progress in your thinking and
your workload, and you really start to
[SPEAKER_03]: think about labor, and this is more even
on like the commercial level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, what is the point of of a compost
tea, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just to add life, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just building up life, and then
we're adding it on top of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we can do that same thing,
maybe not as fast, but I have noticed that
[SPEAKER_03]: with certain compost teas, when you're
first starting out, if you're not really
[SPEAKER_03]: focused on that, and you do kind of make
some mistakes, there are alphas that can
[SPEAKER_03]: breed out of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have personally seen people that
have brewed compost teas, and it killed
[SPEAKER_03]: their plants, because they just didn't pay
attention to certain things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to minimize that, and instead of like
really worrying about that, we just put
[SPEAKER_03]: compost as a top feed, we water it in and
then the worms are going to take care of
[SPEAKER_03]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's less risk of some kind of
myself as a human being, making some kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of mistake, I make sure that the worms are
in my bins, so that I don't make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Mother Nature, you know,
she's working together, she really doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those worms are going to break down
everything you're putting in as a top feed
[SPEAKER_03]: every single time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to do it in a fantastic
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the beauty of a composting worm is
what comes out of them is always better
[SPEAKER_03]: than what they put in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is extremely rare on this planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually what's coming out is only waste.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope that people see that these
little creatures are extremely beneficial
[SPEAKER_03]: to cannabis farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you use avocado tech, and you have
enough time and some space, and you could
[SPEAKER_03]: build an entire facility growing cannabis
with just the soil food web, the four
[SPEAKER_03]: composting worms that you need,
the farmer brain that you have,
[SPEAKER_03]: and some kind of really well thought out
IPM management program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you get to enjoy your weekends,
you'll get to enjoy your nights off,
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't have to worry about pH and all
the time, you know, you girls be praying
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a joy in life is to do what you
love to do, but not have it be such a
[SPEAKER_03]: burden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And growing synthetically on a especially
hydroponically because I have done that on
[SPEAKER_03]: a commercial scale is a burning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though you love the plants,
day in and day out, it becomes a burden.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it is your, you know, your
livelihood, and you're growing that for
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody else, it's just hard to put the
same love and care and hydroponic grow
[SPEAKER_03]: that farmers seem to put into a living
grow and organic living soil grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, work becomes play when you
discover that you are actually a steward
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than, you know, an interpreter.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're in being a steward puts you
right in alignment with natural systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not only learning things about
the plants you're growing, but you're
[SPEAKER_00]: learning things about your own microbiome,
which is a reflect a reflection of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then suddenly, you're feeling more
healthy, and not just because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking amazing weed, but because you're
actually ingesting through your working
[SPEAKER_00]: with a plant, you're getting inoculated in
your own body on your skin, like
[SPEAKER_00]: everything comes into a unification that
is just so pleasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then work becomes play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're suddenly like having these
conversations and loving life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I so appreciate you, Brian.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I want people especially the
home gardeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's where I started,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just, you know, to be honest,
I was lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to play poker, and then the
government shut that shit down one day,
[SPEAKER_03]: I just like woke up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was tax day, like, I don't even
remember now, like 2010, maybe or
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my whole world was crushed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was growing cannabis as a hobby.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was really the only other
alternative that I had.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have a college degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I would play cannabis or thought
I played poker for the rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I want to pass this on to other
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, like, as you guys can see,
like, when, like, I've had this home for
[SPEAKER_03]: since 2009, I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And part of it has been because I
understand how to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I have to say that very delicately.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the reason I have certain things in
life is because I taught myself how to
grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she's she's me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have my own sort of story around
how she's brought me into this very
[SPEAKER_00]: community that we're a part of now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, I had just gotten through,
I was down for breast surgery,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd had implants, but I had breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went eight years with a
prosthetic and I was tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: It.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had, I got my boobs and I was just
like going through a divorce at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just remember I was, I literally watched
the entire season of weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not a candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even smoke cannabis the first six
years that I grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I looked around my house and I was
like, this is a perfect grow house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just taught myself how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd already been gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom and I are big gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were part of the farmers market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really into growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just but cannabis is what growing
cannabis and aligning myself with her is
[SPEAKER_00]: what taught me about my connection to
nature through a very long for a very slow
[SPEAKER_00]: and thorough tutoring of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I am incredibly grateful to her
for her medicine and for helping bring us
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, it's, you know,
I was diagnosed when I was a young man
[SPEAKER_03]: with ADHD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they started pumping me full of drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they first gave me this thing called
Dexedrine and it made me feel weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I never ate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then they gave me Ritalin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Ritalin made me feel really
anxiety, like a lot of had a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: anxiety and just felt like a different
person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they gave me Adderall.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Adderall was horrific.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, if you take it on a Friday
night because you need to study or
[SPEAKER_03]: something, but if you take that day in and
day out for months on end, there's
[SPEAKER_03]: something that changes in your brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't really know what happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know that for a few months there,
I did not feel like I was myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I quit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just blatantly quit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I basically told my parents that,
you know, I'm an adult, even though I
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am going to smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have ever since.
Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: True medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys have more?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you guys were asking questions and
we kind of missed them.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys have more questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was somebody who said BMBBT.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what that is?
[SPEAKER_03]: BMT?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was back in the feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to have a microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leighton is teaching me how important that
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycelium has chitin- chitin-2.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the anaerobic facultatives as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And remember, mycelium is really like the
difference between dial-up internet and
[SPEAKER_03]: fiber optic networks, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you have that mycelium going in that,
so much so like you can see it growing in
[SPEAKER_03]: the sunlight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy cow is that entire world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Communicating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once you get that nice little fuzz for
a living soil farmer or a natural farmer,
[SPEAKER_03]: that is kind of like our three pounds of
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's really hard for us to
achieve certain metrics, I guess,
[SPEAKER_03]: that the synthetic world puts out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've always said, even in my classes
and stuff, I used to teach guys that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: still kind of, you know, in that gray
area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you always want to hustle three pounds
day in and day out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you want somebody willing to prepay
you for two, two and a half?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would rather have somebody prepay me
because I don't know if you guys have ever
[SPEAKER_03]: tried to hustle packs throughout life.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the real secret.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the bubble guts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It fucking sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're worried the entire time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether this is guys you're homie or not,
you're just the real truth of it is,
[SPEAKER_03]: is that you're extremely nervous as that
kind of person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're making money that way,
especially way back in the day,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just it was horrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a horrible existence.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we pretended and we made ourselves
feel better with material things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on a metaphysical level and just on a
health level, you know, like probably even
[SPEAKER_03]: this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That came from selling packs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the fact that we can now do this on a
legal, in a legal way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I have I have children and
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Money doesn't really matter as much as it
used to.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, I just want to take care of my
family.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I think I think the living soil
crowd, our whole views are shifting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really give a shit if we're
growing through your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just trying to grow medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis and greed do not get along,
although they do seem come hand in hand at
[SPEAKER_00]: certain points of the development of the
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, they don't you know,
those guys don't really last that long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if you guys are familiar
with brands like MedMen and stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's a classic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Example of greed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a classic example of those guys
basically thinking they're like almost
[SPEAKER_03]: like an NFL franchise, yet they had no
real talent.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had no real quarterback for that
brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something that I would say to
any owners out there is your head grower
[SPEAKER_03]: is your quarterback.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't believe in him and ride
with them on the ups and downs of things,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to be like the Browns or the
Rams or you know, I mean, you're never
[SPEAKER_03]: going to win.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you got to have a you got to have
an owner that believes in you and yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I think a lot of people are
torn are starting to educate themselves
[SPEAKER_03]: with a living soil is because then you get
to stand out from all the other cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers out there that do understand
growing cannabis and are good at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, how are you
adding value to my farm?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if your knowledge is going to bring my
labor costs down and bring my material
[SPEAKER_03]: costs down, and you're, you know,
you're thinking two years from now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I hope I don't step on anybody's
toes, but I don't really see synthetic
[SPEAKER_03]: guys thinking like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just thinking flip, flip,
flip, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just thinking about that flip.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with a living soil, you have to think
about the future flips because you're
[SPEAKER_03]: feeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, you're feeding for those next
flips.
[SPEAKER_03]: While you're growing your current flip.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know that I think that helps
with genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think growing organically keeps you,
you know, going out there and being
[SPEAKER_03]: involved in your plants every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that when we would do like some
consulting stuff, a lot of the stuff that
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like with pest issues and stuff
just came down because the team was
[SPEAKER_03]: actually lazy, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And everything was so automated that they
just that culture started to build and the
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks went by, the months went by,
maybe a year or two went by.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now everybody has gotten used to
minimal work because everything was
[SPEAKER_03]: automated, but they weren't checking the
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't making sure things were going
and they had major, major issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: So living soil, especially if you have
your team, you almost kind of force your
[SPEAKER_03]: team to hand water.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it's money well spent.
[SPEAKER_03]: That labor is because you teach your team
to scope and check the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: As they're watering, there's nothing
better than a human being walking the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know when I go to these big like MJ
BizCons and stuff and all these guys are
[SPEAKER_03]: pitching you and everything automated,
my world is just closed because I know,
[SPEAKER_03]: at least in my world, you have no idea
what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And automated is the worst thing we would
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, automation makes certain people lazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying to everybody out there and
I hope that people don't take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you grow cannabis, however you
grow cannabis, I personally like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally like you, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying that living soil is the be
all end all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying that I have personally
found that with my skill set and my
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge base that I don't have the same
knowledge that you botanists do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys that are out there growing
amazing cannabis synthetically,
[SPEAKER_03]: hats off to you, because I wouldn't be
able to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just never got that skill set.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I educated myself in another way and
that is to use mother nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really what Korean natural
farming is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what living soil is.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, everything comes
down to we're using nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're speeding things up with nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're using our farmer brain to improve
things, but we're still using nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why we love sharing this stuff
with you is because if I have a farm
[SPEAKER_03]: that's five years in, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no way that you guys could ever
catch up with that farm because that soil
[SPEAKER_03]: is already churned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's become alive and thriving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why wouldn't I help?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why wouldn't I, you know, unless you're
just a dick, I guess, but if someone asked
[SPEAKER_03]: me a question and I know they're not
trying to pick my brain where it's just,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you can tell people when they're
genuinely asking a question or they're
[SPEAKER_03]: strictly asking me a business question
because they want to take that information
[SPEAKER_03]: and make money off of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate those kinds of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you guys genuinely have like a
question, you're like, I have an issue
[SPEAKER_03]: with this or what the hell is a Russet
might, you know, reach out to Tina,
[SPEAKER_03]: reach out to myself where, you know,
we help.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talk to people in the DM as long as they
don't ask me to ship them weed and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm willing to help you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't, again, I just sometimes want
to help.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like then people take advantage of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they were like, I don't know,
they get upset because you're not like
[SPEAKER_03]: basically helping them through their
entire grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there's a few bad habits that we
have to shed as we're sort of coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: of this dark age of silo thinking
vertical, like everyone's against each
[SPEAKER_00]: other competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we really are coming into a new
paradigm and we're all having to get rid
[SPEAKER_00]: of our bad habits and kind of learn how to
share with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's a process like it's it's a
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sometimes a painful process because I
often felt like I'm giving away the King
[SPEAKER_00]: things that maybe I should keep to myself
because I, you know, am still paying a
[SPEAKER_00]: mortgage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still like even with these balls,
like I'm full, you know, there's I'm fully
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing the entire process, recipe,
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's still part of me comes up
with this risk factor, like, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I do that, no one's going to buy the
balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, it's not about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about like, if my area is thriving,
if my little piece of acre is thriving,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to help your piece of acre
thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by everybody thriving, we're going to
change the world and we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to feed ourselves, nurture ourselves,
medicate ourselves and help each other
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, and be at play again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this whole theme of like,
let's work smarter, not harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's about it's about it's about
helping nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way we can do that is by
helping each other, because we're a part
[SPEAKER_00]: of nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And working smarter is us having
conversations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's certain things that I've
learned from you, Tina, that probably
[SPEAKER_03]: would have taken me months, maybe a year
to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's certain tips and tricks like,
you know, I was sharing before with the
[SPEAKER_03]: rabbits and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I can't wait for the rabbits.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's taken me years, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's taken me years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I just rattle them off to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you breeding your rabbits?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually save them from the shelter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I maybe in time I might.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for now, no, I just I rescue them and
then I teach them to poop in the pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I feel like they have a way
better existence in life, being able to
[SPEAKER_03]: just go amongst the house like a dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that they can be cohabitators
of the cat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really up to your cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Training the cat.
[SPEAKER_03]: The lion heads, like I said, the reason
why I like that breed is because they're
[SPEAKER_03]: extremely intelligent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're really sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they're in a corner or something
like that, they will bite the shit out of
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like my GZelda, she'd bite the shit out of
me when I'd feed her.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm like, damn, girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lighten up.
[SPEAKER_03]: This food ain't cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is organic greens over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was one question, and maybe we
can use this to kind of wrap up,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I I'm not I want to come down and
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to have a we need to have lunch
and talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Big hair, big hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big hair Pappy is asking, I'm trying to
reduce the local waste stream at our local
[SPEAKER_00]: distributor for produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: How will you convert a thousand pounds of
fresh veggies into insects?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been feeding to cows, but I'd but I'd
like to do some insect surgery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, how about like start like,
I don't know, quick rundown, like what it
[SPEAKER_00]: would take to scale up to that level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at that level, I would probably be
start using like worms and Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because at that level, you would have a
bunch of worms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Bokashi is next level as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Tina, if you would love to have like
another kind of you're definitely way more
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledgeable on it than me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we could definitely have a discussion
on that, because I think that was another
[SPEAKER_03]: like aha moment for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cover crop was an aha moment for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what do you use for what do you
use for a cover crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have a mix that you like,
especially or?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it all right to build a soil?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a cover crop blend.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a 12 seed blend.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't, if you don't want to shop
like online, I think you just want to go
[SPEAKER_03]: to a store.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crimson clover is usually something that
you can buy really easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just load up on that if I wasn't
able to get like a variety mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, diversity is king, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the the different crops that you can
get, especially legumes and that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition with the clover, that's really
going to build that thriving living soil
[SPEAKER_03]: in the living soil way of like,
where we understand the soil food web,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's okay to have like,
if you really understand the soil food
[SPEAKER_03]: web, it's okay to have a little bit of bad
things, like you almost kind of need it in
[SPEAKER_03]: a way percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, the rove beetles really take,
take care of all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you guys, you know, take away from
anything today, it's that if you're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to grow with a living soil, be so
proactive that you're thinking it through
[SPEAKER_03]: that you guys have worm farming before you
even start putting a plant in the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I assure you that you will appreciate
that you took the time to set that up
[SPEAKER_03]: beforehand, because your life's going to
be so much easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't have to deal with fungus
gnats, and that's the other thing too,
[SPEAKER_03]: is, you know, sometimes these owners,
they don't, you know, they don't smoke,
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't grow, they're just the wallet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when they come in, they see a shit ton
of fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they, they give you these looks
sometimes like, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: does this guy know what the hell he's
talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: But once you get over that hurdle,
right, and it goes away, then everybody,
[SPEAKER_03]: so to minimize your, your boss or your
investors, whoever looking at you that
[SPEAKER_03]: way, be more proactive in these living
soil grows, and you are going to look like
[SPEAKER_03]: a rock star to some of these investors,
because not only growing cannabis that
[SPEAKER_03]: they've probably never seen before,
but if you're doing it the right way,
[SPEAKER_03]: the labor should be down dramatically,
maybe not the first like few months,
[SPEAKER_03]: because you're, you know, working
everything through.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once you're, you know, your process is
in, and you've kind of taken over that
[SPEAKER_03]: facility, and you're running a living
soil, and the beds and everything are
[SPEAKER_03]: growing, that labor costs goes down
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it comes, you know, and then we,
you know, I can continue, I can talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: this all day, but then it comes down more
than to like the genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And genetics are probably 50% of growing
cannabis right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's just, there's just a whole line
of things that if you really set yourself
[SPEAKER_03]: up for success at the beginning,
you just won't ever falter, you won't lose
[SPEAKER_03]: a crop, you won't, you won't have pest
issues to where are powdery mildew issues
[SPEAKER_03]: or anything like that, because you're just
growing such a healthy cannabis crop,
[SPEAKER_03]: that those issues, even if they pop up,
like, let's say you had spider mites,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially in a larger facility,
you might have a pocket of spider mites.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, you might not ever see that
because the mites, the predatory mites
[SPEAKER_03]: that you've been adding every few weeks,
they've been keeping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would love to have a genetics
conversation with you, especially because
[SPEAKER_00]: like being a woman, grower being of an age
group that's not sort of like in the know,
[SPEAKER_00]: or not being a traditional part of the
culture either, like, the genetics game
[SPEAKER_00]: has been sort of the hardest for me to
like, actually be part of a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess this is kind of like me
saying, like, shouting out to everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: out there who's hoarding genetics or
feeling some kind of ego involvement in it
[SPEAKER_00]: that like, this sharing of genetics or
like, even share it, like I'm doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy genetics project that I am intuiting
on my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not getting a whole lot of help in the
community from based on my observational
[SPEAKER_00]: skills, that it's going to take a plant a
period of time to adapt to their
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anyway, there's a whole there's a
whole lot of things we could talk about in
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is just a shout out to be like,
hey, let's find a way to come together as
[SPEAKER_00]: a community around genetics as well and
figure out how to share stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a whole lot that needs to
happen there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and not only that, but let let's
share real truths with each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know, I know that people out
there are afraid to say certain things,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there are breeders out there and I am
not afraid to say this, that are taking
[SPEAKER_03]: two $300 from you for a 10 pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've really never even tested it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you might not notice that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I personally didn't notice it
for many years because I was just growing
[SPEAKER_03]: in a tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't have like, just a huge amount
of plants to run through.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then when I started growing
commercially, a lot of these seed brands
[SPEAKER_03]: that I'm sure you guys probably are in
love with.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're on a larger scale facility,
their stuff is not as good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really think that if we had a real
candid conversation, we don't have to name
[SPEAKER_00]: names or anything, but just talk about the
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And know that, I mean, it's really simple
guys, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you see a genetics brand that's coming
out with 20 new genetics every few weeks,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it doesn't, you don't even really
have to be that great of a cannabis farmer
[SPEAKER_03]: to understand that.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are they working those lines?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and that's why, you know,
I have a little thing that I've been doing
[SPEAKER_03]: as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tina's been on forever flux where I've
been interviewing people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And last week we had a guy named Derek
with Sunleaf seed and he comes out with a
[SPEAKER_03]: line like, every six months, you know,
and that, and that really is kind of the
[SPEAKER_03]: difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I'm, I guess I'm giving,
I guess I am giving certain brands a shout
[SPEAKER_03]: out, but I think, I think Derek deserves a
shout out because he really does work his
[SPEAKER_03]: lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he's, and he's not a, like he doesn't
drive a Lamborghini and all this bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he's, he's a guy of the people,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he's, he takes his money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to get together again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get together again for one of
these and we'll, and I want to catch up on
[SPEAKER_00]: those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interviews that you've been doing,
how can people find out about what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing over there with ever flux?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were posting the videos that ever flux
technologies is under the education aspect
[SPEAKER_03]: or tab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that their website?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's going to also be posted up on
YouTube as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then yeah, if you guys have questions
or stuff, just, just reach out to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tina and myself are here to, to answer
your questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, and as long as you guys don't
take advantage of us, I have no problem
[SPEAKER_03]: answering questions to the best of my
ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, let's keep this as part of
a conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like, let's go, you know, this is an
ongoing relationship that we're having
[SPEAKER_00]: with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, yeah, let's like,
you need help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but at the same time, if we've got
things that, you know, we're needing
[SPEAKER_00]: support through products or, you know,
any of those sorts of things or attendance
[SPEAKER_00]: and anyway, you know, let's do
reciprocation together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, we're, you know, we're going
to have these live events.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tina was the first person I actually
reached out to because of like her,
[SPEAKER_03]: her message and the way she teaches and
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once we are allowed to run with that,
I really think Chris, obviously I'd love
[SPEAKER_03]: to have, it was like a live event.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wendy's son of this cultivating classics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw you on there too, buddy DJ.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just a lot of bright minded people
that really understand it that maybe just
[SPEAKER_03]: because their Instagram is, you know,
not as big or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really hate when I hear people be like,
Oh yeah, but you know, they only have this
[SPEAKER_03]: many or Instagram is bullshit,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason I'm on Instagram is because
it's worked for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise it wouldn't be on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's a platform.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a way for us to be able to educate
and communicate with one another.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my goal is to give the guys that maybe
don't have, you know, they're brilliant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're posting things and maybe four
people liked it, but it's, it's next level
[SPEAKER_03]: thought process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully Tina, I know like since
you've been doing this and I've been
[SPEAKER_03]: helping you understand social media,
maybe that's something else that I could
[SPEAKER_03]: help the community with so that the
message can be seen more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you, excuse me for you guys that don't
know, if you have a cannabis account,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially like me that has the word
cannabis in the actual name, I'm basically
[SPEAKER_03]: like shadow band and everything you can
imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they don't really even show like my
hashtags to many people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it'll, it'll show up in the feed,
but it doesn't go to the people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we as a cannabis community have to
work together to kind of spread our
[SPEAKER_03]: material throughout the ethernet of
Instagram, because their algorithm
[SPEAKER_03]: punishes you just for being a cannabis
person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, to have my account at
where it's at, could you imagine if we
[SPEAKER_03]: were actually allowed to like promote a
living soil cannabis and stuff like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, if we could add, you know,
we're not allowed to do that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to find a way where we're able
to promote each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Tina and I already do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I hope that you guys as
well, like if you have something
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting or something, tag me in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I think it's cool, I'll post it up
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tag people all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to promote people that don't really
have a voice or I just try to use my
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram to promote others and show,
you know, unique things in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope that other people in this
community do the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do see a lot of these people now with
like the ego starting to get to them and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're starting to like really show their
plants and all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get that and that's great and stuff,
but let's use Instagram so that to further
[SPEAKER_03]: educate one another.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all have pretty plants, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We all smoke dabs, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not into the whole like, you know,
we have cool rigs and we smoke good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we all do that, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've kind of in reality, if you're in
Colorado, we've been doing that for a
[SPEAKER_03]: while now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's move on to something cooler.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, that's educating one another,
building a community.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the material shit, like I said,
I don't, as long as I can take care of my
[SPEAKER_03]: family, I don't know, I just don't really
care anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when COVID hit, you kind of see
like what really matters when some major
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it funny how it kind of realigns how
what's important to us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, the constriction,
you know, there's two different forces,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's constriction, and there's
expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by being constricted from an outside
way, we're maybe being taught to sit and
[SPEAKER_00]: learn what it's going to be like to expand
and expansion requires, like breath and so
[SPEAKER_00]: and reciprocity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're learning how to be in
community, it's definitely we feel like we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be given a lot of education or
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're taking that freely from the
people who are giving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also in that remember that you're
you're you're also required to give.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're receiving, remember that
it's a way of you know, it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: reciprocity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breathing is reciprocity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're bringing it in, but then you're
giving it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's all learn how to breathe
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're gonna, you know, if you want to
be greedy on that side of things,
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll you know, this one guy taught me
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: What what radio station does everybody
listen to?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like WWI FM.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's in it for me?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's in it for you guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the fact that you can shave months
years off of growing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If we actually had a community where we
were working together, and we are talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about certain things where it's like,
hey, you know, I tried this on russet
[SPEAKER_03]: mics, and it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know how much time you guys would
have saved me back in the day if I Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody knew how to combat russet mics at
first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to know the secret now?
[SPEAKER_03]: So right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how long you don't have any years
and trials and stuff it took me to just be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to rattle that off to you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the kind of stuff that I hope
other people will start to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do for us so that Tina and I can learn and
you guys can continue to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I can rattle off that something
that took me years to just, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you guys just got for free like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that people kind of like pay it
forward type thing and we really start to
[SPEAKER_03]: work together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would imagine in a few years if we
had this kind of community that all of our
[SPEAKER_03]: attributes would just be through the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm going to give you a little
example of what that's going to feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: for everybody because I'm going to lay
something down for you that you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to just love and I'm going to make sure
you get some of this to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what helps a plant receive
more sulfur in order to do that thriving
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I had heard that it's like, oh,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and so on and I so need something
called a Sidero for within your within
[SPEAKER_03]: your soil system to move that iron.
[SPEAKER_03]: A Sidero for is an iron carrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an organic form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is this shell is extremely high in
iron because I had it tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that thought for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me tell you how I arrived at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want to hear what you're saying
because see how this works when we share
[SPEAKER_00]: information we build on each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm about to learn something from him
and he now learns I have a product that's
[SPEAKER_00]: got a plant available form of iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's so fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are the things that really make
cannabis stand out, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what and there is a relationship
between iron and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they they and I just found one research
paper that I'm going to have to go back
[SPEAKER_00]: and refine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's something about iron and sulfur
go together to make something that
[SPEAKER_00]: resembles a protein in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was I was trying to figure out how
what the ratio is going to be for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to use of this as a humic and
fulvic source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was using it at a different
ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: One to three hundred seemed to be about
the right amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happened was I burned all my
plants because I was treating with sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a dom sulfur with wedding agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess which plants didn't burn at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that I had treated with one to
three hundred of shallow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they were like they almost
literally like thrived by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I started doing some research and
I was like, what is this relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: between what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just do iron and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what's happening in the
plant, but they're creating some kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what was that word you used for a
carrier?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called a Cedero for Cedero for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how to spell that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, we have a whole list of things to list
from this show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we have like I said, I mean,
I just we could do this with with so many
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's so many brilliant people that
never get a platform.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we were able to use our platforms,
you know, it's not like we don't have this
[SPEAKER_03]: huge platform or anything, but we do have
our little platforms that we can message
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think as far as living soil,
you know, it is the future of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it is absolutely 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm biased on that, but I just
can't see especially labor and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the cost of soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I worked at this commercial
facility in Denver, we bought bagged soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were ripping bags of soil,
filling like 10,000 square foot rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, cost effectiveness is that we
weren't even buying totes, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and shoveling it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They thought it was quicker just to but we
were probably paying three bucks extra a
[SPEAKER_03]: bag for that, that quickness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, thousands of bags is what we
were using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what do you do with the bags?
[SPEAKER_00]: You stick them in the dumpster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all of our material stuff we threw
away.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't reuse any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the day that we worked out,
they were like supposedly green or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were paying to have their stuff
like removed on site and then recycled.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then when we brought up, like,
well, why don't we just use it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in our own stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't like that idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fox farm is shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you guys grow with that stuff,
I encourage you to try something else and
[SPEAKER_03]: see what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rocks from the river to get like iron and
yeah.
Badass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did the burn look like with Jadam?
[SPEAKER_00]: Typical like sulfur burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's it sort of eats the leaf away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you notice it, I think first comes
up is kind of like yellow spots and then
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty soon you've got holes in your
leaves and it progresses over a period of
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that with a sulfur burner,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it didn't take much to burn either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember what my application rate
was, but I think it was maybe just a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter teaspoon above what was
prescribed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't much over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be careful with your use of
sulfur for sure or use a buffering agent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, sulfur in that form.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we're really using that to kill
russet mice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's that's what that's about.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, that's it's an extreme.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not it's not the best thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't do it now that I know this
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will never do that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will never.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I don't actually use the Jadam
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bay Laurel that we talked about was
Preston last time that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had hemp aphids last year because I
had my hemp license last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had hemp aphids and I did and I had
russets as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that Bay Laurel with the Jadam wedding
agent and literally in two days put the
[SPEAKER_00]: population into such a great control that
the what I was doing with the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: Korean natural farming kicked in and the
plants, you know, overcame their own
[SPEAKER_00]: stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year I'm not using anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only using Korean natural farming and
I'm using the living soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you don't need anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clicking on all cylinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you don't need it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you recommend instead of
Foxfarm?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love their sale of what their other
products suck.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make your own.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's what I that's what I would
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aurora organics, they make a pretty good
bagged soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, though, it's it's not apples to
apples kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you're using a bagged soil
compared to like something you built and
[SPEAKER_03]: made yourself, I mean, it is the night and
day difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're practically almost there,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe just try building your own soil and
using like a sphagnum pumice, rice holes,
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit of worm castings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Use those worms and run that as your soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you if you set that up a few weeks
beforehand, it'll be ready to go right
[SPEAKER_03]: away for your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just plant right into that as a
clone.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Healing Earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's I mean, how can you say anything
better than that?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can make your own, if you can get
as local as possible, and again,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you could really like understand the
companies that you're buying this stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: from, there are a lot of companies out
there that are OMRI certified.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can tell you from experience when I
worked at a company that we went through
[SPEAKER_03]: the process of being OMRI certified is
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They never came and checked anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all on our word.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just because something is OMRI
certified, they did go out of their way
[SPEAKER_03]: better than another company.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the reality at least with that program
is that they just paid money to get that
[SPEAKER_03]: logo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's not really as far as I
know, there was no one that ever came to
[SPEAKER_03]: our facility and checked what we did,
what what our SOP was, if we dropped
[SPEAKER_03]: compost on the ground, you know,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for it to be organic, we're not
supposed to if it falls on the ground,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're not supposed to put it back in the
machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I can assure you that like sometimes
when mistakes were made and something fell
[SPEAKER_03]: on the ground, it was put back in the
machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, so really know that,
you know, there's brands out there that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, if you guys want to reach out to
me, that I can probably like tell you
[SPEAKER_03]: offline and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have no problem saying bullshit to
Advanced Nutrients and Fox Farm and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been ripping off new farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's time for a paradigm shift,
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm going to tell you about what I
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have indoor beds that are four by
four, and I built them up myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't buy the fancy double bag,
the double sided bags where I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the money to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I built my own beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been gardening outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used wood chips in the bottom and I
used my own soil and I topped it with
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I topped it with wood chips and
then I topped it with straw and started
[SPEAKER_00]: using, you know, started inoculating with
the bugs and everything and let them kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of do the work of bringing those beds into
order.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was scary to do that because I
didn't know what kind of pathogens I was
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what kind of insects I was
bringing in, but I did it anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my beds are just getting better and
better and better and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only problem that I didn't
foresee, and I've learned a lot from it,
[SPEAKER_00]: is those darn pill bugs, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an overrun of pill bugs because
they break things down, but they also eat
[SPEAKER_00]: baby shoots and they keep me from being
able to have a very good cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're literally eating all the
shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hand trapped as many of those as I
could out of my beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I have the bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have is because I was just taking all
the critters I was trapping from my beds
[SPEAKER_00]: and moving it into that bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I have that as a kind of a
pre-digester.
[SPEAKER_03]: Add some magnolia leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you add some magnolia leaves to that,
they'll eat that instead of the shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, it's been annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I finally put my Muscovy ducks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like built a little and I moved them
from bed to bed and they literally ate all
[SPEAKER_00]: the pill bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like pill bugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they work in a fantastic
relationship with the worms and the
[SPEAKER_03]: springtails.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, if anything is out of control,
if anything is too much where it's almost
[SPEAKER_03]: become like an alpha, then you have
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just bring your next entropic
level, which for you is the rabbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in love with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the rabbits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the rabbits are our game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just bringing the next level
up, the next trophic level up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're integrating that into your systems
because nature wants to naturally progress
[SPEAKER_00]: towards succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're bringing in these higher
successional levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with these things like the ducks or
the rabbits or the higher level insects or
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I didn't have like HOA
restrictions, I would probably start
[SPEAKER_03]: messing around with alpacas.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's as great as rabbit manure is,
it's probably the best alpacas,
[SPEAKER_03]: probably twice as good as that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have never raised alpacas or
anything, but their stuff is next level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Malibu compost is definitely overrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what they're charging
anymore, but I remember that it definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: fell overpriced.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you guys, again, do, do your
research on that, like biodynamic farming
[SPEAKER_03]: is definitely a system, but biodynamic
farming is not, like, how do I say this
[SPEAKER_03]: the right way?
[SPEAKER_03]: Biodynamic farming still has a bit of
metaphysical things to it, to where if
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody as a brand is saying that they
are making you a product using only
[SPEAKER_03]: biodynamic farming, that is probably one
of the reasons why Tina and I experienced
[SPEAKER_03]: the issues that we did is because they
probably had a human being make a mistake.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's so I'm not knocking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just there's a lot of metaphysical
things for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think people still even today,
like, they still think like the ram's horn
[SPEAKER_03]: is something that is like really needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in reality, it was just what they had
back then, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does serve a function, but those,
but it's a non-transparent function and
[SPEAKER_00]: you have, but the Korean natural farming
has every piece of tool that you'd ever
[SPEAKER_00]: gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're both systems are kind of
reflective of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet I do appreciate the simplicity and
the transparency behind natural farming
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's so simple, specific,
but oh my goodness, so simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're getting the same results.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and then chicken poop is filled
with nitrogen, but again, that's a hot
[SPEAKER_03]: manure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to have to wait and
compost that down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would personally use alfalfa meal
instead of chicken poop for a nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: source.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, nitrogen is like the Goldilocks
principle, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You only want her to be right there in the
middle of her nitrogen uptake,
[SPEAKER_03]: because especially if you're using like a
nitrate nitrogen, she's going to eat that
[SPEAKER_03]: even in flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're pumping her full of those
nitrate nitrogen, your yields are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: suffer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your quality is going to suffer because
she's still eating that nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you keep it more at that Goldilocks
level where you do get that kind of fade
[SPEAKER_03]: as she's starting to go into flour and
turn, then you kind of know you're at that
[SPEAKER_03]: right peak to where she is still munching
at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is being removed from the fan leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for me, I only take the fan
leaves off if I feel like it would improve
[SPEAKER_03]: a bud site.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do believe in at least an indoor,
you know, outdoor, it's kind of silly,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it doesn't matter where the sun
is, obviously, it's the same amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: sunlight, but indoor, it does matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's where that part of that
comes in to is where you should defan
[SPEAKER_03]: things that are covering buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But otherwise, I try to keep the plant as
intact as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do like the lollipop because I feel like
that's improved yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a bunch of tips and tricks we
could talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another time that I do know is tried and
true, even on like a commercial level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And lollipopping is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, have we come to a natural
progression?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, two hours went by pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, two and a half, maybe even.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm surprised that my boys are upstairs
and I didn't hear one peep out of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you getting rain right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, or it's about to, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're getting rain here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can't wait to come see you and
visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's have a chat soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get busy and then we... Yeah,
we might do that weekly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Tina and I... Sheep compares to
alpacas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as good, but it's a close one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would throw worms in that sheep compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you have a bunch of chicken...
Why are alpacas next level?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they have more than one stomach
like a cow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And their diet is really clean for an
animal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as long as you let them graze and do
their thing... The goats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goats are good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But aren't goats like gross?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I have four goats.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't they ejaculate a lot?
[SPEAKER_03]: All the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because you get a weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have one male that's a weather,
so he's fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The billy goat's a different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're smarter than dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I walk them twice a day and they
respond to my nose and they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's easier to keep than an alpaca.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think alpacas are fairly sensitive to
predation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Predation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Predation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alpacas are more like dogs too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have historical personalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, goats don't eat everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think witches owned goats because
they've been sort of... People have so
[SPEAKER_00]: many misconceptions about goats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like natural medicine finders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will only eat the things that are at
the perfect medicinal quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually, as an herbalist,
do a lot of figuring out harvest times and
[SPEAKER_00]: peak times to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using a goat as an indicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're amazing creatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: A big haired poppy cow would be next level
if you could find like an organic source.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is that even in Malibu that
supposedly was that way, I had heard that
[SPEAKER_03]: like that bovine growth hormone somehow
got into their stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as I understand anything that's
being done dairy wise, they always use
[SPEAKER_03]: that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They always use that growth hormone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless it's like an organic and I don't
really know an organic, pure organic dairy
[SPEAKER_03]: cow manure source.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you guys do know one, please let us
know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all about using different sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not being biased or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the fact that like if you can't
source it or if you know like using malibu
[SPEAKER_03]: could potentially fuck up your entire
crop, then I'm not going to spend full
[SPEAKER_03]: retail to buy their product and then just
to have diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not worth it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know your farmer, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know your grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Horse manure is best as long as you take
the time to compost it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would vermicompost that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, there's a lot of things that horse
manure and cow manure can have in it that
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're growing where your product is
tested, you could fail microbial testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do they call that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just pathogen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just pathogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You fail pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you guys don't have any more
questions, I got to get back to working
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Tina, I really enjoyed this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Brian.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how we would talk if you and I
were just sitting across the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that if people want to hear us
discuss that, I'm open to doing this
[SPEAKER_03]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these will be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make them available both on Facebook and
on my IGTV account.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we did highlight a competition at the
very beginning of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you go back and kind of
revisit that because it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Brian sweetened the pot with some
seeds from Dominion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of love for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not where he needs to be and he is
not with his family.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's hope in time that he's able to
get back home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's put that out into the universe
and come together around community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to watch your little three
second DMs of your microbial whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial little wonders you have going
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyway, you'll get the highlights and
I'll also post sort of a highlight of this
[SPEAKER_00]: of what the competition is going to be
like and participate so you can get a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of free cool stuff from us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what we're about giving back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
