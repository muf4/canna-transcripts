[SPEAKER_00]: I was driving in my car yesterday and I
heard on NPR, I was just randomly on NPR,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a whole story about this
conference happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hear Susan come on and say,
you know, there's a lot of business
[SPEAKER_00]: conferences out there, but this one isn't
a business conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is about the politics and the cause
and all that's happening out here is what
[SPEAKER_00]: comes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went, I'm supposed to give a keynote
about the top seven investment trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on the way in, I'm thinking to
myself, usually when I speak at business
[SPEAKER_00]: conferences, when I speak at investment
conferences, I tend to put on my activist
[SPEAKER_00]: and inspiration hat and try and really
rally people to get behind the cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas everybody else is talking about
really kind of hard business type stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I decided to kind of switch it up a
little bit for this since this is maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: less of a business audience and maybe more
of a policy audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is to actually go a little bit more
into the kind of hard sort of business
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of topics in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll, you know, it's really hard
for me to not talk inspirationally about
[SPEAKER_00]: this important cause, but I'm going to try
and hold back as much as I can to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to download as much kind of business stuff
that I can in the short period of time
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top five cannabis investment trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I get into these, let me just
say that when I say top five cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: investment trends, these aren't
necessarily the top five places where
[SPEAKER_00]: money is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about kind of the top five
most sort of unique or interesting trends
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've seen come around that I think
have a lot of big implications about where
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry could be going in
the coming years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you know, we hear from about 20
to 30 companies every week that want to
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase or present to our investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we whittle that down to two or three a
week that we put on a webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's this whole online
platform where investors get to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: look at deals and share due diligence and
all of this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've now seen thousands and thousands
of pitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is kind of gleaned from some
of the things that I'm seeing that are
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of I think interesting from an
investment standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll also just say on some of these,
like don't shoot the messenger.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just kind of what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's hit the first one, which is
limited investment into limited licensing,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really limited licensing anywhere
people are very, very excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because of high barriers to
entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Creates a really concentrated benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as people are starting to give
these licenses out, the more concentrated
[SPEAKER_00]: the benefit, the more people want to fight
hard and will spend a lot of money and do
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever they can to get those very,
very few licenses that are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a trend in particularly the
Northeast, but also in markets in Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: where you've got these really huge
facilities that are occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so investors are very excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when people ask, well,
what's the biggest investment opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, if you can get a license
in a really limited licensing environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is probably the biggest opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one that will disappear very
shortly as soon as more places come on
[SPEAKER_00]: board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully in California, it looks like
it's going to be a lot more open than
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's still limited, but it's not
so limited that there's such a highly
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated benefit in one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's going to be one of
the big questions that we have going
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there's limited licensing,
then the real investment opportunity tends
[SPEAKER_00]: to be in either cultivation or dispensing,
depending on what the relationship,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ratio is between those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in states that are more open,
where there's a lot of cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses, a lot of dispensary licenses,
then the opportunity tends to be in the
[SPEAKER_00]: product manufacturer angle of it,
that that's where the real opportunity is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the reasons why we're
seeing so much investment, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: in California into brands, because I think
a really big opportunity will be in that
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go to the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetics, biopharma, and testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this really interesting thing
happening right now, where people who've
[SPEAKER_00]: been working with this plant underground
or in the gray area for many, many decades
[SPEAKER_00]: are finally able to be working with the
top engineers and top scientists in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world to really be able to take this plant
in different directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the part where, hey,
don't kill the messenger.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of really interesting
things happening when it comes to even
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that are creating cannabinoids
with yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's investment happening in these
types of applications, where there isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even a plant that's creating the
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of advancement in testing
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an area where I think cannabis
may be able to lead the entire testing
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, because you have, in some ways,
less regulation and more demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's more easy for this industry to be
willing to accept new ideas, because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not as much there to start with in
the first place, and there's so much
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so particularly miniaturization of
testing, as well as getting more testing
[SPEAKER_00]: around genetics and things like that,
so that we know that this strain really
[SPEAKER_00]: means this strain, and all of this stuff
around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of ancillary businesses all
related to testing, biopharma,
[SPEAKER_00]: and genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feelings and low dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say feelings, I don't mean
happy or creative or relaxed, these sorts
[SPEAKER_00]: of feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was, I think, probably the first
company to really swing at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a company called Ebu.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now there's a number of companies that
are really trying to look at how to create
[SPEAKER_00]: a repeatable experience for the wide range
of consumers out there who have really
[SPEAKER_00]: chosen not to consume cannabis,
because one time, maybe eight times out of
[SPEAKER_00]: 10, they enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the two times are enough to make them
not want to do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also people just wanting to dial in
their experience more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the average consumer, figuring out
the differences between all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains and how they relate to their own
experience is mind boggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I include myself in that category.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm as exposed to all of this as
anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry, I can't nerd out on the
strain names and the way that they impact
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, how do I want to feel right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, give me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily, I'm surrounded by people who
are really into the plant and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: nuances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can say, I want to feel like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can go, OK, here, take this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got to cut the middleman out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is one area that I think is going
to get a lot of investment over the coming
[SPEAKER_00]: years in terms of developing brands that
are able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's both a branding question and a
product development question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, the branding plays a big role
in being able to deliver that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's also the actual formulation to
be able to give someone that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you've got a plant where the
experience is so subjective, I question
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not it's even going to be
possible to create that repeatable
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly, there's a lot to be gained
if somebody can really crack that nut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Automated trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, don't shoot the messenger.
[SPEAKER_00]: But automated trimming is one of those
areas where it's this absolutely huge,
[SPEAKER_00]: huge labor expense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we move into sort of OSHA standards
and we move into situations where dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with carpal tunnel and all of this kind of
stuff, coming up with different solutions
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going to keep the plants intact
at the same time as being able to quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: move through the trimming process I think
is an area where we're going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing a lot more investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot of reluctance
among current cultivators who have been in
[SPEAKER_00]: this for a long time to really try out
these sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think newer people that are coming
in are like totally they totally want to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out a different solution here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's going to be
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember that this doesn't happen,
our industry doesn't happen in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this whole robotics industry
that's just totally taking off where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: able to, the prices are reducing and
people can start building like robots
[SPEAKER_00]: doing interesting things like in their
home, in their basements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of opportunity with
those things intersecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could also continually drive down the
price of cannabis which is also another
[SPEAKER_00]: topic that I'm not going to get into here
because I know other people have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we think about the future and how
to adjust to it, this is one of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that is going to continue to drive prices
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then brand IP licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The race is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: For brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are seeing so much energy and
investment going into companies that are
[SPEAKER_00]: building brands and then licensing those
brands out to the licensed producers in
[SPEAKER_00]: given states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of this is driven by the challenge of
laws because you have a situation where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't send your product across state
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what can you send across state
lines, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can, the whole kind of branding
experience can be shared across state
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also you have a lot of processors
and producers who in a brand new market
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be able to start out ahead of the
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they want to look to brands that
already have a certain feel and a vibe and
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain following.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it becomes a natural pairing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that what you're seeing with
branding is, you know, it's very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, it's kind of what Coca-Cola
does and others do in other sectors that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't even have these same kind of
barriers that we have in this sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there are some really
interesting examples around the branding
[SPEAKER_00]: and figuring out what's really going to
connect with both today's consumers and
[SPEAKER_00]: the future's consumers of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more importantly, I think the one,
the audience that's missed when they look
[SPEAKER_00]: at today's cannabis consumers and then
they look at tomorrow's cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers, they're missing, and they're
missing this a lot in the branding,
[SPEAKER_00]: is today's current consumers that are just
in the illicit market, they're just not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to the stores, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're missing that audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's what we're going to,
everyone's trying to make like the top
[SPEAKER_00]: end, everyone's trying to make the Rolex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you really look at what people make
and what their disposable income is and
[SPEAKER_00]: the kind of brands that they actually buy,
then when they're not paying a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: money to be in a specialized store paying
an inflated price, I think that's really,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly as the price of cannabis goes
down, hitting that market is going to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: a really huge opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the question when we talk
about sort of, you know, corporatization
[SPEAKER_00]: or like what kind of brands are really
going to resonate with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I think consumer choice is
really going to make a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I notice, I see Swami over here in
the corner, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean like, you know, a brand like
Swami's, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you've got a situation where
like I think for a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really going to resonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to get a chance to see
a lot of interesting different brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the Marley Naturals, you see Open
Vapes, you see these different people kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of taking different angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be very interesting to
see what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know for a lot of investors,
they really believe that the power is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be in the brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's one of the beautiful things
about the brand play is that it allows
[SPEAKER_00]: investors to be involved in an ancillary
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because often in most cases, these IP
companies that are holding the branding
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't actually touching the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're licensing their formula and their
creative out to others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's an interesting area
where I think we're going to see a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also the other thing,
there's so many rules, there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: laws around investing in directly into a
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this also, it's not just because
it's ancillary, it's even within various
[SPEAKER_00]: state laws, wanting to invest in ancillary
businesses becomes even more interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's so many regulations in so
many states, California included.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's actually a sixth trend,
and I almost didn't include it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go actually, one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost didn't put this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was the sixth trend is that
businesses are starting to really donate
[SPEAKER_00]: to the cannabis industry is really
starting to donate to the politics of this
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't put it in because I think
I've been sort of the Pied Piper of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry isn't doing enough to support the
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we get up at each one of our events
and we're like, donate, donate,
[SPEAKER_00]: donate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not donating and you're in this
industry, then you're shirking your
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a freeloader.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's this whole thing going on
and it's been really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been really, really hard to get a lot
of the people involved in contributing to
[SPEAKER_00]: the cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's particularly frustrating for me
because the whole reason I started Arcview
[SPEAKER_00]: in the first place, the whole reason I
left the sort of movement world full time
[SPEAKER_00]: and moved into the business side full
time, was because I believe that business
[SPEAKER_00]: is a powerful platform for political
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as we could really inspire
that engine, that it would become a no
[SPEAKER_00]: brainer for businesses and entrepreneurs
to be donating to change the laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we learned in the renewable
energy industry, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could write letters to members of
Congress all day long, but until you had
[SPEAKER_00]: profitable businesses and business models
associated with renewable energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was only going to go so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that was true about cannabis
and about changing these laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the whole reason that Steve D
'Angelo and I started Arcview in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: place was based on that belief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are six years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started Arcview in 2010 and really
hoping we would have been further down the
[SPEAKER_00]: line in people coming into this industry
and investing into this industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: simultaneously donating to the cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm happy to say that in the last
month or so, this storyline is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, of course, it'll never be enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I admit that I'm an activist and a
fundraiser by heart, and you're never
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfied if you're an activist or you're
a fundraiser.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say that they're starting to
crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to happen that people are
recognizing that the future of the market
[SPEAKER_00]: for their businesses is really dependent
upon being able to support the cause,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just because it opens up more markets,
but because it's cause marketing,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's hard to be in this industry
which was started by activists and to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually conduct business when you're not
one of the top people out there
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing to the cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm just so grateful that this is
an industry birthed out of a movement
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's what's gonna make it a new
kind of industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that we continue to hold
businesses' feet to the fire to pay for
[SPEAKER_00]: reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bizarre that there's all these people
that are going to benefit and the people
[SPEAKER_00]: who are for the most part paying to pass
these initiatives are the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't even gonna benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's gotta change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can, just looking out in the
audience, I see James Sladek, I see
[SPEAKER_00]: others, a lot of people who've really put
a lot on the line for this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we're sitting here thinking
about what's the best policy or how to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the most money, there are tens of
thousands of people sitting in prison who
[SPEAKER_00]: wake up every day living in fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wake up living in fear and
they're counting on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're counting on us to get this right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're counting on us to not let our
petty disagreements get in the way of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting them out of jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I put this list up of companies
that I know of that are donating at least
[SPEAKER_00]: $100,000 to legalization efforts in the
last year or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you know of another company that
should be on that list that is not,
[SPEAKER_00]: please let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we would love to add them to it,
but we wanna be shouting from the
[SPEAKER_00]: rooftops, the companies that are really
standing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also want you to look at that list
and notice who isn't on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I'm talking specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are, just to be clear, I'm talking
about businesses in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: that are contributing at least $100,000 to
all of the efforts, either contributing or
[SPEAKER_00]: raising $100,000 to the efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's also a lot of companies that
aren't on this list, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how do we make sure that we are
able to grow that in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I thank you for all that you're
doing to help bring this issue and this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to working with you to
keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
