[SPEAKER_01]: So, why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you look at cannabis,
there's about, how many cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_01]: we up to now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Over 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, people say 120, whatever,
pick a number, but it's something over
[SPEAKER_01]: 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, cannabinoids are active ingredients
in the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so go ahead, name off a couple of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, CBD, they're getting the press,
but then there's a whole bunch more like
[SPEAKER_01]: CBG, and CBN, and CBC, and THCA,
and all these ones with funny names.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out that if you look at them
more closely, and that's starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen, that the properties, they have
multiple properties also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I was just taking a look at CBG,
cannabigerol, just for the fun of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and noticing that if you look at it,
it's practically a matchup for THC and CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as the eight or 10 properties that
have been recognized so far in CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, CBG is virtually an unknown player,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and then CBC is, they're all,
except for THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you take, let's just say there's
100 cannabinoids, we have two players,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rest are, you know, riding the
bench, or either never signed up,
[SPEAKER_01]: or I don't know, you know, to use a
baseball analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest are a bunch of riding the bench,
and then a bunch of never even heard of
[SPEAKER_01]: the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we're sort of partway into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's take CBD for a second,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to good old CBD cannabidiol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you all know what this is,
yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knows what CBD is, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, CBD was, and Forrest, help me out here
if I screw something up, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD was discovered to be in the cannabis
plant in, well, centuries ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was in pretty good amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then plants were bred for THC,
and CBD was forgotten, didn't seem to have
[SPEAKER_01]: any use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it was rediscovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it was found that it had all these
amazing properties, some of which we can
[SPEAKER_01]: share with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then plants started getting bred for
CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I want to really emphasize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants were bred for higher CBD,
and higher and higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's been happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to happen with other
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not only going to happen with
cannabis, it's going to happen with hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're already doing that, messing
around, breeding hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp is also a source of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it turns out, it's got a lot of
other little cannabinoids hanging out in
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can breed that for those,
and there's people doing that too,
[SPEAKER_01]: just to keep your eyes open on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we've got that going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you kind of look at, how far CBD's
come, well, when they start breeding CBG
[SPEAKER_01]: and XYZ cannabinoids, what's going to
happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's just going to, I don't even
know, triple or whatever, quadruple the
[SPEAKER_01]: uses of cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you kind of get that drift yet,
where we're going with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's do the properties of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, call them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anti-anxiety, anti-pain, neuroprotective,
protective of neurons in the brain,
[SPEAKER_01]: neurogenesis, able to help create new
neurons, and on and on like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, now, all those properties of CBD were
not known when CBD came out, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think some of the, one of the more
exciting ones that, I don't know if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: still your filter, is if you're going to
mention it, yeah.
Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to, the mention is what we're
learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD has all these effects, but we really
didn't know why, because CBD actually
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't interact with a lot of the
cannabinoid receptors in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that's been
discovered recently is CBD is a powerful
[SPEAKER_00]: re-update in everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that you have to be careful
of, that we find in the kids with
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures, because it'll actually prevent
some anti-seizure drugs from being
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolized, right, which can be a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, CBD's not going to harm you,
but if we have the benzodiazepines raising
[SPEAKER_00]: in your system, those could potentially
harm you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they're finding with the
anti-anxiety, some of the depression
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits that people find from CBD,
is it also works as a re-uptake inhibitor
[SPEAKER_00]: for natural endogenous cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I don't know how down the
science road we want to get, but I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone here has heard of the
endocannabinoid system, and we know that
[SPEAKER_00]: our body produces endogenous cannabinoids,
meaning from within the body, it has
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing to do with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are relatively familiar with
anandamide and two-arachidinoglycerol.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's others, palmitoyl ethylmine,
some others that are not as well-known.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what CBD actually, they're finding is
doing, it's slowing the body's ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: re-uptake anandamide and
two-arachidinoglycerol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, they're having this buildup in the
body that is actually allowing the body to
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize your natural endogenous
cannabinoids, so it's indirectly raising
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoids in your body that someone
might be deficient in, and has this
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing effect, because if your endogenous
cannabinoids are raised, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to correct at a higher rate
malfunctions of the pre or post-synaptic
[SPEAKER_00]: nerves that could be causing imbalances in
all the hormones and neurotransmitters
[SPEAKER_00]: that make us happy, make us sad,
make us function.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if those errors aren't happening
correctly, that's where a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: depression and anxiety and sleep issues
come from, and by just taking CBD as a
[SPEAKER_00]: supplement, you're going to naturally
boost those endogenous cannabinoids in the
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really recent, that's in the
last year or two they've really learned
[SPEAKER_00]: that, so it's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's CBD specifically that has that
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC doesn't have that re-uptake effect,
that we know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're learning something new every
day, so by the time someone watches this
[SPEAKER_00]: and goes, yeah, it does, we just
discovered it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as we know, it doesn't have
that effect, so I would think that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using a mixed balance strain,
you're going to be, the higher the THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant can only produce so many
cannabinoids, so the higher the THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: the less CBD you're going to end up
getting, and other types of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just add one more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about CBG and CBC,
and the variants are really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're learning about THCV and CBDV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are also why it's important to
realize that not every patient is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit from these ultra-purified CBD
products, whether they're from hemp or
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's Epidiolex, because a lot of
the benefit is coming from things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're assuming were CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we find that when we get into
these purified products, they don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the same efficacy, and I think we're going
to find down the road that it is from the
[SPEAKER_00]: variants and the CBCs and the CBGs,
and we haven't even gotten into flavonoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and turpenoids, but I see some RUTHO coin,
this entourage effect of compounds that
[SPEAKER_00]: flies in the face of the way we like to
think about medicine, Western medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: is really also important to realize why
we, as patient advocates, don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: say, well, Epidiolex is out, so kids with
epilepsy are fun, because it's not that
[SPEAKER_00]: simple at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of those kids, my son included,
don't respond to CBD alone at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: never did, never helped a single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't until we started adding
different ratio medicines that he started
[SPEAKER_00]: to respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forrest is referring to the entourage
effect that Ethan Russo, a very good
[SPEAKER_01]: neurologist, came up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the combined effect of all the
ingredients in a cannabis plant on a
[SPEAKER_01]: particular person, and as we talked about,
there's a lot of cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then as he mentioned, there's
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many of you know what terpenes are
just offhand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, terpenes are the aromatic part of
the cannabis plant and a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of them in nature,
like in lemons and black pepper and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They give it the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also have properties, so terpenes
have a bus load of properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, several of them are anti-tumor,
some are anti-inflammatory, some are
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-depressant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else we got, guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just offhand on the terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my terpene list around here
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are sedative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are anti-pain and anti-anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, the terpene thing is like a
whole here we go kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to a new world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say, I think we can
add everything on the list because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about compounds that are
interacting with our endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything that your endocannabinoid
system does, which is regulate almost
[SPEAKER_00]: every function in your body, these
compounds that are interacting with it are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to benefit if they're interacting
with the area of the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system that is causing you problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why cannabis and these terpenes
along with our endocannabinoid system work
[SPEAKER_00]: as these adaptogens, but people see these
very different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because this system regulates so many
different things that depending on how our
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology and biology are individually
structured, we're going to see different
[SPEAKER_00]: results to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So malfunctions in that system could be
causing sleep issues or not, but it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that it's not necessarily taking a
terpenoid or cannabinoid for sleep
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're taking it for is to correct the
malfunctions within the system in our
[SPEAKER_00]: body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see the benefits of it when
the error in that system is corrected and
[SPEAKER_00]: it ties in those errors can be a spectrum
of things, sleep, pain, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really, for a lot of these,
we're going to be able to list all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: same things because these different
compounds are going to likely interact
[SPEAKER_00]: with what is not working for specific
people in different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that can pull into the genetics of that
person, which everybody's getting more
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in genetics, which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some of these people are going to
have deficiencies in their endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system and they're not going to have as
many receptors in the gut or the uterus as
[SPEAKER_01]: you have or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, there's a lot of receptors
in the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I saw that the uterus has the most
concentration of receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get that somewhere?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most concentration of cannabinoid
receptors in the body, which is perhaps
[SPEAKER_01]: why cannabis works so well for menstrual
cramps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it even works, I want to just throw
this in for the ladies, as a salve
[SPEAKER_01]: topically put it on your lower abdomen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the women I've looked at about 32 out
of 33 have benefited from using topical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis on the lower abdomen at the onset
of menstrual cramps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go, how the hell does that work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not sure how the hell that
works, but it's working really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got all these receptors and you've
got a lot of them in the gut, which is why
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis has been working.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say cannabis, I mean in this broad
sense, has been working for irritable
[SPEAKER_01]: bowel syndrome and ulcerative colitis and
Crohn's and all that stuff, sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: spectacularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sky's the limit on this,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me run you just a quick list of
some of the conditions that have responded
[SPEAKER_01]: to cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, pain, anxiety, and sleep,
chronic pain, anxiety, and sleep,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are the big players, the reason
people have come in and seen me for years
[SPEAKER_01]: to get their cannabis approval when we
needed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's Parkinson's and there's
ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, there's some pretty decent
science going on with this, all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's autism, bladder dysfunction
and spasm, depression, glaucoma,
[SPEAKER_01]: ADD and ADHD, cancer, psoriasis,
and dementia.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also did a recent study of migraines,
it just goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just did a recent study showing that
they took this bunch of people,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you guys saw the study,
I just saw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, interesting little study,
they took a bunch of people who had a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of medical disorders and a bunch of
meds and they gave cannabis 20 to one for
[SPEAKER_01]: three or four months, gave them a 20 to
one CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so you don't get lost, the numbers on
the CBDs are CBD to THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's 30 to one, 20 to one,
down to one to one and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just so you don't get lost in there,
we start throwing out the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 to one's a real popular, 18 to one,
a real popular variety and get some study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they gave this for a while and the
people's brain power, their cognition,
[SPEAKER_01]: their thinking improved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they measured it not only with these
standard tests, but with these functional
[SPEAKER_01]: MRIs, fancy scientific gadgets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their functional MRIs got better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: When brains start looking different,
that's like, oh, that's fabulous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
