[SPEAKER_01]: Breaking news in the LA cannabis scene
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the city of LA has had a long and
sordid past trying to regulate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Measure M passed in March of 2017,
and there have been a lot of businesses
[SPEAKER_03]: that have been trying to figure out how
they're going to get their business
[SPEAKER_03]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a set of the Prop D,
businesses that are still working their
[SPEAKER_03]: way through the application process.
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't even submitted their annual
license application.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a bit of a backlog.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the phase two operators who are
the growers and manufacturers and
[SPEAKER_03]: distributors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the supply side of the cannabis market
in LA that have applied and are still
[SPEAKER_03]: waiting to be processed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then everybody's sort of on pins and
needles about when the new retailers can
[SPEAKER_03]: apply.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this morning, the special rules
committee heard a number of
[SPEAKER_03]: recommendations that were put forward by
the Department of Cannabis Regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the breaking news really deals with
new cannabis operators, retailers,
[SPEAKER_03]: delivery services, as well as some very
interesting details that will impact phase
[SPEAKER_03]: two.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the supply side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell us about that.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is going to impact the phase two
Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in LA, we don't have any sort of like
hard caps.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a hundred dispensaries or a
hundred growers or only a hundred thousand
[SPEAKER_03]: square feet of canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we have in LA is something that's
called undue concentration, which requires
[SPEAKER_03]: what's called a public convenience and
necessity process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what all of that basically means is in
LA, we have city council members that want
[SPEAKER_03]: to be able to have some kind of say in who
gets licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially on the supply side,
but also for retailers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as part of sort of the mess or goop
that goes into passing a local ordinance
[SPEAKER_03]: or any sort of law, different regulators
or city council members and their staff
[SPEAKER_03]: give direction on what they want those
rules to look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they make the sausage in certain ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the big ways that the sausage
was made was there was in particular,
[SPEAKER_03]: one city council member, a woman named
council member Nuri Martinez, who has a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of growers and other supply side
operators in her district.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, there are 15 city council
districts in LA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so she said to her Wesson,
the council president, yep, I'm down with
[SPEAKER_03]: passing this cannabis ordinance,
but I want to make sure that we have some
[SPEAKER_03]: control on the number of operators that
get licensed in my district, particularly
[SPEAKER_03]: again, supply side growers and retailers,
of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what was put in was there are
different community plan areas in the city
[SPEAKER_03]: of LA.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the city of LA is absolutely enormous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's crazy how big LA is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sprawling, sprawling, sprawling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you've got these 15 city council
districts, all these different community
[SPEAKER_03]: plan areas within each council district.
[SPEAKER_03]: And based on the population numbers,
the city will issue or go up to kind of a
[SPEAKER_03]: soft cap on how many licenses per
population.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all that's to say that four growers who
are in this phase two supply side
[SPEAKER_03]: grandfather, the folks who supplied these
Prop D dispensaries, what they are up
[SPEAKER_03]: against or what they might be up against
and may no longer be up against are these
[SPEAKER_03]: soft caps.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people applied under this phase two
process, hey, we grew for these Prop D
[SPEAKER_03]: shops and they submitted to the city.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got their temporary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are operational or
non-operational.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what they've been up against is this
fear that, man, I'll go through this
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get an inspection by building and
safety.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put all this money into my tenant
improvements.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm committed to going through the process
in the city of LA.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm then going to get to this public
convenience, necessity, undue
[SPEAKER_03]: concentration potentially, like basically
a wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they're afraid of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put all this money into my
place and kind of really invest in the
[SPEAKER_03]: process in the city of LA.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then there are going to be too many,
basically too much canopy square footage
[SPEAKER_03]: in my particular community plan area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks like they may not be subject
to these PCN caps anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for we, like myself and a lot of other
folks who have been working very hard in
[SPEAKER_03]: LA, especially for the supply side folks
who've been operating in LA for years and
[SPEAKER_03]: years, not in the dispensaries,
not kind of out there to kind of public
[SPEAKER_03]: facing, this is a really big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're crossing our fingers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've kind of done a lot of advocacy to
get up to this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a lot of support within the
city, within the Department of Cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: Regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's really great to see that the
Department of Cannabis Regulation is
[SPEAKER_03]: supportive of the industry and of these
phase two operators and understands that
[SPEAKER_03]: people have really invested in this
process and want to get licensed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm really thrilled about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great, almost news, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens on Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we specifically talking cultivation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the part of the regulation or the
license category that you're focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're saying that there are currently
only four.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got different phases of
licensing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got phase one prop D shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could apply as a micro business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fully vertically integrated or four
licenses, distribution, manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation and retail, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they could do one, two, three or four
of those categories or a micro business.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are the prop D's and there are
about 190 of those businesses that are in
[SPEAKER_03]: the licensing process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because just think about this,
like, you know, the city of L.A.,
[SPEAKER_03]: enormous city, trying to regulate cannabis
for the first time ever, also trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: implement a social equity program.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the Department of Cannabis
Regulation, by the way, is its own
[SPEAKER_03]: department.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the smallest department in the city
of L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's kind of crazy is when the city came
up with the cannabis policy, instead of
[SPEAKER_03]: putting the Department of Cannabis
Regulation within another larger
[SPEAKER_03]: department that already has human
resources and other kind of staff and
[SPEAKER_03]: support, they created a whole new
department.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a department that's like a baby
department that's trying to regulate
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, deal with the social equity
program, and then have all the other bells
[SPEAKER_03]: and whistles of any other department in
the city.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a huge task really ahead of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got a lot more work to do,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got phase one prop D's that are
in that system.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're in the queue.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're working their way through the
queue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then second, the city said, we want to
license the people who made the products
[SPEAKER_03]: that were put on the shelves of these prop
D shops, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the folks who are eligible for this
phase two were people who were growers,
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturers, or distributors that have
been operating in the city of L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: since before, like basically since before
January 1st.
[SPEAKER_03]: The phase two operators are growers,
indoor growers, type six manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could also apply as a type seven
manufacturers, people who are making
[SPEAKER_03]: different sorts of edible products,
people who are distributors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like black stars.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Bryant Mitchell, he's someone who's
very well known and speaks kind of at a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of different events.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's someone like he's a phase two
operator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so phase one is like 190, the pool is
190.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phase two.
[SPEAKER_03]: We think, you know, I don't remember how
many people applied under phase two.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have been as many as 600,
but I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure how many people applied under
phase two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that could be actually less than that
because I think some of them applied for
[SPEAKER_03]: three different licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you focused on I couldn't tell if
for cultivation, you would rather have the
[SPEAKER_01]: more the merrier or you'd like to restrict
the cannabis that be spaced within the
[SPEAKER_01]: city of L.A.?
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the way I view it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been working with cannabis
businesses in the city of L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: basically since like 2009, 2010.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a lot of clients who were indoor
growers, for example, in L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: who are manufacturers who are
distributors.
[SPEAKER_03]: They looked at this whole licensing
process and the history of the way that
[SPEAKER_03]: the city of L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: treated them and other, you know,
any cannabis company looked at the
[SPEAKER_03]: enormity of regulation of taxes and I
would say 80 percent of the folks I used
[SPEAKER_03]: to work with said, see you later.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not I'm not engaging in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though I qualify, some of them would
also have been social equity, qualified
[SPEAKER_03]: for the social equity program.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just didn't have a lot of trust in
the system, to be perfectly honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are they staying in the traditional
market or are they I don't know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't work with those folks
anymore because I'm a business corporate
[SPEAKER_03]: regulatory attorney.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I work with people who are who are
going through a licensing process and kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of taking that leap of faith.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the point is a lot of your former
clients have stopped staying in touch with
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The logical conclusion is that they're not
going through this process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, probably not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe and some of them I've heard from
have gone through that process in another
[SPEAKER_03]: jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's just been a lot of the city of
L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: has been very challenging on a number of
levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's night and day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Working with the city now as a cannabis
attorney and advocate is very different
[SPEAKER_03]: today than it was for many years today.
[SPEAKER_03]: The city in large part at the Department
of Cannabis Regulation is wonderful to
[SPEAKER_03]: work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you've got, you know, a really
great department that has a lot more work
[SPEAKER_03]: to do, but they are very responsive to the
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's hearing was a good example of
that, how they're going to process the new
[SPEAKER_03]: retail applicants and social equity
applicants is a good example of how
[SPEAKER_03]: they're really trying to be responsive to
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been incredibly grateful at how how
open they've been and transparent with,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, proposed rules, kind of running
things by the community, different parts
[SPEAKER_03]: of the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been it's been incredible compared to
how it was in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the reason that this is a big deal for
people who are indoor growers in the city
[SPEAKER_03]: of L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: or, let's say, applied as a non-retail
supply side micro business is they could
[SPEAKER_03]: have been in a situation or and may still
be.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens and whether this
passes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But where they invest in a process in that
sort of like, as I mentioned before,
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of like jumping into, gosh,
I hope this works out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been challenging with the city of L
.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: for a long time, a lot of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're not Prop D's where this just the
suppliers of Prop D shops, which by the
[SPEAKER_03]: way, this phase two thing was never
supposed to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I remember when, you know,
we went through different sets of
[SPEAKER_03]: ordinances and there was nothing for these
folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was one of those situations of
waking up at four in the morning and
[SPEAKER_03]: putting together a policy letter and
lobbying the different city council
[SPEAKER_03]: members.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a miracle that we got that in
the final ordinance was an opportunity for
[SPEAKER_03]: these phase two people.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what they were coming up against was,
OK, you might be able to apply,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you might hit the PCN numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in certain city council members where
you have very conservative city council
[SPEAKER_03]: folks, they may say, too bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you invested all this money.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've invested in this process.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may even have a state license,
like a temporary license and local
[SPEAKER_03]: authorization from the city and spent five
hundred grand on tenant improvements,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever you needed to do, gotten the
inspection from the DCR and then hit this
[SPEAKER_03]: wall of this cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and too bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sad you can't get your license.
[SPEAKER_03]: What this small sentence in these
recommendations that were adopted today
[SPEAKER_03]: says is that those folks that that cap
will not apply to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a it's an amazingly big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know when it takes so much kind of
like detail to explain why that's a big
[SPEAKER_03]: deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to recap for somebody trying to
catch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Originally, the city of L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: was basically saying we're going to allow
prop D shops to make the transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe social equity applicants,
but nobody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they relax those restrictions to
insert phase two, which is kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: taking the entire traditional market that
operated in L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: and giving them some pathway to
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up until today, there was a big fear from
that group of operators that I could
[SPEAKER_01]: invest a ton of money to try to be
compliant and get my annual and get dinged
[SPEAKER_01]: for, I guess, concentration issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then something happened today,
which was that one clause that gave them
[SPEAKER_01]: hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll see what happens on Friday.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's very promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they put the clause they put the clause
up for vote today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Friday is when they decide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that kind of OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the gist of it is a lot of phase two
operators who were very concerned and
[SPEAKER_01]: fearful now have hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's exciting?
[SPEAKER_03]: The city council of L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what would we like to say to the Herb
Wesson's and other city council members?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you like them to keep in mind
as they vote?
[SPEAKER_03]: That we really should support L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: businesses and these traditional cottage
industry folks who really have invested in
[SPEAKER_03]: the process in the city of L.A.,
that this will mean jobs in L.A.,
[SPEAKER_03]: that this will mean, you know,
continued investment in this city and that
[SPEAKER_03]: this is, you know, this is a wonderful,
great gift that we hoped for when we
[SPEAKER_03]: passed the Medical Marijuana Regulation
and Safety Act, when we passed Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we said we cared about small
businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: That this really will effectuate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these businesses are trying to fight
their way onto the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's still not going to be easy once
they're licensed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the beginning of a continued
fight.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, at least there is that
pathway.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least people aren't sort of just,
you know, kind of throwing money and and
[SPEAKER_03]: and a hope in a prayer.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least they're, you know, it's it will
be hopefully a more seamless transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was that woman in that one zone
who is the one who added that clause or
[SPEAKER_01]: proposed the addition of that clause.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so different city council members
obviously have different kind of views on
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a council member, Nury Martinez,
who's not I mean, everyone knows she's not
[SPEAKER_03]: terribly favorable toward cannabis in her
in her area in the city of L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: There have been a lot of grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also been a lot of illegal shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, on on, you know,
kind of viewing things from her
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective, she wanted to and she wanted
other council members to have a little
[SPEAKER_03]: more control over who would be licensed
and how many licenses were issued without
[SPEAKER_03]: putting a hard cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what's called a soft cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once they reach the cap and this is for
retail manufacturing type seven and
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation, then you have to go through
this additional process.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very rigorous, like one would if you
were going to get some sort of like a
[SPEAKER_03]: special special liquor license.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a PCN process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that can be take a really long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: No guarantee goes to the full city council
for a vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: If your city council member supports your
project, then you may have a chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the amount of time and kind of
lobbying and unknown involved in that is
[SPEAKER_03]: huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas without that PCN for those folks
that are already in the queue and kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: working their way through the process,
if they meet the certain benchmarks,
[SPEAKER_03]: then they will probably get licensed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without this provision passing,
you're looking ahead to this huge unknown
[SPEAKER_03]: factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Will I be able to even get through the
PCN?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are the numbers in my community plan
area?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because none of that's even public yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the elected officials within
the local cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_01]: My assumption would be that Prop D
licensees would say we already have our
[SPEAKER_01]: cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need to split it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, there are a number of Prop
D licensees who have offsite non-retail
[SPEAKER_03]: locations, so they also would benefit from
the passage of this provision.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a generality, are Prop D licensees
supportive of this clause?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they pushing to get like, do they have
their lobbying machine showing up at the
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting and railing against it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they for it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they indifferent to it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think probably, if anything,
for it or indifferent.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are no constituents within the
cannabis community that are fighting
[SPEAKER_01]: against.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the only thing that we need to walk
very carefully around are really just the
[SPEAKER_03]: council members themselves and hoping that
this really does kind of move through that
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: It likely will, but there's no opposition
within the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's more of a, well,
if anyone's even paying attention to that
[SPEAKER_03]: level of detail, not so many people are
unless you're really kind of steeped in
[SPEAKER_03]: the weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mostly support, I would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think people realize that kind
of fairness sits on the side of people who
[SPEAKER_03]: are supply side folks in LA.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are LA business owners with LA jobs
trying to bring out like revenue in LA.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you even have like the fire
department chief who is thrilled about the
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity to walk through these
buildings and make sure that they are
[SPEAKER_03]: safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've never been in these buildings
forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, this is another way that you see
certain offices, certain departments in LA
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing the benefit of being able to work
with the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's only by regulating these
businesses that we have that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And meanwhile, today, there were also
motions about shutting down illegal shops
[SPEAKER_03]: and turning off the power.
[SPEAKER_03]: And kind of how to deal with enforcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other big things that happened
today were how the city is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: process the new retail applications and
the social equity program.
[SPEAKER_03]: So probably April, May, there will be the
first window for applications for retail
[SPEAKER_03]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only tier one, tier two social equity
applicants need apply.
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be about 100 that will be
processed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be first come, first served basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be a pre-verification window that
your individual that you're working with
[SPEAKER_03]: actually is a social equity qualified
applicant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then some 30, 60 days later, you'll submit
about 10 items that include a lease and
[SPEAKER_03]: radius map and security plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, you have to kind of meet
these marks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to submit it first come,
first served.
[SPEAKER_03]: Better be perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, your application will
be processed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then maybe nine months later, there'll be
another wave of applications that will be
[SPEAKER_03]: accepted for storefront retail that are
more that the reason for the kind of the
[SPEAKER_03]: time lag is because the social equity
program promises to give business
[SPEAKER_03]: licensing and compliance assistance to
people who maybe don't have access to
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the city is trying to balance two
interests.
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, folks who've been paying rent
on property for a couple of years,
[SPEAKER_03]: they are social equity eligible.
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably have investors behind them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, my God, I mean,
we have clients that have been paying rent
[SPEAKER_03]: on places for two to three years.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just waiting for this process.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to get it underway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's another group of people
that are saying, yeah, but we don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: where's that business licensing and
compliance assistance that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that we need in order to jump into this,
you know, into this very competitive and
[SPEAKER_03]: rigorous sort of game.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's why waiting for nine months
for those folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of that came out today,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within retail in the city of L.A.,
is there any thought to following the West
[SPEAKER_01]: Hollywood lead or consumption?
[SPEAKER_01]: Retail would also be allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we strictly just for sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right now it's just for sale.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's definitely been top of mind for
Council President Herb Wesson and other
[SPEAKER_03]: folks on the council.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we need to get her in here with
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, you know, ever since ever
since he started doing that, I remember
[SPEAKER_03]: this was like three or four years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it two years ago where he started
doing these community gatherings at night
[SPEAKER_03]: all over L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the biggest things that he
loved to talk about is like, where are all
[SPEAKER_03]: these people going to use their cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to make sure they have a place to
use their cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the deal with this on site
consumption like?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he always got really excited about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I think we're definitely
going to have that in L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, it's a lot for the Department
of Cannabis Regulation to process.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when I learned that this
department, like what it means to not be
[SPEAKER_03]: under another department, that you
actually have to like they have to like
[SPEAKER_03]: hire HR people who's processing payroll.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that they were not even put within
a larger department, but they had to kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of like cobble it all together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's crazy in a city this big
when you're processing that many licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many licenses did West Hollywood
process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that many.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about 190 only retail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of those have three to four uses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's 190, you know, times four or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you've got and I think they said
there were like 600 or 800 Prop D licenses
[SPEAKER_03]: if you count like kind of all of the
different components separately.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you've got the phase two that,
you know, some several hundred folks
[SPEAKER_03]: applied.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is an enormous number of
licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So given the cards they were dealt,
which is essentially creating an entire
[SPEAKER_01]: organizational structure from scratch,
you would give them a good grade based on
[SPEAKER_01]: what they have to deal with and building
an entire infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_03]: One hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: One hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in the news, you always see these
stories of kind of pointing fingers and
[SPEAKER_01]: frustration within L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I think there is just
generally in the world in which we live,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially in this country and in this
culture, this idea that we want to have it
[SPEAKER_03]: all right now and a lack of appreciation
for kind of the contoured nature of the
[SPEAKER_03]: political process and how things take time
and are complicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we instead we want it right here,
right now, my way or the highway kind of a
[SPEAKER_03]: vibe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just I mean, that's kind of
it's low vibration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't really appreciate how
complicated all of this is when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about regulating an entire
cannabis industry, trying to benefit
[SPEAKER_03]: people who have already been operating,
trying to create a whole new program to
[SPEAKER_03]: benefit people who are harmed by the war
on drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is a huge amount of very
groundbreaking, really incredible public
[SPEAKER_03]: policy and ideas that you're bringing up
sort of from the heavens into reality,
[SPEAKER_03]: into all these rules and regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you need to hire people, then you need
to implement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it is it's amazing how much is
involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're outside of the process and
you don't kind of see, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and really take the time to understand how
incredibly how much detail can go into
[SPEAKER_03]: just one paragraph, one one one issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy to point and say, well,
why isn't this happening quicker?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't you guys get your stuff
together?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's always easy to do from the outside
when you see it from the inside and the
[SPEAKER_03]: thought that has to go into all of this
and not to mention a public process and
[SPEAKER_03]: various studies and, you know,
implementation and what kind of technology
[SPEAKER_03]: platforming this is.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is massive.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Peanut Gallery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any question, comments?
[SPEAKER_00]: Musings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does these new findings out today,
does it give more hope for more of the
[SPEAKER_02]: process you think to people that want to
come in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is this is this really about a
celebration for those that have been
[SPEAKER_02]: building and have been here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely a celebration for those
who have been here for new, totally new
[SPEAKER_03]: growers, totally new manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically the phase three, I want to
come into L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: and open up my grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a win for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to take the long, long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The city has basically said, we're not
we're just dealing with new retail
[SPEAKER_03]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who even knows when the supply side in the
city of L.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: is going to open up to new applicants,
which makes the properties and the phase
[SPEAKER_03]: two licenses even more valuable,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that this goes well for
federal legalization, like for ground for
[SPEAKER_02]: like setting the groundwork for things
like like you were talking about the
[SPEAKER_02]: process?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do you think that it's true as
California goes social, the nation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, what's been really
incredible is how issues around marijuana,
[SPEAKER_03]: justice and reform have really kind of
swept the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, you know, this morning there
were a lot of folks who gave public
[SPEAKER_03]: comment during this hearing, a lot of
people talking about the social equity
[SPEAKER_03]: program, the opportunity that,
you know, individuals who spoke
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunities.
[SPEAKER_03]: This gives me this gives my community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that really is having reverberations
across the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that would be one of those
sort of like those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's it's like a domino or or some
card that you take and then it will all
[SPEAKER_03]: fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's definitely one of the kind of
these fundamental issues that we're all in
[SPEAKER_03]: this country.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that certainly years ago, I started
looking around like what is up with this
[SPEAKER_03]: complete, ridiculous contradiction where
you've got we're legalizing cannabis in
[SPEAKER_03]: certain states.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certain people are making tons of money
from it and benefiting from it in other
[SPEAKER_03]: states and certain people who have been
most harmed, not just still going to
[SPEAKER_03]: prison for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this contradiction doesn't make
any sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I know you kind of ask about
like businesses in L.A., but I would say
[SPEAKER_03]: the social equity program that is of top
priority.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, thank goodness and thank
goodness it will also continue to create
[SPEAKER_03]: that change nationwide, which I think will
help with federal legalization and
[SPEAKER_03]: hopefully de-scheduling soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Ariel, thank you for taking a seat
between Hello Kitty and Star Trek Barbie.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so my pleasure.
Thank you.
Thank you.
