[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna introduce Eleanor and let her
give her a little background She's gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: get into some ethics and genetics and kind
of take it from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But why don't you say a few things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, it's really awesome to be in such an
amazing group and get to talk about one of
[SPEAKER_01]: my most Passionate subjects which is
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so just to give you a background of who
I am I am a population geneticist my
[SPEAKER_01]: specialty is in the intersection between
agriculture and Wild plants and how those
[SPEAKER_01]: groups talk to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I did my dissertation in
I'm also a trained herbalist and I went to
[SPEAKER_01]: herbalism school not because I like sick
people I I went because I love those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and I really wanted to understand
how the usage of those plants impacts the
[SPEAKER_01]: Populations from which we're drawing in
particular our wild crafted local native
[SPEAKER_01]: endemic plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from the south so ginseng golden seal
Kohash a lot of plants that we all love
[SPEAKER_01]: And youth and how do those plant
populations?
[SPEAKER_01]: React to our usage of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a little bit about where I come
from and so with that background I've done
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of work in compliance and best
agricultural practices working for a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of bigger Natural products companies to
look at how they grow their plants and how
[SPEAKER_01]: those growing methodologies affect the
quality of those plants and so when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: in that world it became very clear that
the largest issue in the botanical trade
[SPEAKER_01]: globally is plant identity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fraud is rampant everywhere and we see
this within our own community just with a
[SPEAKER_01]: naming issue, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the reasons we have a naming
issue is because we have a corporate
[SPEAKER_01]: structure whether we want to see it as
that or not that the name of that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: drives value and so there's incentive to
rename plants to gain value and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: deeply problematic especially if you're
dealing with a community that is utilizing
[SPEAKER_01]: those plants for medicine where you don't
have consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you know if something works if
we're not calling the same thing the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing and then if you go and you expand
out into the agricultural setting,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do you know how your environment we're
talking about Appalachians and I'm so on
[SPEAKER_01]: board.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really involved in this conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how do you move that direction if
you're not holding those plants constant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with all of this background I
started a company called Leafworks with my
[SPEAKER_01]: co-founder Karen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I affectionately call her my work wife
which is how I'll reference her normally
[SPEAKER_01]: and our goal was to develop genetic tools
that can identify plants, ginkgo,
[SPEAKER_01]: cohosh, cannabis varietals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that becomes deeply problematic
because the community itself is the group
[SPEAKER_01]: that needs to do that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not my job to define those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this you know comes to the ethics
of genetics and really understanding what
[SPEAKER_01]: are those plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who are those plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: What holds them constant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when doing any kind of good science
especially in the botanical world one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the most critical resources you have to do
that good science is an herbarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an herbarium is a physical repository
where you take physical plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you take cuttings of them, you press them,
and you define them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go out and you find a new
species this is the first thing you do
[SPEAKER_01]: first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you write your description of
what that new species is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's an insect it's an insectarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got all these fancy words for
basically the same thing which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: physical encyclopedia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because this resource wasn't
available we didn't have the resources to
[SPEAKER_01]: do that good work of IDing which plants
were which cultivars or varietals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started an herbarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very much a community run process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're defining your material.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the few plants that I've grown but
that's you know it's a small little drop
[SPEAKER_01]: in the bucket compared to the diversity
that's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really I want to charge this
group to get involved with that project
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's important for this community
to do those definitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say that enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like no outside group should come in and
tell you what you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not how it's ever worked in
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not how it works in domestication in
general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we need to remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we have the power.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also moves into this you know
when you're talking about corporatization
[SPEAKER_01]: and what's happening within the that
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah you can see kind of this narrowing
down of the things that are available and
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about ethics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean my big shtick is diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're only growing those things
that are going to get you the most money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is completely understandable.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens to all those other plants
that are so important to the diversity in
[SPEAKER_01]: the fabric of not only the cultural
history that we have together but also
[SPEAKER_01]: moving forward to have those resources to
be able to leverage and grow with as we
[SPEAKER_01]: need.
[SPEAKER_01]: In particular those you know land races
and very unique medicinal plants that have
[SPEAKER_01]: specific purposes that aren't going to
drive a big dollar in a dispensary but are
[SPEAKER_01]: really important to a group of people for
their health and well-being.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's another ethical thing I
think we all collectively have to grapple
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how to maintain those plants in
community setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I don't have the answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like this group together can figure a
lot of this stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how do you keep those plants going as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it seed banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it everyone growing two or three things
that aren't commercially viable but are
[SPEAKER_01]: important culturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's you know many ways to approach
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I know there's a lot of questions
people have about genetics and genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: companies especially in the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I rarely say this out loud and in the wake
of the phylos ordeal and that idea that
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to pay to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to give me your samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to sequence them and now you own
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's completely wrong and it's inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's completely inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like saying if I go to the grocery
store and buy a gala apple and sequence
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I own it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no connection to that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why the herbarium is so
important because it's a physical tangible
[SPEAKER_01]: record that is free that you can then link
yourself to and reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we go to the PTO or we go
somewhere we have evidence that we can all
[SPEAKER_01]: then collectively reference as a community
to say no that patent doesn't hold up
[SPEAKER_01]: because look at all these other plants
that fit that bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know we have arguments.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know name X.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who cares what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a reference to go back to to have
a constructive argument because two people
[SPEAKER_01]: yelling across the room is not going to do
anything to move those conversations
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean you know like I think about it over
the years I've got so many C.O.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: certificate of analysis so many of so much
of what I've been working with like I know
[SPEAKER_02]: that's got to be somewhat of a valuable
thing in a potential weird scenario
[SPEAKER_02]: future.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how much weight are these C.O.A.'s
carrying in any kind of law form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I'm going to avoid the legal
questions and punt them to Dale.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know it's good for us to all be at
least creating our stockpile in case you
[SPEAKER_02]: ever have to deal with somebody saying
anything to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be like I've been growing this
for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a certificate of analysis from
2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keeping references of batch samples
because a piece of paper without a
[SPEAKER_01]: reference to the batch is meaningless.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every like so I do a lot of work for
traditional medicine and every time they
[SPEAKER_01]: make a batch of tea they save a certain
number of boxes of that tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of the same thing like it's
just good manufacturing practices that
[SPEAKER_01]: every time you make a batch every time you
have a particular plant that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in a season save some of it that
then links to your C.O.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you have a chemistry aspect and
you can reference back to the material.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's very helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just told me that all my stuff is
meaningless.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean we start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: In natural products the company itself
does that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way that we operate is very much in
the same light that you would for other
[SPEAKER_01]: botanicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not reinventing the wheel we're
just applying the wheel to this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you take generally speaking a
vegetative pressing to get the structure
[SPEAKER_01]: there and you take an early flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish we could take the glorious final
call but no one wants to give them up
[SPEAKER_01]: understandably.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're really unwieldy to press in a
press.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you get those two stages and then
you fill out a form and that form is
[SPEAKER_01]: evolving and we're really open to any kind
of additional information.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've taken the IUCN hemp form for their
cultivar registration and added things
[SPEAKER_01]: that apply to cannabis which include
chemistry flowering time other aspects
[SPEAKER_01]: that aren't necessarily included in that
hemp form and just start taking that data.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's linked to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be linked to a pseudonym if you
don't want it to be linked to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can have that connection that you
can then reference and that physical
[SPEAKER_01]: sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: The herbarium keeps one and then you keep
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you keep each other accountable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way and very low cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are a non-profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been bootstrappy bootstrappy as we
all know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more we grow and the more momentum
the easier it will get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been having press parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year has been a little bit difficult
to facilitate a lot of those things since
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running two organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in different areas we come together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bring those plants at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have presses there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have volunteers that mount things
afterwards at the end of season.
[SPEAKER_01]: We give you your pressed replicate back so
that then we each have one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: pressings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's herbariums everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a really large network in
Vermont and New England also in the South
[SPEAKER_01]: in North Carolina South Carolina some of
the more like illegal all over California
[SPEAKER_01]: up into Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plants are held locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plants from Vermont are held at a
herbarium in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's one thing we're also looking
for organizations that would be willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: hold the material as public service.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is much like a library.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the bigger the herbarium gets the
more locations there should be because it
[SPEAKER_01]: you know Northern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're going into county and then
hopefully we have more than one location
[SPEAKER_01]: because we have so many people that are
involved that can become more and more of
[SPEAKER_01]: a local resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really should grow into a resource
that everyone can utilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know if the Appalachians projects
wants to reference it for certain things
[SPEAKER_01]: then also you have a resource where you
can reference those to do other kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: good projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you have a project looking at PTSD
or sleep and you want to reference samples
[SPEAKER_01]: and you could have a medical group that's
doing research reference it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's you know it should be a resource
that's utilized for those different
[SPEAKER_01]: projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way we utilize it for full
transparency is if you so whenever we take
[SPEAKER_01]: in clients for leaf works and we do
genetic work for them we mandate that they
[SPEAKER_01]: press plants and give it to her the
herbarium because it's what makes their
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics worth something without a
physical sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go and pull it from a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go and take us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it's not reference to anything
tangible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our clients we mandate that they do
that good work because it validates the
[SPEAKER_01]: work they're doing with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then other people give to their barium
and one have nothing to do with genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other individuals want to join.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a cultivar identification program
going on right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you donate and you opt in to
that program we may or may not utilize
[SPEAKER_01]: those to then make markers for different
cultivars which is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like we do for our ginkgo test or a
black cohosh test so that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: referencing material that is correctly
named and has history and traceability
[SPEAKER_01]: attached to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it adds value to that farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you also get turkey get turkey testing
with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you know so if I have seen you
have seeds of the same female I've heard
[SPEAKER_04]: them here you grow them in southern L.A.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know the genetics can be slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're you know the value of that healing
property will be different depending on
[SPEAKER_04]: where it's from.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do we do you keep samples of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And keep that listed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know like cinnamon if we sourced
cinnamon from specific spots to get the
[SPEAKER_04]: strength and potency of the medicinal
strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it is this geared to that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't make any requirements of
individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: This community doesn't like to be told
what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not here to mandate we're here
to really serve as a container.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have COAs from labs if you have
done sequencing with another lab if you've
[SPEAKER_01]: done chemical testing you can link all of
that stuff to your samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no requirement but that is
something that you can absolutely do it
[SPEAKER_01]: and adds value especially as a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple farmers that have
different locations and they're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: like six things and all of their
locations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're really seeing it as a tool
and a utility to their own process to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand how do those different
locations affect the quality of those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can start to get at that G by E
that genetics by environment which is what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're all a product of right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics is just the back backbone the
environment is you know the nurturing that
[SPEAKER_01]: gets us to our true phenotype our true
outward expression regardless if we're a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant or an animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we do do that but it's not
mandatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to I guess also open it up
and say I know in these situations when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to genetics and ethics and like what
are people doing with my data and what
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of data do I not want to share and
what kind of data is really in our best
[SPEAKER_01]: interest to share.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a really good opportunity to
have some of those conversations and be
[SPEAKER_01]: really open about it because there's a lot
of fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understandably there's a lot of fear of
thievery.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of fear of ownership and who
owns what.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know exactly where everyone
sits but that's a conversation I would
[SPEAKER_01]: love to have with people this is something
that I'm very passionate about and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know I'm here with the plants and so it's
really about stewarding them and then
[SPEAKER_01]: taking care of those individuals and
humans that are taking care of those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah so right now we're fundraising to
digitize the samples that we have and it
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't be public it would be if you
contribute to the herbarium you have
[SPEAKER_01]: access to those resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the way and we may change and
grow but it's really to stop outside
[SPEAKER_01]: entities that are really just there to
pull data and not support the mission of
[SPEAKER_01]: the organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we made that decision and
we're of course open to discussion but
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why we stand there at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your data is your data right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you pull that data whenever like you're
if you're contributing plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pressings are really beautiful to look
at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice art.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're going to the Emerald Cup
both leaf works and candor will have
[SPEAKER_01]: separate booths and you can see some of
these pressings and we've made some
[SPEAKER_01]: posters of some of them Wade one of Wade's
plants is one of those posters you can
[SPEAKER_01]: check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought it was really graceful how
Eleanor kind of avoided talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: Phylos and I want to make sure that we're
not going to get stuck on rehashing or
[SPEAKER_00]: complaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is it's like the asteroid impact
that changed life after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changed our industry and it's important
to take that into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some lessons and some of us got very
burned by Phylos and others just watched
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're all here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what matters is do we take any lessons
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a couple of things that that
we can take from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote a blog post called demand this and
all your business relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: transparency accountability and
trustworthiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about the problems that
we learned from hopefully that we the
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons we learned are was there
transparency was there accountability and
[SPEAKER_00]: did that lead us to did it create the
appearance of trustworthiness or actual
[SPEAKER_00]: trustworthiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so much more important is going
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we do that in our own in our own
activities in our own businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we look at groups that are offering
to receive and store data or handle your
[SPEAKER_00]: data or we'll look at groups that are
offering to receive and store genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: material like seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to understand their
trustworthiness or their accountability
[SPEAKER_00]: and their transparency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means you need to ask hard
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the fundamentals is
that if you put in data you still own the
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's really fundamental.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Eleanor Eleanor and I.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sound like a southerner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Eleanor Eleanor and I are both in
involved in something called the Ethical
[SPEAKER_00]: Data Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an open group.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have calls every Wednesday morning at
8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except this week it's Thursday morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially trying to achieve
something that the open cannabis project
[SPEAKER_00]: was trying to do until we just kind of
closed the doors and walked away because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the situation with phylos.
It's.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is one of the goals is to have a
genuinely ethical opportunity to receive
[SPEAKER_00]: and relay data to other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an organization that won't do any
of its own breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one there's one important point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an also an organization that if you
submit data it's still your data.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something right now we're just
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about forming the right way
of organizing it with the right ground
[SPEAKER_00]: rules the right statement of ethics the
right operate operational procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we get all that in place and
we think that people will want to take
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of it then we will have to get
to the infrastructure the IT capabilities
[SPEAKER_00]: of handling those data and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the I think one of our key
principles is you put in your data on
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever terms you you wish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be I don't want this to be
used for any commercial purpose or I want
[SPEAKER_00]: it to only be used by members in good
standing of this organization or I just
[SPEAKER_00]: want this out there and this is a
convenient way to put it out and I put no
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be you can use this for a
commercial purpose but then I want a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain defined royalty from anything you
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think different people who own data
and have different reasons for sharing it
[SPEAKER_00]: can have can be ethical and still have any
one of those approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: To how their data are used in a similar
way for a while we were looking at doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that and having the same organization
handle seeds because a lot of people have
[SPEAKER_00]: have come to me and told me look I've got
these legacy collections of seeds rare
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds land races was something somebody
gave me whatever and I want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are that they're going to
ultimately contribute to the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity as plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that there's vast diversity in
cannabis genetics but most of what people
[SPEAKER_00]: are working with right now suffers from
something called the founder effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've all heard of the founder effect is
basically if you have okay let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: people got stuck on Gilligan's Island
forever and they had babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well everybody would either have Mr.
Howells DNA or the professors or
[SPEAKER_00]: Gilligan's or the skippers right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No Gilligan's well he got around you know
Gilligan got around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody got Gilligan's DNA at one point
or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is there would be a limited
diversity no matter how many people ended
[SPEAKER_00]: up on that island and if let's say the
island is huge you could have a billion
[SPEAKER_00]: people on that island but they would have
gone through a genetic bottleneck where
[SPEAKER_00]: there were only a small number of possible
parents and all the rest of the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse everybody would have been white by
the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wouldn't there wouldn't be there'd
be vastly limited diversity and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what's happened with cannabis the cannabis
that has been bred for the last couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: generations to maximize THC and do this
and that it has disproportionately been
[SPEAKER_00]: selected from a certain collection of
original parents instead of sampling from
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole wide diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm telling you what you already know
but our goal with the with this group and
[SPEAKER_00]: this this project is to have a way that
people can can trust putting their seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: in for safekeeping or for whatever for
what other geez I didn't even smoke very
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to smoke more and more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is that at first we were thinking
of doing this all in one organization and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we realized okay genetic material
that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all you don't want to have it all
in one place you don't want to have
[SPEAKER_00]: something bad happen and everything die.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also you can as much as you can abuse
data you can abuse genetic information
[SPEAKER_00]: even more you can you you know it's it's
got to be really trustworthy you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: have one let's say you have one aggregator
let's say I'm the aggregator and I tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you trust me I just want all your seeds
but you can trust me there maybe you can
[SPEAKER_00]: but you don't know that and so what we've
decided to do instead is a kind of a like
[SPEAKER_00]: a library system of local seed banks that
all agree to play by by certain principles
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll you know it'll give people who put
their seeds in there some options about
[SPEAKER_00]: what they want the use to be do they want
it just for safekeeping do they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: again same same list of options share it
non-commercially share it commercially but
[SPEAKER_00]: with a royalty share it commercially
without a whatever and so the person who
[SPEAKER_00]: puts the seeds in should still own the
seeds and they should have be able to have
[SPEAKER_00]: their rules for putting that in govern the
rules for taking it out and we're thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: that if we can come up with a coherent set
of rules that aren't too rulesy they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: alienate everybody we can actually have a
bunch of independent seed libraries sign
[SPEAKER_00]: on to this and then it would almost it
would really be like a library system we
[SPEAKER_00]: if we can if we can actually create
corresponding information then it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: okay I I'm a breeder I want to bring in
some some southern African whatever and
[SPEAKER_00]: and what are my choices and who's offering
it for for no royalty or for a modest
[SPEAKER_00]: royalty and you can really start we will
see a huge increase in the diversity of
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetics of commercial cannabis which
should be really cool so that we did
[SPEAKER_00]: decide to do that differently from the
ethical data alliance so we really are
[SPEAKER_00]: creating two separate structures and right
now it is we're just a lot of people with
[SPEAKER_00]: good intentions talking every Wednesday
morning we do intend to take it to actual
[SPEAKER_00]: fruition we've got we've all got better
things to do than just talk on the phone
[SPEAKER_00]: once a week so we are going to make it
happen we'd love the support of this group
[SPEAKER_00]: or anybody else if you're interested send
me an email and I'll get you on the on the
[SPEAKER_00]: call-in list I mean it's just we'll send
you the the dial-in information there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an open group I'm and and and and and
and .
