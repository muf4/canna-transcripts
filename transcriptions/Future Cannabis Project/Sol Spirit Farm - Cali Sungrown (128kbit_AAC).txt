[SPEAKER_02]: Can one of you be our hand?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ask you for a favor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you be our hand clap model?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you just put your hands right here and
make a big clap?
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Walter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Walter is going to roll us a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is dealer's choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Walter is going for what he grew at
home this past season, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we grew this in our Hugo culture
bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brand new Hugo culture bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost no inputs at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really stoked on how it came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It placed seventh in the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're super, super proud of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what cut is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a Fruity Pebbles OG seedling,
which I've heard tends to be rather
[SPEAKER_01]: turpentine dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strain and that this is no exception
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who gave it to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was a freebie seed,
I think from Equinox seeds, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd have to double check on the
exact detail on that one, but I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that's where it came.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just, you know, it came with
another pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are your expectations for like
year two and three of the same Hugo bed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like is year one kind of like get it going
and then like your highest hopes are for
[SPEAKER_02]: year like three?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably, but so one of the things we did
to kind of jumpstart our Hugo beds is we
[SPEAKER_01]: used a lot of wood that was already
starting to decay a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, usually like the inner two
thirds is still good and solid,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just the outer bit still decomposing
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it has those mycelium networking
districts running a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my experience has been those first
year Hugo's kick butt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got some Hugo culture beds now
that are three and four years old that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're raging strong still.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't say they're really better or
worse than they were that first year,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I have heard a fair number of people
that have had, you know, it require a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of compost and stuff those first couple of
years because probably not using the
[SPEAKER_01]: decomposed wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say year seven or whatever,
when everything's totally broken down,
[SPEAKER_02]: like are you moving on from that Hugo bed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you loving it and still using it as
just regular soil that's very nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: rich?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that's something to be,
to be determined a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm fairly new to the Hugo
culture thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, one thing we've heard is that you can
kind of put wood in from the side a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I'm doing with some of my
20 year old soil because I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: dig it up and flip it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's been where it's been and we've
been, you know, growing there for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're, we're on a little bit of
hillside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just infilling on the edges with
a, with a little bit of wood to add,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that Hugo culture effect to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, do you want stronger winds
when you're trying to roll a joint
[SPEAKER_01]: outside?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'd have to say that normally
stronger winds when rolling a joint or in
[SPEAKER_01]: general, when even doing an event like
this, stronger winds are not the
[SPEAKER_01]: preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the wedding cake you guys did
last season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's the mother's milk and the Mac
melon in the next jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's some blueberry muffin
over there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the papers are challenging today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just the rolling papers, all the
papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Walter technique, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the goal is to get as much weed
in as small of a paper as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So otherwise you have what I'm,
what I consider an improper balance of
[SPEAKER_01]: paper to weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to minimize the amount of
paper, maximize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what type of paper do you like to use
personally?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, you know, I, I enjoy the raw
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mix in the elements, clubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like, um, anything that's,
you know, clean enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I'm thin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gotta be thin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gotta be clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to use just the clubs without glue,
but, uh, at this point they only are
[SPEAKER_01]: making the smaller papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't roll a, I can't roll a proper
grower joint with that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just a little, and so tell me
about the smoke for this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you like about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a, the turpentine dominant is
less than 10% of the flower out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, according to a couple of labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and it's, it is that really focused
eight times the Tiva type of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, you know, if you got a meeting to
go to, but you know, you still need to
[SPEAKER_01]: take care of your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have like 100 C packs to pack up,
I will be focused on the task.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not a, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause so this mother's milk great sativa
also not so focusing though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's on the hybrid end of
sativa for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just, this is as sativa as I've
smoked in a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fruity pebbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: OG did not sound to me like sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounded like OG and fruity pebbles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't expecting this out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you never know though, what,
what seeds will do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe somebody mislabeled the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere that happens to the best of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's your doobie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's, uh, I wish we could sit in this
car.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe you probably could think anyone
would give me a hard time if I,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's his car right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, back to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavor X shirts there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we ask them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this your car?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could we sit in it and smoke a joint?
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the flavor is in that video.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the flavor branding is in that
video.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will get the flavor branding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Walter, you want to come sit
with me?
[SPEAKER_02]: I will.
I will.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will, this is our sponsor for the
joint smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go for a cruise here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let you fire that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I trust you as a man in a, in a reclusive
area is not a carrying coronavirus right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, this is a ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm sitting on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say they make an electric one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I want to check out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what kind of car is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bander hall.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it says on the wheels too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a stair.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, but there's no, uh,
no clutch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think clutch is gone out of
style.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is confusing though.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that would imply that it's like a
modern built.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is modern built.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very modern built.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be amazing if we both had a
little cup holder right here with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see a cup holder and I'll have to
say even for, for two people, we're,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're cozy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking around to see if I spot any
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some water over yonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not within reach though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically we could drive over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When that guy's not looking, this is
fucking windy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could not imagine being Jody playing
golf right now and not hating my golf
skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like nothing makes you hate your golf
abilities more than wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I don't wind it or wind enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't golf enough to know about the
wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, you know, I frisbee golf
sometimes, so not very often.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you think about the flavor of
that one?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my normal thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't see any water anywhere,
do you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch out for that phone on the corner
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give me your assessment of,
uh, where the California market is right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you sad?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you happy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you optimistic?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm totally optimistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like California market is a 13 year
old boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Running into the liquor store and grabbing
the Everclear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Want water?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's, that's where I think the
market's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 13 year old boy going, well,
I get Everclear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get really, really messed up
really quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you know, a couple of years,
maybe we'll get a little more mature and
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll move on some craft beers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even a couple of years later,
we'll be onto the fine wines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once we get to the fine wines,
and you know what, there's some of us that
[SPEAKER_01]: are there already, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're enjoying fine flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's, there's those of us that
are in the know already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to find, find those,
you know, make those connections.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to find our weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much noise and it's just so
new.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like, you know, it's going to take
some time for this dust to settle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the other, the other part of it
though is like, can the craft farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: survive?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that time when like even the other
part would be when you can sell globally,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, there, we, we do have some
advantages as the craft, craft farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of us, uh, have been doing this for
20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, these new farms, they don't have 20
years under their belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, um, but they have a lot of money,
but they're trying to go from,
[SPEAKER_01]: from, you know, zero to run in a marathon
without having run the 5k first,
[SPEAKER_01]: without having fucking graduated from the
5k and keep moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so yeah, this, that's where,
that's where we're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I think, so we've got some
advantages there and yeah, we can't
[SPEAKER_01]: compete with them on mids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to crush the mids market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is strong, but I'll be focused on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Focus clear in my car when they make an
electric or they say they say he said if
[SPEAKER_01]: they make one, when I can afford one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that might be when I can afford one
and they haven't let that be a bad ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That thing would be fast as fuck too.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said it weighs under a thousand pounds
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Must squirt out and go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a four cylinder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not quite a highway car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, said it goes 140.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll, that'll get you on the highway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you get hit by like the SUV and yeah,
no, there's those things too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm really stoked with the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really tasty pungent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't be happier with the coming in
seventh.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then would that be something you'll now
put in the commercial?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, uh, we had some seeds of it and we
were growing those out on the commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: side of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then are you Fino hunting too?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're like, this is really good,
but I'm going to see if I can push it and
[SPEAKER_02]: then even better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got, well, so I've got one that I,
I've Fino hunted out, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't Fino hunted it in the light
depth yet, but so we know that in a,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the outdoor, it'll do a 25% THC and
it'll do a almost 4% turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got high hopes for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it was dense and super nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, you know, it was epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we got, we have a couple other new
strains coming out too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really excited about,
I ran some, uh, Burmese mimosas last year
[SPEAKER_01]: that, uh, we Fino hunted out a couple of,
and we keep going on the Fino hunt,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the flavor, I think, you know,
I'm, I'm hoping it'll, it'll cross that
[SPEAKER_01]: 20% THC number because the teenagers in
the 13 year old market are grabbing that
[SPEAKER_01]: 20% THC and they're like, the retailers
won't, won't buy the lower stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's odd too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's like a vicious circle of
negative feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and here's the thing is Leafly did
an article where 60 something percent of
[SPEAKER_01]: the consumer said they wanted less than
20%, but those aren't the loud guys coming
[SPEAKER_01]: in the end of the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the old timers going in and
looking and reading the labels and the
[SPEAKER_01]: young kid comes in and I want the stuff
with what's a hundred percent THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what they're paying attention
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I feel like there actually is more
of a market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually did have to put some lower THC
stuff on the market and, and we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: hard time getting it into a dispensary,
but once it's in that one develops a fan
[SPEAKER_01]: fan base because there isn't that much low
THC stuff on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody wants to get ripped out of
their gourd on one hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some folks would maybe even like take the
second hit before they get ripped out of
[SPEAKER_01]: their gourd.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people don't even want to get
ripped out of their gourd.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all looking for a different thing
and a different, you know, different
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerance levels and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just lumping everyone into a
couple of categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're looking forward to the choir.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's just, you know, we got,
we got to get that consumer education is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is the key.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's what I think is amazing
about what you're doing is that's what I
[SPEAKER_02]: try to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it's like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why the whole event thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, I want to smoke LA people out
with like amazing outdoor NorCal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd just be like, what do you all think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's why I do these,
these events.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I, for me, it's worth it making
that huge trip out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, yeah, that's outdoor,
sun grown, organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I really think that a lot of
people have been buying, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever came out of Humboldt and the
Emerald Triangle, Trinity, Mendocino,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever came out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really nice and dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoor, it didn't get sold as outdoor
when it got to the buyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're buying it as indoor because it
looked nice and it could pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I mean, I know they're
changing the name three times,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like it, it wouldn't even stay
in, like it wouldn't stay the same name as
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm selling it to the first guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd be like, no, no, I'm calling this
this and this this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is what I said on the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some great things about
legalization for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things is we can come out
of the indoor closet and we can grow on
[SPEAKER_01]: the full sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of hurts my stomach when I see all
this indoor shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I love giving away weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a little personal share stuff
here and there and turn people on to what
[SPEAKER_01]: what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is that sun grown is the answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do it regeneratively instead of
killing the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I want a place for my kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's pretty important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all good goals to have in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I support each and every one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This thing is meant to go faster than
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it's like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot I have sunglasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sitting in the sun now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wear a little umbrella.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the umbrella at one hundred forty
miles an hour would be hard to hold on to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I would my legs would not
stay this pale.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would have a hard time staying that
pale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep this pale by being upright.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's not a shadow or there's a
shadow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not that's how we say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy to think that people used to
race like like old car races and cars like
[SPEAKER_02]: this with like the like pilot goggles.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Lamans and stuff like that in a
car like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skinny ass wheels and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, please do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can open a jar and grab a nugget,
too, if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just said that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it depends on which one you like
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that mother's milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that Macmillan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's going to give you a massage
after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just keeps getting better.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I just came for the free
Frisbee and I got weed and a massage,
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks for doing what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate, you know,
the help getting the word out about the
[SPEAKER_01]: the Emerald Triangle, sun grown love and
that, you know, we can do this in an
[SPEAKER_01]: environmentally responsible way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those are super, super important
to me, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I'm trying to think when's the next
time you guys are I want to try to get up
[SPEAKER_02]: there, but I.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have like two little kids and another
one on the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's our personal photographer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the weed con photographer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was guessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm swell train high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this car needs to move faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to head home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should grab that box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to start charging by the hour.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a combination of two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, typically, typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of genetics out there,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
