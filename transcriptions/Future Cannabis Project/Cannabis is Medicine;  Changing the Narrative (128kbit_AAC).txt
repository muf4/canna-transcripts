[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Maureen Smith.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am an RN, BSN.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked for six years with Iraqi war
veterans at the West Roxbury VA in Boston,
[SPEAKER_02]: Massachusetts and then embarked on a
travel nursing career.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2018, I decided that I was going to
change my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I became a cannabis nurse educator.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have one-on-one consults with
patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I advocate for the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I advocate for cannabis education.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I advocate for people to understand
that cannabis medicine is a viable
[SPEAKER_02]: alternative to Western medical
pharmaceuticals for chronic and lifestyle
[SPEAKER_02]: disease management.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Jude Tillman, and I'm a
medicinal cannabis educator based on a
[SPEAKER_00]: graduate degree in public education,
but more based on my activism in support
[SPEAKER_00]: of health care as a right and in
understanding traditional medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that cannabis as an herb and
as an herbal remedy is an alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pharmaceutical industry is the
alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to be fighting for the
traditional return to traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, which worked for various
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And conditions for 5,000 years,
but we didn't understand the reason why it
[SPEAKER_00]: worked until the later part of the 20th
century.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very happy to work with health care
providers in the allopathic tradition as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as patients, public and the industry
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: My background is international solidarity
movements, peace, social justice,
[SPEAKER_00]: working in South Africa and Nicaragua and
the old Soviet Union to bring human rights
[SPEAKER_00]: and health care rights to people around
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my passion and we have a
dispensary, a holistic wellness center
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been alive for eight years now and
before that for nine years I was a
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator and that's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to know what's the biggest
thing on our minds today with,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you said with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, personally, my biggest concern is
that people don't understand that all
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that when people go home at
the end of a stressful day and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: martini or two, they're doing anything
beyond self-medicating for stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same with what's called
recreational because the history of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in Western culture particularly,
but Eastern culture as well has been one
[SPEAKER_00]: that was using cannabis as a source of
inspiration for jazz music and art and all
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've associated it so much with the
pleasures of the creativity that you get
[SPEAKER_00]: from getting high that we forgot that
there's a medical motivation in the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to be more direct about your question
about what's on my mind is to begin to
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to fill the gap of knowledge both
within our farmers who are growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, our medicine makers who are
trying to craft these great medicines out
[SPEAKER_00]: of those medicines, try to begin to bridge
the gap between them and the researchers
[SPEAKER_00]: such as the cannabis clinicians and many,
many researchers around the world who are
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out how cannabis heals and treats
certain conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a big gap between those two.
[SPEAKER_02]: The knowledge gap continues throughout the
entire Western medical healthcare system.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had been speaking to you that about 60%
of American adults live with a chronic
[SPEAKER_02]: medical condition and that 42% of those,
60% have something that we RNs call
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple comorbidities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiple comorbidities, there are 30 of
them associated with poor dietary choices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when coupled with weight gain
and sedentary lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: This includes insulin resistance,
type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure,
[SPEAKER_02]: high cholesterol, heart disease,
stroke, sleep apnea, gall bladder disease,
[SPEAKER_02]: GERD, pain and some cancers and insomnia.
[SPEAKER_02]: These chronic health problems have a
negative impact on quality of life and
[SPEAKER_02]: they lead to depression and social stigma
and discrimination.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a result of toxic and work life
stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Causes many to use excess food and alcohol
as a coping mechanism.
[SPEAKER_02]: These poor choices are made under duress
because quick energy is needed to fuel
[SPEAKER_02]: these hectic lifestyles.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of these are hypothetical scenarios.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have taken care of people from all walks
of life in every condition known to man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every three nights for 12 hours a night
for 14 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know they are on several different
classes of pharmaceuticals and that each
[SPEAKER_02]: particular drug has the potential to cause
another disease state.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a national healthcare crisis that
we can actually fix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what cannabis has to do with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a tremendous opportunity and this
is probably the first interview that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: done in joint work with another cannabis
educator, medical practitioner like
[SPEAKER_00]: Maureen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the perfect marriage of two
different knowledge bases and we're both
[SPEAKER_00]: on the same page about the value of
cannabis and the terror.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use the word terror of
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything that I agree a thousand
percent with, everything Maureen just
[SPEAKER_00]: said.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you see as the way we can move
forward with what Maureen is saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you connect cannabis with all these
problems that you've described?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that connection work?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go first this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to be a pessimist but I've done
presentations to doctors and nurses all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at St. Jude's Hospital down near San
Clemente.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was presenting to a group of doctors and
nurses and there were about 25 doctors and
[SPEAKER_00]: nurses in the room and about three
quarters through my presentation about the
[SPEAKER_00]: wonders and the science and the richness
of what we understand about how cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: works, a nurse raised her hand and she
says this is such good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were never taught this in nursing
school.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says when do you think we'll be able
to integrate this into our clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: practice as Western practitioners?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was like really earnest about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a really deep breath trying to
figure out how to answer her question and
[SPEAKER_00]: a gentleman in the back of the room,
an MD, raised his hand and said we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: never be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like whoa, I wasn't gonna be that
pessimistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you say that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says because the insurance industry
will not allow us to spend more than 15
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes with each patient and write a
prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way the system is structured.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, as a patient counselor, when I sit down
with a new patient at Dragonfly or
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere in California or on the phone
from Australia to a group of artistic
[SPEAKER_00]: children on the East Coast, whenever I
spend time with new patients, it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum of 45 minutes and you can see his
point then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like wow, how is the system gonna
allow this change to take place?
[SPEAKER_00]: You answer the question Maureen,
please.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking very similarly when I woke
up this morning that when you go to a
[SPEAKER_02]: doctor, a traditional conventional doctor,
with a serious problem and serious
[SPEAKER_02]: concerns and you're looking for solutions,
they, the last two visits I've been at for
[SPEAKER_02]: my personal, you know, to go to my doctor,
I believe that I wasn't heard at all,
[SPEAKER_02]: that I wasn't even listened to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they have in their mind which
prescription they're gonna write for you
[SPEAKER_02]: to walk out the door and I am no longer
walking out the door with a piece of
[SPEAKER_02]: paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: The prescription, it's within us and it is
the endocannabinoid system and it is
[SPEAKER_02]: through natural healing and it is through
time and it is through lifestyle changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sparks are being made.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of people in the medical
community who are catching on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Western conventional medicine will always
be an option for some.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just have to go that route.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just need to get the message out to the
people who are willing to change and who
[SPEAKER_02]: are willing to nurture this type of
medicine for life, to thrive for the
[SPEAKER_02]: community, for the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going back to what you were saying in
your previous comment about how it also
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on how you manage stress,
about nutrition, exercise, all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we started Dragonfly in 2011,
it was a group of women.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a Tai Chi instructor,
a yoga instructor, an herbalist,
[SPEAKER_00]: a manual lymphatic drainage instructor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like all of us and then
somebody, everybody said I wanna do my
[SPEAKER_00]: practices, my holistic natural healing
practices, but I don't wanna run a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary so I got voted in to be the
admin person which was thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point was we could have carved out
a tiny piece of real estate much cheaper
[SPEAKER_00]: and become a pot shop just like many
dispensaries are in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we decided we would have space for a
classroom, for yoga classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have a practitioner's individual
room where you could have massage or
[SPEAKER_00]: acupuncture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided we would go the extra effort to
make sure that cannabis was integrated
[SPEAKER_00]: into a holistic lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're still struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still struggling to offer all of the
things that patients need to, by way of
[SPEAKER_00]: information, because it doesn't do any
good to come in and just say oh I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer, give me some cannabis for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, if there's a million other,
if you're not doing all these other things
[SPEAKER_00]: for yourself and you're living an
unhealthy lifestyle, you can eat or smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: or drink all the cannabis in the world and
it won't do any good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really in agreement with the
framework that Maureen is suggesting about
[SPEAKER_00]: holistic healing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is that the veterans are a
powerful group and they are moving this
[SPEAKER_02]: message forward in a very strong way.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them are healing from PTSD
through cannabis and are becoming very
[SPEAKER_02]: vocal advocates.
[SPEAKER_02]: The VA is actually following suit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are looking for, I forget what they
call it, but they're looking at different
[SPEAKER_02]: modalities and they're actually funding
different modalities.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, and there's lots of veterans
bills up in, wherever bills go up,
[SPEAKER_02]: sorry, I'm not a political person.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Congress, on the national level,
you're right, there are some bills
[SPEAKER_00]: proposed that are very, met with very
positive attitudes on both sides of the
[SPEAKER_00]: aisle, Republicans and Democrats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and what I'm finding that in
practice is that state by state,
[SPEAKER_00]: the VA, heads of the VA will do kind of a
don't ask, don't tell, look the other way
[SPEAKER_00]: with some of them and then some of them
are absolutely ideologically opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in any way, shape, or form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gonna be, the VA's a little bit
like the states.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be chipping away at it to get
it to open up, but Maureen's absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vets are a powerful voice and we work
with vets as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm a member of the American
Cannabis Nurses Association and we just
[SPEAKER_02]: had to write an essay for a scholarship to
their first conference in New Orleans.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the nurse, there was one for a student
nurse, somebody who hadn't become a
[SPEAKER_02]: practitioner yet, and there was one for an
advanced practitioner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the advanced practitioner's essay was
just so heartfelt about the first time
[SPEAKER_02]: that she had treated a patient with
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a hospice patient, but that patient
found relief and was able to transform
[SPEAKER_02]: from being alive to passing on in a much
more spiritual and comfortable way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this nurse was moved so much that she
decided to devote her life to this type of
[SPEAKER_02]: medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I'm losing words.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also in Michigan, I know that there's
a format in a long-term nursing care
[SPEAKER_02]: facility where they are allowed to treat
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave a lecture in Ukiah and a woman came
up to me and said that she was interested
[SPEAKER_02]: in using CBD and somehow she is able to
use CBD with her mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her mother has dementia and I have heard
from her and her mother is sleeping
[SPEAKER_02]: through the night and they're hoping in
six months' time to get her off some of
[SPEAKER_02]: her anti-psychotic meds because she's
doing so well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that the answer lies deep
within our cellular matrices that has a
[SPEAKER_02]: profound ability to use beneficial
molecules without fretting about political
[SPEAKER_02]: or religious or cultural ideologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once people get those molecules and
find the change and start benefiting from
[SPEAKER_02]: chronic conditions that they've had their
entire life that was only exacerbated by
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceuticals, these people are the
people who start advocating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I talk to people, I say if you get
it, if it works for you, if it changes
[SPEAKER_02]: your life in the most profound way,
please grab somebody else's hand and teach
[SPEAKER_02]: them what you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is so true.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most inspiration that we've seen in
all the state legislatures, we're about up
[SPEAKER_00]: to 31 states that have now legalized
medical cannabis, but the patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: the parents of children with epilepsy,
the patients who come forward and speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: those moving stories, just as Maureen is
saying, but I would just add one little
[SPEAKER_00]: extra thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aside from telling everybody you know,
your family and friends about how it's
[SPEAKER_00]: worked for you, the organization,
I'm a political activist, a political
[SPEAKER_00]: organizer for 30 years, and when we work
with the hospice groups, I've presented to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mendocino Cannabis Nurses Association,
the Parkinson's support groups,
[SPEAKER_00]: the vets groups, 420, we have six target
populations, and they each have groups
[SPEAKER_00]: that represent and lobby for the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it's hospice seniors,
anyone over 65 that have particular needs,
[SPEAKER_00]: parents of children with autism,
epilepsy, athletes use this, no pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: no gain, get back in the game kind of
thing, and I said that one wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of the pain, get back in the game,
that kind of, pets are another big,
[SPEAKER_00]: big, big, and then vets, did I get all
six?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, they each have organized
grassroots organizations that are lobbying
[SPEAKER_00]: on the state level and on the national
level, and people need to plug into those
[SPEAKER_00]: because they, it's with unity that they
add heft to their individual patient
[SPEAKER_00]: voices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also on a positive note, in that
direction, the National Council for the
[SPEAKER_02]: State Boards of Nursing Regulations did
come out with their 2018 guidelines for
[SPEAKER_02]: medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So key to those guidelines are that
nurses, student nurses and advanced
[SPEAKER_02]: practice in nurses must learn the
endocannabinoid system, cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmacology, the cannabinoids,
and...
[SPEAKER_02]: The AMA has not come out with such a
statement, the American, so in Canada,
[SPEAKER_02]: nurses are leading the way, and I think
that that's gonna be the case in America
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I asked a leading researcher,
Dr. Ethan Russo, how are we going to bring
[SPEAKER_02]: medical cannabis to the dispensaries,
and he said a good doctor always listens
[SPEAKER_02]: to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a nurse.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that moment, I decided it was gonna
have to be me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nurses really do lead the way in
allopathy, in western medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: they really do, and Ethan's a great
advocate as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the positivity, and I'm curious if
there's one other thing that maybe start
[SPEAKER_01]: with, if there was one thing you could
change about the current system today,
[SPEAKER_01]: what would that be, and then what other
really good things do you see happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've been focusing on the medical,
because that's what we're about right at
[SPEAKER_00]: the moment, but I have three hats,
and one of them has to do with policy,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we were talking about this earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best farmers and the best medicine
makers of second and third generation are
[SPEAKER_00]: being suppressed and stopped by
over-regulation and ridiculous taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can't create this very
high-quality, craft cannabis flower that
[SPEAKER_00]: we need for good medicine, as we have in
the Emerald Triangle, unlike anything else
[SPEAKER_00]: in the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't create it, they can't get in
the game and become regulated and legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's too onerous, it's too
difficult, it's too much money to get
[SPEAKER_00]: involved, too many taxes, too much
infrastructure that the state or the
[SPEAKER_00]: counties requiring them to build,
so on the cultivation level, and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: know of at least six medicine makers who,
for the last eight years, have used their
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines very effectively with patients,
very good high CBD tinctures and SAVs and
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer THC oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't produce their medicines under
the current regulations, so we're losing
[SPEAKER_00]: very important medicine makers for our
patients because of ridiculous,
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, ironically, both on the county level
and throughout the state of California,
[SPEAKER_00]: and on the state level, we're starting to
see the pendulum swing back to a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more reasonableness in the
regulations, because, not because they get
[SPEAKER_00]: it that they're hurting patients,
but because they get it that they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the tax revenue that they want,
because so many people are staying in the
[SPEAKER_00]: underground market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because why should they get legal and
compliant when they have to deal with all
[SPEAKER_00]: of this nonsense, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think they're finally beginning to
get it, and that's what we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: advocate for, to protect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are not many places in the world
where you can get pure and potent cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, other than the Emerald Triangle,
for reasons that I could go into,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we won't right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But elsewhere, Salinas Valley,
Tennessee, wherever, they're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: things in soil, they're growing cannabis
in soil that has had previously treated
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical nutrients, chemical pesticides,
and all kinds of other toxins that we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want as the root cause of our
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the unique possibility here in
the Emerald Triangle to support and
[SPEAKER_00]: sustain the most pure and potent and the
best raw materials for cannabis medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world, bar no other place in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a reputation that we have around the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if everybody doesn't protect that and
cry out to protect it, we're gonna lose it
[SPEAKER_00]: to big pharma and other forces.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I came up in the time of D.A.R.E.
[SPEAKER_02]: and I raised my children in the time of D
.A.R.E.
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I became a nurse and I had to put
veils on to sort of be able to exist in a
[SPEAKER_02]: culture that I didn't really believe in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I had known more about cannabis
than I did about the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the next journey for me is
to integrate the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I do know about the plant is
that in Israel, the strains are a little
[SPEAKER_02]: more controlled and they're a little more
medicinal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if controlling the strains or
making them more medicinal rather than
[SPEAKER_02]: more marketable through like high THC
strains is possible or viable or even a
[SPEAKER_02]: solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if we create a market for
medicinal marijuana, then the farmers will
[SPEAKER_02]: grow the more medicinal varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's true because I'm
not a plant person, unfortunately not yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna get my hands in the ground,
I wanna get my hands on that plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I just haven't had the opportunities
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do believe that there are
cannabinoids we don't know about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Israel has been studying these
cannabinoids for the 80 years that we have
[SPEAKER_02]: been prohibiting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they know which cannabinoids actually
cure which prostate cancers through the
[SPEAKER_02]: biomarkers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're growing to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maureen is absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not just Israel, but the University of
Bonn and Pltense in Madrid and Oxford and
[SPEAKER_00]: Brazil's doing a lot of really good work
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere in the world where they didn't
have this silly war on drugs that also
[SPEAKER_00]: included marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a crazy Alice in Wonderland world in
the United States right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with time that will change,
but it does take time to change people's
[SPEAKER_00]: attitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I would say is that this,
I think there's a false notion that the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries have recreational marijuana
and we're trying to get medicine in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I again will say that I think all cannabis
is medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question of which is the best delivery
system, which are the best ratios,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the best dosing, all of that can
be done within the products that are being
[SPEAKER_00]: created now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just need to educate our staff in
these various dispensaries so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: give honest, good information to the
patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a huge gap.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 23 license types in the state of
California, but there's not one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses that the state of California has
directed any resources toward public and
[SPEAKER_00]: patient education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero, zip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're on our own out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having said that, there's still a big
gap between the research that's being done
[SPEAKER_00]: in places like Israel and what our farmers
are cultivating and what our medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: makers are making.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to close that gap so that we begin
to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a question of the markers
and figuring out, because even with that
[SPEAKER_00]: study on pancreatic cancer in Israel,
they ran into a problem halfway through
[SPEAKER_00]: the study because the cultivator hired on
contract by the Israeli government
[SPEAKER_00]: switched one nutrient in that very
controlled indoor grow and all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_00]: they had completely different results and
they couldn't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fortunately they were able to trace it
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on an international webinar where
they talked to the person who was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that study and he says, we were going
crazy 24-7 trying to figure out what did
[SPEAKER_00]: we do wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one little variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of science that still
needs to be applied to our cultivation and
[SPEAKER_00]: to our medicine making.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those structures aren't set up yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also the endocannabinoid system is under
genetic control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's gonna be personalized and
different for every single patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a good and a bad thing because
what we know about herbal medicine that's
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamentally different from
pharmaceuticals is it's individuated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmaceuticals treat patients like we're
cookie cutters, take two aspirin every
[SPEAKER_00]: four hours no matter what's wrong with you
and how big you are, how small you are,
[SPEAKER_00]: male, female, child, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the way our bodies work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a good and a bad part to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I have a lot of fantasies but they're
not fantasies that are mine alone because
[SPEAKER_00]: there are groups that are organizing
around some key aspects of where do we go
[SPEAKER_00]: next in cannabis regulation and such as if
you look through the state of California
[SPEAKER_00]: those counties or those sectors of
different counties who have had strong
[SPEAKER_00]: trade associations have achieved the most
traction in Sacramento and in their local
[SPEAKER_00]: county seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the coming together of a
couple of grassroots organizations in
[SPEAKER_00]: something called MCA, the Mendocino
Cannabis Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we need to focus on as MCA and
becoming a very strong voice on behalf of
[SPEAKER_00]: our farmers, our cultivators, our medicine
makers, our distributors, our
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries, all of us in not just
Mendocino but our entire Emerald Triangle
[SPEAKER_00]: area, region, is we need to focus on
lifting these onerous regulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: treating it as a regular agricultural
crop, get the helicopters out of our
[SPEAKER_00]: backyards, lift the tax burden that
welcomes, invites people to become
[SPEAKER_00]: compliant and legal, make it easier for
them to do that, support an appellation
[SPEAKER_00]: system that would create a protective
envelope around the craft cannabis that
[SPEAKER_00]: exists in the Emerald Triangle that's
unique and different from anything
[SPEAKER_00]: they've, when they throw seeds into the
dirt in Salinas Valley or Kentucky or
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever they're throwing seeds into the
dirt these days, it will distinguish the
[SPEAKER_00]: high quality and the purity and the
potency that becomes the basis of our
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to create a market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The market is out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just since January 1st, 2018 with the
legalization in California, people are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of the woodwork because they
have, there's patient needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients are coming out of the woodwork
and saying I want to try cannabis instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of being dependent on all these
pharmaceuticals that have all these side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to organize ourselves as an
industry and have a strong voice at the
[SPEAKER_00]: table to create a supportive fiscal tax
and regulatory environment for our people
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry to keep making those high
craft, high heritage value, pure and
[SPEAKER_00]: potent materials, biological materials
I'll just be broad about it, biomass,
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, everything that we need to create
these medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need that kind of organization.
[SPEAKER_02]: My personal belief is that everybody has a
right to thrive up to their level of their
[SPEAKER_02]: ability.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the Western medical model does
not have the same belief.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many are caught in a trap of working in a,
toxic work environment, coming home
[SPEAKER_02]: stressed, taking their stress out on their
families.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cycle just continues and people
are turning to opioids, alcohol,
[SPEAKER_02]: food, even hectic lifestyle as an
addiction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many are depressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many are anxious.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the highest level of stress in 10
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis medicine can bring the change
that we need to our culture, to our
[SPEAKER_02]: society.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've just gone mad.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have gone mad with collective madness
with all this trying to keep up with the
[SPEAKER_02]: Joneses, trying to buy the best couch,
like constantly watching TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our kids are feeling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our kids are stressed, overweight and
pre-diabetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: There needs to be a cultural shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis will bring it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
