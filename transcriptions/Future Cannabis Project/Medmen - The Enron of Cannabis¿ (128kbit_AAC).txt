[SPEAKER_01]: Today's topic was around corporate
governance and what can be expected of
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, how they run their companies,
how they treat their shareholders,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not different shareholders that
are in different classes that hold
[SPEAKER_01]: different paper, how they're treated,
how management teams are thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: their own compensation, how they're
thinking about the long-term viability of
[SPEAKER_01]: their business versus are they short-term
greedy or long-term greedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that what a lot of people are
watching right now is as some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: companies have these massive market caps,
especially some of the multi-state
[SPEAKER_01]: operators, are they going to be around in
five years or are they going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: attacked by the market eventually for not
practicing good corporate governance?
[SPEAKER_01]: What I heard a lot of people talking about
today is what can we expect going forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are these companies going to mature?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they really ready for prime time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did these companies go public too early?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they have the ability to scale into
being a Fortune 500 style company or are
[SPEAKER_01]: they going to end up getting run into the
ground and forgotten about in five years'
[SPEAKER_01]: time?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think about this in the same perspective
thinking about tech in the 1990s when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're having these massive valuations
from let's say 98 until 2002 when it
[SPEAKER_01]: crashed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had companies that you thought were
going to be the hottest big next thing
[SPEAKER_01]: because they came out of the gate with so
much bluster and bravado and then within
[SPEAKER_01]: two years' time they burned through all
their cash, squandered their first mover
[SPEAKER_01]: advantage and no one ever heard of them
again where some other ones took a really
[SPEAKER_01]: meaningful approach to how to address
their industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at 1999 and Amazon obviously at
the time everyone knew the name but they
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't anything close to what they are
today whereas at the same time you had
[SPEAKER_01]: companies like MySpace that probably could
have made it that didn't and then there's
[SPEAKER_01]: companies like Pets.com that were the
famous flame outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're watching that happen right now with
cannabis of which companies do you look at
[SPEAKER_01]: and say okay well that company is run by
so much corporate greed, so much hubris
[SPEAKER_01]: that ultimately they're not going to be
able to survive going forward whereas
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking at some of the other ones
and thinking okay have they been really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really careful about how they structure
their shares?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have they been really careful about how
they've treated their shareholders?
[SPEAKER_01]: How they've worked their cap table?
[SPEAKER_01]: How they've controlled their float?
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at a company like Tilray that's
been really, really smart about not
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing all of their shareholders from
privateer to have an exit to date where
[SPEAKER_01]: you have some other companies where they
flooded the market with their paper and
[SPEAKER_01]: taken people off restrictions too early
that's going to cause either massive
[SPEAKER_01]: dilution or it's going to cause a massive
downward pressure on their share price and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what people are watching and then
they're also watching who's at the helm
[SPEAKER_01]: and how are they thinking about it and are
they being overly aggressive to the
[SPEAKER_01]: detriment of their shareholder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in talking to kind of institutional
investors and maybe high net worth
[SPEAKER_00]: investors and you know VC firms,
PE firms who have invested in some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these current public companies early who
have a lot at stake, do you see a fear
[SPEAKER_00]: that some of these companies may kind of
blow up Enron style with just scandals
[SPEAKER_00]: that could have been avoidable but we kind
of got the better of the company?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it's a very real fear and I
think that what's happening right now
[SPEAKER_01]: people are starting to you know the
euphoria is wearing off you know you had
[SPEAKER_01]: this great saccharin sugar high for a
while of like oh we've invested in this
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis company and they're everywhere
and they're gonna do all these great
[SPEAKER_01]: things and you know they've taken such a
great footprint right out of the gate that
[SPEAKER_01]: now is sort of the high is worn off and
now they're thinking about it okay well
[SPEAKER_01]: you know do these guys really know how to
run a business and you know now that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: really read through all the filings we've
really read through you know what what
[SPEAKER_01]: this company has you know underneath it's
not not what we thought it was and then
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a question of whether or not those
companies are able to to overcome that
[SPEAKER_01]: whether they can bring in you know good
management behind that to say okay well
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got some we've got some issues we've
got some overhangs we're gonna find a way
[SPEAKER_01]: to clean it up or you have you know
management teams that are still so
[SPEAKER_01]: confident in themselves that they think
you know they're impenetrable but I think
[SPEAKER_01]: those guys you're gonna watch a couple
just get slaughtered because either the
[SPEAKER_01]: short sellers are gonna come in or you're
gonna have derivative suits you know
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing up the companies for for
mismanagement of funds or for for you know
[SPEAKER_01]: breach of fiduciary duty or you know doing
things that from a corporate governance
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint will be looked upon very very
unfavorably by any you know court that's
[SPEAKER_01]: uh that's examining it so you know expect
to see the other first wave of like mega
[SPEAKER_01]: lawsuits happening you know in the
immediate future and I think that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna see some pretty big marquee names
that you know people were talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time you know call it in the last
three or four months probably not exist by
[SPEAKER_01]: 2020 and or if they they do exist will be
you know a shadow of their former selves
[SPEAKER_00]: right and we've seen some of these
lawsuits come to light pretty recently so
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of these companies have gone public
so recently so if you're thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: the sentiment of early and current
investors based on what they do when a
[SPEAKER_00]: lock-up period ends what would you be
watching for when company A's lockup
[SPEAKER_00]: period ends and they're a public company
and you're what you're watching or
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring either management or early
investor activity in terms of selling
[SPEAKER_00]: shares and on the Canadian exchanges on
everybody's favorite Canadian exchange the
[SPEAKER_01]: first thing to be watching for is you know
who is their banker you know who they
[SPEAKER_01]: working with and what's that bankers plan
whether it's you know can a quarter GMP or
[SPEAKER_01]: beacon or the other Canadian companies up
there that are really supporting these
[SPEAKER_01]: companies and finding out from management
you know what's your what's your plan that
[SPEAKER_01]: when shares come off restriction to have a
secondary market that's going to come in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and sweep up and purchase those
shares so it doesn't have just a massive
[SPEAKER_01]: hit to the share price because some of
these companies you might have you know 10
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 30 million shares or more hitting the
market at one time this they come off
[SPEAKER_01]: restrictions and boom some people are
gonna hold but there's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: that say hey you know I got in really
early I've already had a 20x I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to risk that this thing goes down I'm
gonna take my profits and walk away and by
[SPEAKER_01]: the way I want to be first to the door
because if I wait someone else is gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: beat me to it and that's gonna put
downward pressure on the on the share
[SPEAKER_01]: price and it's just gonna keep you know
pushing it down so you know when these
[SPEAKER_01]: shares do come off restriction if you're a
really smart management team and you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got really good strong relationships with
your bankers you've already thought about
[SPEAKER_01]: this beforehand you're saying okay who's
gonna go in there and start buying large
[SPEAKER_01]: blocks to support the share price or how
much cash we have on our balance sheet to
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially buy shares back ourselves to
keep them at the share price up but you
[SPEAKER_01]: know watching these things hit too fast
and crater is is problematic and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that a lot of times you have to think
about whether or not you're gonna only
[SPEAKER_01]: allow a certain amounts of shares from
shareholders to bleed out in small
[SPEAKER_01]: tranches specifically to prevent that from
happening before before it does you
