[SPEAKER_00]: Compliance-ish sounding things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my bigger concerns has been the way
people are paying their employees and
[SPEAKER_00]: documenting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wage and hour compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are people classified as employees versus
independent contractors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes in this industry, people are
labeled as independent contractors or even
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteers when they're really employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a big hot button issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Categorizing employees accurately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you talk about what you're seeing
in the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it is largely driven by the banking
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And historically, these companies not
being able to run a traditional payroll
[SPEAKER_00]: because they didn't have a banking
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a misunderstanding that you can't pay
employees in cash, which you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not done in a traditional
business because it's just complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And messy and cumbersome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a result of that, there was sort of
a default to call in people all sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: things, as I mentioned, volunteers or paid
interns or independent contractors when
[SPEAKER_00]: really the individual was an employee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And California law had been a little bit
more complicated in years past.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more recently, there was a decision
that came down that simplified it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're controlling the means and
manner in which people are doing your
[SPEAKER_00]: work, if they're working on the core
business that you're in, if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower, if they're growing, if you're a
manufacturer, if they're on the floor
[SPEAKER_00]: making products, if you're a dispensary,
if they're selling products, if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing your core business, and if they
don't have a job outside of yours,
[SPEAKER_00]: by and large, they are your employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they should be treated like employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really to the point of why labor and
employment lawyers, whatever get involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: they need to be paid like employees
because if you don't pay an employee like
[SPEAKER_00]: an employee, all sorts of really bad
things start to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be tracking their hours
correctly or you may not be at least
[SPEAKER_00]: documenting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be paying them for overtime
either eight in a day or 40 in a week
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're just paying them some sort
of a lump sum per week as an independent
[SPEAKER_00]: contractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could create liability for not paying
all hours or not paying overtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not be giving them meal periods or
rest breaks, or if you are, you may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: documenting that you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this opens you up to liability and
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
[SPEAKER_00]: but people actually don't tell the truth
sometimes and they will stretch the truth
[SPEAKER_00]: when they want to get money out of a
business and they'll say, I'm not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: my meal periods or I'm working off the
clock or I'm not being paid all of my
[SPEAKER_00]: overtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're treating them like an
independent contractor or you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: all these documents that you normally
would have for an employee, you're sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: left there saying, oh yeah, but,
and then the court's gonna look at you and
[SPEAKER_00]: say we'll prove it and you're not gonna
have the documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some of the things that grow
out of not treating employees like
[SPEAKER_00]: employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have unpaid time or unpaid or
underpaid time or overtime or people are
[SPEAKER_00]: not getting their meal periods or their
rest breaks and you're not giving them an
[SPEAKER_00]: itemized wage statement that sort of lists
all of the things that are supposed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: out there, these penalties start mounting
under the California Labor Code.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get really expensive and it's not
unusual for me to speak to somebody and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, oh, you owe this person $800 in
overtime and $6,000 in penalties plus
[SPEAKER_00]: their attorney's fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are sort of shocked to learn
that an $800 wage claim can turn into a
[SPEAKER_00]: $15,000 wage claim downtown at the labor
board, but it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these can be business killers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've seen this play out in cannabis
businesses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without naming companies, can you give
me an, like you just mentioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: was that an actual case?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was $800 and it turned into
$15,000?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in the cannabis space, but we've seen
something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also seen people that were
classified as independent contractors go
[SPEAKER_00]: into the labor board and saying,
hey, I wasn't paid correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then go into other state agencies and
making claims of discrimination or
[SPEAKER_00]: harassment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first threshold for those agencies
are gonna be, well, are you an employee or
[SPEAKER_00]: not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're an independent
contractor, you're not given some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: same rights that you are if you're an
employee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing that those individuals
need to do is pierce through that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: definition or classification and convince
the administrative law judge or a judge
[SPEAKER_00]: that, hey, I'm not an independent
contractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an employee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, I'm protected from
discrimination or I'm owed overtime wages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's oftentimes a very difficult job
for the cannabis employer to overcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as an example, it's expected that I
show up at nine and stay till 5 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monday through Friday, which is sort of a
baseline definition of independent
[SPEAKER_01]: contractors have choice of when and how
and where they get the work done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Employees are expected to, you know,
on a set schedule, be there and do the
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a traditional sort of
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there used to be a long list of things
that courts would look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really grows out of the IRS
definitions of independent contractors
[SPEAKER_00]: versus employees and a number of cases
that sort of adopted them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I mentioned, the California courts
really simplified things maybe six months
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, beginning part of 2018 and made it
much more difficult to treat somebody as
[SPEAKER_00]: an independent contractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas before you would look at hours of
work and equipment used and all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not three factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it the ABC test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's is that individual, are you
controlling the means and the manner in
[SPEAKER_00]: which the individual is doing their job?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they performing your core business?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do they have an independent business
outside of what they do for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if those things aren't being met,
they're employed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you were describing where nine to
five, you're telling them when to show up,
[SPEAKER_00]: where to go to work, how to do their job.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a clacking duck.
[SPEAKER_00]: That duck is employed on an independent
contractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Workers comp is something that we're
increasingly seeing questions come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a workers comp expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will tell people in the industry
that are confused that there are workers
[SPEAKER_00]: comp policies available for their
employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mandated that any employer in
California have those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to have them in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't, the penalties are pretty
onerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this goes to training your
managers or the people that are sort of at
[SPEAKER_00]: the front line dealing with the day to day
employment issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody comes forward and reports an
injury at work, you have to take some
[SPEAKER_00]: steps immediately to preserve certain
rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a form you need to give to the
individual to allow them to make a claim
[SPEAKER_00]: to identify what the injury is and get
them into that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody's not carrying workers comp or
they're not providing that notice of
[SPEAKER_00]: rights and they're allowing injured
workers to continue to work, there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: serious liability that can flow from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sort of anecdotally, we sort of
are interested to watch around the country
[SPEAKER_00]: how certain judges, nobody in California
have actually ordered workers comp
[SPEAKER_00]: carriers to pay for marijuana as a
treatment for certain injuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something many of our carrier
clients are watching very closely to see
[SPEAKER_00]: if that's going to expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to price the risk and what's going to
be available for employees, but then also
[SPEAKER_00]: how to administer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're a workers comp carrier,
if you can imagine you're getting premium
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars in, you're paying benefits out and
somebody says, I want you to pay for some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a cannabis derived product for
paying medication costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's the logistics for actually
paying for that medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are insurance companies going to start
handing dollars directly to dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: or should they give them to the
individuals?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the concern there becomes,
are we effectively engaging in something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's unlawful by providing money to a
claimant knowing that they're going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: use it to buy something that's federally
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a bit of a wormhole.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a maturation that's happening very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know precisely what it's born
of, but I do know that there are people
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from other industries into cannabis
that sort of encounter it outside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: lawyers on the ground inside of a
manufacturing warehouse and then saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do business like that,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So insurance products come in and they
underwrite and they're identifying some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things and saying, we can't write
insurance unless you improve certain
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then folks like myself have become
more active in interfacing with the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and educating them and teaching
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these sort of things are quickly
moving and pushing the industry along to
[SPEAKER_00]: the point where you are getting more
formal processes for hiring people,
[SPEAKER_00]: people being reclassified and put into
their right classifications, people being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to sort of identify a thorny
termination and pick up the phone and call
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody like myself before they pull the
trigger on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gotten better, but overall I would
say it is no different than anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not because it's the cannabis
industry entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just because it's a new industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the operators tend to be younger
or less experienced or at least they were
[SPEAKER_00]: when they started.
[SPEAKER_01]: First time operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they just need to have a focus to
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other part of it that I didn't
mention a minute ago is for the last three
[SPEAKER_00]: years, the focus has been on regulatory
reform, having licensing regulations in
[SPEAKER_00]: place, doing what's required to get the
license in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now in a state like California,
there's probably a life cycle like this in
[SPEAKER_00]: every state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that more and more businesses are sort
of over the hump on getting that license
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're turning to running their
business, these things are now getting
[SPEAKER_00]: more attention because they just can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would encourage those businesses that
are either taking in some private equity
[SPEAKER_00]: money or doing fundraising or just coming
out of the licensing phase and going back
[SPEAKER_00]: to doing their business.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be successful in the long
haul and you want to be attractive to
[SPEAKER_00]: investors who are going to be able to make
investments in your company so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can grow, be able to demonstrate that you
have solid onboarding processes,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've got some policies and
procedures in place and that you train to
[SPEAKER_00]: them, you take them seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a handbook that Dean Rockle
gives you and you throw it in a file
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you go forward and you manage your
employees, you do so in a wise way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you sort of identify that there's
some thorny issues, work with an HR
[SPEAKER_00]: consultant that you can trust or an
employment lawyer like myself and figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out sort of what the risk management would
be as you go through those so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to look over your shoulder too
much as you move ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
