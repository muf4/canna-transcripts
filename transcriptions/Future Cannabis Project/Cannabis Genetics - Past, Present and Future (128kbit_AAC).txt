[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cover some topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to cover history of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about organic biology
and how it impacts cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can weave all this together into a
big web.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at any point in time, man,
just make sure you stop somebody and get
[SPEAKER_00]: access to a mic if you want us to stop and
cover a topic or go into something or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's the whole point of it is
that it's really trying to share the
[SPEAKER_00]: information that we've gathered over these
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that as a group, as a cultivation
culture, we can actually do better
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that in mind, I will introduce
Mowgli and Jeff and Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to let them just give a
quick little blast on themselves because
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise I won't cover them correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mowgli.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the CEO of Filos.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a cannabis genomics company based
out of Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working on sequencing the DNA of all
the cannabis in the world and figuring out
[SPEAKER_04]: what the hell we're actually smoking at
any given time, which is still to this day
[SPEAKER_04]: a mystery to a lot of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have testing tools that are just meant
to help growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're working on helping people do
really advanced plant breeding to bring
[SPEAKER_04]: this plant into the future, make it work
better for growers, make it less
[SPEAKER_04]: susceptible to powdery mildew and flour
earlier and all those things that every
[SPEAKER_04]: other crop has been through all this
science.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've been incredibly advanced by
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cannabis hasn't had access to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our whole work really, you're going to
hear about a lot of things that intersect
[SPEAKER_04]: with this on this panel, is to bring all
that science without fucking everything up
[SPEAKER_04]: in the way that that science typically
fucks everything up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's all this diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all this subtlety.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all this stuff that's not science.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all this stuff that has to do with
flavor and feeling and history and
[SPEAKER_04]: culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, so how do we, you know,
and there's a world of people out there in
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada, mainly, who just want the biggest
plant that yields the most oil and they
[SPEAKER_04]: get the most single cannabinoids out of.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's, you know, and that will
happen, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So how do we do all this science that can
drive that and turn it in a different
[SPEAKER_04]: direction so we're actually bringing out
the full richness of the plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's our challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Kevin Jodry, founder of Wonderland
Nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually say career hustler, because that
seems how I got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's basically a lifetime of being
involved in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a young guy on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was involved in what we call then
criminal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to see an unbelievable amount of
cannabis as a young guy coming into the
[SPEAKER_00]: country through my neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it absolutely changed my life in terms
of I was just fascinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the course of the last,
you know, 40 years, that's been really the
[SPEAKER_00]: chase is to better understand cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the last couple years,
I'd say the last 11, I was involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: legitimate industry, regulated industry,
and trying to figure out how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain those cultural connections and
how do you keep the quality present?
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, how do you really
share the information with other people so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you leave a legacy of people who
follow you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my direction has been that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a very interesting ride to
say the least.
[SPEAKER_09]: My name is Jeff Loewenfels.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in 1975, I was in Alaska and the
Supreme Court decided that you could do
[SPEAKER_09]: anything you wanted in the privacy of your
home, including smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so as an assistant attorney general,
I helped write the opinion as to where you
[SPEAKER_09]: have a right to privacy so that you could
smoke cannabis in your tent or in your
[SPEAKER_09]: hotel room.
[SPEAKER_09]: We couldn't quite get a phone booth that
didn't work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cars didn't work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, so I've been fooling around with
cannabis since 1975 and before.
[SPEAKER_09]: And somewhere along the line, I started to
write a book on organics and resulted in
[SPEAKER_09]: teeming with microbes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then one day, I decided I needed to
figure out how plants eat.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that resulted in teeming with
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then one day, I decided that not
enough people knew about mycorrhizal fungi
[SPEAKER_09]: and how I was so effective in growing
things.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I wrote a third book.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have three books.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas I used to have two.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was America's dirtiest lawyer.
[SPEAKER_09]: I now have three books, which makes me
lord of the roots.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm very interested in organics.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very interested in making sure that
when the big guys come in, the little guys
[SPEAKER_09]: don't get pushed out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I am very, very interested in making
sure that we never again let the
[SPEAKER_09]: government prohibit cannabis.
So.
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Justin Calvino.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time I'm with Kevin, I realize like
in 94, I started selling cannabis on
[SPEAKER_07]: Thayer Street in Providence.
[SPEAKER_07]: I grew up like three blocks off of Thayer
Street in Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're like Rhode Island cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: I probably sold it to Brown Campus.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was like Brown and RISD.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I worked at a skate shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: And moved out to California in 96,
where I was buying cannabis from Arcata
[SPEAKER_07]: from up on the square or Boulder Creek in
Santa Cruz and selling it on Haight
[SPEAKER_07]: Ashbury.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I spent two years as a homeless
teenager on the Haight and trying to go
[SPEAKER_07]: pro at this thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have some history in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I moved out to Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did what everyone else did.
[SPEAKER_07]: We hid behind our locked gates.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were trying to raise a family,
small farms, work on local systems of
[SPEAKER_07]: governance, sharing, community fire
departments, you name it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And got arrested and ended up in cannabis
policy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And ended up saying enough is enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sherry Glazer said get out of the cannabis
closet.
[SPEAKER_07]: So came out and drew a map.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I drew an Appalachians map.
[SPEAKER_07]: I took my design talents and my knowing of
regional specific strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: And heritage.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I put it down on paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going up to Wonderland Nursery and
asking Kevin, what do you think about
[SPEAKER_07]: this?
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_07]: And all the breeders and all the regions.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we put together quite a project.
[SPEAKER_07]: And since then I've done things like the
Emerald Exchange, trying to get small
[SPEAKER_07]: batch cannabis farmers access to market.
[SPEAKER_07]: So started bringing farmers out of the
hills, setting up tables for them,
[SPEAKER_07]: getting them in mason jars, helping them
brand and market themselves fully
[SPEAKER_07]: illegally.
[SPEAKER_07]: So everyone was like, what are we doing
this for?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, because this is coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we've been working hard for the
small guys for quite a few years now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's an honor to sit here with Kev.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mowgli, I'm really interested to learn
more about what it is that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And how you can help solidify some of the
metabolomic research and data collection
[SPEAKER_07]: that we're doing to internationally
recognize Appalachians of origin.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jeff, I'm a lover of roots.
[SPEAKER_07]: Man, 10 years in regenerative design
theory and permaculture practice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's my geek.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to get into the
history of genetics where we began.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that way we can start the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it really ties into all the stuff
we're doing where the varietals that came
[SPEAKER_00]: into the United States initially,
what people call land race, I don't use
[SPEAKER_00]: that verbiage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because land race to me is open
pollination and not selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you start to select cultivars
that you're going to work with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you also choose males from those open
populations that you're going to use to
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as you put your hand in the
pile, that's a cultivated variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no longer land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Land race is basically plants that are
developed for survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all they're for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care about yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not worrying about quality of
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a genomic form that wants to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once humans started from these genetic
piles, they pulled things out that they
[SPEAKER_00]: liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started to pull things they liked for
whatever reason they chose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you take a look at the world in
terms of latitude, you can see stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: was equatorial was chosen primarily for
cerebral nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make generalizations, but the more
we go up in latitude, the more we start to
[SPEAKER_00]: see CBD genetics come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you start to look through this material
on lab analysis, you can start to see
[SPEAKER_00]: these connections where the individuals
that lived in latitudes 20 to 40 had a
[SPEAKER_00]: much harder life than those from zero to
20 in terms of climactic situations,
[SPEAKER_00]: abundance of food, and just in general
living conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so much of the cannabis that comes
into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: from when I was a kid was coming in off of
ships on the East Coast primarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was coming over from Mexico into
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to call that stuff sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been like late 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so much of the weed coming into New
England was coming in through fishing
[SPEAKER_00]: boats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just like in Humboldt County,
when cannabis took off in Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't the hippies that really blew it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the loggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the logging industry disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, you have this massive
industrial workforce that has no job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get into growing weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hippies are making money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might as well make money, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the next thing you know,
Humboldt County is punching out as much
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis as one could grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was not the hippies that were
punching it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the industrial loggers.
[SPEAKER_00]: New England was the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fishing industry collapses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lobstermen collapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: My whole neighborhood's a fishing area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, the fishermen are
grabbing all the weed from the offshore
[SPEAKER_00]: boats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the boats are coming in out to sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fishing boats would go in,
grab the weed, bring it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: My family wasn't into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my family was into organized crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they were into organized
crime, they were kind of terrifying
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allowed me to access the cannabis
industry in a different way, where I could
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of do what I wanted and hang out with
who I chose, because my family had such a
[SPEAKER_00]: reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it allowed me to get involved with
some stuff as a young guy that wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to see this incredible diversity
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would come through seasonally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would see varietals coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that were bringing it in in
bulk would tell you, hey, we got Colombian
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we knew Thai would come in
basically when school started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the end of August, 1st of September,
you would see Thai coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd see Afghani come in through the
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd see cannabis move globally into the
East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would see hash move into the East
Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was always on a really consistent
basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we noticed was that it wasn't
homogenized, that all of these varietals
[SPEAKER_00]: were very distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I think, where we went wrong
with what we did in genetics, where
[SPEAKER_00]: illegalities forced us to make changes in
terms of how we perceive cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because there was a shortage of
cannabis in general, meaning that the open
[SPEAKER_00]: population couldn't access it freely,
whatever you could buy, you would buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what occurred was, I call it a dumbing
down of the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started to really truncate what was
shortened, what was available,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what we used, and how we went about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, like right now,
it's fascinating to have Mowgli on stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: because what he's doing, he's going back
in and taking a look at these varieties on
[SPEAKER_00]: a genetic level, saying, hey, in the
genome itself, what do we see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do these things come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: What traits do they have?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we start to pull the directions
apart and start to take this homogenized
[SPEAKER_00]: mix and start to reseparate it out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because fundamentally, all the cannabis
that came in from these overseas
[SPEAKER_00]: situations was, Justin's working on
Appalachians, but Appalachians are just
[SPEAKER_00]: designations of production zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all cannabis came from designated
production zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what made it unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Jeff is, because I've read his
books, and I enjoy the shit of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's about how cannabis was produced
then organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the relationship between cannabis
in terms of genomic, how it was produced,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it was produced, all contributes to
what we have today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think so much of this direction that
we're trying to go is to figure out,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we go back into this pile,
separate the pile, and figure out how do
[SPEAKER_00]: we put what belongs where, where,
and how do you drive the greatest input
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that when you get into organic
methodologies versus chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: methodologies, a lot of it is a function
of, for one, I don't want to call it
[SPEAKER_00]: ethics, but desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also simplicity, because chemical
systems are favored because it allows you
[SPEAKER_00]: to do a lot of automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't try to knock salt,
guys, but it's not what creates these
[SPEAKER_00]: hyper complex varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The relationship between what's in the
soil, the microbiology, and the indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes from the regions combined with
the unique soil profiles all create that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that for us, so many of us,
as we start to go forward as smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: operators, craft operators, niche
operators, Appalachian operators,
[SPEAKER_00]: organic operators, genomic hunters,
that's the direction we start to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because otherwise what it is is it's
homogenized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Moke said, you're talking about
operations in Canada that are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: heavily funded, huge operations for
extraction, put anything together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem with that is that none of
us can compete with that on an economic
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it fundamentally wipes us out as
operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the direction is to differentiate
yourself from that package.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a process, and it's a difficult
process because it revolves many of us to
[SPEAKER_00]: work together in a collaborative fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the cannabis didn't require
that same collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all in a collusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would all work together to make the
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would all work together to keep our
mouths shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were pretty good about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we didn't have to work together in the
same combined level because we made enough
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of us really were broke if you were
in the weed game.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were, you weren't growing very
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't have been broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean that you were a king or a
queen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just meant that you had adequate
income.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the first time, the money is
what's driving this unity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you start to have the unity come
together, it starts to become cultural
[SPEAKER_00]: spiritual where you start to realize,
hey, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we liked was that relationship that
worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's what's taking
place now is as we start getting into this
[SPEAKER_00]: situation of what it is that we're
creating, why are we creating it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how do we utilize the skill sets and
the tools?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we go back into this time period
where all this beautiful cannabis came
[SPEAKER_00]: into the United States in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would say, well, back to land movement
in 68.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back to land movement in Humboldt was
in 68.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was also these other situations
where they call it Chautauqua,
[SPEAKER_00]: this resurgence, relove for the land,
spiritual awakening, renaissance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you see it all over the New England
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw it in Tennessee, Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have it in pockets of the Midwest,
Colorado, Idaho.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have it on the whole Pacific
Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't just isolated to one region.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these places receive this
incredible genomic packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got material from these countries
that was pretty true breeding in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: that you could basically see what was
going to come out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have mixed packages in terms of
resistance because that's really what
[SPEAKER_00]: broad spectrum cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you would have somewhat of a
consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people started to take those varietals
and then they would start to mix them with
[SPEAKER_00]: other things to work for their situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you started to see some of the first
really good crosses coming out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, that late 70s, early 80s is
really the zenith of American cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: where you had people who were able to work
it fully heavily and they were using
[SPEAKER_00]: organic biology and they were using
sungrown methodologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what it did is it allowed you to
use basically the material that was from
[SPEAKER_00]: these other countries in the same form
that it was grown there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you weren't having to make a radical
change in how we fed it or how we selected
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get into 83, which was really
the beginning of the drug war in full
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always tell people I remember 83
because I got dragged out of high school
[SPEAKER_00]: in handcuffs for cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a turning point for most
individuals because at that time all of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden the enforcement became heavy,
cannabis was driven indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when you started to see these
changes in what was required.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also started to see changes in
what individuals wanted to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because prior to that time period,
we would call cannabis more ethereal,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning more uplifting, more spiritual,
what individuals want to call sativa,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it's all sativa, but mental,
ethereal, uplifting strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world started to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started to see a desire for different
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the advent of indoor cannabis came
along, you needed to have things that
[SPEAKER_00]: flowered on a quicker time frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: You needed stuff that was stockier.
[SPEAKER_00]: People started choosing things that worked
in those capacities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you started to see a lot of these old
varieties get trimmed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first real culling of the
population was in that early 80s where a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the old beautiful land race or
derived from land race taken through
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated variety brought over to here,
held in form, pollinated, worked outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all got culled out because that stuff
didn't work on the indoor methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of a sudden, boom, we get into
indoor methodologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you started seeing the
shorter, broader leaves, stockier,
[SPEAKER_00]: more narcotic cannabis become more in
vogue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just basically run that direction
ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that what I'm involved with
right now is trying to go backwards in
[SPEAKER_00]: time and find things from those golden
eras of cannabis when the varieties had a
[SPEAKER_00]: more diverse effect and you had a much
different amount of things to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that for so many individuals
right now, they're so used to homogenize
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis where if you take a look at it
genomically, you see that there's these
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters, but so much of the cannabis on
the shelf today is really related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically it's, you know, you have 40
cousins you're messing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might as well be in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a problem with that is that it
really, really doesn't allow individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: to have the full range of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does, it doesn't allow you as
cultivators to have a diversity in your
[SPEAKER_00]: own libraries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't allow you to have
differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when everybody's growing the same OG,
it doesn't make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might have the best OG,
but it's still OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the differentiation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And on that point of it is, you know,
how do we utilize these tools that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we take knowledge on organic
methodologies which allow plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: express themselves in a more balanced
form?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you utilize the locations of
Appalachians, which means specific
[SPEAKER_00]: production regions, and optimize that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, how do you get into
genomic mapping?
[SPEAKER_00]: And where is the future of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll throw out the mold for a
second and say, hey, what was the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: why you started mapping cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was it that you saw initially?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then where are we going with it in
that direction?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Kev.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we started mapping it,
we were trying to tell this historical
[SPEAKER_04]: story that you, in a way, just told off
the top of your head.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you knew it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're trying to go back a lot further,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we wanted to know where all the
varieties came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the story begins, like,
you know, it doesn't begin when the stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: shows up here, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it begins in, like, 10,000 years ago
in Central Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the plant followed humans
everywhere around the globe.
[SPEAKER_04]: It literally went everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're starting, we hope we're starting
to be able to piece together the story of
[SPEAKER_04]: how it migrated.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we think it came over to South
America with the conquistadors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, somehow it came up to the
United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there were all these introductions
from China.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's this whole long history of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But throughout that time, these individual
varieties were preserved.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we call those land races because
they... So, I mean, the way that plant
[SPEAKER_04]: evolution happens once humans starts to
mess with it, right, is, like,
[SPEAKER_04]: humans get their hands on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're not breeding,
but they do seed saving, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So for millennia, humans are saving seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're growing this diverse
population in this defined geographical
[SPEAKER_04]: region.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're saving the seeds they like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that exerts a little bit of... It's
not real breeding, but it exerts some
[SPEAKER_04]: selection pressure on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you end up with these, what they call
land races, that, you know, in a certain
[SPEAKER_04]: valley, in somewhere in Afghanistan or
Thailand, for maybe millennia,
[SPEAKER_04]: people have been saving seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the plant has evolved along with the
humans.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a bit different from the wild
variety, but it's also not a cultivated
[SPEAKER_04]: variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't know if people started making
crosses before that stuff started getting
[SPEAKER_04]: imported to the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it may be that in the 50s,
in Thailand, they were making crosses,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was really a cultivated variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just a land race, and it was still
growing semi-wild, and they were just
[SPEAKER_04]: saving seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we find out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we could find out.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we got enough samples from a region,
we can do a thing called molecular clock
[SPEAKER_04]: analysis and figure out how fast it was
evolving and see if there's a signature of
[SPEAKER_04]: human selection pressure on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have enough samples from each
area.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to do that, but we could find
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then the thing is, like, all that
stuff comes here, just like you're saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes here, and bam, it's just all
mixed together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so all those genes are still in the
gene pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all circulating.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we look genetically at the map of
all the cannabis out there, it still seems
[SPEAKER_04]: incredibly diverse.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's thousands and thousands
and thousands and thousands of kinds,
[SPEAKER_04]: but there's a sameness to it because,
like, imagine you put, like, a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: different things in a pot, right,
and they're all different, and you just
[SPEAKER_04]: stir it and stir it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, all that stuff is in there,
but there is a kind of homogeneity to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The great thing about genetics is that
some genes, when you mix them together,
[SPEAKER_04]: they blend, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like, if a tall person and a short
person have a kid, that kid is often of
[SPEAKER_04]: intermediate height.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those genes are, there's a lot of genes
that go into height, and together you end
[SPEAKER_04]: up with something in the middle.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then there are lots of genes,
like blue eyes and brown eyes,
[SPEAKER_04]: they don't blend.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just discrete characters.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they stay, they keep their force.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can stir the pot as long as you
want.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in every generation, that gene is just
like, boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's randomly distributed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's distributed now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in cannabis, we see the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, there are certain features that I
think get blended, but there are other
[SPEAKER_04]: features that they just pop out,
like, they're still there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the stuff, you know, before the
introduction of all the Afghani stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: and correct me if I'm wrong, but,
like, the reason why everything became so
[SPEAKER_04]: sedating, like, that was not a
consumer-driven trend, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, those plants, we had to,
people just had to grow those plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so suddenly consumers are like,
oh, I like this, but that's what there
[SPEAKER_04]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of, kind of, because it was so
powerful at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was such a radically different
experience to smoke these nasty,
[SPEAKER_00]: because at the time, the first Afghanis I
met, I remember messing with were called
[SPEAKER_00]: Mazaris.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were the dark golf balls with the
red hair that just make you sweat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you weren't really used to,
like, something that shook the shit out of
[SPEAKER_00]: you when you smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you'd get lifted and forget what
your name was from ethereal cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'd be like, wow, the colors of the
sky are incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you were smoking really
devastating Afghani, man, you wanted to go
[SPEAKER_00]: home and lay down and go hide in the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd wake up, and your mom would be
wiping your forehead with a rag saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you sick?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd be like, no, I'm really fucking
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it evolved into where people wanted
narcotics, where we were talking one time
[SPEAKER_00]: about, maybe 11, 12 years ago,
we talked about trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone said, OG's a fad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I look at trends and fads with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't understand why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did a random sample of 1,000 people,
because I had a dispensary that I was able
[SPEAKER_00]: to use as my test period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started logging the answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answers on a lot of the heavy
myrcine-based, carafalene-based stuff was
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy sedative, because a tremendous
number of people had opiate issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we started to see over time
was opiate-driven replacement,
[SPEAKER_00]: where if you were on opiates, you could
utilize things that were based in specific
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene categories as a replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other varieties wouldn't work as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, at first, when those Afghanis
came out, they worked well for indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they worked well for a shorter cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think, also, it was such a radical
change in the type of high that you
[SPEAKER_00]: received, that I think that it really
turned people on, where they were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, this is some really, really powerful
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a combination of all those
drivers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those other traits, those traits that
originated with the plants that people
[SPEAKER_04]: tend to call sativa, even though I'm not
going to call it that, those are in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're still circulating in the
population.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as we can tell, some aspects of
those traits are blended.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've hit some kind of like,
they're just being averaged out with the
[SPEAKER_04]: Afghani stuff, which is too bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: But some of them, they just pop out
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are varieties that just have those
aspects.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think they don't have all of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's all these different genes that
need to be recombined to recreate those
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can do that now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can go back.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can turn the clock backwards if we're
really paying attention to what genes we
[SPEAKER_04]: want to put together.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just really hard, complicated work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so right now, we have this soup.
[SPEAKER_04]: But small farmers in California and Oregon
have to differentiate themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way they're going to do it is
they're going to start to take that soup
[SPEAKER_04]: apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're really going to start to
re-differentiate the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to start using real breeding
to really drive towards very specific
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, breeders drive towards a
flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an overarching goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll get certain effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're still just stirring the pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once people start to identify real goals
and they can really differentiate cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: back towards specific kinds that we
originally had or towards kinds that are
[SPEAKER_04]: new combinations, where you're really
combining a whole handful of traits to
[SPEAKER_04]: make a plant that is outrageous in some
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that if you mixed it into the whole
pool, it would all go away.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the differentiation that's going to
make local growers in different
[SPEAKER_04]: Appalachians start to stand out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people in different regions,
they're going to focus on different things
[SPEAKER_04]: like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can get there, where it's like,
wow, in Southern Mendo, they're making
[SPEAKER_04]: plants that remind us of what Panama Red
used to be like.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's going to take a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way we've been breeding now,
it's not going to get us there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think so either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, too, that with what Justin's
doing with the Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to let Justin and Jeff kind
of chew this one up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because really, the impact on the overall
is based off of the plant and its inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so much is the direction of where it's
located.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's feeding it, what's driving
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're seeing this huge, I say,
a renaissance in organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think cannabis drove the renaissance
in organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that for most individuals,
they started to become very aware that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were feeding their plants better than
they were feeding themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they had the disposable
income, they could actually start to
[SPEAKER_00]: create a market at stores where they would
say, hey, I want to go buy these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stores started to cater to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go to places like where I'm
from in Humboldt, there's a lot of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's disproportionate for the
population how much organic selection that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think so much of it wasn't that the
people were so aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was they became aware from the fact
that they were taking better care of their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started to make them realize that the
products that they were purchasing were of
[SPEAKER_00]: lower quality from supermarkets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, there was a demand to
feed this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're starting to see this incredible
desire to hunt out microbes, indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms, where people are starting
to do their own mining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got involved in that maybe,
I say 10, 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 years ago, where I saw these Filipino
guys that had been culturing stuff for 100
[SPEAKER_00]: years, like sourdough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were passing it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started to mine my own microbes
and then tried to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't have the skills to hold it in
that form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with fermentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how that applies to your appellations,
because these appellations have a unique
[SPEAKER_00]: input, the terroir, like Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen Frenchy cannoli?
[SPEAKER_00]: Frenchy's, he almost spits the word out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is that I'm going to let,
if possible, let Jeff and Justin kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: get into what is an appellation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from his definition of it,
because it applies to us in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been used in so many different
words.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully, then Jeff can kick in
about what these inputs are and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: affect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because overall, all of that applies
ultimately to the end quality of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, more than just the end quality
of the product, also the sustainability of
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because to me, I think that, like I said,
I try not to go off on salt-driven
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, it's not sustainable,
because you're creating too much waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're creating waste in the creation of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're doing damage on the usage of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll turn it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I had a pen and paper, because I
had something on all of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing is, for a shout-out to Frenchy,
is all of this is about proving Toa.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like we have a 20-, 50-,
100-year project ahead of us.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we're talking about is hypothetical
and theoretical.
[SPEAKER_07]: And everything that we're doing is
community-driven research.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of us together, putting our knowledge
in the pot and coming up with what the
[SPEAKER_07]: best system is.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that prohibition didn't do us a
service.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's something we're getting
into right now with the Appalachians
[SPEAKER_07]: project.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking to a lot of cultivators up
in Palo Verde and places like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're talking about standards set to
indigenize inoculants, engineer all soil
[SPEAKER_07]: on site.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're getting farmers saying,
well, what about our yields?
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't go in-ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no way.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have smart pots,
raised beds, engineered soils.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is part of our new culture.
[SPEAKER_07]: And really, that's part of a prohibition
culture.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was when we had to maximize the
amount of yield we were getting off of a
[SPEAKER_07]: per-plant basis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the federal government was saying
99-plus plants above 99 or 100 and above
[SPEAKER_07]: is a federal crime.
[SPEAKER_07]: So everyone was like, oh, yeah,
99 and below, the state kind of frowns
[SPEAKER_07]: upon us.
[SPEAKER_07]: So people were like, how do we get the
biggest freaking plant?
[SPEAKER_07]: And how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_07]: We put 800 gallons of soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: We engineer it all.
[SPEAKER_07]: We pump it full of juice, gas,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we get a 5, a 10, a 15.
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone in southern Oregon had a 22-pound
plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: What variety?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was a cookie.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was on a magazine.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was in a big magazine.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like the 22-pounder.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, that's got to be crap.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we were having this conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other day, actually, I think it was
this morning, on a subcommittee call for
[SPEAKER_07]: Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we were talking about in the fields of
Afghanistan, in some of these cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: heritage regions, where you see these
valleys full of dry-farmed, and
[SPEAKER_07]: Afghanistan's dry-farmed, waist-high
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks the opposite.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always like Afghani cooks.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the opposite of these 10,
12-pound monsters that you see in the
[SPEAKER_07]: magazines now with all of us growers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're sitting there with our shirts
saying, yo, we did this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, but what are you really
doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing to the plant?
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing to the genotype?
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that phenotype?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're hunting something that's going to
get bigger, higher yield.
[SPEAKER_07]: But our quality markers aren't set
properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we talk about money.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was getting on the money thing,
and we're all unifying around money.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the fact of the matter is it's like,
now we're going to be getting into this
[SPEAKER_07]: place where genetics are going to be bred,
where you're going to have this
[SPEAKER_07]: homogenized crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Going out into the open to grow 500 acres
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's our responsibility now to say,
how is that cannabis grown?
[SPEAKER_07]: Where was it grown?
[SPEAKER_07]: In soil?
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the marine layer condition?
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the altitude?
[SPEAKER_07]: What did we do to not only indigenize the
inoculants, but to actually co-evolve that
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivar to the soil and to the climactic
conditions over decades?
[SPEAKER_07]: And how is it going to express itself
fully in that region?
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are looking at now profile testing,
terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now everybody's talking about what's a
terp count?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every day there's another cannabinoid
compound that's coming out in reaction to
[SPEAKER_07]: another terpene, and now everyone's
seeking that medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that medicine is actually regionally
specific.
[SPEAKER_07]: The different heritage strains,
we call heritage, let's say 50 years,
[SPEAKER_07]: selected to breed that quality,
that trichome development.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like Appalachian's development
right now is going to be talking about
[SPEAKER_07]: quality medicine development.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to be seeking strains,
and we're going to be seeking cultivars
[SPEAKER_07]: from these regions because they were able
to express themselves fully in that region
[SPEAKER_07]: and have full profile developments.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's done, I do believe,
in the mineral content of the soil with
[SPEAKER_07]: that marine layer condition, with that
altitude.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we see it, in Spiroc, I watch some of
the world's best sour diesel being grown.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would never, for the love of me,
grow that sour diesel in Navarro.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like shitty.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I watch my friends and neighbors do it
every year and throw away half their crop
[SPEAKER_07]: because it's market driven.
[SPEAKER_07]: They want something that's like high
potency.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we need to start having this
conversation about quality and these
[SPEAKER_07]: quality markers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that what you're doing,
Mowgli, is really important because that
[SPEAKER_07]: cellular capture, that data capture,
to tell us like, okay, that's a marker.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what that plant expressed itself in
that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the genotype that we're seeking for
that region.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we need to match that with the
region and use that as IP protections and
[SPEAKER_07]: go ahead and claim it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of where we're going in the
Appalachian space with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think the conversation needs to be
about unifying around markers of quality,
[SPEAKER_07]: like indoor, mixed light, Appalachian,
terpene, cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are we looking for to come out of the
strain so that the consumer market can
[SPEAKER_07]: start to differentiate the actual product
that we're consuming?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, a couple of things first.
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems to me that we need to recognize
why we're here and why we're really
[SPEAKER_09]: talking about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think if I say Coca-Cola,
Pepsi-Cola, Scott's Miracle Grow,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, you get the idea.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going to happen is this Canadian
situation.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have a big company of
Pepsi-Cola, Coca-Cola.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to want one kind of cannabis
because that's what they want in their
[SPEAKER_09]: standardized drink.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe they'll have three different drinks,
but they won't have very many more than
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, if we're not careful,
then we're going to be forced to grow for
[SPEAKER_09]: them.
[SPEAKER_09]: What we want to do, is grow for
individuals.
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to stay in business without having
to merge with a gigantic company.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't necessarily want to merge with
each other.
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to continue to do our thing
individually and share our information and
[SPEAKER_09]: make sure that we're not cut out of this
business by the industry that is clearly
[SPEAKER_09]: forming.
[SPEAKER_09]: No question about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Number two, we want to make sure that we
don't continue to allow the government to
[SPEAKER_09]: fuck us over as we do this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I mean this in a couple of different
ways.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why we allow in Alaska, you know,
they say, you don't have to test your
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course you should.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're selling a product that people are
ingesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, whether you're organic or not,
people need to know what's on their
[SPEAKER_09]: product.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and so we got to make sure that
the government does what we want them to
[SPEAKER_09]: do not what these new regulators want to
do so that they can keep their jobs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And those two things, I think,
are the backdrop that you got to keep in
[SPEAKER_09]: mind when you ask the question,
which I think we're all trying to ask,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is, I put it in this way,
can you grow Durban poison in Anchorage,
[SPEAKER_09]: Alaska?
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to grow Durban poison in Anchorage,
Alaska.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I really do it?
[SPEAKER_09]: And to me, based upon the books that I've
written and the stuff that I've read,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, read from your company and
others, there are three legs to the stool.
[SPEAKER_09]: The first is genetics.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you don't have the Durban poison
genetics, you're not going to have Durban
[SPEAKER_09]: poison.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have to figure out what the Durban
poison genetics really are.
[SPEAKER_09]: The second is the soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that's in theory my expertise.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no question that the soil has a
direct impact on all of the things that go
[SPEAKER_09]: on inside the plant for the various
reasons that are in all three of my books.
[SPEAKER_09]: But not the least of which is that you've
got bacteria and fungi that are
[SPEAKER_09]: responsible for feeding the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, they in turn are impacted by
microarthropods, nematodes, and protozoa.
[SPEAKER_09]: But all of those things together are what
help make up your appellation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you got the Durban poison genes,
then what you want to try to do is make
[SPEAKER_09]: sure that you've got soil that mimics the
Durban soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you need to figure out, and I'm sure
we're going to end up in a situation where
[SPEAKER_09]: in addition to doing the genotypes and
figuring out what the DNA is, we're going
[SPEAKER_09]: to have books that are going to be able to
say, and this is what the soil is like.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what the microbiology is like.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what the biomass of the soil is
like in that area.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you talk to Dr. Elaine Ingham,
she will tell you you need slightly more
[SPEAKER_09]: fungal than bacterial.
[SPEAKER_09]: She will tell you that you need certain
kinds of protozoa over other protozoa.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all of this stuff is important,
and we're not getting it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You should be getting it, and I think
you're beginning to pick up a little bit
[SPEAKER_09]: of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we need to make sure that we're all
sharing this information and figuring out
[SPEAKER_09]: what it really is.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the third leg, from my
perspective, is light, sunlight.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Sin, are you here?
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, if we can just for two seconds,
maybe while Sin sets this up.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you don't have the sunlight from
South Africa, you can't really grow the
[SPEAKER_09]: Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we concentrate on soil, because that's
what the grape growers do.
[SPEAKER_09]: But in cannabis, it's the light as much as
anything that causes the soil microbes to
[SPEAKER_09]: act the way they act, and of course the
plant to act the way it acts.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've got a situation where we used to
grow outdoors, and we had sunlight,
[SPEAKER_09]: and then the prohibition came and they
pushed us indoors.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we've got a lot of people who are
still growing indoors, and the industry
[SPEAKER_09]: seems to be coming to the conclusion that
if they grow indoors using sunlight as
[SPEAKER_09]: well, that they're going to benefit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know where the little grower fits
in in that scenario, but we've got to
[SPEAKER_09]: learn the differences between the lights
that Scott's Miracle Grow wants you to
[SPEAKER_09]: buy, because they bought the company,
and okay they're going to push it,
[SPEAKER_09]: and they're going to advertise it,
and they don't give a shit if it doesn't
[SPEAKER_09]: do a couple of the things that you really
need it to do, because they bought the
[SPEAKER_09]: company, and they need to be making money.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or we can develop our own projects,
which is what this fellow over here has
[SPEAKER_09]: done.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you may never have heard of a plasma
light, but what Sin is about to show you
[SPEAKER_09]: is the sun in a little teeny light that he
can pick up with one hand, and he can
[SPEAKER_09]: change the gas that's inside this lamp,
and he can change that gas in many
[SPEAKER_09]: different ways to create the sun that you
want.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we went to NASA to talk to him about
the potential of growing food using this
[SPEAKER_09]: light.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you want to grow South African
cannabis in Anchorage, Alaska,
[SPEAKER_09]: you set the light to the wavelengths,
which are all available by the way,
[SPEAKER_09]: so that you can duplicate the same kind of
light that's in South Africa.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now none of this stuff makes any sense
unless you know what the genetics are.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it always starts with the genetics,
which is why, you know, the Philos
[SPEAKER_09]: Bioscience project is really so key.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think you would agree that the
genetics are influenced by sunlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean I know they matter, but do they
matter as much or more?
[SPEAKER_02]: The same cuts from the same moms,
you take them nationwide, the expression
[SPEAKER_02]: of those is going to be based on their
environment, not just the genetics.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right, but the question is,
and I agree with you, I think you're
[SPEAKER_09]: absolutely correct, but if you are able to
control with better precision the other
[SPEAKER_09]: actions, then you have less of an
influence by the epigenetic stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is not necessarily bad, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree, I understand, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Say you go down to Humboldt, you get a lot
of soil from one of the valleys there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you bring it up to Alaska.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you plant an OG in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you turn on the plasma light and
you dial it in so that it has the same
[SPEAKER_04]: light at the latitude and longitude where
you took that soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should that plant then be eligible for the
Humboldt Appalachian?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the question I was going to ask.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think it's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's an interesting
question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's millions of years of
co-evolution of that soil's relationship
[SPEAKER_07]: to the entire environment, not just the
sun.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you haven't been growing the cannabis
for millions of years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not about the cannabis, it's about
protecting the earth.
Right?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're also, this IP protects the earth in
which we stand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't just about, we are using
cannabis genetics to find out this
[SPEAKER_07]: metabolomic capture.
[SPEAKER_07]: But once we capture and use a sensational
nature that we have, this stage that we
[SPEAKER_07]: have right now, we can protect genetics
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_07]: But not just the genetics, the humans that
live in co-evolution with those genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: Indigenous tribes all over the world,
need these protections as well do their
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so if we start manipulating that and
start shifting that, and then it's not
[SPEAKER_07]: just shifting the genetics, it's shifting
the policies that those genetics protect.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we start shifting the policies that
protect the people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, capitalism won.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would agree that the biggest- Wait,
wait, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_09]: Before you answer, let me just answer your
question in a slightly different way.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you take Alaskan soil, because this is
what I've done.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you take Alaskan soil down to Hawaii,
you can grow a giant cabbage.
[SPEAKER_09]: The giant cabbages that we grow in Alaska
is soil-based.
[SPEAKER_09]: I live in Anchorage.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't grow those giant cabbages in
Anchorage.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasilla, where they grow them,
Palmer, is 40 minutes away.
[SPEAKER_09]: The difference is the soil.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you bring that soil from Wasilla into
Anchorage, you can grow the giant cabbage.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can't grow the giant cabbage
without that soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in a way- It's the same genetics,
the same conditions.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the same expression.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why we need that capture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we need that capture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was involved in LED development probably
a decade ago with a company where
[SPEAKER_00]: Heliospector came in and said,
we want to do LED development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, none of the Europeans
could touch cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they used my facility to do all the R
&D, and then they would ship all these
[SPEAKER_00]: light scientists in from all over the
world to do the tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would run standardized testing where
we would hold one under what we knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew the cultivar, I would put it
under the traditional HBS.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would then run the Heliospectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we couldn't get the stuff to shine the
way we wanted to until I took them up the
[SPEAKER_00]: hill, and we started to measure the sun
coming off of my farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that started to let them get a better
baseline of what was desired for that
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from what you're saying is,
yeah, the soil microbes from that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if we move it, does it create a
sameness?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that Justin's right in terms
of the overall picture's too big to
[SPEAKER_00]: capture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't capture an appellation by
just microbials or just sunlight because
[SPEAKER_00]: it has to be the entire environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though we don't have cannabis
appellation, so to speak, because none of
[SPEAKER_00]: us have 60 years minimum of genetic
manipulation where we've got genomic forms
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been developed for at least 60
year period, which is typically like a
[SPEAKER_00]: standard in appellations, we don't have
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is that, we always had that
theory of if you wanted to grow good
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian, because I knew that the
Hawaiian, the same thing was when I was in
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaii and I was consuming some of this
Killa High Mountain Hawaiian, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: really Southeast Asian varietals,
it was so nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we grew it in Humboldt,
even if we had the ability to protect it
[SPEAKER_00]: for the longer season, it didn't have the
same flavonoid profiles and the high was
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we knew that it was soil biology
that was driving it, but we didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to replicate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't knowledgeable enough at the
time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, you're right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And all of these things make a difference.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the question is, I live in Anchorage,
Alaska, and I'm gonna go down,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, right now I can't go down to
California to buy my Durban poison from
[SPEAKER_09]: you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I gotta grow in Anchorage, Alaska.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, if we end up with a wrong kind of
regulatory system, i.e.
[SPEAKER_09]: they're gonna let states make a
determination, in some states you'll be
[SPEAKER_09]: able to do it and some you won't.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that presents the sort of the problem
that a wine industry doesn't have.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you can ship anywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: But is it responsible?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's a whole other question.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the question we have to ask as
consumers.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, is it responsible to put that
weight on the earth because we want
[SPEAKER_07]: something?
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we need something, is it better for
us to go where that something is already?
[SPEAKER_00]: For Appalachians in NorCal, you're gonna
see incredibly diminished amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that can be grown based off of
watershed availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've already controlled the water
flow pretty good, but over the next couple
[SPEAKER_00]: years, they're gonna go at all these
watersheds heavily and start to determine,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's kind of arbitrary because no one
really knows, consumptive, how much waters
[SPEAKER_00]: are actually in the ground to suck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're gonna start to change how much
you can actually cultivate in your
[SPEAKER_00]: watershed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much cannabis can be created,
which is terrifying for a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller people, but they don't understand
that scarcity creates value, just like
[SPEAKER_00]: scarcity creates a value of an antiquity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sand is pretty old, but it's not valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get something that has a scarcity,
there's a value, and I think that as we go
[SPEAKER_00]: forward...
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ship it as you go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, even within these limited
markets, for the individuals that are able
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce certain batch lots that are
less, it'll be clearly defined from... I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at operations right now that are
talking about doing 200,000 pounds a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm talking to guys that are putting in
that OPSA that are looking at... That's a
[SPEAKER_00]: credible amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: 200,000 pounds off of a single operation
is frightening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And doesn't sound like scarcity.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the thing is that with the
Appalachian situations that he's talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, it's not just geographical zones,
but it'll be compressed because the state
[SPEAKER_00]: is gonna compress it through water usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're gonna see a lot less
produced in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in these specific regions,
once we are able to use genomics and
[SPEAKER_00]: understand microbiology to a degree that
lets us tailor what we're really trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: do, I think then you'll have a
differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really have it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think right now what you have is a
basket of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's just grabbing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really have this upper shelf and
this lower shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all kind of just what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everybody's growing the same weed all
over the state, and we're all saying we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing some unbelievable job with it,
how can you really compare that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be these unique forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this situation... And I'm sure
there's people here that are doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: larger operations, and it's not meant to
exclude them at all because those larger
[SPEAKER_00]: operations, they'll use the same
information because they're gonna use
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology to increase resistance,
and they're gonna use genetic modeling,
[SPEAKER_00]: sifting, marking, and selection to be able
to improve what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Appalachian regions are where
they produce these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're within those regions and they
follow suit, or they have an investment in
[SPEAKER_00]: one of these, it'll diversify their
portfolio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter what size you are,
the conversation still really applies.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's hilarious that in Humboldt
County, they're talking about water
[SPEAKER_07]: rationing, and in Siskiyou County,
they're building tunnels to ship water to
[SPEAKER_07]: the desert, and they're stealing water.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to grow a bunch of
cannabis, move to the desert.
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes absolutely no sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Less political.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Humboldt County, your water guys are
going around to farms and to large-scale
[SPEAKER_07]: industrial facilities, soil guys,
and getting them to double their water
[SPEAKER_07]: count so they can keep the water in
Humboldt because there's people already
[SPEAKER_07]: shopping for your water to ship it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we got a water mill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this isn't about cannabis,
but it kind of is, is that there's a lake
[SPEAKER_00]: called Ruth Lake, and it was designed to
feed a mill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this giant mill facility asked me if I
wanted to put a major nursery operation
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I toured the whole facility,
it was a super fun site, and I just knew,
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, there's no way you can get this
thing clean enough to really do any work,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's just not the right location for
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing that made it attractive was
they have a couple million gallons a day
[SPEAKER_00]: of water flowing from the dam into this
facility that's just flowing out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: ocean, and if they can't find a user for
the facility, they're gonna have to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: the water to someone else versus just
re-divert it back into the river.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fundamentally, you know, when it comes
to these appellations and it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: water use, it's political because when
you're putting in, you know, unbelievable
[SPEAKER_00]: operations in the high desert,
high desert's defined by less than 10
[SPEAKER_00]: inches of rain a year, so if you're gonna
call it high desert, then that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: what it means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we should be popping around
70 to 80 inches of an Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a phenomenal amount of water,
but they're gonna limit us tremendously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on a very protected watershed,
but the watershed emanates from my
[SPEAKER_00]: property, so it gives me a chance to work,
and what I'll do is I'll work a canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: size that lets me get to a level that's
allowable, because really, you can't beat
[SPEAKER_00]: them right off the bat, and that's why
it's important for a lot of the smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: operators to say, listen, if I only have
10,000 square foot at best, 5,000 square
[SPEAKER_00]: foot, then how do you work in conjunction
with other operators in your watersheds,
[SPEAKER_00]: in your directions, to find out,
you know, what kind of biology systems do
[SPEAKER_00]: you utilize?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like what Molly was saying,
which she's been saying for a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that you guys gotta get together and
team up and work on these projects
[SPEAKER_00]: together so that you have the resources to
be able to actually function, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the cost of cannabis production
right now, which is unbelievable for the
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller operator to actually function on,
this teamwork is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, as we go forward, man,
it's imperative that a lot of this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: gets brought out, but the conversation of
can you grow Durban in Alaska,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had the similar ideas of can you repeat
the experience of the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: because what I knew was from me traveling
all over the world and smoking weed from
[SPEAKER_00]: all these places, no matter how much we
grew back at home, it wasn't the same
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we knew that the light was different,
but I didn't understand that light just
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't energy, light was information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I started to really mess with the
light scientist, I started to find out
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's information, and if we change
the spectra, we can make a plant flower
[SPEAKER_00]: under full 24 hour lighting, we can make a
plant not flower, we can make it elongate,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can change its shape, we can change its
profile, we can change soil uptake,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can change what microbial counts and
how they function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so much of that is just knowledge that
we're learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the problem is that what we
use is we use lab metrics to determine
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one of the issues is that
you're using total turps, total potency,
[SPEAKER_00]: this cannabinoid, that cannabinoid,
and the fact is that it's all in a
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you start to say if it isn't
above 22% THC, it's not top shelf,
[SPEAKER_00]: it instantly knocks out all these
varieties that are seven and eights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was talking to a Colombian,
that's a Colombian collector out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia, so he's able to collect all the
South American varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he and I have to use Google Translate
to talk, but for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is that he's a collector,
he's an older guy in Colombia who collects
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colombia, and what he was saying is
hey, the only reason why you guys aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the effect you want off of these
varieties is because you're muddied with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Afghani cannabis that you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said it basically muddied you up and
you need to cleanse your system,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you'll get back to being able to
experience the effects you want off these
[SPEAKER_00]: seven and eight percent strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always look at the total turps as
irrelevant because it's what terpenes are
[SPEAKER_00]: present, not the total concentration of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I don't like stuff I always jam
on terpenator, because I call it
[SPEAKER_00]: homogenator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes everything taste the goddamn
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm glad it has hot numbers,
but it's homogenized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of this is trying to get the
market to understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just got jammed by someone on plants
that I submitted to a competition of why
[SPEAKER_00]: did I submit this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said because I want the competitors to
be able to sell the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I give them something like some
Laos that I'm messing around with right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, from Laos or from Nepal, for one,
it's going to have lower numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not going to move on the shelf
because of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, wait, wait, you're saying the lower,
you know, the lower numbers, this industry
[SPEAKER_09]: in particular has never said these words
to people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whenever I say to them, they go,
gee, you're right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Low number, just take another hit for
God's sake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they see it as an economic concern,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: For someone who owns dispensaries,
someone who actually owns stores for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time, you have to gently educate them
and say, listen, just because it says this
[SPEAKER_00]: number doesn't mean you're going to get to
smoke less, because it doesn't really,
[SPEAKER_00]: it isn't true.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers don't dictate the reality,
but they dictate an economic reality,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like terpene numbers do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had a friend that had a 5.6%
Terps, and I showed him a 2% 2.2 Terp
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, and the 2.2 was volatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we did, we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it to ourselves, but the problem is
we have to undo it, because what we've
[SPEAKER_00]: done is we've created a situation where
the diversity is almost impossible to put
[SPEAKER_00]: out if it isn't at these tremendous levels
of numerics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm somebody who breeds things to go
into heavy numerics, where I chase these
[SPEAKER_00]: upper 30s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them in because it's marketability,
and I tell people why I'm doing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not my entire project,
it's just that when you want to make money
[SPEAKER_00]: in modern cannabis, and you need to,
or you're going to go broke, that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: better have hot numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't mean it's better,
and it doesn't mean that it's going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: you higher, and it doesn't mean it's going
to be a better experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the market is obsessed with it,
and even the ranking systems coming in
[SPEAKER_00]: through some of these farmer federations
are trying to quantify the same thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: that a top-shelf five-star is over 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reality is I think that we really
have to have an educational system come
[SPEAKER_00]: into play so that the users start to
understand that the metrics are something
[SPEAKER_00]: you look at after the fact, not first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at the numbers after and say,
hey, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the unique terpene profile that
made this happen, perhaps, and these are
[SPEAKER_00]: these interesting cannabinoids that I'm
experiencing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it starts to allow you to see
patterns, and those patterns let you find
[SPEAKER_00]: other varietals that are similar so that
you have a better range of choices,
[SPEAKER_00]: because in these limited production
models, you won't be able to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: dispersed throughout the whole state.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff should have gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just going to ask specifically,
do you still mess with the 78,
[SPEAKER_07]: the 6 cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I still mess.
[SPEAKER_07]: Five years ago, we were talking about they
had to recalibrate the machine for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The highest CBD-dominant overall
cannabinoid strain ever found.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was like 16963, and it was an OG.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I made great hash out of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Frenchy made great hash out of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all smoked it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a very cerebral experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kept on going back for more.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was our little strain, and it was my
favorite thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the Madrone picked it up,
and those guys had been running with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, there is a market for it for
that full profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the ratio on that?
[SPEAKER_07]: 16963 was mine.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was 169 on the CBD and a 63 on the THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was an OG.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a 78.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was a number 6.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was a 6 or 8 cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 6, the 8 phenome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a 10 phenome that the 10 cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes out at around 19.8 and then
like 10.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we did that, I think I had a
combined cannabinoid of maybe like 33.5,
[SPEAKER_00]: which at the time had never been seen in a
CBD-dominant cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, the thing is I got lucky in that when
Labs came out, I was one of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: people that was playing around with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got access to Labs quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understood how to use the tool to
let me see inside so I could steer
[SPEAKER_00]: directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those directions are where we drove
CBD in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was my crew in Arcata went through
the cannatonics and then Ringo went
[SPEAKER_00]: through Ringo's line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was the basis of all CBD material
you have in America today came out of
[SPEAKER_00]: those projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wasn't caught up with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me with the CBD work, once I found
cultivars and had a variety of them that
[SPEAKER_00]: had certain ratios, what I did is I just
put them into the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was more driven into what I would call
recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I used my predicated work to steer
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I could get these jammed
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what it did was it let us move
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it let me put cuttings into hands
of farmers that could then make money
[SPEAKER_00]: moving those pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of it was to explain to the
public at the same time, these are numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: that you use to sell, but this is an 11%
that you want to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we would give the education.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, you got to sell the weed in order
to stay in business.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let me make the suggestion next time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I have a dispensary in Oregon that
does this.
[SPEAKER_09]: So most of the weed in Oregon has now
gotten really cheap.
[SPEAKER_09]: This stuff he sells for $25 a gram.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got low numbers.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's killer weed, but it's got low
numbers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of putting the numbers down,
it's the price people look at.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so he's charging $25 a gram for
something that by numbers, people might
[SPEAKER_09]: pay $6 for.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he can't keep it on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: The numbers are right on the product
though now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see Oregon's different than
California, where Oregon still allows you
[SPEAKER_00]: to smell the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon still lets you open the jar.
[SPEAKER_09]: California.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what I mean by we can't let the
government in California say you're not
[SPEAKER_09]: allowed to do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on, what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_09]: This is our industry, not your industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let us do what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's not going to kill anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think to me, that's fundamentally tax
base.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so much they're afraid you're
going to smell it, but they're afraid that
[SPEAKER_00]: a little nugget might fall out of that
open container into someone's hand for
[SPEAKER_00]: free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to do a lot of giveaways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was involved in a tremendous amount of
free CBD, where I've never sold any CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've been in the industry forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been in dispensary operations now
for probably almost 11 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the 11 years, I've never sold any
CBD material.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you came to me for CBD material,
you got it for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was probably about 120,000 free
clones that went through on books,
[SPEAKER_00]: another 30,000 that we kicked on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe 150,000 clones I kicked out for
free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then probably another ungodly amount
of tinctures, RSO, and all these other
[SPEAKER_00]: components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there was a greater good that was
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we knew that that was going to come to
an end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we kind of went at it so
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we knew at some point in time,
there's no way anybody was going to allow
[SPEAKER_00]: us to do this much charity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just knew it was coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the problem is that you want
to fight the government on this crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fundamentally, you need to have the
finances to survive long enough to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've done such a good job by
limiting what one can do and how one does
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think so many people right now are
just financially crippled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really stop in any kind of battle
to where you have to work with these
[SPEAKER_00]: realities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think part of the reality is have
varietals that you can use as attractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then create the awareness of what is
an experience of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we quantify it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does one just want to get affected?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does one want a quality of effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the new individuals that are
coming in that you'll be able to start to
[SPEAKER_00]: give this information to because they
don't have a back history.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing is those individuals aren't
coming in in the way they should be
[SPEAKER_04]: because of this feedback loop between the
money and the high numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's a little bit caught in this
trap that is a side effect of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone's making moonshine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And moonshine is an artifact of
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want that high potency stuff for
storage and transport because shit is
[SPEAKER_04]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when prohibition goes away,
an industry is supposed to evolve into
[SPEAKER_04]: variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're supposed to start making pinot
grigio that civilians can appreciate.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have this existing market base that
will pay for stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's all this financial pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's gluts on the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody just wants to, it's just
this very short term thinking like I gotta
[SPEAKER_04]: hit 30 so I can move stuff because
otherwise I'm gonna die.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're still, it's like we're acting
like we're still in prohibition.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one's willing to take the leap to make
plants that smell outrageous.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're incredibly low numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can bring them and you can smoke
them at Thanksgiving with your whole
[SPEAKER_04]: family and all the old people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's just thousands and thousands
of people that aren't coming into shops.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know dispensary owners who wanna
start bringing in those people.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they can't because they're like,
I'm not gonna carry that stuff on my shelf
[SPEAKER_04]: because it doesn't move.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't move because they won't
carry it on their shelves and they won't
[SPEAKER_04]: market it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so everyone's in this financial jam
selling to these 200,000 consumers who
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke all the cannabis and only want
numbers in the 30s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like we're on this wheel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like we have to take a second and get
off the wheel and look at the fact that
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody would like to smoke some pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just have to make it for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: The flower market could learn a lot from
the low dose edible market right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the edibles have figured this out
way before.
[SPEAKER_07]: The edibles figured it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't tell you how many like 45 to 60
year old women or gentlemen are 2.5 or.
[SPEAKER_07]: 3 milligram dose.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't get down to 2.5 till like last
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took it till last year for anyone to
get under five.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's so funny because you look at
these like ladies at like concerts and
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff like that with their little kiva
tins.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they pull out the little kiva tin and
they take one little bean and they're
[SPEAKER_07]: like, would you like one?
[SPEAKER_07]: They're microdosing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, yeah, they're microdosing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what they'd really like to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: They like to take out a little pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like 4% and just be like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, so I smoke 12 to 14.
[SPEAKER_07]: I smoke 12 to 14.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so like in founding the exchange and
many other markets, I've always grown.
[SPEAKER_07]: I worked with Equilibrium, grown African
based sativas.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: And pineapple, because I'm from a
pineapple region, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like I like smoking in the pines.
[SPEAKER_07]: A good in the pines is between like around
14%.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I smoke that in the pines,
or at least Derek's cut, I smoke that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm having a great time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to do my taxes.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I smoke the Afghani, I want to run from
my taxes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's like hiding up in my mom's
bed with like sweating and all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But so the idea that there is that market
is emerging.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when I smoke at like an exchange and
somebody comes to me for a higher dose,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I smoke a pineapple or I smoke a
Malawi or something, they feel like almost
[SPEAKER_07]: they're having a psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're actually having fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're enjoying themselves on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, this is great.
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you put in this?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I use my girl as I call it like my
weed guinea pig for what I call the lower
[SPEAKER_00]: octane strains, because everything that I
was smoking was too strong for her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went through a couple of years of
sifting period where I was able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into some of the mean jeans lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to pull out this beautiful
cherry back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bred into it and pulled out maybe
something that comes around like 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a really rich quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flavor is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for people who smoke it, it's
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbelievably satisfying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm telling you, put that stuff on the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sits there because of the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has to be some system that comes
where you start to have the ability to get
[SPEAKER_00]: people to come in and actually experience
cannabis and then see the numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it cannabis light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we just don't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is you're competing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're competing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The marketing part's hard because you're
having to compete with people that have
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Emerald Exchange and events like you
used to do was that it allowed you to have
[SPEAKER_00]: people come and actually be present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it lets you now have cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the problem with all the
cultivation where the farmers can't sell
[SPEAKER_00]: direct, the farmers can't have tastings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do it illicitly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is that's not going to
allow you any kind of real penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you had that, then what you could
do is you could have a real diversity in
[SPEAKER_00]: your lines where you had a true gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the gradients can be based off of
potency gradients and also how you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: from the varietal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's based off of terpene
relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'd be able to have true
gradients that matched what you wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: release from your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would have things that would
satisfy people who wanted more broad-based
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff up to peel the top of your skull.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people like that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't throw rocks at anybody what
they like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like THC isolate, where they
want that stuff at 99%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what they like.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, let's make that also.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it all has to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that traditionally that's been
the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why someone asked me,
they said, why did you chase such high THC
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties for so long and develop males to
throw those numbers on other plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, because it sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it allowed individuals to be able to
have sellable varieties which kept them in
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we have to redo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like back in the day, I used to go
hunt varietals that had low scent
[SPEAKER_00]: signatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people say, why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, because I'm somebody who was here
before charcoal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before charcoal technology came out,
you'd have a full pair of balls to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: dope illegally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or otherwise, you'd be about to have a
heart attack when you pulled into your
[SPEAKER_00]: driveway and the whole neighborhood
reeked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were looking to catch in a felony
case and go into prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would hunt varietals that had low
scent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it allowed us to cultivate and move.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I mean, by the time I'm done with
this, we end up snuffing out a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was a function of illegality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is so upsetting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to say, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think I'm digging it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my own library of stuff I would keep
because I was somebody that was basically
[SPEAKER_00]: a lunatic, so I could handle the risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pretty ballsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the clients that I built
operations for, that wasn't the case for
[SPEAKER_00]: all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for these people that wanted to
cultivate cannabis in the early 90s,
[SPEAKER_00]: when the indoor was really taken off,
and charcoal wasn't present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was using high tech ozone at the
time to where I could blow the ducts of a
[SPEAKER_00]: building clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But regular people didn't have access to
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was really a function of what
could you cultivate and grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we would have things that were
higher level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all this stuff that gets us here is
all a result of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why, for me, I'm trying to go
back in time and mine the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the libraries that we held for so
much of us have got taken in raids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So between raids and armed robberies,
we've lost a tremendous amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: genealogical material.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's how it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could lament the story, but it is what
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's trying to move forward from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I give people the
background on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I explained to them, look,
this is why I chase the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is why I'm trying to expose you
to an 11% varietal.
[SPEAKER_04]: My position lets me do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But listen, everybody's fighting for their
lives now, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think people are taking this
seriously.
[SPEAKER_04]: The massive farms and the companies that
are just after oil, just after THC,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're just cannabinoid production
companies, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we stay in this market where we're
chasing numbers in the 30s for THC,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we're making oil in the 90s,
it's like, I'm going to have a little
[SPEAKER_04]: farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to compete with Big Ag,
who's growing fields of THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't compete in the THC market.
[SPEAKER_04]: The THC market, the high THC market,
is now kind of gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're going to have Appalachians,
if we're going to have small farms that
[SPEAKER_04]: survive, a ton of THC is just not where
they're going to compete.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to find other niches.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not just because I want to smoke
that stuff and because it'll bring in
[SPEAKER_04]: other customers who are interested.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that that thing that was
prohibited in prohibition, big companies
[SPEAKER_04]: are taking that now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that should not be our job anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the question is, how do we get there?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can see a couple of different ways.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, one, the work that you're doing,
I don't know how it shows up on a string.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when I go and buy a Durban poison,
then I know that's really Durban poison,
[SPEAKER_09]: because you said the DNAs would,
you know, is there a stamp that's going to
[SPEAKER_09]: be developed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's a stamp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And listen, if I was in Alaska and I
wanted to grow Durban poison, I would go
[SPEAKER_04]: to Humboldt or I would go to South Africa
and I would get the right soil and I would
[SPEAKER_04]: get the Durban poison and I would go to
Alaska and I would grow it in that local
[SPEAKER_04]: soil and I would put the magic light over
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would dial the light in until it was
like the right latitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wouldn't try to get the Appalachian
Durban poison, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the reason for the Appalachians,
like you're not protecting the IP around
[SPEAKER_04]: the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: The soil is the IP.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're protecting their local soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you couldn't get an Appalachian around
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we're doing in Appalachian
development is experience driven,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like come experience the cultural
heritage of the region as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it means like we're diversifying.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, a lot of us up there,
you know, we was back to the Landers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're economic refugees.
[SPEAKER_07]: We came up there for a simpler way of
life.
[SPEAKER_07]: We like to build our own shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like this is what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to share that with the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to share our permaculture
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to share our strain development
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to share the history heritage.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to feed you, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we want all of these things and
that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, at the end of the day,
we're not in the same market as these
[SPEAKER_07]: guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not worried about Big Agra coming in
and ruining our region because at the end
[SPEAKER_07]: of the day, I mean, we're capped at 10,000
square feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're geographically isolated to a
point with why would Big Ag?
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're organic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beyond organic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's why would we, why would Big Ag
want to go two and a half hours on the
[SPEAKER_07]: backside of fucking Iron Peak,
you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: To get a 10,000 square foot grow for a
commodities market.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't even make sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But can you survive selling your flower to
your neighbors?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that is where, no, it's not to our
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, in initiatives and I don't
like self promotion or whatever,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's like the initiatives of micro
branding your brands.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are taking, it's micro branding.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we take small brands, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: We take people out of the hills.
[SPEAKER_07]: We incentivize them to start off in the
branding space.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now there's an evolution to that,
which is cooperatives, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So they start off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone wants to be king of the hill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone wants to be king of the castle.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did it the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do it the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am the best.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then all of a sudden they realize
they're like, Hey, can you sell my weed?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and it's like, they're starting
to depend on their neighbors again,
[SPEAKER_07]: like they always have.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the cooperative forms.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now the cooperative may be a series of
micro brands acting as multiple.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're seeing that with true humble,
but still has a little monikers on or the
[SPEAKER_07]: little tags for each one of the farms or
Arcana.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone wants their own three sisters,
all these different things.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, now we've got a Emerald groans
coming out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're, you know, they're going to be a
ton of micro brands, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: but then you have Flo Khana, which started
out, Hey, we're going to be a bunch of
[SPEAKER_07]: micro brands.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, well, maybe we're going
to be one big brand.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so then you have a co-operative,
an agriculture cooperative that shows up
[SPEAKER_07]: like Flo Khana.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then you have this one big brand of
weed called Flo Khana goes out onto the
[SPEAKER_07]: shelves.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have, you know, small micro brands,
micro brands acting as a cooperative.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you have larger cooperatives of
farmers acting as a single brand.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's it follows the coffee model.
[SPEAKER_07]: It follows the wine model.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, but the appellation of origin and
the control and the governance behind the
[SPEAKER_07]: IP protections for each one of these
regions actually gets to dictate the
[SPEAKER_07]: standards of quality in which they are
allowed to grow in that region.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they, they actually make their own
rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: The state doesn't handle a set of rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been with CDFA now for three weeks
traveling around the state.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw you up in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's like, we were just out in
Palm desert, Palm desert said,
[SPEAKER_07]: we're not going to be an appellation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, good, cause you're doing it on
stolen water.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's like, they don't want it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, but the idea is they have,
they want a geographical indication,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Grown in the desert, not of the desert.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause they're not grown of the desert,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So these AOCs that are forming,
these collectives, these cooperatives that
[SPEAKER_07]: set their own rules, that set their own
standards themselves get to govern it.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an attractive, you know,
this is a proposition to a consumer that
[SPEAKER_07]: can only get that product in one place,
only one place, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be distributed to small
dispensaries around, but the product can't
[SPEAKER_07]: be produced at a scale that can feed the
masses.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let them have the central Valley,
unfortunately, you know, but let us,
[SPEAKER_07]: let us have the small, the craft,
the artisanal, let's take that model.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take that market.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's our market.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and, and, and, you know, and I don't
think we're worried at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you don't think you have to move
stuff down to the city?
[SPEAKER_07]: I am a fuck dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I surf, I surf right now, 14 days out
of 28, the other 14, I'm up with my kids.
[SPEAKER_07]: The reason I, I'm down here surfing Venice
breakwater almost every single morning and
[SPEAKER_07]: every single night is because I have to be
down here selling weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, this is where the market is.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where I have to bring cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish to God, I could just meet somebody
at the end of my driveway, get a duffel
[SPEAKER_07]: bag of cash and give them a fricking
duffel bag of turkey bags and,
[SPEAKER_07]: and, and let that go.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll meet you at the third gate.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll leave the second one open.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not giving you the code and we
didn't count the cash because you knew the
[SPEAKER_00]: guy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I mean, and you know, so the idea
is, is like, those days are over.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're down here, down here with jars of
fucking weed, tons of all my friends and
[SPEAKER_07]: neighbors.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's now we're becoming business
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're becoming politicians.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're becoming consultants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything we never wanted to be just to
survive.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the thing is, is we are going to
survive.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going high numbers?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you selling high numbers?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you falling into that trap?
[SPEAKER_07]: High numbers?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, I say you scale,
you fail.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's like, so, so, so no,
we're not selling high numbers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're trying to sell at high margins.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, I meant, I meant you're,
you're, you're TAC numbers.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I mean, I, I'd say, I'd say,
I would say, I would say there's a
[SPEAKER_07]: diversity in your lines right now that,
you know, that, that at dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_07]: I just got a COA back from big rock farms,
the 22%.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's like, Oh my God, I'm going to
take 50 of those, you know, take,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, you know, a hundred of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: I, that's what I want.
[SPEAKER_07]: The 22, 21% I'll take the 22%.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Numbers are still driving, driving the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some, we got some questions coming
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Kevin, you and I have talked about
this for hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, and you guys kind of touched on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate all, sorry, it's Lance Mowgli.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, you guys, I hate comparing
our industry to alcohol, but it's true,
[SPEAKER_01]: micro, macro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Justin and I just talked about this on
a boat in Long Beach the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think that's the only way it has to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Justin's spot on with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something that can't be emulated
on what's going on in the triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's going to make a unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: He introduced me to Hidden Prairie Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: By far the best fire blue skittles I've
ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll stay that way and I'll pay all
the money for what we just talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Used to getting free product, but there's
some product you're willing to pay for if
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't make it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what do you guys think about as far as
the evolution beyond the micro,
[SPEAKER_01]: macro?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about the race to the top,
which is sad for the States that
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's to your point, 34, 35,
38%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows if it's real on THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: When do you think that the 2.0 is going to
come in where it stops me in a race?
[SPEAKER_01]: It stops me in the dumb question of
Indica, Sativa or hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gets into more of a what's your
terpene profile is mercy for the win is
[SPEAKER_01]: lemony.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of know your answer,
Kevin, but I think everyone would like to
hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm on the same page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that for the craft regions,
it's really about getting and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to get the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, remember most of these craft regions,
Humboldt's a really good example because
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt's is unique in California in
terms of ownership of property.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of California has a
disproportionate amount of state and
[SPEAKER_00]: federal land versus private ownership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt has the most private ownership of
any county in California, which means that
[SPEAKER_00]: people really haven't seen Humboldt
County.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just words.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming from Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you're seeing right now,
though, is the first time where we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: able to work with the people who run
Humboldt County in terms of tourism and in
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt made and in the ability to get
people to come in and start to really be
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to the farms directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working so heavily on the tourism
aspect to allow individuals to come in and
[SPEAKER_00]: start to experience what the farmer has to
offer because the farmer can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the way we're working it is the
farmer can have the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone like me has to sell the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the license.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all I'm doing is selling the product
that the farmers convince and the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that they want to try based off of what
the individuals are asking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I look at storefronts,
the person who controls the destiny of
[SPEAKER_00]: your farm is someone who's making under
$15 an hour, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So under $15 an hour, they're controlling
the success of your farm because they're a
[SPEAKER_00]: bud tender.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not meant any disrespect for
way about money or in skill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that it's somebody who's at the
counter is being asked questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So few people actually come in and ask for
something specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a couple companies have that type of
market penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes down to the individuals have
to start to want to know the product
[SPEAKER_00]: they're buying from who's creating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based off of what these individuals
are trying to create.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that the craft of the way
that we're working it is to allow the
[SPEAKER_00]: tourism to increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which it's beginning and we can see it
clearly now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're starting to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you allow the farmers to actually
converse with these people so they can ask
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmer, what are you growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you recommend for me for what I'm
seeking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it isn't just about a single
terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about I just want this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe for opiate replacement it kind of
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can say that limonene drives you
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can say carafalene drives you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can make broad generalizations
based off of how we see terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fundamentally, you want to be able to
have the farmers who are cultivating and
[SPEAKER_00]: working on their own diverse, varietal
packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that make them unique in terms of I
don't grow the same thing Justin does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I might desire to send you a different
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when the people come in, they're
allowed to see these things, experience
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they do the word of mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones that drive that direction
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones that go back to their
home of origin and say, man, I said I got
[SPEAKER_00]: some killer weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the company that I got it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is those companies only
produce certain amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say Justin's farm does 500 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just talked about a farm that's
going to do 200,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what happens is why can't you do
pre-buys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we do that with other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in wine clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I order wine in and hold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's other things in life that we
work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the Ferrari model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the Ferrari model is you got 300
orders for cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you only made 200 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other 100 guys, sorry,
you missed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't seem to hurt Ferrari very
badly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does is they've created a
demand for a thing that makes people want
[SPEAKER_00]: a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes them commit to this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it allows you then to sell that thing
at a higher price point and have an
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to sell all your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of these craft farms,
I don't think they should even be putting
[SPEAKER_00]: them in eighths.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it should be in eighths only.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you were saying about Budtenders,
so we have three separate projects now in
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're realizing the truth of what
you said.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have three separate projects now in
Oregon to educate Budtenders.
[SPEAKER_04]: These people are putting together reams of
educational content and doing Budtender
[SPEAKER_04]: certifications.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we are super dependent on those
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're the gatekeepers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And reaching out to them and getting them
to drive the market in a new way.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the easiest pressure point right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We should all be pulling behind that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Making sure that the brand is carried into
the shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Budtender understands the brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can talk about the different varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when someone comes in, they steer them
towards something more intelligent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the market will evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough for a lot of the stores though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I use an example of some stores I
go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got 400 flower choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Jesus, Christ, how does any
Budtender know 400 goddamn choices?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do they carry so much flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ultimately, they believe that that
varietal is needed in terms of who's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming and they want to catch everybody
because it's so competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're really doing legit business
with your facilities where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: permitted, basically, if you're breaking
even, you're doing pretty goddamn good
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, this whole model is an assimilation
model where you're building something to
[SPEAKER_00]: be sold in a couple years.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't about running a business like
traditional business where I make X amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have X amount of profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these places are being built on a
for sale basis where you're building some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of vehicle that you can unload to a
larger conglomerate down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: It favors that model.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a look at it, to me,
it's Walmart model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a couple percentage points of profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can deal with it, you're going
to do great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're not, you're screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're trying to shotgun approach
who they're selling to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what you have to have is you
have to have the ability for storefronts
[SPEAKER_00]: in specific areas to say we're Mendocino
based, where you have a shop in Venice
[SPEAKER_00]: that works off of Mendocino farmers
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does, it allows them to,
or the Appalachian farmers, where these
[SPEAKER_00]: three Appalachians, we believe,
have superior product of these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of those Appalachian farmers,
we believe these three farmers have the
[SPEAKER_00]: right product of this product.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what you hear about Appalachian,
about collectives, trying to get retail,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll have some kind of humble
collective that has a shop in LA,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like an embassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you bring a brand ambassador
down, someone who's able to sit there and
[SPEAKER_00]: educate the people on, hey, these are how
they produce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the different directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it is trying to get people to
experience some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the tricks of it is you
do steam derived turps and you put it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: water bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's the only way you're going
to get anybody to taste this shit legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we messed around with it,
where we steam pulled turps off the
[SPEAKER_00]: varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it into a water bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can taste what that variety tastes
like with no legal issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just to let you know also that what
we're doing right now, what we have
[SPEAKER_07]: evolved from the events not being able to
happen this year, is we've made something
[SPEAKER_07]: called an outpost, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So we put all the brands in a kiosk and
have the brand ambassadors come down and
[SPEAKER_07]: actually do education pieces.
[SPEAKER_07]: But even that, because the distributor
model too.
[SPEAKER_07]: The distributors are 200, 500 skews.
[SPEAKER_07]: They go into the shop and they've got all
these skews.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got these price sheets.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've got everything like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I went across the street.
[SPEAKER_07]: Across the street is the Ease
headquarters.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess you heard of Ease, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right across the street, that big giant
castle is Ease.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I went in there with a bunch of farm
product.
[SPEAKER_07]: A little farm box with super cute little
stamps and all the Humboldt magazine,
[SPEAKER_07]: Appalachians map.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, hi, you want to buy our weed?
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were like, we're buying $6.80.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like $300 pounds and less with
taxes and distro and all of those things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So price is driving because these people
are trying to push it all out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're up against, this market is going,
the price per unit is going down.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's driving a lot of the business
inside the retail.
[SPEAKER_07]: The retailers are trying to push this out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's about education, but it's about
each and every single one of you going in
[SPEAKER_07]: and demanding higher quality products.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about us defining those quality
markers.
[SPEAKER_07]: In French, it was like with the hash
wheel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Max Montreux, give him a shout out with
the interpreting guide.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tim Blake, for the love of Christ,
put pressure on Tim Blake to release the
[SPEAKER_07]: cup data of all the judging cards.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of those markers, we start speaking
that language in unification like every
[SPEAKER_07]: single one of us.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can demand bud tenders to actually give
us a higher quality product and brands can
[SPEAKER_07]: produce that higher quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with that is that if you
really want a good bud tender,
[SPEAKER_00]: the best bud tender is really the grower
because they're the ones that know the
[SPEAKER_00]: product best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's trying to get the level of
information to the end user and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to target it geographically where you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all the years that I did illicit sales
for nursery work, when people asked me,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where Senator McGuire came in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came and asked me, he goes,
how do you choose your varials?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, you want the answer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell you, you want the real answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, I want the real answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I take a look regionally and I
take a look through the whole United
[SPEAKER_00]: States and I determine what's moving in
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I study the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: as a total market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you come in to do business
with me, I ask you privately where you
[SPEAKER_00]: move in the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you tell me you're moving it to
Chicago, I know what to put you into.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're moving it to Florida,
I know what to put you into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what to put you into because
regions have desires.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think with cannabis, what you're
doing is we're throwing, and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing wrong with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that have lower income levels
shouldn't be forced to buy more expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis because we want to get paid a
fair price for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in every object in life,
you can find a price gradient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that what we have to do is
really stare ourselves into people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are more discerning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why I believe that when you
work off of these craft models,
[SPEAKER_00]: less is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a higher price because you're
trying to target a very different user.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not trying to get everybody in the
country to smoke your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to get people that really
have enough income to smoke a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: quality product.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't have enough price differentiation
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all in the same bucket.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like a thousand X range.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with cannabis, we just haven't figured
out how to walk into, we haven't figured
[SPEAKER_04]: out how to walk into a store and be like,
this is a $200 eighth because it's fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: worth it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like in every other product, it's like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just haven't, we haven't had the balls
maybe yet to just, to just set up a store
[SPEAKER_04]: and to grow in a supply chain and just be
like, this is so much better.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not the balls, it's the funding to
actually do it because at the end of the
[SPEAKER_07]: day, it's the education.
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the end of the day, I did the math
when you and I used to work together.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember the most money I ever made was
when the OGSD, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd fill a greenhouse for the OGSD and
I've worked in two different markets.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to clear it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when I went with the diamonds,
with the diamond OG, I got a third of what
[SPEAKER_07]: it was that I was doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was like, so I had to grow that OGSD
because I could sell it, it would move.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't exactly, you know, it wasn't a
desired shape, but it would move in the
[SPEAKER_07]: fuel market and I could grow three times
as much of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was like, so it's like, we,
we were economic, we were driven by
[SPEAKER_07]: economics as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like what produces the most and,
and, and I know, but it's the job of the
[SPEAKER_04]: small grower to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's will be to grow the stuff that
doesn't produce the most, but is
[SPEAKER_04]: extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can, and you're getting that kind
of price reward.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Back then, of course, prohibition model.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not coming out of that fast
enough, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's going to, it's going to take
time though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, wine, people had to drink it or
they would have died of a toxic water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, fermented drinks, I mean,
Christ, beer was a breakfast drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it could still be a breakfast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it still is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the, but the point of it is,
is that you, you, you have to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: take the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the problem is that we don't
have time or you don't feel like we have
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that as people start to become
exposed to cannabis and you start to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: these cheaper products, you're going to
say, Hey, how come that wasn't the stuff I
[SPEAKER_00]: used to smoke prior?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to desire it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to realize, you know
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could smoke an ounce of this shit and it
wouldn't be as satisfying as an eighth of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, what's the difference in
price?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like all things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you drink in certain amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a, you got some kind of little
micro IPA in front of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's a choice that was made.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little double head on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin, we got, we got an audience
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got questions.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey guys, thank you so much for coming
through.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys are all super knowledgeable,
you know, giving us all a ton of stuff.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a question on consumers.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys are not, you guys, you
specifically, Kevin, seem to be mixed on
[SPEAKER_12]: consumer because you seem to say that the
Budtender has a ton of power, but at the
[SPEAKER_12]: same time you're saying that they go home
and they decide.
[SPEAKER_12]: So at the end of the day, don't you think
that the consumer is going to know what
[SPEAKER_12]: they want?
[SPEAKER_12]: They might be pushed something,
but just because there's a hottie and a
[SPEAKER_12]: hornitos, you know, cutoff doesn't mean
I'm going to order hornitos tequila.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not a hottie and a hornitos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that when you're, when you're running
a storefront, it isn't everybody that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes in as so cognizant of what they
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time people ask,
what do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you recommend me something?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they recommend typically is
something that they have a connection to
[SPEAKER_00]: in some form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a good farmer in terms of
business skill, you make a relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: with the people who are selling your
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where this distributor model
sucks in my opinion, because they just
[SPEAKER_00]: stick in the shit in a shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmer has to actually go to the
Budtenders, show them the product that
[SPEAKER_00]: they cultivate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell them why they grow what they grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them the information about what makes
it different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them experience it in some capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now what the Budtender has is a
memory of that relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I walk into stores that have hundreds
of choices, I go, give me something gassy,
[SPEAKER_00]: give me something fruity, and give me
something you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go, okay, this gassy one is what
seems to be moving most.
[SPEAKER_00]: We seem to get the most satisfaction on
the repeat buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is the same for the fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're doing is I'm asking them,
and this is a game I'm playing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just playing to see how are they
choosing these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the final one is what do you like
yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you choose yourself for your
own opinion, your own piece?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then it lets me get an idea what
the individual likes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's this person who's selling the
product at the front of the counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be able to differentiate
yourself as a farmer, grower, whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to call yourself, to that individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because otherwise you just fit into a jar
like all the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the part that matters,
is that in any single storefront you walk
[SPEAKER_00]: into, it's the person who's being paid the
least amount of money, who has the most
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of influence on the sale of your
product.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in Oregon, the consumers don't
know what they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: People keep saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you think they'll learn,
is my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll learn if the Budtenders teach
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through education, the Budtenders can
teach them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the farmer has to teach the
Budtender, though really about why the
[SPEAKER_00]: product is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it can't be the distributor,
because the distributor, how the hell are
[SPEAKER_00]: they going to know 700 products?
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half these guys don't even smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people who don't even smoke weed
dictate the success of your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I tell the farmers,
listen, you've got to go to every
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go through the distributor in the
conventional sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the stores, make the connections as
the farmer, and then find a distributor to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell to them.
[SPEAKER_12]: So the consumers who like Pinot Noir or
sold Pinot Noir at a certain point,
[SPEAKER_12]: is that what you're saying?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I'm asking, they know they like
Pinot Noir from trying it, from learning,
[SPEAKER_12]: from experimenting, not because they
walked in and the horny dose chick gave
[SPEAKER_12]: them horny dose, and that's what they're
about.
[SPEAKER_12]: They tried it, and they learned they like
Pinot, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Partially both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people know that they tried it and
liked it someplace, and they come in and
[SPEAKER_00]: ask for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a tremendous number of people come in
and ask the person selling it,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have 20 choices in front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your opinion?
[SPEAKER_04]: The Budtenders in Oregon say that it's
like being a bartender in a bar,
[SPEAKER_04]: and every single person that comes in
says, what should I drink?
[SPEAKER_12]: Bars aren't like that anymore.
[SPEAKER_12]: But for now though, but for now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm lucky to have a diverse experience
with it, because we give out, I think we
[SPEAKER_07]: give out 50 to 100 dispensary comps,
mostly to Budtenders, to Emerald Exchange
[SPEAKER_07]: events, to come and meet the farmers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're nonstop giving samples.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we find out you're a Budtender,
we're hanging out with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a different experience with
Budtenders when walking in to a space.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm usually with a brand or doing
something different.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's education to me to see now in the
LA market, watching how many products are
[SPEAKER_07]: coming out, how many products are
available, and how important it is that we
[SPEAKER_07]: do ask for what it is that we want.
[SPEAKER_07]: As consumers, so media is becoming huge.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the media outlets, partnerships with
media, telling people the story of the
[SPEAKER_07]: strains that we want.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that that's one of the things
that I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_07]: When being in the LA marketplace is like,
hey, how is it that we get what it is that
[SPEAKER_07]: we want?
[SPEAKER_07]: How does it we ask these questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Budtenders seem to be,
to me, more educated than what you guys,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I don't know, I'm just coming from a
different place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's coming from the Emerald
Exchange place, but I think that,
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, I just see a different
vantage point.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that we are starting to find
people that are indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beginning, yeah, yeah, it's
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not to the point where you have
an ability for the customer to know
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what they like.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they can tell you, though,
is how they want to feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of effect do they want to
achieve from the product that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: buying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can tell you, hey, I want
something that makes me feel uplifted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like something to relax me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to have some sleep aid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to be able to have an appetite
stimulation, either up or down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can tell you this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for so many individuals, they used to
scorn weed just scoring weed, and half the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that they were buying was
mislabeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what Filos lets you find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half the stuff you were smoking really
wasn't what you thought you were smoking.
[SPEAKER_09]: And still isn't.
[SPEAKER_09]: And still isn't.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the point.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when you go in and you talk to your
Budtender, you're buying Blue Dream,
[SPEAKER_09]: you don't have any idea whether that's
Blue Dream, and your Budtender doesn't
[SPEAKER_09]: either.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, so part of the answer... But if
there was a really smart Budtender who had
[SPEAKER_04]: smoked that stuff thoughtfully,
and it was called Blue Dream, but he was
[SPEAKER_04]: like, this is what you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I know that after talking to you,
and it was called Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I shouldn't say this, but if there
was that connection, that'd be just fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you could have a Budtender who could
lead you in that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the ways they get there,
I think, is because they'll have a
[SPEAKER_09]: certification by your company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they'll start to know without having
to smoke it so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are seven or eight different
kinds of people.
[SPEAKER_09]: We know it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But most people don't know Kush.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't know that Afghan was for making
hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it gives you a different kind of
high.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most people don't know that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I'm a member of the Garden Riders of
America.
[SPEAKER_09]: We represent... We reach 85 million people
a week.
[SPEAKER_09]: So last year was the first time they ever
had a talk on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: They would never let anybody talk about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are no newspaper articles by
regular garden writers who would reach
[SPEAKER_09]: normal people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you got the Oregonian has their
Budtender page and everything else where
[SPEAKER_09]: they try to make it sound like it's a
wine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's not the right kind of education
that we need right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got people that are... They want to
smoke the weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: They really don't even know what to ask
other than, I want to be uplifted or couch
[SPEAKER_09]: locked.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are the two things they know.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so all of this stuff has to change.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the ways I think we change is
by not wasting our time.
[SPEAKER_09]: So for example, we have this 420 day,
which gets more publicity than you can
[SPEAKER_09]: possibly garner for free for the industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do we do on 420?
[SPEAKER_09]: We party.
[SPEAKER_09]: We could use 420 day to change the name
from marijuana to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: We could find three or four different
things.
[SPEAKER_09]: 420 day, everybody who's thinking about
smoking cannabis ought to read this
[SPEAKER_09]: article or this week.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a way we could unify the way to
reach people as an industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff?
[SPEAKER_09]: We talk to ourselves.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't really get the people who are out
of the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you say that the Garden Riders of
America reach 85 million people a week?
[SPEAKER_09]: A week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_09]: On TV, radio.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: 85 million people a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I got... You're the new outlet for
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna be leaning on you heavily.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're right, except we've got another
problem there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So High Times decides, hmm, dope magazine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we better buy that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're gonna see the same kind of
consolidation in the media industry
[SPEAKER_09]: involving this.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got about 100 different cannabis
magazines now.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all the same.
[SPEAKER_09]: But at least we got 100 different ones.
[SPEAKER_09]: They could be different.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now we're gonna end up with two or
three.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, these are the things we have to
do.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want to go back to that 420 idea.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a day that's there.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is written about in every newspaper.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is on every television station.
[SPEAKER_09]: 420, oh my God, what an opportunity for
us.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we blow it every year.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're just all really high on that
day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we should figure out what to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've got like 10 more questions.
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll shoot the next question.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sundarajan here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm new to the... It's really dark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you the guy with the atomic light?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually very dark.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's the light guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the only dark guy here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was just because of the
lighting.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mowgli.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm very new to the industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And first, I want to say thank you guys
for sharing your wisdom with us.
[SPEAKER_08]: There seems to be, for me, a different
pivot point.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a living plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems to me, and when we talk about
numbers, high THC, every plant,
[SPEAKER_08]: it seems to me, from what I'm learning,
every strain is different.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody that smokes it takes it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we're all individuals,
have different effects with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so to have a discussion on one
particular one on how you like it,
[SPEAKER_08]: don't like it, is one thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other, and this is going to be a
question here.
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing is that the medicinal part
of this, no matter whether you're a wreck
[SPEAKER_08]: or not, it's still a medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the sense that whether it's a health or
whether it's a physical ailment,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's a medicine, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And we know that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm from India and I know my ancestors
have been using it.
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, my grandfather as well,
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I see also from the outside is a
lot of camaraderie that happens and a
[SPEAKER_08]: whole lot of less amount of collaboration,
not only in the educational part of this,
[SPEAKER_08]: but also treating that plant like it
should be in the sense of nature,
[SPEAKER_08]: how nature is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess what I'm trying to figure
out from you guys is you talk about
[SPEAKER_08]: pricing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You talk about keeping that edge in the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Mowgli, I hear you very loud and
clear.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got to make that plant very quality
that people will come.
[SPEAKER_08]: The growers that have used, I'm not just
trying to plug the plasma light,
[SPEAKER_08]: but they've kept their price up in Oregon
because they can do and get the numbers
[SPEAKER_08]: and get full entourage effect,
full profile.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I'm asking, I guess, is when you
go indoors like this, trying to do
[SPEAKER_08]: biomimicry, trying to do that,
and get the full expression of those
[SPEAKER_08]: specific land races you're trying to go
back to, what is the process that you're
[SPEAKER_08]: currently using to do that?
[SPEAKER_08]: And is everybody doing it like in a vacuum
and then trying to figure it out so they
[SPEAKER_08]: can get an edge?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is there a group that's literally
working towards getting more of the same
[SPEAKER_08]: kinds of medicine out to everybody that
really need this medicine?
[SPEAKER_08]: Not just, I mean, I smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: I enjoy it too.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I can just get it from my grower,
the guys I know, so I can supply myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the medicinal kind of grow,
the kind that really are helping veterans
[SPEAKER_08]: out, the kinds of cancer patients and all
these, where's the group that actually
[SPEAKER_08]: does that as a collaboration?
[SPEAKER_08]: And how do you guys think that should be
done?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think traditionally that's been done by
a lot of us behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you're talking about medicine
to veterans and ill and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from my situation, that's why I've
given out so much frigging money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because how do you ask somebody who has
nothing to give you something?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a charity situation,
which is very difficult for regular people
[SPEAKER_00]: to do, because you're having to subsidize
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but that's you, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now there's companies that are trying
to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to have proprietary plants
that have unusual cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they make oil from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they work with doctors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they try to bring it to patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's rough to watch them, because
they're trying to help patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're also simultaneously trying to
build all this IP.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're conflicted in various ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't have any data on the actual
medicine they're giving patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not a collaborative thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a handful of companies that are very
focused on the medical space.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not like it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's big business, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medical end is the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're talking about how do you help,
it wasn't about how do you drive medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said, how do you help specific groups?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say the word help, that doesn't
mean charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help is like, come over and help me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I pay you, that's a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're talking about help,
then it has to be where we had ideas where
[SPEAKER_00]: you had these regions, like our regions,
where X amount of the product that came
[SPEAKER_00]: off of your farm was put into a general
fund.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was allowed to be distributed so
that you only had X.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you did 90% of the crop was for
sales so that you could keep your farm
[SPEAKER_00]: alive, and then 10% of the farm was given
to these type of situations, then you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: have some ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that it's tough, because you've
got to pay tax on these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just give anything away anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So none of this stuff is easily to give
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to pay all the taxes on it,
the excise tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to pay production costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's extremely expensive to do what
you're saying in the modern world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went at this as aggressively as
possible while we had the chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that until you're able to
create these larger operations that can
[SPEAKER_00]: get some of the prices down on genomically
sorted medical varieties, on how we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to define medical, say it's in a specific
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use the word medical variety very
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's all cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how you use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think the problem is that when it
comes to these lower income people,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think America really gives a shit
because I had a step over three homeless
[SPEAKER_00]: to get in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I see homeless laying in the
street, I don't think people really worry
[SPEAKER_00]: about providing cannabis to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were caught up in it because we
were caught up in it because we were just
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitized to it because these are people
that you are around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see your neighbors that need help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of a sudden it starts to make you
more aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have strangers come to you for
help and it makes you more aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're in corporate cannabis in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a different animal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kevin, I give weed to everybody out here
on this street.
[SPEAKER_07]: You do?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why the guy was lying on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I mean, we've actually had weed
church, which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're like on Sunday, like we like sat
down and we're just sitting there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We smoked a joint.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the next thing you know, we're driving
my dollas on the road.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I definitely like, that's a hundred.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, my ex-wife used to say like,
I was the only person that could,
[SPEAKER_07]: because Dr. Courtney gave me an ACDC
strain and I got it through Jude Tillman.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then all of a sudden I got their phone
numbers and everybody was giving me the
[SPEAKER_07]: phone numbers or they gave my number to
everyone else.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my ex-wife was like, dude,
you figured out how to turn our square
[SPEAKER_07]: footage into a nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because at the end of the day,
how do you charge?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just veterans.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause if you want to do veterans,
I mean, the compassion programs that
[SPEAKER_07]: we're, you know, supporting through CGA
and weed, the weed for warriors program,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's extremely important to support that
at any cost.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the compassion programs to stay
alive, the way it was written in the
[SPEAKER_07]: state, we just got the new regs dropped.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're allowed now to have, we're now
allowed to give our, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: to be destroyed cannabis to compassion
programs, which is great.
[SPEAKER_07]: But further things like the, you know,
not supporting CBD isolate and hemp
[SPEAKER_07]: derived CBD, full spectrum CBD products,
because you have brands moving into the
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD space and they're saying, oh,
fuck it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's available in an isolate form at
pennies and the dollar.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have people like myself or Jude
Tillman who were running compassion
[SPEAKER_07]: programs where we were giving away tons of
CBD medicine to two patients, two children
[SPEAKER_07]: with epilepsy or people with cancer or
anti-inflammatory conditions.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were auto-immunes and, you know,
now we can't because it, I mean,
[SPEAKER_07]: at the cost of, you know, of regulation
and the square footage we're given,
[SPEAKER_07]: we can't afford to grow it anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's so, and, you know, if we were to
sell it, which I've never sold CBD in my
[SPEAKER_07]: life either.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm one of those, I just couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish that there was a way to,
you know, maximize square footage,
[SPEAKER_07]: but at the end of the day, you just can't
do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't sell it to kids.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, now we have to support
those programs, those compassion programs.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to support, you know, I would,
I have to say, you know, asking your local
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensaries, asking your local
politicians and everyone, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: getting involved in compassion is the
biggest thing that we have right now
[SPEAKER_07]: because these big hemp companies are
coming in and they're just driving the
[SPEAKER_07]: full spectrum out of, you know,
out of business.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I didn't mix two messages there,
but don't buy CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the first farm in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hemp farm, full, they make full
spectrum CBD tincture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's the first cannabis farm that's a
B Corp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: B Corp's a good way to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you know, the other way sin is
legalization.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got to get more states to legalize.
[SPEAKER_09]: Simple as that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you know, I think the Oregon
experiment in a way has resulted in $50
[SPEAKER_09]: ounces, which is pretty compassionate when
you get down to $50 ounces.
[SPEAKER_04]: And accidentally compassionate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, accidentally compassionate.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't mean to be so compassionate.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I, but I, but I do think more
legalization and I, did I hear today that
[SPEAKER_09]: the, that the federal government finally
said CBD is now not schedule one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a very big deal.
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, we got to make sure that
whatever it goes into, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: we're able to control how it's,
how it's done.
[SPEAKER_09]: And unfortunately that's not so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, yo, just to say, thanks Kevin.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to hold my hand now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted an excuse to hold his hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love you too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I usually, I just usually just
take the, anyway, we got like five minutes
[SPEAKER_04]: just to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: So recently you guys have been talking
about shrinking profits.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been talking about a general
education of the consumer and stuff like
[SPEAKER_05]: that, and educating, you know,
your blood tenders and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as a, like, let's say you're a
dispensary owner, you've got, you carry
[SPEAKER_05]: 20, 30 brands, you know, and you've got,
let's say five, five blood tenders,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, let's say that brands were able
to afford sales reps and they were
[SPEAKER_05]: bringing sales reps to your dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you have the time and would you be
able to educate all of your employees on
[SPEAKER_05]: 30 different brands?
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you have the space in your
dispensary to allow like literature of a
[SPEAKER_05]: general education about your brand or
about other brands?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think that a big issue is not
that dispensary owners can't, they just
[SPEAKER_05]: can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a lot of things and I'm
not a dispensary owner.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like you guys have, you know,
we were just talking about, I got
[SPEAKER_00]: approached by a bunch of my partners that
are farmers that don't have stores and
[SPEAKER_00]: they asked me if I could move their
product since we've changed the
[SPEAKER_00]: classifications on where you can sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my thing was I wanted the farmers,
I wanted them to send a rep with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what it does is I can have a mobile
storefront so I can set up a storefront at
[SPEAKER_00]: these different locations that are allowed
through whatever county we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted the farmers to be present,
someone from the farm to be present from
[SPEAKER_00]: that brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crucial because what I, I'm not
trying to be the face of their brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to be someone who sells
their brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the farmer to make the relationship
with the customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just happen to be one of the sellers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what it does, it allows the
individuals who are coming to buy cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: to meet the farmers themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmers can then educate these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were doing your job as a store
owner, then you take the people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: your butt tennis and you do put them
through a system where you bring them to
[SPEAKER_00]: farms you bring them to farmers,
you let them get a good exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to put it in the homework.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's easier for us where
we are because we have a proliferation of
[SPEAKER_00]: craft people around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it allows it a lot easier for us to
go up and check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going to Ganja Rebels Farm Tuesday
so I can check out all his products,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to carry some exclusive work
of his, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I know Dan forever,
but I'm going to bring a couple of the
[SPEAKER_00]: guys with me so they can see what he's
working with and they can see his new
[SPEAKER_00]: product line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then this way they're educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're educated on why we think it's good
and why we think the public should enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would have gradients of potency,
different profiles so that you have a true
[SPEAKER_00]: choice selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the dispensary owner's job to
educate the people who work in the
[SPEAKER_00]: facility so they know enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's about your commitment to the
industry long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that with a lot of stores is just
if you're in a good geographic area,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a lot of turnaround.
[SPEAKER_00]: People coming through, I don't think that
emphasis is placed as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that Jeremy's dispensary in
Oregon, Pharma, I think that he shines at
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every Monday the whole staff sits down and
they bring a scientist in to talk to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he shines.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a really, really good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Oregon is pretty unique in that way
where I think Oregon has a more developed
[SPEAKER_00]: craft system than California does by far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though California is the monster
of the game, Oregon has a different level
[SPEAKER_00]: of appreciation of the finite details of
the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that when I go and tour spots
in Oregon, I see a higher level of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge from the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also they can be more intimate
because you can also touch and play with
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: California is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: California, you don't get a chance to
touch this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where you have to bring your
workers that work for you to the location
[SPEAKER_00]: so they can actually see these products
and get exposed to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is to try to find a cluster
of farms that you can work with that can
[SPEAKER_00]: provide you a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it's brutal because you only
have so many farms that are online and
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution controls a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes it very difficult for you
to... I used to focus on local only.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was a local only guy for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were known for that, where we
worked so hard to develop all these
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller brands, where we would advertise
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would actually create your brand
because we had the ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the money and I had the resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what it did is it allowed us to
further... And people ask why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, because fundamentally I want
to get their product because it's a better
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can keep them alive, then I can
keep selling their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that means we have to have a
relationship in that form where the store
[SPEAKER_00]: owner and the farmer believe they're
connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, no one gives a shit who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need product on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a very transient type of
thought where it's anybody on the shelf is
[SPEAKER_00]: fine and it can't be viewed in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're a smaller operator and
you have an ability to choose farms that
[SPEAKER_00]: you work with based off of the ethics that
you believe that they should grow with,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have enough of them to give you a
product diversity, and you have enough of
[SPEAKER_00]: them to be able to give you sustainability
over the course of a fiscal year,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can actually get a knowledge base
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to hold that line where
you focus on those products and those
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that requires a different view of
cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say 85% of the businesses in
cannabis right now are here just to grab
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's the right way to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: We identified that kink in the supply
chain with the exchange.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we created that Emerald Outpost.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we now aggregated 25 plus brands.
[SPEAKER_07]: We aggregate all the brands in Northern
California if we want.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what we've done is we've taken
ambassadors, and we've only linked four to
[SPEAKER_07]: five farms, like five being max.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that ambassador actually knows those
five brands in and out, comes up to the
[SPEAKER_07]: farm, knows everyone, visits the farm,
and they can come down to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: As soon as we eclipse five brands per
ambassador, we add another ambassador.
[SPEAKER_07]: The brands pay for the ambassador.
[SPEAKER_07]: They pay us a referral fee similar to
brokering.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, we're brokers, essentially.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not distributors.
[SPEAKER_07]: We saw that these products were just being
dumped into distributors.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were visiting the distributors because
we were trying to get the distributors
[SPEAKER_07]: into the exchange.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're visiting these distributors,
and we're like, holy crap, you've got all
[SPEAKER_07]: this shit sitting there.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you doing with it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Our friends and neighbors aren't getting
paid.
[SPEAKER_07]: No one's getting paid.
[SPEAKER_07]: And who the fuck is selling this?
[SPEAKER_07]: And no one from the distribution company,
they couldn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: They had two, three guys out there with
two 400 SKUs on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the idea is it's like the brands then
pay the ambassadors.
[SPEAKER_07]: The ambassadors go to the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a good model, though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then eventually, what we're going to
be doing once we allow for onsite
[SPEAKER_07]: consumption after the January,
the 2020 passed, that we're going to start
[SPEAKER_07]: bringing all the dispensary owners and
everyone up there for full
[SPEAKER_07]: experience-driven tourism models through
the exchange and have that full gamut for
[SPEAKER_07]: the brands themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I mean, it is a thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, it's just another job that
we've got.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to keep on moving.
[SPEAKER_07]: We cannot sit and let weed sit on the
shelves.
[SPEAKER_07]: In Northern California, that is our bread
and butter.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is our mortgage payment.
[SPEAKER_07]: That feeds our dog.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: That is our gas money is sitting on the
shelves of a distributor somewhere in LA.
[SPEAKER_07]: That sucks.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you bring up a good point,
though.
[SPEAKER_09]: The dispensary has a much bigger
responsibility than they're taking on.
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to make money, exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you go in there and you're
waiting to get in, there should be some
[SPEAKER_09]: better reading material.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the crap that's sitting on it,
there should be teaming with microbes.
[SPEAKER_09]: But there should be better reading
material.
[SPEAKER_09]: The regulatory agency should be helping
with the education.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you leave dispensaries, you get the
little card that says, if you're pregnant,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, there's all that kind of stuff
that they force on us.
[SPEAKER_09]: They could also force on us a little
education.
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to know terpenes.
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to know the numbers.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just so you know, we're making a little
science book.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to give it out to
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be like weed science for
civilians.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little pamphlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use your galaxy at the nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the nursery, I got a 40-inch flat
screen on the wall that just has the
[SPEAKER_00]: galaxy on it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have a tremendous number of
strains mapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does, it allows people to come
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And start to see these relationships
between varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can start to get their mind
peaked on, hey, these things are
[SPEAKER_00]: connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because really, sometimes you can only
find certain things certain places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you want to find something similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we want to be able to do is
get you to understand, hey, these things
[SPEAKER_00]: are related.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, when you're in LA,
you might be able to find something that
[SPEAKER_00]: works for you like you did in Mendocino or
in Humboldt or in Siskiyou or wherever
[SPEAKER_00]: you're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what you're trying to do is you're
trying to get the individual who's buying
[SPEAKER_00]: the product to enjoy the experience of
buying the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that process, they start to become
educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you make it miserable, and I'm
telling you right now, I'm somebody who
[SPEAKER_00]: loves to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't like to read a damn
thing anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I shoot so much video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people really want it delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can do then is I give them
all the strain info.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give you a full digital breakdown of
everything we're touching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this way, you can go home and look at
it and come back and say, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to cultivate this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that has to be done with a lot
of the strains themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the videos, you see people smoking
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't give you the info you
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has to be done from a stability
sense, where it's easier as a nursery
[SPEAKER_00]: because I control the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have this material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say, look, we're going to run it for
this many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with purchasing products, it's
constantly new turnover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I think that a lot of the
stores, you have to kind of limit what you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually carry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather see less choices at a shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But better curated choices so that you
have a better stability on how you sell
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much you know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and what you know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you can really give a satisfaction
to the user.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what they do is they become
educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go to any shop and use that
education.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just us.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you think about the way wine works,
if you're a waiter in a restaurant and you
[SPEAKER_04]: have a good wine list.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's how I got to be a weed
scientist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a waiter for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you work in a restaurant that has a
decent wine list.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to go to the tables all night
long.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have to talk shit about the wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have to have some idea what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so a good restaurant owner,
every time there's a wine delivery,
[SPEAKER_04]: they sit down with their entire wait staff
or the person from the wine company.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you taste everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you learn about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you go to the tables,
you're not an idiot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can actually steer people towards
something they like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't steer them towards the
thing they like, then you don't make as
[SPEAKER_04]: much money.
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be like that at dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to educate yourself to sell
something to somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard with the weed though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because with wine, you can spit that shit
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with cannabis, you're not spitting
that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where me and the wine
industry have beef.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're training the bartenders to
go like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how Elon Musk smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, the individuals,
that's why I believe that the farmer,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's what we're trying to
do in our own world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the only way I can see this
really taking place is that you start to
[SPEAKER_00]: have the farmers come into your facility
more frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're present.
[SPEAKER_00]: You advertise for them to be present.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows individuals to start to meet the
individuals who produce the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually able to consume with you
off the site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they have an ability to have an
ounce legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this all has to work in legal
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything we based our whole world off of
was illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I'm somebody who's trying to
figure out how do you not step in a legal
[SPEAKER_00]: bear trap and lose your license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so much of it is to let the farmers
come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have an ounce in their hand that
they're allowed to show you outside the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a separate area where people
can look at products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't be through the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't open that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That product has to leave in a sealed bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the criteria in California make it
very, very hard to have an intimate
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change it sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, go do that goddamn thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm not doing it quick enough.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you're going to be able to do
on-site consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some places, it's all about zoning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's about your county.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just like someone says,
California is legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to Calaveras and tell me it's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a radically different situation
depending where you are geographically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, you have to be able
to find the loopholes that allow you to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it now or you won't be in business in a
year to do it when it does change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I think that you have to be
able to get your producers to come into
[SPEAKER_00]: the place and meet the buyers themselves
and just make it casual to where it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: frequent situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm lucky in the sense that the
people that we have at my shop are career.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pick career people, people that have
been smoking for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I bring in older people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have 70-year-old women that work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think that they're the most
knowledgeable about medical cannabis of
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know how to do holistic cannabis work
better than anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I need that type of situation to
occur in my world so that when people come
[SPEAKER_00]: in and are asking, how do you use this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually get people who have been
helping people for 20, 30 years with
[SPEAKER_00]: medical-type needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the farmer coming in,
the farmer's the only one that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to get you to tie into this and
understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, the bud tenders, they have to
be able to serve as a liaison.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't have to be hyper
knowledgeable to the degree where they
[SPEAKER_00]: know every single product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because not every one of them wants to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get someone who's phenomenal at
customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they only smoke very, very low-potency
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they do, they smoke a little bit of
it at night when they go to bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how the hell are they going to help you
out selling any of these other products?
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes it look like they're
incompetent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're phenomenal representatives of your
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're great with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that you need to be able to
bring in other people that can explain why
[SPEAKER_00]: they chose this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did you choose Orange Chewy Berry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it makes this happen for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then these people, and this is my
antidotal, this number of people worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we looked at the turf profiles and
the potency, we found it had unique
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had unique cannabinoid compounds
that we didn't see in other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the education that lets the buyer
realize, hey, that's what affected me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they know they can find similarities
in other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to give them an education,
not just to buy stuff from you or from the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers that you're selling for,
but you're trying to give them an
[SPEAKER_00]: education to where any store they walk in,
they have skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then any farmer they go to,
they have an ability to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's industry building.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just you and one farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to build a new industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very difficult to do it the way
we did it, where you could have an
[SPEAKER_00]: intimate relationship with the flower,
where you could open it up, touch it,
[SPEAKER_00]: smell it, look it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Christ, we had a secret smoke lounge for
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were smoking down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're going through my garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They dump out my trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had the BCC at my new shop three
times since July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've never had any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm talking, they're dumping the trash
out, combing the goddamn trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they're going through your trash,
and that's part of what they're allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: to, it makes it very hard to do anything
that's not within a complete regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to get around it by
bringing in other people from the outside
[SPEAKER_00]: that have an ability to be able to start
making these connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's where together,
as a culture, we should do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've historically been pretty
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we may not have done a lot of
business intimately, we did business when
[SPEAKER_00]: we needed to to make the pounds move.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we historically got along in a pretty
gentle, caring method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the part that you have
to bring forward to the public,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they realize, whoa, I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis was always this kind of
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that elevates them and lets them
realize, I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to change the way I purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't just look at it to snap it up off
a shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually take a second to get an
education on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this way, I know what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can go and find it at other
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we all had a common, you know,
I say objective like that, you'd see a
[SPEAKER_00]: radically different change in how people
perceived what they bought, and how much
[SPEAKER_00]: they were willing to pay for what they
bought.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I actually don't grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: I grow bugs to kill bad bugs on your
cannabis farm.
[SPEAKER_10]: So in conventional agriculture,
one big thing that happens is a
[SPEAKER_10]: globalization of pests.
[SPEAKER_10]: Asian citrus psyllid on citrus right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have lantern flies eating up entire
vineyards over on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_10]: So at what point is pest resistance going
to become more than a novelty and creating
[SPEAKER_10]: cultivars of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_10]: And also on top of that, what's the most
susceptible strain that you've ever grown?
[SPEAKER_10]: Like what's the drosophila that we can
test things on?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're working on PM first, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've collected a bunch of incredibly
susceptible varieties and a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties that have really high
resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've sequenced the DNA of PM varieties
from around the country so that we know
[SPEAKER_04]: when we're looking at PM, which strain of
PM it is, because there's a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: different ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: We built a detached leaf assay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead of running a breeding program
for PM in a building that you have to
[SPEAKER_04]: saturate and mold, we can run it in a
clean building and pull off a leaf and
[SPEAKER_04]: take it into the lab and inoculate it with
a known quantity of PM, and then
[SPEAKER_04]: quantitatively assess resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it will take a little while,
and then we've got to do botrytis,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then we've got to do fusarium.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just didn't have a way to do this
stuff scientifically before, but now we
[SPEAKER_04]: can do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once you have a genetic marker
for PM resistance, you can put that on all
[SPEAKER_04]: the backgrounds you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have two parts.
[SPEAKER_07]: One is I'll give you, I had a question for
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we just had this, Crystal Ortiz
and I just had this conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: She had a root aphid, no, I think it was
a, it might have been a russet mite that
[SPEAKER_07]: got onto her plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: So she brought in predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_07]: She does dry farming, all organic,
beyond organic, regenerative farm,
[SPEAKER_07]: beautiful garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: She introduces a predatory mite,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Gets in, works, gets rid of the,
you know, stabilizes the environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next year she does it as prevention,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's working really well.
[SPEAKER_07]: She says, at what point in time does the
introduction of this predatory mite start
[SPEAKER_07]: to shift the natural environment of my
entire garden?
[SPEAKER_07]: When does the predatory mite start to
breed and then take over in the area?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it was like, a question for you
was like, have you done research on how to
[SPEAKER_07]: stop, because I know the pikeminnow,
when it was introduced into the eel,
[SPEAKER_07]: right, to kill mosquitoes, ended up eating
all the salmon eggs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so then they had this huge,
they were like, no steelhead, because they
[SPEAKER_07]: had introduced the pikeminnow to kill the
mosquito.
[SPEAKER_07]: So question to you is, how do you stop a
predatory mite from breeding to ravage a
[SPEAKER_07]: garden called floriculture?
[SPEAKER_10]: When we're working on the smaller scale,
like prey mantis, for example,
[SPEAKER_10]: there are barely any prey mantis species
that are actually native to the United
[SPEAKER_10]: States.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything that you see is a Chinese
mantis.
[SPEAKER_10]: But on the smaller scale, everything is
incredibly finicky.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if there's no food there, the mites not
gonna exist.
[SPEAKER_10]: Same thing with parasitic wasps.
[SPEAKER_10]: And parasitic wasps are one of the
greatest fire controls out there,
[SPEAKER_10]: because without the pest, there's no
parasite.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they kill the pest and then they die
because their food is gone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's why you have to re-inoculate
every year.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like if you're using oxidant tallus,
you're using persimilis, like persimilis
[SPEAKER_10]: doesn't even survive year to year.
[SPEAKER_10]: Half the time, just because at some point,
the spider mites will go into diapause.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then once they're in diapause,
they're in the soil, and one's going to
[SPEAKER_10]: the soil, the other one's going right to
the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you pre-inoculate, that might not
even work, because if there's no food
[SPEAKER_04]: there, they'll just die right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they won't be there when the mites do
show up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_10]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are solutions to this,
providing enough food for them.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can provide pollen for certain
species.
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll feed off the pollen until there's
a better food source out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or you can really just introduce a mite
that actually doesn't really do anything
[SPEAKER_10]: to your crop.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just kind of there generally.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sacrificial source?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's kind of like really,
you're giving a dog some food in a bowl,
[SPEAKER_10]: and the food isn't gonna get up and crawl
away and start eating everything around
[SPEAKER_10]: it.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we gotta wrap it up on that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because there is evidently a line of
people upstairs waiting to get down here
[SPEAKER_11]: to listen to DJ Who.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the end of episode one,
and will be continued on pest management.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I appreciate everybody coming.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hope you learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: Round of applause for our panelists.
[SPEAKER_11]: The Marathon panel.
[SPEAKER_11]: You made it the whole time?
[SPEAKER_11]: I made it.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, thank you all very much.
See you next time.
