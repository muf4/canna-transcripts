[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Michael Masterman Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a molecular and medical pharmacologist
from UCLA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go Bruins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a brain tumor specialist from UCLA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go Bruins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chief scientific officer of CA Labs,
which is a small company that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting in once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The botanical drug space is one way to
explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phytochemistry is another way to explain
what are chemicals and pharmaceuticals
[SPEAKER_00]: that come from nature versus something
that might be synthetically derived in a
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, you have healthcare
backgrounds, but if you have biology
[SPEAKER_00]: backgrounds, we know most of our drugs
come from natural products, and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: will do some tweaks on it and make it
synthetic, and then that's how the drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many ways, my talk about medicinal
cannabis reverts back to something that we
[SPEAKER_00]: used to do before we had the age of
synthetic chemistry and our ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: really modify chemicals in new and
different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a United States congressional
candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something new that happened this
year, and I just felt as though compelled
[SPEAKER_00]: that it was time for me to step up and
take a serious responsibility for some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the healthcare issues that we have in this
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a founder of the Center for
Accessibility Research and Education,
[SPEAKER_00]: CARE.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new organization that I'm starting
to be able to get healthcare candidates
[SPEAKER_00]: elected as well as move on some of these
agendas that need to be done at the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm now a healthcare advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: From cancer lab to cannabis farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1998, I became interested in malignant
brain tumors by researching pediatric
[SPEAKER_00]: brain tumors, and we just didn't have a
lot of options for these patients and
[SPEAKER_00]: these kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cause was unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treatment options were and still are very
limited, and then in 2003, we discovered
[SPEAKER_00]: these things called cancer stem cells,
and these were pediatric brain tumors,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we found that this changed the way we
think about cancer as the cause of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most malignant cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something where we actually could
dial into these cells go bad, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: causes the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We describe these things as basically stem
cells that break bad, and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible for making copies of
themselves, but also creating the tumor
[SPEAKER_00]: bulk and the malignancy as well as they're
responsible for metastases.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was something that I was always very
passionate about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still very passionate about,
but it's a matter of ... We now have a new
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of what cells we need to be
looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we need to target them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2006, we screened and studied over
30,000 drugs which could kill brain cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: stem cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is exhaustive pharmaceutical research
where we're really trying to find what
[SPEAKER_00]: might kill these things, and we couldn't
find anything to kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exception of by 2013, and if you look
at the numbers, the amount of time and
[SPEAKER_00]: effort it takes to be able to develop
something that might actually be brought
[SPEAKER_00]: through as a treatment for cancers,
it's a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2013, we published a study proving
cannabinoid receptor agonists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our powerful drug class that could kill
these specific cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue was we were dealing with
synthetic compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could not get them to clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't license them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't do anything with them because
they would be considered too toxic for us
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to continue a clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: That led later on to 2016 when I founded a
botanical biopharma company to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid-based medicines for hard to
treat conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to talk about today is what
is the endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Three important diseases where
cannabis-based medicines may become
[SPEAKER_00]: essential in reducing disease burden and
healthcare costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is brain injury and brain health.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second one is cancer, my specialty.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third one is pain management and
stemming the opioid crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to describe what do cannabis
medicines actually look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the national cannabis medicine
policy look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to go over real quickly
challenges and problems for implementation
[SPEAKER_00]: into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: healthcare system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The takeaway from all this is how do we
make America healthy again?
[SPEAKER_00]: The human endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The human endocannabinoid system is a lock
and key for cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis-based compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several different receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Receptors are antennas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They coat the surface of cells in our
bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoid receptor one in red receives
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's tetrahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the main thing that everyone
focuses on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is on in the adult use market with
regards to that market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly in the central and peripheral
nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the cannabinoid receptor two,
which indirectly receives inputs from
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol, which is a non-psychoactive
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that's found in the nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remarkably, it's found in the immune
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see the greens and reds,
this is a receptor system that's
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout our bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is with regards to if you can see the
green area, the immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where our gut is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where a lot of things go on down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we have a lot of problems
with autoimmune diseases and whatnot in
[SPEAKER_00]: our guts.
[SPEAKER_00]: IBD, inflammatory bowel disease,
it's all mediated by our immune system and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's in our gut area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we built the car and we're
driving it at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a third cannabinoid
receptor that's still under study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been called the CB3.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right now called some very
complicated name.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's these endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the drugs that our body
produces, just like endorphins get
[SPEAKER_00]: produced when you run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing happens in our bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have these endocannabinoids that get
produced for a number of different
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to go into a few of them
here today and what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traumatic brain injury is a devastating
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a devastating thing that happens to a
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: The injury produces a cascade of complex
events within 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is the reparative and
destructive processes that go on in those
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 minutes as well as beyond those 20
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's primary, secondary, long-term
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no real effective therapies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The side effects of traumatic brain injury
include pain, memory, attention deficits,
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety, stroke effects, PTSD effects,
learning, depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really hardcore disease that we
just really don't understand a lot about
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're still trying to figure out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting thing about traumatic
brain injury, however, is that we learned
[SPEAKER_00]: that about these endocannabinoids from
studying traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: These endocannabinoids are naturally
occurring cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They protect the brain from stress during
injury and they were identified by
[SPEAKER_00]: studying the effects of brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right side of this slide is a
picture of a presypnatic post-synoptic
[SPEAKER_00]: neuron.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's these chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the left slide is those odd-looking
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are CBD-like compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they learned was, upon a traumatic
brain injury, these chemicals get produced
[SPEAKER_00]: by the body and their specific purpose is
to stop chemical signaling that can kill
[SPEAKER_00]: neurons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this was very fascinating that
would happen, that we were trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out traumatic brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up, in the same fashion that I
was learning about cancer, another lab
[SPEAKER_00]: studying traumatic brain injury and they
said, oh, wait a minute, this is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that could protect brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting in a cancer lab and I'm like,
oh my god, this is something that could
[SPEAKER_00]: kill cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a lot of the way the scientific
community is starting to look at this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and look at cannabinoids in a
different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids in neuro-production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our brains are constantly under stress
through lifestyle, aging, if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: brain injury or you played football or
soccer or any other event that would hit
[SPEAKER_00]: you in the noggin, mood disorders,
poor sleep, diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all things that we all
experience, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out that cannabinoids may fend
off this stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a natural thing that our bodies are
doing in order to protect itself from
[SPEAKER_00]: these insults that we have to our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids are produced in response to
brain injury and may play a role in
[SPEAKER_00]: recovery from brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endocannabinoids repair and protect the
brain and then the scientific consensus is
[SPEAKER_00]: now that cannabinoids should be further
developed as potential preventatives as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as treatments for brain injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're gonna switch into cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effects of cancer on our healthcare
system are enormous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes up to a billion dollars to bring
a new drug to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: To satisfy return on those costs,
each successful drug must bring in about
[SPEAKER_00]: five billion to 10 billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So worldwide sales of cancer drugs
surpassed 100 billion dollars in 2016 and
[SPEAKER_00]: the market is expected to reach 147
billion by 2017, or excuse me,
[SPEAKER_00]: by 2018, which would be this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark that, bring that into the United
States and directly affecting your careers
[SPEAKER_00]: and what we're doing here in the United
States is that we have 1.6 million new
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer cases each year, 600,000 cancer
deaths and 38% of patients die within one
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still have a long way to go and then
we have these economic issues that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the big question, can cannabis really
be used to treat cancer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very, the slide of a very,
what goes on in cancer and how we study
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoid receptors get expressed on
cancer cells, they act as antennas and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the cannabinoids can get into the
cells through those receptors and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they actually just kill the cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of complications that go
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at this slide, there's all
these different signaling pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the red parts are inhibitors of a
particular function and the green arrows
[SPEAKER_00]: are activating functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the bottom of the slide,
most of those functions that you're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: are cancer stem cell things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epithelial mesenchymal transition is how a
cell pops off from a tumor and then goes
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how metastasis gets started.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some things in the middle here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look directly in the middle,
that mTOR, that AKT, that PI3 kinase,
[SPEAKER_00]: or it's called PI3 kinase, LPA3K,
that's a very, very powerful cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: causing signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drugs are very difficult to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with this pathway for most of my
career and every single time we throw a
[SPEAKER_00]: drug at that that's trying to inhibit that
particular pathway that will kill the
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer stem cell, it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these drugs that are on the
market now, they're only, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfactorily, they're satisfactory,
they're treated as blockbusters,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we still have a long way to go because
these pathways are very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that thing in the middle, that PI3K,
AKT, mTOR, shutting that pathway down will
[SPEAKER_00]: kill a cancer stem cell and it turns out
that that's what we found when we were
[SPEAKER_00]: studying cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shut that pathway down and the cancer
stem cells died and that's really where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at targeted chemotherapy for
cancer might actually be targeted
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid therapy for cancer in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does cannabis kill stem cells?
[SPEAKER_00]: It kills cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cancer cells express antenna-like
receptors on the cell surface,
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps as a mutation for growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still trying to understand why a
cannabinoid receptor would be expressed
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically on a cancer cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of research still needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids enter the cancer cells and
act as a Trojan horse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids affect essential signals that
keep cancer cells alive and then cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: stem cells particularly are highly
dependent on very specific signals for
[SPEAKER_00]: survival that cannabinoids shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of cannabinoid effects on
immune function, they may help the body to
[SPEAKER_00]: kill cancer cells in ways we don't fully
understand at this time right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to switch into pain management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to switch into the opioid
epidemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons I actually ran for
Congress was because I felt as though some
[SPEAKER_00]: that we were failing, that we had a
drastic failure that went right in front
[SPEAKER_00]: of our faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I am as a cancer biologist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to understand how to treat
complex cancers and all of a sudden we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing deaths from opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something that we created.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're all panicked by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every doctor I see is completely panicked
by the opioid crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hands rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to switch into hands rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hands rolling was a statistician and he
looked at basically development and how
[SPEAKER_00]: finances and the development of our
economies related to life expectancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was Swedish so he was looking at
the Swedish life expectancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on your y-axis here is life expectancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the x-axis is income.
[SPEAKER_00]: As our income and our GDP grows,
our life expectancy goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the state of American medicine can be
seen that in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are pictures from his family members
who helped him write this book called
[SPEAKER_00]: Factfulness, which I strongly recommend
you read and check out because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty cool book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we develop and we go from walking and
then we get bikes and we start riding
[SPEAKER_00]: bikes and then we have cars and now we got
a lot of cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we run into developed and then we go
overdeveloped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look at that fourth thing and these
are the patterns of economic development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the fourth thing where we have
plenty of cars, that's a situation where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're moving into overdevelopment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really where I think our health
care system is at right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were good and then we just went
overboard a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not to scare you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to change health care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be great in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we just have to figure these things
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Americans make up 5% of the world's
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: We consume 75% of the world's drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pay the most for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not helping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not helping anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: life expectancy has dropped because of
opioid deaths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Males will no longer live to 82 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to live to 75 because of an
opioid crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one killer of people under 50
is opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to go do something about this,
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just turns out that the state of
cannabis' medicine is there to start to
[SPEAKER_00]: help this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis relieves a number of common
ailments, pain and inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It relieves some costly and difficult to
treat conditions, cancer, brain injury,
[SPEAKER_00]: autoimmune disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works synergistically with existing
medicine so it can be brought right into
[SPEAKER_00]: our system and not necessarily be this odd
thing that comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a way to help other drugs that
might work in particular things such as
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotherapy and opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: As broad spectrum affects, it may reduce
health care costs in ways we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to research it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be safely used as a replacement or
with opioids to reduce opioid overuse and
[SPEAKER_00]: abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And health care and societal costs are
going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prescription medication use has gone down
and deaths from opioid crisis has gone
[SPEAKER_00]: down in states that have medical cannabis
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not, there was a study in the
Journal of American Medical Association
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks ago, Journal of Internal
Medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as well at the same time, Rand just
released a study showing the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does cannabis-based medicine look
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Johnson & Johnson just decided that
they now have a medical cannabis company
[SPEAKER_00]: up in Canada that they're working with to
create medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: GW Pharmaceutical and just under the GW
Pharmaceutical is this, to the left of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a drug called Apidiolex.
[SPEAKER_00]: On April 18th, just next week,
they're about to have their FDA review to
[SPEAKER_00]: treat seizures from a very rare form of
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the beginning of what America's
going to be going through the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to create these medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in CA labs we learned,
we started to work with patients and we
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to figure out like what works,
what doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started to figure out that there
was ratios that were very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people who needed pain maybe needed
more THC, but people who didn't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the psychoactive effects, they'd be
able to use CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be medicine of the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as more and more companies start to
move through the pipelines and be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: go through our clinical trials,
we're going to have some new tools in the
[SPEAKER_00]: toolkit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to get used to it and
we're going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fundamentally believe that we're going
to be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get ourselves out of this
healthcare crisis and cannabis medicine is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way to do it for true cannabis-based
medicine and in order for medicine to be
[SPEAKER_00]: accepted and doctors to be able to say
yes, I believe in this, it has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be for specific indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to report on the side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to understand the proper use for
the condition and then be able to explain
[SPEAKER_00]: to physicians and patients how they should
be using it because if you don't use it
[SPEAKER_00]: right, it might not work well and it might
also get you really, really high and that
[SPEAKER_00]: might not be good either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we're dealing with severe
diseases, a physician's care should be
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't something that people should go
off and do on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're sick, doctors, I'm a PhD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doctors know a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be able to be able to work
with the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't really have that in America
right now and we need to get to that
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it should be insurable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we can make it insurable,
we'll probably be able to really be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to reduce our healthcare costs as well as
improve our care and America will get
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Components of an effective national
medical cannabis policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that I came up with
years and years and years and looking and
[SPEAKER_00]: looking and looking and when I ran for
United States Congress, I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: what would I want to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had the power, what is exactly the
steps that I would take in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce cannabis into the healthcare
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: First, accurate scheduling of cannabis and
cannabinoid derivatives such as CBD and
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC is psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is a little less psychoactive to
non-psychoactive and yet they're both
[SPEAKER_00]: being treated like the exact same compound
with the exact same as a drug of abuse
[SPEAKER_00]: that has little or no medical value and
yet we're seeing that there is medical
[SPEAKER_00]: value and they're not necessarily drugs of
abuse either.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to have a federal recognition that
cannabinoids are a safe alternative for
[SPEAKER_00]: pain relief because that's where it
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the opioid crisis because we were
focusing on opioids for pain relief and we
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't looking at anything else and we
need to start thinking a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: differently about how things go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to fund research initiatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to study the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in training, they didn't teach
us anything about the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just, it's not something that you
learn when you're going through an
[SPEAKER_00]: American medical school.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to research and develop and deploy
new therapies and we're gonna start to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do this very, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to understand the healthcare
economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if healthcare cows go down with
cannabis and they're researching it,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is an out-of-pocket expense so we
have to understand how this is gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: actually favorably improve healthcare and
favorably improve our ability to insure
[SPEAKER_00]: for it and actually make it possibly
easier to sell insurance if you're dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with things that work and have the right
cost metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is gonna help your industry over the
long term and then we have to study
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis use disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientists and doctors do not call this an
addictive substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll call it a cannabis use disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't call it an addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something going on there that this
is not an addictive substance as we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been led to believe throughout
generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to create specifications for
medical education and continuing medical
[SPEAKER_00]: education training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doctors, nurses, anyone in the healthcare
system, they wanna learn about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanna do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know the drugs that they're
prescribing in many cases are not optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want other options but they need
to be trained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so CME is gonna be a part of that as
well as continuing education for our
[SPEAKER_00]: healthcare insurers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys should really get up to speed on
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna have these conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna help us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we need to improve the regulatory
process for cannabis medicine across our
[SPEAKER_00]: federal agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DEA, the FDA, the Veterans
Administration, the National Institutes of
[SPEAKER_00]: Drug Abuse, these are agencies that need
to be working together in concert to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to introduce cannabis medicines into
our society.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then six is insurance coverage for
medical cannabis and cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should fall under the same exact
guidelines that we deal with other
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we're getting to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the reasons why I'm
speaking here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenges to implementing cannabis
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an adult use thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have something, some relationship
to cannabis in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to separate out that yes,
the recreational use and the adult use and
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that we use this to treat very
deadly diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use it as a mechanism to improve
our healthcare system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are two different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the stigma that gets applied through
things like this don't help.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't help my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna help your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're gonna walk away from here,
I'm gonna ask you for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The promise in implementing cannabis-based
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grown-up pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When somebody's at the dinner table at
cocktail hour or you're in the office and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking about cannabis and cannabis
medicine, where are the grown-up pants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And say, hey listen, I talked to somebody
who really knows what he's talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: and he says we can cure cancer with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to somebody who really knows what
they're talking about and there's a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: go about doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I snicker, I laugh, it's funny,
but I'm also working on very difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my goal is really to recruit
everybody in this room to think like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're all gonna get sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all gonna have to deal with this in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want the medicines we already have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, some of them are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them aren't that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them may be too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them's not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Circumstance of ours that we're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to integrate cannabis medicine
to our healthcare system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because while we don't, the rest of the
world is going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is something that grown-up
pants are pretty important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is okay for you to laugh but then
say yeah, but it's also used for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some really important things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those medicines are gonna come along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're gonna get the insurance codes
for specific ratios and specific dosages
[SPEAKER_00]: and specific products that are gonna be on
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a feeling that they're gonna be
a lot cheaper than some of the drugs that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can make America healthy again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank you for listening to me.
