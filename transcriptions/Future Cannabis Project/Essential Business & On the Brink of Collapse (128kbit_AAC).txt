[SPEAKER_08]: We are tuned in to a morning breakfast
briefing.
[SPEAKER_08]: The title of this conversation,
but we will cover a variety of topics,
[SPEAKER_08]: is essential.
[SPEAKER_08]: And on the brink of collapse, a weighty
start to your day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Take it away, Mr. Tom Himes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess the genesis for this discussion
was anecdotal conversations that we've all
[SPEAKER_02]: been having with business owners,
people in the industry, and also a series
[SPEAKER_02]: of three very recent articles,
one in the Sacramento Bee, one in MJ Biz,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then a Forbes article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the same thing, that California
cannabis, even though it's deemed
[SPEAKER_02]: essential, is in crisis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what we want to do is kind of
dig down into that kind of talk about why
[SPEAKER_02]: it's happening, what's the result of the
pandemic, what issues were percolating
[SPEAKER_02]: already and were aggravated by the current
situation, and what people are doing about
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think maybe the best thing to do to
start is to have everyone one at a time
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of talk about within the perspective
of this subject, what they're doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: right now in the industry, and they can
sort of weigh in if they want with their
[SPEAKER_02]: general perspective right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'd also like to get from people,
because everyone here is deeply involved
[SPEAKER_02]: in policy, in the overview and the nuances
of the industry, to talk about what's
[SPEAKER_02]: really going on from your perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give us an overview and an under view.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that would be very helpful for
whoever's listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who do we want to start with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't we start lower left with Jackie,
and then we'll, at least on my screen,
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of just introduce yourself for
us, Jackie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were one of the people quoted in
one of these articles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give us your perspective.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Tom.
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Jackie McGowan, and I have a
consulting company called Green Street
[SPEAKER_07]: Consulting and a Facebook group called
California City and County Regulation
[SPEAKER_07]: Watch, where I set up 540 Google email
alerts to every city and county in the
[SPEAKER_07]: state four and a half years ago to capture
all of the movement at the local level.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've been banning those Google email
alerts for the past four and a half years
[SPEAKER_07]: and reading every article that's come out
in every jurisdiction in the state.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the actual quote that I gave to the
Sacramento Bee, who I view as a very
[SPEAKER_07]: biased publication, which is unfortunate
considering that it's the state capitals
[SPEAKER_07]: newspaper.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the editors of the Sac Bee,
the editorial board, came out in
[SPEAKER_07]: opposition of Proposition 64.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you look back, at the last year to
two years worth of articles in the Sac
[SPEAKER_07]: Bee, they love to harp on any negative
stories.
[SPEAKER_07]: They do not like to tell anything positive
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And my actual quote was that the industry
was on the verge of collapse prior to the
[SPEAKER_07]: coronavirus pandemic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that part got edited out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had a few words with the journalist
that it wasn't acceptable that they're not
[SPEAKER_07]: telling the entire story.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that the media did the industry an
extreme disservice by publishing article
[SPEAKER_07]: after article talking about how there was
a significant increase in sales and
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody was stocking up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that just made everyone view or
continue to view the industry as a cash
[SPEAKER_07]: cow, which it is not.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not because there's so many
different people and agencies with their
[SPEAKER_07]: hands out and it all does add up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that the industry was in some
deep trouble prior to this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And given that they've had to,
especially if you come at it from a retail
[SPEAKER_07]: perspective, retail has had to come up
with an entire list of really new business
[SPEAKER_07]: model.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason that I believe that the
industry is on the brink of failing is
[SPEAKER_07]: because that business model, it worked for
existing retail when people were visiting
[SPEAKER_07]: retail stores.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one store in San Jose that prior
to the pandemic was seeing 1,500 people a
[SPEAKER_07]: day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know how you replicate
servicing 1,500 people a day and be
[SPEAKER_07]: profitable if you have to do curbside
delivery or curbside pickup and shifting
[SPEAKER_07]: to a delivery model.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that the numbers pan out to
pay expensive leases for real estate as
[SPEAKER_07]: well as running a delivery business.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would make a lot more sense if they
were in industrial areas and that would
[SPEAKER_07]: bring the cost of leasing down.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's not something that you can just
change in the midst of a pandemic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think that distributors have
become sort of the credit master in this
[SPEAKER_07]: game.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of retailers have pushed off
their credit onto the distributors.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when they blow out a distributor,
they just switch to another one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we're seeing those accounts
receivables get larger and larger with
[SPEAKER_07]: many distributors if it doesn't blow them
out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so a distributor didn't get a license
to then become the financier of the
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what's happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I don't know, I hope that there's
some other brains on this panel today that
[SPEAKER_07]: can come up with some out of the box
solutions because we're in some serious,
[SPEAKER_07]: terrible territory.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shannon, do you want to weigh in?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Shannon Hatton.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am co-founder and CEO of Fiddler's
Greens and Hightype Distro.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been in the industry in California
for about 10 years coming out of the Prop
[SPEAKER_06]: 215 market.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were one of the earlier adopters of
getting our Prop 64 license.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of a running joke at our
organization of ask Shannon, she's the
[SPEAKER_06]: first one to ever do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've spent a lot of time helping
regulators figure out how to implement
[SPEAKER_06]: some of their rules at the local and at
the state level.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it's been a battle.
[SPEAKER_06]: We started this as cultivators and teacher
makers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I never imagined we'd be in the
distribution business.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we were having such a hard time
finding a distributor that could represent
[SPEAKER_06]: us and meet the needs of our clients.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of our products are non-psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was a tough sale in the early days
that we were selling weed that didn't get
[SPEAKER_06]: you high.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we started our own sales team.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the last few months with COVID and
just some of the extinction going on in
[SPEAKER_06]: the distribution space, we've taken on a
lot more at the last mile fulfillment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're actually onboarding other small
brands right now that are getting pushed
[SPEAKER_06]: out by the distributors and really just
trying to build that portfolio of boutique
[SPEAKER_06]: heritage products and keep the people that
built this industry viable through this
[SPEAKER_06]: next transition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amanda.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Had to unmute myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's good to see everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope everyone's doing well this morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm Amanda Ryman.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm currently the vice president of
community development at Flocona.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are also distribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: I resonate a lot with what Jackie was
saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are based up here in Mendocino
County.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we work with a network of
independently owned small farms that are
[SPEAKER_04]: sungrown.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of our brand is a sungrown
product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we distribute around the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think in addition to what's already
been said, as Jackie was saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: this isn't like COVID caused these issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: And prior to this pandemic happening,
there were some policy issues that we were
[SPEAKER_04]: working very hard on that we felt were
necessary in order to move the industry
[SPEAKER_04]: forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them being tax reform.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them being market expansion and the
fact that cannabis is banned in most of
[SPEAKER_04]: the state of California, even though they
overwhelmingly voted for legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then banking at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's interesting that after
COVID happened, these issues did not go
[SPEAKER_04]: away.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, they became even more necessary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think COVID actually started to give
us some talking points around these issues
[SPEAKER_04]: that we hadn't had before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's interesting, I've been working in
cannabis for over 20 years as an activist
[SPEAKER_04]: first, and then moving more into the
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as activists, we were never in a
landscape that was friendly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were never in a landscape that
wasn't in crisis mode.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had dispensaries getting raided every
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had patients going to jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had people losing their freedom.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the idea of having to operate in a
crisis scenario, honestly, feels a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit more comfortable to me than operating
in a business as usual scenario.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think we as activists,
and as those who really had to push this
[SPEAKER_04]: movement forward, we have an opportunity
to think about what used to work and what
[SPEAKER_04]: we used to do before we just tried to go
about it as business as usual.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how do we change hearts and minds?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how do we ignite passion?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how do we help everyone understand the
hypocrisy between being essential and
[SPEAKER_04]: being illegal?
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is giving us opportunities we
haven't had in actually quite some time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm interested to take advantage of
them and also kind of use this as a pivot
[SPEAKER_04]: point to see where we want to go moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've got more thoughts on that in
terms of how the state of California is
[SPEAKER_04]: handling cannabis, how the federal
government is handling cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: and what we can do as businesses and
activists to try to impact change,
[SPEAKER_04]: even in a time of COVID.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of think of this as like getting
the carpet out and like shaking it out
[SPEAKER_04]: real good for society.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when that happens, you have an
opportunity to slough off a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: crap that's been hanging on for a long
time and to breathe some fresh air into
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that's an amazing
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I look forward to having this
conversation with this group today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a panel of real activists.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Adam, weigh in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Adam Spiker, I'm the executive director
of Southern California Coalition,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has been in existence for about five
years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four and a half, predominantly initially
to try and fix LA's situation,
[SPEAKER_01]: shall we call it, previously and
currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also run a lobbying firm that has been
in existence in the state for three
[SPEAKER_01]: generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely concur with some of the things
that I'm hearing from the rest of your
[SPEAKER_01]: panelists.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say it's a shame that it isn't
hyperbole how you titled your conversation
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just flat out not hyperbole that the
industry is failing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would almost argue that the legal
industry just about has failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're two and a half years in just
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have 70 to 80% of the industry
illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's absolutely, I would challenge
anyone to give me an example of another
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated industry anywhere in the state
or country that has that type of
[SPEAKER_01]: environment they're dealing with,
where they're getting taxed and dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: with the over-regulation and the costs
associated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And meanwhile, 70 to 80% of their
competition is still in existence
[SPEAKER_01]: dominating their market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we try to do is we try to think
outside the box continuously,
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding politics and politicians,
whether local, state, federal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certainly tactics involved in how
to create consensus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times it means getting
creative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of been our RMO from day
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it still is, as some of the focal
points about, I don't have an answer for
[SPEAKER_01]: more licenses because the state really
can't, they can't force that issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of our two tiered structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: On taxation, I'll just kind of start off a
conversation and Greg and others can chime
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our challenge on taxation has been for
three years since this even became a
[SPEAKER_01]: concept of 64, the folks that were trying
to do it right and do it legally were
[SPEAKER_01]: facing an unfair competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each year the industry would get
behind typically, assembly member Bonta or
[SPEAKER_01]: others proposing ways to try and make them
more competitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just hasn't even begun to got
traction in the legislature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, a lot of the reasoning
behind that is branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been deemed corporate tax relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: The example I would give is it's basically
having med men harvest, cure leaf and
[SPEAKER_01]: acreage telling the state we need help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, the state was seeing them be
evaluated over a billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was a universal no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of our big pushes is to change
the narrative rightfully to this being a
[SPEAKER_01]: social responsibility of the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all working hard in our different
local communities to try and correct some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the wrongs over the last 60 years as it
relates to the war on drugs, social equity
[SPEAKER_01]: programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our argument and our challenge to the
state is that it's a social responsibility
[SPEAKER_01]: to them to make this industry more
competitive, at least for those programs
[SPEAKER_01]: let alone the general legal industry or
else they're set up to fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where we're trying to change
the narrative and also trying to build
[SPEAKER_01]: more consensus within the industry because
a lot of times it gets really fractured
[SPEAKER_01]: and different groups and different
segments go at policy advocacy in their
[SPEAKER_01]: own way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it does more harm than good
when you're not singing the same song.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of our argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we spent a lot of time because we had
our hands full just dealing with LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still do, but we felt it important to
kind of try and take a second line of
[SPEAKER_01]: battle with the state of California as it
relates to just the competitive landscape
[SPEAKER_01]: for the legal operators and the social
equity applicants and operators that are
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna enter this market that unless
something change, the statistics are not
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to fail at an alarming rate
and it won't be their fault.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greg, you wanna sort of pick up this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, why not?
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, what everybody's saying is
correct and you don't have to look into
[SPEAKER_09]: the future to see that most of the
businesses that are coming in half are
[SPEAKER_09]: gonna fail.
[SPEAKER_09]: All you have to do is look at LA cities.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, let me, I just jumped right into,
for those that don't know me, I'm Greg,
[SPEAKER_09]: CEO of Refinery Inc.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're licensed in both phase one,
phase two and phase three in LA and been
[SPEAKER_09]: involved locally in local LA boy born and
raised, been involved in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: politics since the beginning from Glacca,
now also on the board of the SEC since the
[SPEAKER_09]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's just a quick brief one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also a Marine combat veteran.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so to get into that, right,
you don't have to look, but to LA phase
[SPEAKER_09]: two social equity licensees to see that
it's failing, you had 800 something
[SPEAKER_09]: different people awarded licenses,
half of those are already abandoned,
[SPEAKER_09]: canceled, gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't have the funds, they didn't
have the means, they're gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those were 400 licenses that were issued
by local and state that are now dead.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kinda gonna be hard, in my
opinion, to convince the state to give
[SPEAKER_09]: more when they gave more and then they
just went to nothing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the focus should be, I believe more
than giving more licenses to help people
[SPEAKER_09]: succeed and not lose those licenses,
because that is what's happening.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in my opinion, I mean, the taxes are
high, everything is high.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're gonna keep the taxes high,
then you need to subsidize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what I mean by that is subsidize the
prices and the price difference between
[SPEAKER_09]: legal and illegal cannabis so that we can
be competitive against the illegal market.
[SPEAKER_09]: And part of the reason why, and it's not
an excuse, because people need to pay
[SPEAKER_09]: their bills, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like anything else.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is touching, because I think I
heard briefly what Jacqueline was saying
[SPEAKER_09]: about retailers bouncing from distro to
distro and basically bouncing on their
[SPEAKER_09]: bills, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So these retailers are used to this
different situation where they just get an
[SPEAKER_09]: item and they double the price or they put
an 80% markup on it and they think,
[SPEAKER_09]: oh, I'm gonna make all my costs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then here we are two years later and a
lot of the retailers are like,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna go bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_09]: So not only do they not have enough money
to pay their taxes, which are overpriced,
[SPEAKER_09]: and then on top of that, when they're
paying their taxes, the state has this
[SPEAKER_09]: ridiculous tax where you get hit with 50%
if you're even late on your excise tax.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never heard of any industry that gets
50% penalty.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a $100,000 bill, now all of a
sudden it's 150.
[SPEAKER_09]: You couldn't pay the 100, how are you
gonna pay the 150?
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's all connected.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just one issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a bunch of issues.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a bunch of problems that have to all
get solved pretty much at the same time or
[SPEAKER_09]: else it's not gonna work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greg, can you talk for a second about,
you had told me that the taxes are so
[SPEAKER_02]: fucked up that you're disincentivized from
selling your own homegrown product in
[SPEAKER_02]: retail.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're incentivized to sell it bulk.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so the tax liability on distribution
is a lot less.
[SPEAKER_09]: And my situation is maybe a little
different because we're a micro business.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I have to remit my excise tax at
the end, not at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what happens is I don't end up paying
an excise tax on an 80% markup because
[SPEAKER_09]: I've done the math and 80% markup means
bankruptcy.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have payroll taxes, I have all these
other taxes that we haven't even got into
[SPEAKER_09]: as a normal retail would.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, God, I just went off track.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyone else can weigh in if you have
something to say about this, but you were
[SPEAKER_09]: talking about the bulk as opposed to-
Yeah, so for me, it just, I pay less on
[SPEAKER_09]: taxes and end up profiting more money when
I just sell my cultivation in bulk instead
[SPEAKER_09]: of spending the time to package it,
lab test it, put it through the retail and
[SPEAKER_09]: then pay full excise tax at the point of
sale, which sometimes I'm doing it 225%
[SPEAKER_09]: markup.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the whole system is wrong because you
have some people paying less taxes than
[SPEAKER_09]: others.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there are people that are working
the system, saying, oh yeah, I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_09]: remit my own taxes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they never remit any excise taxes
because they're doing distro to distro and
[SPEAKER_09]: the state and the city have not caught up
to it yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there's people out there that are
avoiding taxes on the excise side and
[SPEAKER_09]: claiming that they paid when they didn't
pay.
[SPEAKER_09]: And eventually that's gonna come back onto
the distributor as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there'll be a dispute of who
paid, who didn't pay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's even more problems coming down
the line.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's gonna be huge because that one
you're talking about millions and millions
[SPEAKER_09]: of dollars.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, just in excise tax alone,
we pay over two and a half million a year.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, excise and sales tax, not just
excise to the state.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's a lot of money that people
are basically frauding this data.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're in the tax war story
section, part of our discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone else wanna weigh in on this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Tom, this is Adam.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is definitely a pet peeve of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a pet peeve of the legal
industries in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe for your viewers or
listeners, maybe an analogy might be
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I totally appreciate it and can
understand the legal cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't like comparisons to legal alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do think is an interesting
perception of what happened post
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1932, we lifted prohibition and because
of supply and demand, alcohol was this
[SPEAKER_01]: robust industry all underground,
unregulated, unprotected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we lift prohibition in 1932.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first federal tax in 1933 on
alcohol was 2% because they were trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: transition that robust legal industry into
regulated means and it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously it took some time and they
staggered the tax rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they went from two to six to 13 to
probably 3000 right now, who the hell
[SPEAKER_01]: knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point is, it doesn't matter what
the tax rate now is on legal alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: They eradicated the illicit competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: They staged up the taxation and made sure
that they were capturing this new legal
[SPEAKER_01]: market of legal alcohol again,
through regulated means and channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've not done that in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in California, I know Jackie was
bringing up reporters out there that are
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to capture the story and the
essence of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no other example that exists in
the world like California, where we had a
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 plus year history under compassionate
use to create collective models and
[SPEAKER_01]: medical protections for patients and
consumers and co-ops that turned into a
[SPEAKER_01]: multi-billion dollar industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in California, it's basically the
analogy I like to use is that Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: Illinois, some of these other states or
Canada, in a large sense, they got to play
[SPEAKER_01]: with a blank chess board and figure out
what to do with legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they still had their challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: California, we passed Prop 64,
predating that the MCRSA and then Malcursa
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started with a chess board where
pieces were all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no one can figure out what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our argument was always, and Greg was
part of this from the beginning,
[SPEAKER_01]: you just need to incentivize the illicit
folks to come out of that gray area and
[SPEAKER_01]: into legal in whatever way possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We proposed registries, checks and
balances within those registries,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just get people to come out of the
shadows and start being on the right side
[SPEAKER_01]: of legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've never done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're two and a half years in,
we've created this price point
[SPEAKER_01]: disparagement that's so severe that,
and Greg can speak to us, I'm sure others,
[SPEAKER_01]: they all had friends that were playing in
that gray market in the collective model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of their friends said,
good luck to you, but I'm not going there
[SPEAKER_01]: because what's in it for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna lose money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I'm ever gonna get caught
doing what I'm doing, which is now
[SPEAKER_01]: completely illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just take their chances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a part of this discussion definitely
has to be enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in particular, deterrence for illicit
activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now we have none.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of any sort of felony charges or
prosecution were taken away under Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think at that time, certainly giving
sympathy to the war on drugs, you could
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the logic, but now post Prop 64
and licensing for the legal industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're making clear distinction between
legal and illegal, yet we have no
[SPEAKER_01]: deterrence for the illicit operator to
think twice about starting a illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically it's a line item in their
budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: In LA, we're playing whack-a-mole every
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to bring up LA, obviously you have a
broader audience in that, but LA sets the
[SPEAKER_01]: tone for the whole state's market because
of how big it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in LA, Greg and others like him can't
compete because while the city's trying
[SPEAKER_01]: their best to enforce and shut down a lot
of illegal stores, and they just finalized
[SPEAKER_01]: a padlocking order in the city to be able
to close down illegal stores, they still
[SPEAKER_01]: find a way to open back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they'll open back up in the same
strip mall, in a new address, but 40 feet
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got to start the whole process
over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's just got to be critical
to the discussion that there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: deterrence for illegal operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not afraid to keep doing what
they're doing because the clientele's
[SPEAKER_01]: there, and it's a risk-reward thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The risk is very minimal for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone want to just weigh in?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the best way to write this
imbalance?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it enforcement, which is the stick or
carrots, reducing taxes, incentivizing
[SPEAKER_02]: patients and consumers to come back to the
legal market?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do we get there?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's happening in Sacramento?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they just simply not listening?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I mean, honestly, I don't think
enforcement ever really is going to work.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have way too many hidden places in Los
Angeles and way too many people for them
[SPEAKER_09]: to find everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: And beyond the whack-a-mole, I had an
illegal retailer maybe a thousand feet
[SPEAKER_09]: from me.
[SPEAKER_09]: It took gangs and narcotics seven times
raiding him.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then finally, the last time,
the idiot decided to run up the street
[SPEAKER_09]: with a bag full of cash.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they got him on some other charges,
not even cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that's what finally closed him.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, and I have friends.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a lot of friends that are still in
the illegal market because there's no more
[SPEAKER_09]: gray area now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have no intention of coming in.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they call me the idiot for paying all
this money in taxes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And while I'm suffering... I think they're
right.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we knew then what we know now.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I mean, I probably would have
invested in real estate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Tom, I would just say this,
and I'd definitely turn it over to the
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's a silver bullet,
in my opinion, just fixing taxes,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially understanding the landscape of
how difficult it has been to get any sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of tax relief the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't think that's gonna change
the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do certainly sympathize with Greg and
understand what he's talking about from an
[SPEAKER_01]: actual enforcement standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, illegal operators have been
pretty damn good at hiding for 20 plus
[SPEAKER_01]: years, if not more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a lot of confidence that
they won't get caught.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think more deterrence is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, going after the landlords that
safe harbor these folks, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing things like that and having more
administrative enforcement rather than
[SPEAKER_01]: boots on the ground enforcement,
you know, is a help.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like Reggie Jones-Sawyer and
assembly member Rubio, both have bills in
[SPEAKER_01]: the legislature that may not go anywhere
this year because of COVID-19.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Reggie's bill is to go after landlords
to the tune of $50,000 a day, if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: having an illegal cannabis operator in one
of their premises.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rubio's bill is to go after the operator
to the tune of $30,000 a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Greg was there, you know, from the
beginning in LA, we tried to fight for as
[SPEAKER_01]: much enforcement under Prop M as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we settled on trying to do $20,000 a
day fines attached to the landlord and the
[SPEAKER_01]: operator, if they were caught thinking it
was more of an administrative action and
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can send letters and the city
attorney can start, you know, enforcing
[SPEAKER_01]: and adjudicating, and then we come to find
out they can't enforce it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they don't think the city
attorney doesn't think we can win those
[SPEAKER_01]: battles in court to charge people $20,000
a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we're sitting there looking
back at it, you know, now saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, why the fuck did you write it into
the ordinance, you know, and into the
[SPEAKER_01]: initiative if you didn't think you can
enforce it?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think enforcement's key.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think more licensing's key.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree with Greg.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's, you know, there's a lot
of licenses out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's an overabundance of
cultivation licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to a safe access
standpoint, you can get into pockets of
[SPEAKER_01]: the state where you might have to go 75
miles just to get to a licensed retailer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it does matter in that regard
because the illicit market will follow
[SPEAKER_01]: where the clientele's gonna be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll just leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just quickly, I'm a big fan of concrete
examples.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Greg touched on kind of the craziness
that is taxes from the retailer
[SPEAKER_08]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shannon, you wear two hats, distributor
and brand.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure Flo Khanna has a distribution
license, too, and is also a brand.
[SPEAKER_08]: So can you guys just talk about some of
the crazy stuff of how you're taxed from a
[SPEAKER_08]: brand and distributor perspective?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Jackie, you're in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_08]: So can you talk about the tax
conversations you're having with the Lori
[SPEAKER_08]: Ajax's Nicole Elliott's Fiona Maz of the
world and kind of where their heads are
[SPEAKER_08]: at?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually not my lane.
[SPEAKER_07]: I spent time at K Street where K Street
had dedicated lobbyists working on those
[SPEAKER_07]: issues, and I'm no longer with K Street.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I did want to touch on enforcement.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'll let Shannon and Amanda talk
about the taxes at those levels that
[SPEAKER_07]: they're experiencing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't stand when we have any
conversation about enforcement where
[SPEAKER_07]: operators are asking for increased law
enforcement presence because that didn't
[SPEAKER_07]: work for 20 years under Prop 215 when
commercial activity was illegal and it was
[SPEAKER_07]: a felony.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so now it's a misdemeanor and we're
expecting a lesser offense to work to
[SPEAKER_07]: prohibit the illegal market from existing
and flourishing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's the wrong approach.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that in the Prop 215 days that
dispensaries were paying sales tax.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't believe that that ever
stopped.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so if the old BOE, which is now the
CDTFA, is knocking on illegal dispensaries
[SPEAKER_07]: doors and demanding tax payment,
is that not the definition of taxation
[SPEAKER_07]: without representation?
[SPEAKER_07]: And if they're paying those taxes still
currently and they're illegal,
[SPEAKER_07]: why can't we tax them more and even the
playing field?
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the only way that the legal market
will ever thrive is if we can bring these
[SPEAKER_07]: two into alignment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then let the consumer decide.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in Florida right now and I love
getting into a new area.
[SPEAKER_07]: Typically I do this in California,
but I'm in Florida so I did it here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I went to a city council meeting two
days ago where a band was on the agenda
[SPEAKER_07]: and I just wanted to see another state,
how they were having this conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have been asking about the illicit
market to anybody that will talk to me
[SPEAKER_07]: here and whether or not they purchased in
the illicit market and if they purchased
[SPEAKER_07]: in the legal market as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the illicit market here is even bigger
than I had ever dreamed because I talked
[SPEAKER_07]: to one girl and she loves the dispensaries
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: But even without taxes, those dispensaries
are charging $55 an eighth.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the girl that I had asked about her
purchases in the illegal market,
[SPEAKER_07]: she said hers directly from a licensed
operator out of Washington state,
[SPEAKER_07]: mails it directly to her and she can get
an ounce for $200.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so if our legal market has their paws
all up in the illicit market and is now
[SPEAKER_07]: going direct to consumer across the
country, like we're in trouble.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we need to be thinking along those
lines.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the illicit market doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: How are consumers purchasing their
product?
[SPEAKER_07]: What are they getting?
[SPEAKER_07]: What are they getting it for?
[SPEAKER_07]: And how can we compete?
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the conversation that has to be
had.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the only way the legal market
across the country is ever going to thrive
[SPEAKER_07]: is if we're actually having the honest
conversation about what a consumer is
[SPEAKER_07]: getting for their dollar.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've never had that conversation and it
boggles my mind how we never took a
[SPEAKER_07]: consumer into the picture.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is Greg and I just want to touch
on what Jackie said.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some things I agree, some things I don't.
[SPEAKER_09]: But as far as for the taxes, majority,
super majority, I'm not going to say all
[SPEAKER_09]: because there's probably some people that
are paying, but I could say 99% of
[SPEAKER_09]: retailers, illegal retailers here are
paying zero tax, sale tax, zero.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe that the CDTFA should go
after them for tax evasion.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like any other business.
[SPEAKER_09]: And just like they did to Al Capone,
you cannot, you have no defense against
[SPEAKER_09]: tax evasion.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you're not paying the state and our
government taxes, then I hope you're out
[SPEAKER_09]: in jail.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my feelings, because I pay lots of
taxes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if that's how you want to be,
whether legal or illegal, you should go to
[SPEAKER_09]: jail.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not for cannabis, because I have my own,
you know, I got charged with triple felony
[SPEAKER_09]: in 2007 for just $50, 55 grams of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I really don't like seeing anybody
going to jail just because of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you're not paying your taxes and
you're doing other things wrong,
[SPEAKER_09]: then yeah, you should.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's an easy case.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know why they haven't done
more of that because there is no defense
[SPEAKER_09]: for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then as far as legal people going
direct to market in another state,
[SPEAKER_09]: I would not believe the consumer and what
she's saying because there's so many
[SPEAKER_09]: fraudulent products out there,
where they're making counterfeits of other
[SPEAKER_09]: people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I could be an illegal person.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Washington is very, and Oregon,
they are probably, well, Washington,
[SPEAKER_09]: Oregon, California, we are the worst.
[SPEAKER_09]: We send so much stuff out of state.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, anyone could say,
oh, yeah, it's a legal product.
[SPEAKER_09]: I ordered some, you know, I could order,
well, I don't know about now during COVID,
[SPEAKER_09]: but you know, I could have ordered brass
knuckles packaging in parts and filled it
[SPEAKER_09]: up and said, yeah, it's brass knuckles and
send it across the country.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, a lot of brands are having
serious issues with that and getting,
[SPEAKER_09]: and that gets into the point of where you
said, Jackie, what is the consumer getting
[SPEAKER_09]: for their dollar?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, in the illegal market, they're
getting illegal products that are not lab
[SPEAKER_09]: tested and could be severely bad for their
health, especially during the time of
[SPEAKER_09]: COVID, where we know that people with
breathing problems can, are more
[SPEAKER_09]: susceptible and can die and pesticides,
you know, I don't know, people don't
[SPEAKER_09]: realize pesticide is a nerve agent and it
actually lowers your white blood cell
[SPEAKER_09]: count, which makes it, you know,
hello, you're going to die even easier
[SPEAKER_09]: now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a very important point,
but that gets into the educating.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe we need the state and not
the states, all the states that are legal
[SPEAKER_09]: to do an education program, to educate,
to do more to educate the consumer and
[SPEAKER_09]: like, look, you might be saving a couple
of bucks getting it from the street,
[SPEAKER_09]: but is your life worth it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it worth it to risk your health and
wellbeing just to save a few bucks?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and it has to, but that's where
that difference has to come in,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's a $50 difference where you're
paying double the price, the consumer is
[SPEAKER_09]: going to definitely risk it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if we could get that to be very close
to where it's only a few dollar
[SPEAKER_09]: difference, then, then they probably
wouldn't risk it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, and a lot of consumers, they don't
even know they're going into illegal
[SPEAKER_06]: shops.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we talk about it in the industry
and we can all list the legal,
[SPEAKER_06]: the, you know, unregulated shops around
us, but your average consumer,
[SPEAKER_06]: all they know is they drove by a building
with a green cross in the window and they
[SPEAKER_06]: went and got a great deal on product.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and the BCC sent out those QR
codes for people to scan.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know anyone that's ever walked in
and looked for the QR code to verify that
[SPEAKER_06]: they're in a legal shop.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so we've got to get that
conversation outside of the industry and
[SPEAKER_06]: to the average consumer so that they know
that they have the choice of purchasing
[SPEAKER_06]: regulated or unregulated.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, the bottom line is we've got
to simplify the amount of compliance in
[SPEAKER_06]: this industry and we've got to simplify
taxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a distributor, I'm playing tax money.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not responsible for taxes,
but I'm responsible for collecting taxes
[SPEAKER_06]: and then remitting.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just, that's absurd.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no other industry where someone's
paying taxes on behalf of someone else's
[SPEAKER_06]: business.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to say something to that real
important before I forget, because,
[SPEAKER_09]: and I, and if you're only distributors
know this, they tax us on the excise tax.
[SPEAKER_09]: They count the excise tax that we're
collecting from the retailer.
[SPEAKER_09]: They tax that tax.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's really not in the benefit of the
distributor to collect and remit because
[SPEAKER_09]: we're getting on a tax that we're not even
making money off of.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're doing a service, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Having to pay for the accounting and the
bookkeeping and all of the things.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, you know, I mean, just the
compliance side of it as the other reason
[SPEAKER_06]: the regulated market's really struggling
right now is we've got to make sure that
we're doing the right thing.
We've got to make sure that we're doing
the right thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you think about the old days,
you were a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_06]: You had a few plants in your backyard or
in your basement.
[SPEAKER_06]: You trimmed them at your kitchen table.
[SPEAKER_06]: You put them in a backpack and you went to
the retailer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you were, it was one set of
hands touching it throughout the process
[SPEAKER_06]: on one piece of property.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now we've got, you know, all of the
regulations for setting up a farm,
[SPEAKER_06]: getting permitted, staying compliant with,
you know, with cultivation.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to have vans.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got to have someone that knows
metric on the cultivation side,
[SPEAKER_06]: someone that knows metric on the
distribution side.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're inventorying the stuff twice a
month.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, we're paying that overhead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we've got to have somebody that,
you know, metricing, pulling it out,
[SPEAKER_06]: putting it on another van, trying to
schedule to get into retailers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with COVID coming on, retailers have
limited hours now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, we were doing deliveries
five days a week.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now most shops are taking deliveries
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we're having to put more vehicles,
more people on the road to get there
[SPEAKER_06]: between 10 and four, three days a week,
where previously it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: eight to six, five days a week.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's, there's a lot of things in the
supply chain that were already on the
[SPEAKER_06]: brink that are getting constricted even
further.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to see a next round of
extinction, I think, happen in the next
[SPEAKER_06]: couple of months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you want to weigh in?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't really speak to the specifics of
taxation on distribution because that's
[SPEAKER_04]: not my role at the company.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in community development.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do a lot of policy work and that
policy is my background and not business.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will talk more about policy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did have the LAO report that came
out last year, which is the legislative
[SPEAKER_04]: analyst office that basically looks at how
the system is working and then makes
[SPEAKER_04]: recommendations about how they feel we can
change the regulations in order to bring
[SPEAKER_04]: what we're seeing more in line with what
the goals of legalization were.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the big goals of legalization
was to eliminate the unregulated
[SPEAKER_04]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the LAO looks and sees how well are we
doing that?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing terrible at that, as has
already been discussed by other panelists.
[SPEAKER_04]: One out of every $4 spent on cannabis is
being spent in the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three out of every $4 spent on cannabis in
California is being spent on the
[SPEAKER_04]: unregulated market.
[SPEAKER_04]: So obviously, there's a huge disconnect.
[SPEAKER_04]: As was mentioned, part of this issue is
that we had a very robust gray market for
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 years to the point where, in many ways,
it mimicked what the regulated market
[SPEAKER_04]: ended up looking like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So unlike other states, even states that
had medical prior to legalization,
[SPEAKER_04]: which they all did, they didn't have these
gray market scenarios, even Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado had a very regulated medical
cannabis program when they legalized.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they already had a licensing structure
in place.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were licensing the entire supply
chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Folks may forget, prior to legalization,
the only people in the state that had a
[SPEAKER_04]: license to do anything were a handful of
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even they risked federal interference
and risked getting shut down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was really not a stable environment
for anyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, now we're trying to bring some
stability into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think with that, we're constricting
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what the LAO's office recommended was
that we eliminate the cultivation tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's something that absolutely
impacts the folks that we work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: No other crop has a separate tax
associated with just the fact that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: growing the crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: The second issue is the way that tax is
collected.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the cultivation tax, as was mentioned,
is collected by the distributor.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have to collect that before we have
any idea how that product is going to
[SPEAKER_04]: perform in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: So individuals are paying cultivation tax
based on weight prior to the product
[SPEAKER_04]: actually getting into the marketplace to
where we know whether that's going to sell
[SPEAKER_04]: well, whether it's not going to sell well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is completely unpredictable right
now as to what's going to go on dispensary
[SPEAKER_04]: shelves, what's going to sell,
what's not going to sell.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it makes it really difficult,
especially for smaller cultivators,
[SPEAKER_04]: to be able to have any kind of assurance
of their economics and how things are
[SPEAKER_04]: going to work and how much they need to
grow in order to pay the tax, in order to
[SPEAKER_04]: sell this much.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think eliminating the cultivation tax
is a really good first step.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the second issue is about the
excise tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: So excise tax is syntax.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tax that we put on products that we
think are going to cause some kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: public health or safety harm to the
community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we feel that that tax money is there
in order to make up for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, tobacco tax, alcohol tax,
the idea is that if you drink for 50 years
[SPEAKER_04]: and end up in the hospital with cirrhosis
of the liver and that society has to pay
[SPEAKER_04]: for those medical bills, that that's
supported by the excise tax that people
[SPEAKER_04]: pay on alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: So of course, when we were legalizing
cannabis, there was a lot of comparisons
[SPEAKER_04]: being made to alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: And unlike alcohol prohibition when it
ended, it hadn't been that long since we'd
[SPEAKER_04]: had legal alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people getting back into legal alcohol
after alcohol prohibition wasn't as
[SPEAKER_04]: jarring.
[SPEAKER_04]: With cannabis, we've had decades and
decades and decades of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we came and said, all right,
now it's time to legalize folks were like,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, you've got to have a syntax because
legalization is going to cause all of this
[SPEAKER_04]: harm, health harm and safety harm and bus
drivers are going to be smoking weed and
[SPEAKER_04]: your pilot's going to be smoking weed and
your teenager is going to be smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need a hefty excise tax to make
sure that society doesn't end up footing
[SPEAKER_04]: the bill for all of these harms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, those of us who study cannabis
knew that was all bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: We knew there weren't going to be these
harms that we see with other substances,
[SPEAKER_04]: but that was the thinking of folks who
were making the rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they felt cannabis needed an
excise tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: So last thing I'll say.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we are with this excise tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: The excise tax is being levied on the
consumer, the consumer that is currently
[SPEAKER_04]: spending three out of $4 in the
unregulated marketplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the theory is that if you reduce
taxes, you make less revenue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that has been one of the reasons that
the state has been very reticent to touch
[SPEAKER_04]: the excise tax, especially right now,
given that we've pushed back tax filing in
[SPEAKER_04]: California till July.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're like, we don't even know how
much money we're going to have.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are we going to cut excise tax?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't even know how much money we're
going to have.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, here's the rub.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is because we have this
unregulated marketplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cutting excise tax may reduce temporarily
and in a very specific way, the amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: tax that dispensaries remit because of
that excise amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, what it also does is have people
buy more product because it's cheaper and
[SPEAKER_04]: they're paying less for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are going into regulated stores
instead of unregulated stores because the
[SPEAKER_04]: price differential is more similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the end, you actually end up making
more money if you just reduce that tax and
[SPEAKER_04]: bring more people into the regulated
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think from a taxation perspective,
what we're really advocating for is the
[SPEAKER_04]: elimination of the cultivation tax and a
hefty reduction of the excise tax,
[SPEAKER_04]: at least for the next few years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other whole side of this is
the fact that consumers don't have a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of money right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's pushing them even more into
the unregulated market, which is even
[SPEAKER_04]: bigger reason for us to reduce the excise
tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because on top of all the other public
safety issues, we had EVALI.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that like that's all old news.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are like, EVALI?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the vaping illness,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we know that a lot of those
situations are tied to people buying
[SPEAKER_04]: unregulated products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now that we have this lung illness of
COVID going through the country,
[SPEAKER_04]: are we really going to keep prices so high
in the regulated marketplace of an
[SPEAKER_04]: essential business that we're pushing
people to buy unregulated vape carts,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is just going to increase the
likelihood of lung disease?
[SPEAKER_04]: And people listening to this are like,
that makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what the impact of propaganda
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the impact of 50 years of trying
to convince people that cannabis is evil,
[SPEAKER_04]: that people that use cannabis are evil,
because this is what it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes people completely reject logic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes them not think about business
models.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes them react to how they feel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the things we should be doing as
an industry, really, is going back to our
[SPEAKER_04]: activism days when we were really,
really good at changing hearts and minds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were really, really good at making
people feel a certain way about our
[SPEAKER_04]: mission.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like we've gotten away from
that a little bit because we're trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: go about it legitimately, and we're trying
to lobby our legislators, and we're trying
[SPEAKER_04]: to form these relationships.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're not going into city council
meetings anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going and talking about the fact
that it's 75 miles to a licensed
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary, and how is grandma going to
get her meds?
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't talk about that anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like it's done us a disservice
in moving things forward as an industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just quickly, Nicole Elliott just
joined the conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nicole, we will gently ease you in.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just listen for a minute, and then you
can get up to speed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amanda, I love everything you were just
talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: In 2015, at the State of Marijuana,
we had Tony Olivera, an economist,
[SPEAKER_08]: speak.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was talking all about price.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you have a comparable product,
which is the traditional market product,
[SPEAKER_08]: you can only tax people so much before.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basic economics.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought, from my perspective,
common sense would prevail when you have a
[SPEAKER_08]: competing product.
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously, it didn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to send everybody that link,
because I think it's like everything he
[SPEAKER_08]: was talking about in 2015 of what not to
do has since happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he could do a mic drop.
[SPEAKER_08]: With the cultivation tax, which I think
every grower would agree with you,
[SPEAKER_08]: just out of curiosity, which agencies or
who in the government do you approach to
[SPEAKER_08]: say, hey, this is crazy?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it Richard Parrott, the CDFA?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it Newsom's office?
[SPEAKER_08]: Who do you talk to and start that
conversation with?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think a lot of it is thinking
about where your options lie at any given
[SPEAKER_04]: moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there's a vehicle that is in the
legislature to do some of these things,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's really about supporting that vehicle.
[SPEAKER_04]: This past year, we had AB 1948 that was
introduced by Assemblymember Bonner.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a great example of what
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a lot of opportunity to
think about what we need to do for this
[SPEAKER_04]: industry to help us get through these next
few years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that there are some sweeping
steps that we're going to need to take to
[SPEAKER_04]: make sure that this industry stays afloat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this isn't just for the sake of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that you're right that the
industry sometimes sounds like we're like
[SPEAKER_04]: big tobacco coming and asking for
corporate tax breaks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand that, which is why I'm
like, let's start getting the public back
[SPEAKER_04]: involved and get them to start talking
about this as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think for the state of California,
I can't imagine a world where having a
[SPEAKER_04]: struggling cannabis industry is helpful to
the economic recovery of the state of
[SPEAKER_04]: California post-COVID.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot imagine a scenario where we are
not looking to the cannabis industry to be
[SPEAKER_04]: robust and to be and fulfill its promise
and fulfill what it can be when the state
[SPEAKER_04]: so badly needs new jobs.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the state so badly needs
opportunities for people who have been
[SPEAKER_04]: displaced from other industries.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is a time for us to come
together and kind of get over the fact
[SPEAKER_04]: that it's cannabis and start talking about
it as an economic driver, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: honestly what it's always been,
even when it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we can talk about the illegal economy
and how much that has supported California
[SPEAKER_04]: over the years because it absolutely has.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we have the opportunity to bring
that industry above board and to allow it
[SPEAKER_04]: to really shine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, to really come into its own.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we just need folks to get out of our
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the analogy I like to use is that,
you know, if cannabis is a lifeboat and
[SPEAKER_04]: we're telling the state of California,
look, we can bring some folks into this
[SPEAKER_04]: lifeboat.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to shoulder this alone,
but this lifeboat is full of holes and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not seaworthy and we can barely use
it to sustain ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Help us patch this boat and we will bring
people into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that is what I'm really looking
for, is a way for the cannabis industry to
[SPEAKER_04]: be what it needs to be for the state of
California.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Nicole, let me cue you up.
[SPEAKER_08]: A thriving industry generates lots of jobs
and taxes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Currently the cannabis industry has a
whole bunch of diseases and is very sick.
[SPEAKER_08]: So can you talk about kind of what the
governor's office is thinking as it looks
[SPEAKER_08]: at this sick patient and how to get it
healthy and contributing economically and
[SPEAKER_08]: financially to the state, the great state
of California?
[SPEAKER_05]: Apologies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sort of in and out of this
conversation because I'm working on a
[SPEAKER_05]: couple of other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't have this held on my calendar,
but I believe the question was really
[SPEAKER_05]: about mechanisms for health.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what you asked?
[SPEAKER_05]: Health of the industry?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, basically every operator,
there is not a single licensed operator
[SPEAKER_08]: who would disagree with these statements
that they're basically trying to be
[SPEAKER_08]: businesses with two hands tied behind
their backs as compared to any other
[SPEAKER_08]: industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: California cannabis is not a poster child
for success.
[SPEAKER_08]: So from the governor's perspective,
do you see that and where's the governor's
[SPEAKER_08]: office's head at in terms of how do we fix
this problem?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it goes without saying that the
governor recognizes the challenges of the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something that he talked a lot
about last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: We collectively talked a lot about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just I think that to sort of gut check
this conversation, of course, nobody saw a
[SPEAKER_05]: pandemic hit the state of California,
the nation, the world in the way that we
[SPEAKER_05]: are now experiencing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that sort of turned many things,
not sort of, it has turned many things
[SPEAKER_05]: upside down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've seen the state really expend an
exceptional amount of resources in trying
[SPEAKER_05]: to preserve people's lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in that effort, obviously,
there was a lot of thought given to what
[SPEAKER_05]: businesses would remain open and what
businesses wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the governor, as you guys clearly
know, didn't put this essential in that
[SPEAKER_05]: effort.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we talk about what lies ahead and
what can be done for the industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to make sure that we're doing it in
the context of the here and now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is a challenged economic time for
everyone in the state, including
[SPEAKER_05]: businesses that were not deemed essential.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we as a state are going to have a
challenging economic forecast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need to keep that in mind when we
talk about what resources the state can
[SPEAKER_05]: expend.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it is important to contemplate
changes that can be made absent those
[SPEAKER_05]: resources.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thinking about those administrative
changes that can be made.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then perhaps even statutory changes,
knowing what we're up against in the
[SPEAKER_05]: legislature as far as the legislature
having bandwidth to take up anything
[SPEAKER_05]: non-COVID related at this time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a long winded way of saying,
we're sort of seeing where everything,
[SPEAKER_05]: the dust, settles and trying to figure out
how to best proceed, knowing that our
[SPEAKER_05]: objective has been and will continue to be
to ease the burdens on the industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether that be regulatory, administrative
or financial, where possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that has to be couched in the context
of these times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Nicole, this is Adam Spiker.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you, Adam?
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just enjoying life here in Southern
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally appreciate everything you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you and I've talked before,
I think the legal industry has complete
[SPEAKER_01]: sympathy and respect for what the
priorities have to be for the
[SPEAKER_01]: administration given COVID-19 and what
we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would say to you is, and we've
talked about it privately, but what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to do is just present a fixer two
for the industry that is now two and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half years in and just, frankly,
getting its ass kicked by the illicit
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you mentioned, obviously,
that the budget and other panelists talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about it more candidly before you joined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, the budget is in peril.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one knows what that budget is going to
look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no one knows when the, we don't know
if the Trump administration is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: help relieve the state of California,
its local governments.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that aside, I do think that there is
an argument to make that the legal
[SPEAKER_01]: industry has now two and a half years in
not had a chance to compete.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also believe in, you know,
the LAO report got brought up earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's faults in that report.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish there was time to refute them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've tried to refute it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they show their work very
well for others outside of it to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to take that work and try to refute it,
especially as it relates to the illicit
[SPEAKER_01]: market and trying to offset tax
reductions, not simplification or
[SPEAKER_01]: restructuring, but offset tax relief by
capturing more of the illicit market into
[SPEAKER_01]: the regulating realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would assume you agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a challenge in this
environment, but I'd be remiss if I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: bring it up as just something that,
you know, if we were going to pick one or
[SPEAKER_01]: two things that are a priority for an
industry where all these industries and
[SPEAKER_01]: all these residents and constituents are
coming to the governor's office and the
[SPEAKER_01]: administration saying we need help,
if we could focus on one or two things for
[SPEAKER_01]: the legal cannabis, it would have to start
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the story's on our side.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, as far as responding to that,
I think what I'm hearing you say is as an
[SPEAKER_05]: industry, if the industry were to have to
pick one or two things to focus on this
[SPEAKER_05]: year, enforcement should be top of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that accurate?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me broaden that and certainly allow
others to chime in.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end point, it becomes the price
point for the illegal market versus the
[SPEAKER_01]: legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now it's about double,
and Greg can chime in and others that are
[SPEAKER_01]: operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we restructure taxes or simplify them,
but the end result is that a consumer,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in a world where unemployment,
I think in the states about 4 million and
[SPEAKER_01]: nationally 30 million, they're going to be
more price conscious.
[SPEAKER_01]: If at the end of the day, legal cannabis
is double the price just to make ends meet
[SPEAKER_01]: of the illicit, they don't have a chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's the economic argument,
but I want to make clear to you that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: sympathetic of understanding that the
governor's got a lot on his plate,
[SPEAKER_01]: and certainly the administration and the
legislature has a lot on their plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also believe that there's 80% of the
demand for cannabis in the state there to
[SPEAKER_01]: be captured by the state and local
governments in regulated means.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just need it to be more competitive in
order to start capturing more of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, this is Greg.
[SPEAKER_09]: And just to reiterate everything that Adam
said, it's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just had another illegal store open up
1,000 feet from me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so enforcement is never truly going to
work, and you're never going to really get
[SPEAKER_09]: rid of all the illegals, especially in a
big city where everything's so congested.
[SPEAKER_09]: And law enforcement already has their
hands full because gangs and narcotics are
[SPEAKER_09]: the ones that are doing the investigations
and raids.
[SPEAKER_09]: And like we had discussed earlier,
now they're doing investigations and
[SPEAKER_09]: trying to do raids on people that it's not
even a felony now selling illegal
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I believe the only way is going to be
through reducing the taxes so that we can
[SPEAKER_09]: be competitive with the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that way, the consumer, and it doesn't
have to be lower than the illicit market
[SPEAKER_09]: or even equal.
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's just to the point where it's only
a couple of dollars or a few dollars more
[SPEAKER_09]: expensive, we can start also an education
program where it starts educating the
[SPEAKER_09]: consumer that, hey, yeah, maybe the
illicit market is only a couple dollars
[SPEAKER_09]: more now since we lowered the taxes.
[SPEAKER_09]: But is your health worth paying a couple
of dollars less to buy illegal products
[SPEAKER_09]: that are not lab tested?
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's two things, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: You've got to lower the taxes,
and you have to do an education program.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like we see all those commercials on TV
for the vaping and tobacco.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, don't buy illegal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Buy legal cannabis because it's not going
to kill you, and it's not going to have
[SPEAKER_09]: pesticides in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I got.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to add one dynamic in here,
if I could, as a consumer and a patient
[SPEAKER_02]: who increasingly sees the industry from
that perspective almost actually now
[SPEAKER_02]: universally, I wonder how the powers that
be, are they cognizant of the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: anger there is at being charged usury tax
rates as a consumer?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these taxes roll downhill right
onto us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd be interested to get a perspective
from retailers there, people who are
[SPEAKER_02]: public facing, what they're hearing,
what they've dealt with, because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had no qualms over the years of
telling legislatures that I'm just one
[SPEAKER_02]: person.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd be interested in people's thoughts
on that dynamic, because I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: real.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tom, you're absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_09]: The retailers being in the tip of the
spear, if you want to call it,
[SPEAKER_09]: we get bashed for everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: The consumers love to bash us.
[SPEAKER_09]: The taxes are our fault somehow.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_09]: They are upset, and they have no problem
letting us retailers know that they're
[SPEAKER_09]: upset.
[SPEAKER_09]: And usually my answer is, please call your
legislator and let them know, because it's
[SPEAKER_09]: out of our control.
[SPEAKER_09]: But they are absolutely furious.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've been told, well, this is why I'm
never going to shop at the legal place.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to go up the street to the
illegal place.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they literally tell me where they're
going, because they think nothing's going
[SPEAKER_09]: to happen to that person.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's all a joke.
[SPEAKER_09]: Enforcement is a joke.
[SPEAKER_09]: And our taxes and our high prices are a
joke.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you probably have more like 60%,
70% of the market buying from illegal
[SPEAKER_09]: market, not from the legal market.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to add something that's kind of a
little bit of a different take on other
[SPEAKER_04]: ways from the consumer's perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Tom, I really agree with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Nicole, hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Amanda Reiman from Ops Ocona.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I first started doing research on
medical cannabis dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was 2005.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did a study on how dispensaries were
operating as community health service
[SPEAKER_04]: providers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was really because, as folks who
have been doing this for a while,
[SPEAKER_04]: no, in San Francisco coming out of the
AIDS crisis was really when you saw these
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensaries start to proliferate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you saw people providing community
services in addition to cannabis in these
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it wasn't just about buying weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was about taking yoga and working in
the garden and having access to internet
[SPEAKER_04]: and having access to peer support and
counseling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Americans for Safe Access used to come in
and do peer counseling.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had lawyers that would come in and give
free legal advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think all of this is to say that
kind of like taking a full spectrum plant
[SPEAKER_04]: and then distilling it into THC,
we've taken this beautiful cultural
[SPEAKER_04]: experience of interacting with cannabis
and distilled it to Walgreens.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that has really
disadvantaged the consumer, not just
[SPEAKER_04]: because of the taxes, but because of the
education and knowledge and community that
[SPEAKER_04]: they used to get from that experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of this is to say is that we need
alternative models of retail.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to start opening up the idea of
what it means to get cannabis and start
[SPEAKER_04]: offering other pathways to that besides
just dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need farmers markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need direct to consumer sales from the
farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need more opportunities for
subscription boxes and mail order.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need more opportunities for people to
grow and process their own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: At their own homes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to look at where they're not
allowed to do that and why, because that's
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely the most economical way to
consume cannabis is to grow it yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that, you know, we get focused
a lot on what the current model is and how
[SPEAKER_04]: we tweak those taxes and those models.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also think we need to be really
thinking outside the box, which is a term
[SPEAKER_04]: that I think is way overused, but thinking
back to those days of the community model
[SPEAKER_04]: of cannabis retail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it's not like we saw a huge
amount of social problems as a result of
[SPEAKER_04]: the fact that it was super easy for people
to go into dispensaries and get cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we aren't, we weren't trying to
solve for a public health crisis around
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis access.
[SPEAKER_04]: We never have, and we won't unless we keep
pushing people into unregulated
[SPEAKER_04]: marketplaces.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we will absolutely have a public
health crisis around cannabis with Ivali,
[SPEAKER_04]: which we had before COVID.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's just such a vulnerable
time for medical cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of them are immunocompromised anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the idea that they don't have the
access that they need, that they have to
[SPEAKER_04]: go through this one very specific model of
retail that may not speak to their needs,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think is also a big threat to the
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, those individuals are
going to still need their cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: they're going to get it from the place
that they feel is safest and is most
[SPEAKER_04]: economical to their needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not naive.
[SPEAKER_04]: These aren't new consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we really have to meet them where
they're at.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say, Amanda, that I
appreciate those comments.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate sort of, well, I really
appreciate the approach that you're coming
[SPEAKER_05]: at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though you hate the term thinking
outside the box, I think that's really
[SPEAKER_05]: what's necessary right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all really need to get creative in how
we approach addressing things like
[SPEAKER_05]: financial burdens and enforcement because
you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, tweaking the existing model is
one way of getting at it, but it's not the
[SPEAKER_05]: only way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we should really be maximizing,
you know, which avenues we're pursuing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just want to comment that I
think the I have a lot of respect for the
[SPEAKER_02]: argument, the health argument by legal,
by healthier.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it may not have as much
traction as it would otherwise precisely
[SPEAKER_02]: because so many of us do come out of the
gray or traditional market and have years
[SPEAKER_02]: of experience there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all come out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all were our children of the
traditional market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we weren't, you know, really suffering
horrible health consequences.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a result, plus, you know, people there
might indeed be more receptive to
[SPEAKER_02]: individual needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might know more what you're getting
than a CPG package in a retail store where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not exactly sure, despite the fact
that it has its COA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just think that those are subtle
dynamics that are very real with people
[SPEAKER_02]: and that cannabis is a very personalized,
individualized experience for so many
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't necessarily have that fear
of traversing the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think that dynamic is
necessarily true for new people coming in,
[SPEAKER_02]: but who don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that might be one of the,
you know, one of the problems with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think we also have to remember
that just like every substance,
[SPEAKER_04]: the majority of the substance is consumed
by a small percentage of the consumer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, when we talk about the
people that are buying the most cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: that are really making up the most of the
marketplace, it's a very small percentage
[SPEAKER_04]: of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if that's, if those are the people
that we need to get into the regulated
[SPEAKER_04]: marketplace, it's not the person that's
buying cannabis once a year or,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, for a special occasion,
because they are going to go to the
[SPEAKER_04]: regulated marketplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the person that is using cannabis
regularly for medicinal purposes,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's, you know, purchasing a larger
amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the person we need to bring in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's also the person that's most
likely going to go into the unregulated
[SPEAKER_04]: marketplace, both because of economics and
because of comfort with that marketplace.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those were the, those were the members of
the collectives.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those were the people who knew their
growers and were working with them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, we had 20 years of that and
we had 20 years of access to safe
[SPEAKER_06]: products.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a file folder in my home office
with lab reports from 2012, because we
[SPEAKER_06]: were testing before we delivered anything
to a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, so there were those mechanisms
in place for the dispensaries who were
[SPEAKER_06]: enforcing that and were only selling lab
tested products and they thrived and they
[SPEAKER_06]: did well under Prop 215.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because the consumers drove that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and that's something that,
you know, cannabis consumers, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: as you were saying, their relationship
with the plant is so personal and so
[SPEAKER_04]: intense that they really do think a lot
about what they want to put in their
[SPEAKER_04]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were demanding that dispensaries
give them more information.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I started working at
Berkeley Patients Group in 2010 and worked
[SPEAKER_04]: there until 2012.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we started to sell product that was
tested because patients were coming in and
[SPEAKER_04]: saying, I need to know what's in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I saw in the evolution from
like 2005 to 2012, edibles go from like
[SPEAKER_04]: just cellophane wrapped brownies with no
label, like a bake sale to people actually
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to tell you how much THC was in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this wasn't because the state was
making us do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were no rules around it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was because consumers were saying,
this is something that I need to make sure
[SPEAKER_04]: that I'm dosing myself accurately.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I really believe that if we opened
up more farm direct sales where farmers
[SPEAKER_04]: could sell directly to consumers,
we would capture a lot of those regular
[SPEAKER_04]: consumers, those that are consuming most
of the cannabis, because we're giving them
[SPEAKER_04]: a way to connect personally with the
product again and the farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's definitely something we lost,
you know, with all of the packaging,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I get, I totally understand why we
have it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, walking into a dispensary
and smelling like everything that they had
[SPEAKER_04]: behind the case and being able to choose,
you know, being able to have that more of
[SPEAKER_04]: that relationship with a farmer,
I think that's what that specific
[SPEAKER_04]: population of heavier consumers is looking
for.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not looking for like super low
dose, really pretty packaging,
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD treats.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they want to toe and talk to the
guy that grew their cannabis for like 40
[SPEAKER_04]: minutes about genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there isn't that outlet for those
folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, the area 101, you know,
old school Emerald cup types of
[SPEAKER_04]: environments.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: As you were talking, I was actually
writing down farmers markets and then you
[SPEAKER_08]: talked about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think for every farmer who grows
quality product and is a smart,
[SPEAKER_08]: intelligent person, that would be a
lifeline to survival because they're
[SPEAKER_08]: small.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't need to clear a lot of product
in December at a like Emerald you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: the NorCal farmers who would come down to
the Emerald exchange in December with
[SPEAKER_08]: their recent harvest, proudly sharing it
with the SoCal market and educating them
[SPEAKER_08]: on sun-grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't need to sell a lot to clear out
their inventory and be able to move on to
[SPEAKER_08]: thinking about the next season.
[SPEAKER_08]: And right now they're at the mercy of the
distribution networks and the retailers
[SPEAKER_08]: convincing consumers in LA that this tiny
brand is worth your time.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is also Greg and I just want to touch
on something because one thing that was
[SPEAKER_09]: mentioned also is the experience,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is something that the
dispensaries were robbed of is that
[SPEAKER_09]: experience and being able to provide that
experience where you show the product,
[SPEAKER_09]: you smell it, you actually get to see it
being weighed out in front of you.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that holistic approach that we
had coming out of the medical,
[SPEAKER_09]: we have lost that and that has also
affected us against the illicit market
[SPEAKER_09]: because they still are doing it that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: They do.
[SPEAKER_09]: With us, it's no longer personable,
that engagement, that relationship with
[SPEAKER_09]: the consumer, you know, it's become more
cold, you know, and we do different things
[SPEAKER_09]: to try to change that but it becomes very
difficult because you know, everything's
[SPEAKER_09]: prepackaged and the consumer, even though
in their mind, yeah, I see your little
[SPEAKER_09]: sample, I'm staring at it, but I still
really don't know until I get home when I
[SPEAKER_09]: open that package what I'm really getting.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that in a way has also affected the
legal retailers because that experience
[SPEAKER_09]: that we had brought kind of like a
farmer's market where you go, you look at
[SPEAKER_09]: the fruits and vegetables and everything,
it's gone, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: And we used to have a whole bunch of
vendors that would show up on our
[SPEAKER_09]: appreciation days once a month and they
would all have their products and they
[SPEAKER_09]: would all set up different tables like our
own little mini farmer's market and that
[SPEAKER_09]: experience is gone as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now when they show up, well,
now they don't show up because of COVID,
[SPEAKER_09]: nobody's showing up, but when they used
to, it became, oh, here's a hat or a
[SPEAKER_09]: t-shirt, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I could talk to you about the product
but I have nothing to show you,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it really changed the whole dynamic
of what we had gotten used to for over two
[SPEAKER_09]: decades, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that is a very, very good
point.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just quickly, because Nicole has to
jump off for a meeting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nicole, thank you for being such a good
sport.
[SPEAKER_08]: She had no idea that I was going to send
her a link to join this call and she
[SPEAKER_08]: joined it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's encourage her to do it again.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Nicole.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Nicole.
[SPEAKER_08]: But just quickly, you know, Nicole,
I sent you that link to the 2015 economist
[SPEAKER_08]: talking about price elasticity and
economics.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I hope the state views cannabis
like Walmart and Costco view profits,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is if there is a lot, if we do low
margins, which for the state would be low
[SPEAKER_08]: taxes and high volume, we will make more
money than high margins and low volume and
[SPEAKER_08]: all these small operators going extinct
and not being able to hire people and job
[SPEAKER_08]: losses and things like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, that's my two cents on how I
would hope the state approaches taxes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Nicole.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take care, you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Tom, our most- I actually have
a question for, I have a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do the people here think that generally
speaking, the state needs more legal
[SPEAKER_02]: shops?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think in certain areas they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just because there's so many areas
that have banned.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's not necessarily like,
are we adding more?
[SPEAKER_04]: In some places it's like, are we adding
any?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I think that the state
really should take this up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, this was something that we
had Flocon had put into our
[SPEAKER_04]: recommendations for legislation,
but we know that, you know, because of the
[SPEAKER_04]: budget and costs, but this idea of market
expansion and the state really getting
[SPEAKER_04]: involved in helping localities pass
commercial cultivation ordinances and
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis ordinances when maybe before
they've been reticent because they thought
[SPEAKER_04]: it was going to be too hard or they didn't
know what to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, so I think that if the
state can really start encouraging
[SPEAKER_04]: localities to pass ordinances and maybe
may generate a model ordinance or be
[SPEAKER_04]: willing to give them some support,
then we'll start to see some of these
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis deserts change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think now it's time to strike while
the iron is hot, because these localities
[SPEAKER_04]: are going to be looking for job creation.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be looking for sources of
revenue post COVID.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we hear countries all over the
world now talking about legalizing
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis as economic recovery functions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do think it's time and we could start
with localities that I always like to pick
[SPEAKER_04]: on Marin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start with Marin.
[SPEAKER_04]: That voted overwhelmingly for Prop 64,
but has banned commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, there's so much NIMBYism.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start there and let's really put
pressure on them to open it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So quick, quick adding to this,
does 64 need to be amended to do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it not codify the patchwork nature in
this state?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how do we get, how do we get there?
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely includes local control.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in order to change that, that's all
about the league of cities.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the league of cities, you know,
local control has been their sticking
[SPEAKER_04]: point for oh, 20 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: League of cities, long-term friends of the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, long-term friends of the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so local control was in the
medical legislation that was passed in
[SPEAKER_04]: 2015.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was actually stricter than it was
in Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually wanted to get rid of local
control in Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_04]: The compromise was to make it a little bit
less onerous than it was in the medical
[SPEAKER_04]: regs, but to still keep it in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have met with the league of cities.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've taken their temperature on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have had some leadership change.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been good leadership change,
but that's really who we have to have come
[SPEAKER_04]: to the table to really do anything to
eliminate local control.
[SPEAKER_04]: So absent of that, I think we need to make
it as easy as possible, like turnkey local
[SPEAKER_04]: regulation so that localities can just
turn it on or localities can pass an
[SPEAKER_04]: ordinance that says, if a business applies
for a state license and meets all those
[SPEAKER_04]: requirements, we will give them local
authorization.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we don't have to pass a local
ordinance, but if someone's ready to go
[SPEAKER_04]: and they meet all the requirements,
we will grant them authorization,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is what the state's looking for in
order to grant their licensure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that there's some ways that we
can wiggle around it, but until we really
[SPEAKER_04]: engage these localities, adding another
500 dispensaries in San Francisco or
[SPEAKER_04]: another thousand dispensaries in LA,
is gonna help some things, but it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna help a person that's in a cannabis
desert.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless we have mail order, then that would
help them.
[SPEAKER_11]: So who is we?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, go ahead, Jackie.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need more retail.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're at something like 1,150 when
you count storefront retail delivery and
[SPEAKER_07]: micro business with retail.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're somewhere around there for 40
million people in an incredibly big,
[SPEAKER_07]: vast state.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we need to figure out how to
incentivize local municipalities.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the beginning, it was, well,
you're not gonna get any enforcement
[SPEAKER_07]: dollars unless you regulate retail and
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that doesn't seem to have worked.
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe we have to up that amount that
jurisdictions are getting and then shine a
[SPEAKER_07]: big spotlight on it and say, look,
who's getting some tax dollars over here.
[SPEAKER_07]: But Los Angeles is very interesting and
it's the cannabis consumer capital of the
[SPEAKER_07]: world, I believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's more consumers per capita than in
any other jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we could get LA to at least be
moving in a positive direction,
[SPEAKER_07]: it could turn the entire industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know that there's been a lot of drama
over the first 100 equity permits that had
[SPEAKER_07]: been issued and a compromise to the 700
that are, and technically all 800 are
[SPEAKER_07]: sitting on the sidelines waiting for the
city to figure out what they're gonna do.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the compromise right now that is being
discussed in articles and in the community
[SPEAKER_07]: is that the 700 that did not receive that
first permit would qualify immediately for
[SPEAKER_07]: either manufacturing, distribution or
delivery.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if we were to turn on 700 delivery
licenses this year, that's a game changer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that could be the number one way to
try and compete with the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be the one thing that could
change the fact that LA needs enforcement.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be that we, instead of enforcing,
offer a way to compete.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if that was coupled with some sort of
equity easement of local taxes,
[SPEAKER_07]: then that could possibly spur other
jurisdictions to kind of follow suit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe making delivery an over the counter
permit like someone else just said before
[SPEAKER_07]: me, making sure that that delivery license
is compatible with all the state
[SPEAKER_07]: requirements and then just giving them an
over the counter permit locally.
[SPEAKER_07]: That could change everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And since we are an essential business,
I'm really hoping that we see some big win
[SPEAKER_07]: for the cannabis industry that comes out
of this crisis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just quickly, Greg, I'm gonna tee you
up.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just quickly, I mean, when Jackie
mentions delivery, it's almost as if we're
[SPEAKER_08]: aspiring to act like every other type of
product.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we all order stuff from Amazon.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think COVID is kind of putting delivery
in the spotlight in a positive way.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Greg, can you talk about your,
are you doing any delivery or do you have
[SPEAKER_08]: aspirations or what's your delivery plan?
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your strategy going forward?
[SPEAKER_09]: We are, and we actually started pretty
much with our delivery.
[SPEAKER_09]: So like I had said earlier, I'm licensed
in phase one since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our store has been around since 05,
micro business.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have three phase two licenses,
cultivation, manufacturing, distribution,
[SPEAKER_09]: and we got one of the 100 phase three
social equity licenses as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm in every phase of LA.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not believe that having seven hundred
delivery licenses come online will help
[SPEAKER_09]: anything at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm doing delivery.
[SPEAKER_09]: The max I get is 20 to 30.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't even know how the next 100 social
equity licenses, which the audit was
[SPEAKER_09]: completed and found that it's good to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we are gonna be moving forward with
issuing licenses for the 100.
[SPEAKER_09]: We did get that email.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a done deal.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no more argument there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, but the thing is, I feel that the
100 social equity licenses that are coming
[SPEAKER_09]: online, they're gonna fail.
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, they don't have the
contacts.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, unless they're partnered with
somebody like myself, who's experienced
[SPEAKER_09]: and who has the contacts and connections.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of manufacturers and distributors
and Flo Khanna could attest to this.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't have too much product left for
new retailers.
[SPEAKER_09]: I go on the website of Flo Khanna and it's
almost always sold out of a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_09]: and that they're not the only ones.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of distributors that are
already at their max capacity with the
[SPEAKER_09]: retailers that they already work with.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of these new businesses coming
online who have zero reputation,
[SPEAKER_09]: zero contacts and relationships with
vendors.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck getting anything on consignment.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that goes to the point that Jackie had
made in the very beginning, where people's
[SPEAKER_09]: AR boats are out of control because people
aren't paying.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're already too paranoid to do any
more consignment because they've already
[SPEAKER_09]: had that taste and it doesn't taste good.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you're gonna have a lot of
businesses coming online and failing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And my thing has always been is I don't
wanna set up anybody for failure.
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanna set them up for success.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it takes a little longer to do
that, then let it take a little longer and
[SPEAKER_09]: let's do it right.
[SPEAKER_09]: But to rush into and jump into and just do
licensing and then what?
[SPEAKER_09]: What did we really solve?
[SPEAKER_09]: What did we really achieve other than
having these people who are just thrown
[SPEAKER_09]: into a situation.
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't know anything about metric.
[SPEAKER_09]: I pay my metric compliance officer 6,000 a
month.
[SPEAKER_09]: How are these social equity people gonna
afford that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then metric, the amount of times it
goes offline and then you can't even get
[SPEAKER_09]: product onto the floor because you have to
wait hours and hours until it comes back
[SPEAKER_09]: online.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is so many intricacies and nuances
that really have to be done.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to create a social equity
education and mentorship program for
[SPEAKER_09]: success or else you could hand up
thousands of licenses and they're all
[SPEAKER_09]: gonna fail.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we expand about metric a little bit
here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Others, my fear is that metric is an
auditing tsunami waiting to happen for a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can people just kind of weigh in on their
perspectives and their experiences with
[SPEAKER_02]: metric?
[SPEAKER_09]: I could wait till somebody, I mean,
my experience has been insane.
[SPEAKER_09]: As a retailer, we deal with a lot more
line.
[SPEAKER_09]: On the distribution side, it's easy.
[SPEAKER_09]: We only have a handful of line items.
[SPEAKER_09]: But on the retail side, we have over 2,000
line items.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we get one order in from one
distributor and you have 60 different
[SPEAKER_09]: COAs.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to enter all of those in and it's
really a mess.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like before we would get a product in
medical days.
[SPEAKER_09]: You get the product in, you pay for it,
you get the bag, you can just throw the
[SPEAKER_09]: bag on the shelf and start selling it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now we're like, oh, well, we hope to be
able to get it on the shelf on the same
[SPEAKER_09]: day.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we hope that metric is online.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a huge bottleneck for the entire
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's really labor intensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a distributor trying to get samples out
to retailers, we've got 25, 30 SKUs.
[SPEAKER_06]: That means someone has to go and
individually tag single items,
[SPEAKER_06]: 25, 30 per retailer we want to send a
package out to.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the benefit?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we keeping children safer by having 30
metric tags go out on samples?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's got to be a better way to handle
some of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It should not take my fulfillment manager
two hours to put together a sample pack.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then have to put it in a van.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it costs us $300, $400, $500 to get
samples out to a retailer now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking to Shannon's point about the
samples, yeah, we were experiencing the
[SPEAKER_04]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we worked to get a bill introduced,
a trade samples bill that would allow
[SPEAKER_04]: distributors to give samples to retailers
without having to go through all of that
[SPEAKER_04]: craziness and designate certain product as
sample, not for resale.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that is, again, one of those things
where it was like, oh, this seems like an
[SPEAKER_04]: easy fix.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one's really going to have a problem
with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it gets stuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now it's stuck because of COVID.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That offers some immediate relief in the
supply chain that if it buys us five,
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 hours, 20 hours a week in labor costs,
that's the difference between some people
[SPEAKER_06]: surviving.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that, and Nicole's not on
anymore, but I think part of the
[SPEAKER_04]: frustration that I feel coming from the
industry is that the super controversial
[SPEAKER_04]: things, like eliminating taxes and the
super not controversial things,
[SPEAKER_04]: like allowing distributors to designate
samples seem to have the same holdup.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like I don't have confidence that
giving them something that's completely
[SPEAKER_04]: budget neutral, totally in the context of
COVID, everything they say they want,
[SPEAKER_04]: that anything's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I feel like we're putting forth
all kinds of ideas and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_04]: suggestions and regulatory fixes from the
very, very big and profound to the very,
[SPEAKER_04]: very small and everything is getting
stopped.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that makes it really difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest, sometimes the industry
is its own worst enemy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have to understand what
incrementalism is and that not everything
[SPEAKER_04]: is going to be a vehicle for everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we submit something, allowing
distributors to give samples to retailers,
[SPEAKER_04]: there may be parts of the supply chain
that aren't included in that, but this is
[SPEAKER_04]: a low hanging fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Show that it's benefiting us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can go back and say,
look, it benefited the distributor so
[SPEAKER_04]: much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's have it benefit the cultivators.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's have it benefit the manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the problem is, is that folks are so
afraid of what's happening, which I
[SPEAKER_04]: totally understand that they don't want to
get left behind.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they feel this need to be included
and involved in every step of the way when
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes that's what's holding us back
because we then appear to legislators to
[SPEAKER_04]: not know what we want, that they're not
going to be able to make us happy,
[SPEAKER_04]: that whatever they do is going to be the
wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not the kind of situation you
want to put legislators in.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want them to think that they're going
to sign this and everyone's going to clap
[SPEAKER_04]: for them and give them a pat on the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just don't think the industry's
given them one of those situations except
[SPEAKER_04]: taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eliminating the cultivation tax would be
the easiest thing in the world for them to
[SPEAKER_04]: do and not get the pushback and let it be
a sign of good faith that they really do
[SPEAKER_04]: want this industry to succeed.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and you know, one thing about the
cultivation tax that I, when we were
[SPEAKER_09]: speaking about that, that I don't think
was mentioned earlier is, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: they tax us per clone.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, for every clone we make,
we get taxed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know any, and you know,
they keep talking about how we're like
[SPEAKER_09]: agriculture, you know, but I don't go to a
nursery and I don't see the nursery guy
[SPEAKER_09]: making clones of his succulents,
getting charged per succulent a tax.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, can you imagine if you did that,
all hell would break loose.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you mean I got to pay every time I
make a clone off of my plants?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or, you know, it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the most asinine thing I've ever
heard that every time I make a clone off
[SPEAKER_09]: of my own plant, I have to pay a tax.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, part of that issue is because
cannabis in California is considered an
[SPEAKER_04]: agricultural product and not agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even when that clone is considered a
product and products are taxed,
[SPEAKER_04]: like wine is an agricultural product and
it's taxed.
[SPEAKER_04]: The grapes aren't taxed, but the product
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the problem is that we don't have a
designation for cannabis in its raw plant
[SPEAKER_04]: form to just be agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we did and it was just agriculture,
then we wouldn't be applying the taxes to
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, of course, one of the rubs,
right, is that one of the things we're
[SPEAKER_04]: finding that's a big pain in the ass about
the industry is the multiple agencies that
[SPEAKER_04]: are involved and the duplication of things
that you have to do for your compliance
[SPEAKER_04]: for this agency and this agency.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the recommendations that was
made that the governor's office is
[SPEAKER_04]: considering is consolidation and bringing
all of the cannabis activities under the
[SPEAKER_04]: Bureau of Cannabis Control.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this is a double edged sword because
on the one hand, yeah, it'd be great to
[SPEAKER_04]: just have one agency's rules that you had
to follow instead of sometimes conflicting
[SPEAKER_04]: rules coming from two agencies.
[SPEAKER_04]: But on the other hand, it takes cannabis
out of CDFA.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a concern that that is going to
separate cannabis from agriculture even
[SPEAKER_04]: further if the plant is no longer
regulated by the Department of Food and
[SPEAKER_04]: Ag.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that this is like a 2022
discussion, given where we are right now,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like there's no easy answers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that as an industry,
we really have to think about what we want
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis to look like 10 years from now
and work towards that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we want it to be an agricultural
crop with farmers markets and interstate
[SPEAKER_04]: commerce and being treated like the wine
industry of California, we should set our
[SPEAKER_04]: sights on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really do think that's a good model,
even though I don't like to compare
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis to alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: As an industry, the California wine
industry really does make a lot of sense
[SPEAKER_04]: in terms of the appellations and the
branding and the tourism and everything
[SPEAKER_04]: that comes along with that for them to
aspire to have their California cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: be right alongside with that California
wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: During non-COVID times, we have thousands
of buses a day going from San Francisco to
[SPEAKER_04]: wine country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the state makes a ton of money on
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The industries make a ton of money on
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why shouldn't we have thousands of
buses leaving San Francisco every day to
[SPEAKER_04]: come to the Emerald Triangle?
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I go back to the missed
opportunities because we still think we
[SPEAKER_04]: don't want to encourage cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really getting in the way of us
letting this industry flourish in the way
[SPEAKER_04]: that it should.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just want to get to that point
because you said the taking of the buses
[SPEAKER_09]: to wine country, which is something else
that as cultivators and even
[SPEAKER_09]: manufacturers, we're not allowed to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't do cannabis tourism.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't have someone come and give them a
tour of the facility and then later on go
[SPEAKER_09]: and purchase products from the retailer.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not allowed to do that, even though
my other property, that's how we set it
up.
[SPEAKER_09]: With the grow, the manufacturing distro
and the retail all there on the same
[SPEAKER_09]: property, they're not going to allow us to
do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a big hit, like you said,
because that's a lot of money in the
[SPEAKER_09]: tourism.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys think that the California
industry is on the same page about what it
[SPEAKER_02]: wants to look like in 10 years?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just want to add on to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The industry is in a patchwork too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a note here, perception of
wealth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that depending on who you're
talking to, their perception of the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry is unique to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done this a lot, talked to people
down in LA, retailers, where's all the
[SPEAKER_02]: money?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they go, the growers up north.
[SPEAKER_02]: You talk to growers up north, where's all
the money?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they point fingers down to retailers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like two separate entities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, there's a myriad number of trade
groups throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen an industry with so many
trade groups that pop up out of necessity
[SPEAKER_02]: in geographic areas representing a swath
of different businesses rather than
[SPEAKER_02]: setting up trade groups that represent
specific areas of business, which might
[SPEAKER_02]: make more sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not criticizing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just seems to be really piecemeal and a
recipe for disparate voices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then who is the state listening to?
[SPEAKER_11]: And how do we get onto the same page?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think the reason that the
organizational situation is what it is,
[SPEAKER_04]: is just because of the growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: So before we were an industry,
it was like the consumer and then the
[SPEAKER_04]: people that were providing to the
consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those were two groups and they were
represented by like normal and Americans
[SPEAKER_04]: for Safe Access on the consumer side.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on the people serving the
consumer side, you had marijuana policy
[SPEAKER_04]: project and drug policy alliance because
they weren't businesses yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the people representing the industry
were really representing the criminal
[SPEAKER_04]: justice piece of that and the policy piece
of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're much bigger now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the example that I'll give it,
I'm curious to hear what Jackie has to say
[SPEAKER_04]: about this because I know that she does a
lot of work with organizations and thinks
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot about organizational politics.
[SPEAKER_04]: A few years ago, I was invited to speak at
the Alcohol Distributors Conference.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have a huge conference just for
alcohol distributors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have another huge conference just
for alcohol retailers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have another huge conference just
for the alcohol producers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't necessarily agree with each
other.
[SPEAKER_04]: What the retailers want, isn't necessarily
what the distributors want, isn't
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily what the manufacturers want.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they don't all get together in one
room and try to figure out a path that
[SPEAKER_04]: they all agree on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, they meet in their factions and
they decide what's best for their faction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they send representatives to talk
about what that means as an industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like we're in that awkward
teenage phase between these two worlds
[SPEAKER_04]: where we need to grow out of the idea that
we can have one umbrella organization that
[SPEAKER_04]: represents accurately every sector of the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need to start thinking more about
representation by sector, which I think
[SPEAKER_04]: you are seeing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the California Distributors
Association.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have regional cultivation associations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that's really where we're
headed because it's just getting too big
[SPEAKER_04]: for us to come together and think that one
association is going to be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: accurately and fully represent the needs
of all the members across sectors.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can agree with that, that it's probably
going to end up being a few different
[SPEAKER_09]: ones, but definitely not like 30 or 40
like we have now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that each section, the distributors,
manufacturers, cultivators, retailers,
[SPEAKER_09]: eventually probably hopefully gets into
only four.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that way it'll be a lot easier for
when each perspectives board goes to meet
[SPEAKER_09]: with the other executive board,
it'll be less.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I mean, I've been a part of so
many trade organizations and helped found
[SPEAKER_09]: so many California Growers Association,
Greater Los Angeles Collectives
[SPEAKER_09]: Association, which been around forever was
like the first cannabis trade
[SPEAKER_09]: organization.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm on the Southern California Coalition
Cultivators Alliance when we had started
[SPEAKER_09]: that in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just, you know, it gets a little
tiring, you know, when you just all of
[SPEAKER_09]: these different organizations and then you
help put them together, some succeed,
[SPEAKER_09]: some fail, some stick around, some don't.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so for me, just to see, and just to
have some kind of unity on that forefront
[SPEAKER_09]: would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And to have that message that all of us,
even though we're separate, we're together
[SPEAKER_09]: when it comes to certain messaging would
resonate a lot further with our elected
[SPEAKER_09]: officials.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in all reality, if they knew or even
thought that we were all together,
[SPEAKER_09]: like we all because whenever it's a
crisis, we all come together really quick,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, you know, we get into crisis
mode, we all come together, we all form
[SPEAKER_09]: together, we get things done and resolved.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then next, you know, everybody's off
to the winds again, which is what has
[SPEAKER_09]: happened almost every time.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I would love to see that not
happen, where we come together during
[SPEAKER_09]: crisis and we stay together and continue
to progress towards what we want,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, 10 years from now, whatever it
may be.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it does get exhausting when you have
so many different organizations and then
[SPEAKER_09]: it's like you're just playing conference
call after conference call when we could
[SPEAKER_09]: all just get on one call and get to the
meat and potatoes if you want to say of
[SPEAKER_09]: the subject and actually get some real
resolution and I mean, LA we're notorious
[SPEAKER_09]: for it down here.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like every year there's a new
organization, if not every three months,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, and it's because we are very
diverse and the diversity adds to that as
[SPEAKER_09]: well because every seems like different
also ethnic backgrounds have their own
[SPEAKER_09]: organizations as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: But honestly, trying to get it down to
kind of, you know, minimize that I think
[SPEAKER_09]: would further our us in getting our
message to what we want to our officials
[SPEAKER_09]: to really push forward our agenda,
which at the end of the day, we all want
[SPEAKER_09]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I truly believe that we all really want
the same thing, which is just to be
[SPEAKER_09]: treated like normal businesses and not
like third class, third rate citizens,
[SPEAKER_09]: which I'm kind of sick of, you know,
I mean, in 2008, I got a DA letter saying
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm gonna go to federal prison and I got
arrested in 2007 for 55 grams and they try
[SPEAKER_09]: to give me three to five years for less
than two ounces.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just, I am just so tired of being
treated like a third class and all the
[SPEAKER_09]: amount of taxes we give and it can you
imagine if we were in a central
[SPEAKER_09]: businesses, where would that leave us?
[SPEAKER_09]: We would all be bankrupt because we don't
get a bailout.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the whole thing and the whole thinking
has to change because we are citizens,
[SPEAKER_09]: we are tax members, we are fathers,
we are mothers, we are your average
[SPEAKER_09]: working class, the last of the middle
class because this is where we
[SPEAKER_09]: transitioned into because there was no
other middle class jobs left, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: and you know, we are normal, regular
people and we should be treated as such.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and that's my thing and the
sooner I think we can all, we're not all
[SPEAKER_09]: gonna come together, it's gonna be so,
but as long as we can all come together in
[SPEAKER_09]: our own perspective fields and then
communicate with each other, I believe and
[SPEAKER_09]: that's where the Southern California
Coalition is trying to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are trying to talk to different
organizations about whether it's on paper
[SPEAKER_09]: or just by word coming together.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's that appearance that sends
the message to the officials that hey,
[SPEAKER_09]: we're coming together and we're gonna get
this together and you need to start paying
[SPEAKER_09]: even more attention to what we're saying
because we're tired.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's exhausting and it doesn't
feel good and then you look at the liquor
[SPEAKER_09]: store down the street who's paying only
$1,600 a year for his city tax and I'm
[SPEAKER_09]: paying over a half a million and I'm
getting treated worse.
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes like zero sense and you know,
I can get into so many things.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I served in the Marine Corps for
seven and a half years.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got shot, stabbed, blown up and now I'm
getting treated like a third class citizen
[SPEAKER_09]: when there is someone who migrated here
three years ago who has a liquor store and
[SPEAKER_09]: is getting treated better than I am when I
sacrificed almost my life for my country.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it doesn't make sense and we
need to get our officials to start having
[SPEAKER_09]: more common sense and looking at us and
perceiving us in a much different way than
[SPEAKER_09]: what has been in the past.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tom, thank you for prefacing that question
by articulating that there's 30 or 40
[SPEAKER_07]: groups at a necessity.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that to me is really important.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are 30 to 40 groups out of
necessity, out of whatever their issue is
[SPEAKER_07]: that they've come together for,
whether it be manufacturing or retail or
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivation or patient access,
whatever it is, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that in my, I think it's been
like five years that I've been in this
[SPEAKER_07]: industry now and I can't tell you how many
people, how many regulators, legislators,
[SPEAKER_07]: politicians have asked me this question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have an NRA of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_07]: And every time I'm like, no, we don't have
an NRA of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we don't have a consumer association.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we don't have anybody, you know,
working at the federal level representing
[SPEAKER_07]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have anybody at state level
representing consumers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have niche little organizations
representing factions of consumers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Normal, you know, probably being the one
most recognized Americans for safe access.
[SPEAKER_07]: Being the most recognized for patients and
their access.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've never had a consumer association.
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone as powerful, an organization as
powerful as the NRA.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that might be what we need.
[SPEAKER_07]: We, I think that that, if all of our
operators throughout the entire supply
[SPEAKER_07]: chain were to forget about their operator
hat for a second and remember that most of
[SPEAKER_07]: them are consumers, I would say a very
high majority of them are consumers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what is it like to be a consumer in
this marketplace?
[SPEAKER_07]: And for me, I'm constantly frustrated as a
consumer on a daily basis of, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: when I find a product in California that I
like, I struggle to find it in multiple
[SPEAKER_07]: retail establishments.
[SPEAKER_07]: I struggle to find it at the same price
point in multiple retail establishments.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm usually not able to find it in
Northern California and in Southern
[SPEAKER_07]: California.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that that is the type of
problem that's gonna get worse as the
[SPEAKER_07]: industry does evolve.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we evolve without any policy
reform, we're gonna see more of a
[SPEAKER_07]: segregated market because the only
operators that really are able to weather
[SPEAKER_07]: this storm are the vertically integrated
ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the more vertically integrated you
become, the less likely you are to sell
[SPEAKER_07]: other people's products, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you're not incentivized to.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're trying to survive.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand why the market looks this
way.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for me, every time I find a product
that I like, I struggle to get more of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I really think that maybe we could
all come together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's been really playing in the back
of my mind during this entire COVID
[SPEAKER_07]: crisis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we need an NRA of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we need a consumer association?
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I would pay 100 bucks a year to
belong to an association that told me who
[SPEAKER_07]: my cannabis friendly politicians were to
vote for.
[SPEAKER_07]: If someone did that work for me,
that would be worth 100 bucks a year for
[SPEAKER_07]: me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody that was an organization that was
working on rectifying the fact that I have
[SPEAKER_07]: a problem that I can't find my favorite
edible in more than three areas of the
[SPEAKER_07]: state.
[SPEAKER_07]: That to me is an issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think that we've ever come at
this from a consumer lens and taken the
[SPEAKER_07]: consumer's perspective into consideration.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if there were an NRA of cannabis,
they'd be at the Capitol right now saying,
[SPEAKER_07]: this is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't pay 45% more for the same product
we bought two and a half years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: With our bongs instead of guns,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't want to take up too much more
time on this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that our panels are supposed to be
done right now, but there are a few more
[SPEAKER_07]: hot topics that Peter wanted to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we should probably do a
check-in with everyone to see if everyone
[SPEAKER_07]: can stick around and what Peter's thinking
about how much longer he wants to take.
[SPEAKER_09]: I could stick around.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have to take care of one thing,
but you did make a great point.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think there has to be a consumer
organization because every time we've done
[SPEAKER_09]: anything on initiatives or referendums or
anything we've done and speaking of
[SPEAKER_09]: Americans for Safe We've always gone about
for the patients, for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is what's always our message.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what had progressed us so far
because those elected officials,
[SPEAKER_09]: they care more about the consumer than
what they think is the wealthy cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: business.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though they need to just look at our
books and realize we're not wealthy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they don't care because for us they
think, oh, they're just complaining
[SPEAKER_09]: because they're not making enough money.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when the consumer says something,
it drives that message a lot further than
[SPEAKER_09]: coming from us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's the reason why we did this
banking campaign as consumer facing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's one of the things
that's really been missing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Post-legalization is bringing the
consumers into the discussion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prior to legalization, consumers were like
our biggest asset.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they were making a stink.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't want to go to jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted access to product.
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted access to things that were
tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they really had a lot to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think after legalization,
unfortunately, there was this idea of
[SPEAKER_04]: like, OK, the businesses have it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we kind of lost some of that from the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the big issues I think we need
to fix is banking.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that cannabis businesses don't
have access to banking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously, that's a big issue for
us as businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the consumer, what it means is you
have to pay cash.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to pay cash at the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dispensary workers have to handle cash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And given the current environment that
we're in, we were like, hey, this is
[SPEAKER_04]: something that consumers, myself as a
consumer, that worries me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to have to use cash every
time I go to a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my brother manages dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't want him to have to handle
cash every day and then go home to his one
[SPEAKER_04]: and a half year old daughter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we thought this is something that
consumers could get behind.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we started this dirty money campaign
aimed at getting the Safe Banking Act
[SPEAKER_04]: included in the next federal COVID relief
stimulus package.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we did a public facing campaign
aimed at consumers to write the
[SPEAKER_04]: representatives to basically say,
I don't like the idea that I have to
[SPEAKER_04]: handle cash when I go and purchase my
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that we're going to see how
this goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had the campaign up for two days.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had 180 letters generated to
representatives in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to keep going with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that this is an opportunity
for businesses also to help engage their
[SPEAKER_04]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to recognize that consumers do care
about what's happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not just about how expensive it
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not just about products.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's how we feel we're being treated as
adults that are seeking out a service that
[SPEAKER_04]: is legal to us to seek out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that in the future,
there is definitely a role for consumers
[SPEAKER_04]: to play.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really would hope or wish that normal
would take a more NRA approach and be more
[SPEAKER_04]: aggressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they're aggressive enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that's really what we
need.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need folks that are going to be super
aggressive at the federal level on behalf
[SPEAKER_04]: of consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's millions of cannabis
consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would hazard a guess that there's more
cannabis consumers than there are gun
[SPEAKER_04]: users.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we definitely have the leverage there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Often they overlap too, often.
[SPEAKER_02]: My belief is that cannabis consumers are
potentially the most powerful constituency
[SPEAKER_02]: in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just somehow need to be mobilized.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lesson I'm taking away is that this is
almost a call to action.
[SPEAKER_02]: I may devote the rest of my life to
building that organization, since it
[SPEAKER_02]: really is near and dear to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And has been for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as a consumer, I feel invisible
and unheard.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to say, and you know this
because I'm here in LA, you know that when
[SPEAKER_09]: push comes to shove, and things happen,
the dispensary operators, they start
[SPEAKER_09]: sending emails and texts to their
consumers.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we rally them up.
[SPEAKER_09]: And next thing you know, we have hundreds
of people at City Hall.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not like it can't be done.
[SPEAKER_09]: We could do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the thing, the part that I always have
a problem is, is not that we can do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We never keep it going.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once we get what we want, everybody goes
off to the wind.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the most important thing is,
is once we do the call to action,
[SPEAKER_09]: and everybody, we got to keep it going.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't just, oh, we got what we wanted.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'll see you guys next time there's
a problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: That doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm sure there's strategies for
mobilizing people and maintaining their
[SPEAKER_02]: interest over time that people have
developed and that people who are,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, have done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's techniques to doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's easy, but it's doable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's people who are really good at
having clear strategies, short term,
[SPEAKER_02]: medium term and long term, keeping that
information in front of people and trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep them mobilized.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's super hard, but it's
necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you're a victim.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're just at the mercy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And who wants to be at the mercy of
anybody, including the state, which from
[SPEAKER_02]: my perspective is kind of acting like a
drug dealer in not the best sense of the
[SPEAKER_02]: term.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things we were trying to do
with 420 being all month in April was we
[SPEAKER_06]: were designing some postcards we wanted to
put at the point of sale at every retail
[SPEAKER_06]: that we worked with that they could mail
to Sacramento that, you know, itemize some
[SPEAKER_06]: of these things because you're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: The consumers have to start making their
voices heard.
[SPEAKER_06]: The industry's talk to her blue in the
face and we're just not getting traction.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, obviously COVID kind of threw a
wrench in that when retail or consumers
[SPEAKER_06]: weren't able to walk into shops and
everybody's got masks on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're working on a different plan.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, what happens if a couple
million green postcards show up in
[SPEAKER_06]: Sacramento saying taxes are too high.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't have access to medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to drive three hours to get epilepsy
medicine for my child.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, that's how we get things to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big issue for us is how patient,
you know, what happens to patients.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's almost like we need to organize a
call patients and access to medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're actually doing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're organizing it in the background.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are doing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just quickly, let's get to the speed
round on some fun topics in no particular
[SPEAKER_08]: order.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we got high times getting into retail.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got weed maps, subpoenas, and one of my
favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just take them one at a time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just listing the topics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Med men, which most people here know for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been calling the Enron of Cannabis
and Adam Bierman, the Martin Screlli,
[SPEAKER_08]: the Pharma Bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's the Cannabro.
[SPEAKER_08]: So why don't we start with high times
thinks that the retail game is where it's
[SPEAKER_08]: at and they're making big pivots.
[SPEAKER_08]: So who wants to start with that one?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I could start.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, look, it's I told I think I said
this to Tom the other day.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, everybody wants to do retail
until they get into retail.
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks, you know, glamorous.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's, you know, I think high times is
in for a rude awakening when they realize
[SPEAKER_09]: that the amount of money there is in
retail is horrible.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you know, unless you're going to try to
cut corners and try to evade certain
[SPEAKER_09]: things here and there, which I'm not going
to lie, a third of retailers are doing
[SPEAKER_09]: that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, they're not doing things that
exactly the way that they've been supposed
to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, and which shocked me because
there has been a few, quite a few
[SPEAKER_09]: retailers that have already been busted by
the BCC, legal ones doing things that
[SPEAKER_09]: they're not supposed to.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I know one that got caught with a
hundred pounds of illicit cannabis,
[SPEAKER_09]: selling it out of the jar from underneath
the register, underneath the counter,
[SPEAKER_09]: and they still have their license and
nothing's nothing's done.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Another disheartening fact, you know,
off subject, but yeah, I think high times
[SPEAKER_09]: is in for a rude awakening when they
realize that the retail business is not
[SPEAKER_09]: all it was meant to be and that they're
not going to be able to get the evaluation
[SPEAKER_09]: that they want from retail to sell it or
what they eventually plan on doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's back up a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were they just slapped?
[SPEAKER_02]: Were they just let go or there was a slap
on the wrist?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's not enforcement.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's not enforcement at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, the BCC has always said,
oh, well, we only enforce and the DCR,
[SPEAKER_09]: we only enforce against legal operators
because that's what we can do.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we're allowed to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not allowed to enforce against
illegal, but they're not enforcing against
[SPEAKER_09]: legal ones either that are breaking the
laws.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and when you do that, now you're
creating a completely miscued market
[SPEAKER_09]: because now you have legal operators that
are doing illegal stuff.
And as a result of that, you're creating a
very miscued market where you have legal
operators that are going to say,
yeah, we're going to do this or we're
going to do this.
You're not going to do that, but they're
going to do that.
And so that's what you're going to be
doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so when I'm, I'm doing that,
I'm doing it in a very miscued way.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not going to have to cut corners.
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't Cushy Punch back to business as
usual?
[SPEAKER_09]: Cushy Punch is back to business.
[SPEAKER_09]: They know, I mean, they got caught with a
completely illegal facility running two
[SPEAKER_09]: locations.
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you guys selling cushy punch in your
shop?
[SPEAKER_09]: I am not, but I'm friends with the owner
and I met him.
[SPEAKER_09]: I met up with him the other day and I
asked him, he said, Oh yeah, we're going
[SPEAKER_09]: to be back online.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't think they actually have
products back out there yet, but you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: all it is, is the brand gets caught.
[SPEAKER_09]: They find another licensee, they make a
licensing agreement for the name.
[SPEAKER_09]: And next thing you know, that brand is
back online with a new license.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, and again, I love the guy,
very nice guy, family guy, but you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: when, when people are doing things like
this and he's not the worst, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: the other retailers selling, you know,
literally they confiscated a hundred
[SPEAKER_09]: pounds from his facility.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know of another incident where the
idiot manager started running down the
[SPEAKER_09]: back alley with like 20 pounds and the BCC
agents tackled him.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, and they're still operating.
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm over here worried about taxes and
this and that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm getting, you know, if I'm late,
I'll get a threat letter that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_09]: lose my license.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then the person who completely does
something illegal and gets caught red
[SPEAKER_09]: handed, nothing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it just, it, a lot of things just don't
make sense to me, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_09]: and if you're not going to enforce in
areas where you have complete control to
[SPEAKER_09]: him boards, let alone the ones that you
don't.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, again, where, you know, you're
setting us up for failure and you're
[SPEAKER_09]: rewarding the people that are doing
illegal stuff to continue doing illegal
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So back to the question at hand about high
times.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if anyone else is as bored as
I am, but I actually pulled up the SEC
[SPEAKER_07]: filing to look at what assets were
included in that purchase.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've got to kind of unwind it
pre-Harvest before Harvest entered the
[SPEAKER_07]: California picture.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a Havahart out of Seattle that was,
you know, getting some of the retail
[SPEAKER_07]: permits in not so coveted jurisdictions,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Harvest purchased Havahart dispensaries
and then they were also, in the process of
[SPEAKER_07]: getting some of their own licenses.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I unpacked just what it is that high
times allegedly purchased.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm saying allegedly because you still
need a stock to go public and all of these
[SPEAKER_07]: different jurisdictions to sign off on
this before this deal could ever go
[SPEAKER_07]: through.
[SPEAKER_07]: So minimum, I would say you're looking at
a year before, you know, any dots would
[SPEAKER_07]: be, T's would be crossed and I's would be
dotted before this would be completed.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've got a Harvest in Palm Springs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're familiar with Palm Springs
market, Palm Springs is one of two
[SPEAKER_07]: jurisdictions in the entire state that
have an open process for retail,
[SPEAKER_07]: the other being Lompoc.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're interested in getting a
retail permit, those are the two
[SPEAKER_07]: jurisdictions that if you can find
property that qualify, you can get,
[SPEAKER_07]: you pretty much can get a retail permit
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've got a very overcrowded market in
Palm Springs.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got another one in Harvest of
Venice, which if my memory serves me
[SPEAKER_07]: correctly, I believe Venice is only a
medical market, which is a really tough
[SPEAKER_07]: way to compete these days.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got Harvest of Merced.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got Harvest of Riverside.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think that one is opened yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got Harvest of Hanford,
which isn't open yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got Harvest of Blythe, which is
definitely not open yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you've got two very expensive
dispensary permits in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got another one in San Bernardino,
which I don't believe is open.
[SPEAKER_07]: And two in Oakland, one in Coalinga,
and the final one being in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Santa Cruz only allows you to sell off
20% of the business.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what they sold was their 20% stake in,
or no, actually I think it's only 10%.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've got a lot of less desirable
areas to operate.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that the Coalinga store is,
if it's still open, is doing about $1,000
[SPEAKER_07]: a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are the types of assets I want
everyone to be aware of that Harvest
[SPEAKER_07]: potentially unloaded onto high times.
[SPEAKER_07]: High times still has to go public and
still has to take possession of these.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the midst of a pandemic,
when everybody is shifting from retail to
[SPEAKER_07]: curbside or delivery, those business
models absolutely do not make sense in
[SPEAKER_07]: either Oakland or San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe they could make sense if you're
going to turn all of those assets into
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to become a statewide delivery
brand is the only thing that I could think
[SPEAKER_07]: that they would attempt to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that would all depend on how expensive
those San Francisco and Oakland properties
[SPEAKER_07]: really are and how much those are bleeding
them dry until they actually are up and
[SPEAKER_07]: running.
[SPEAKER_07]: And up and running in a post-pandemic
world where we're not wearing masks and
[SPEAKER_07]: we're congregating again.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this, to me, should be viewed as a
hail Mary by both Harvest who's looking to
[SPEAKER_07]: unload their less desirable assets and a
hail Mary by high times, hoping that this
[SPEAKER_07]: will help them go public.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's all this is and nothing more.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just quickly a show of hands,
the panelists, who here is getting it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting in on the high times, reg A
offering.
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting in while the going's hot.
Anybody?
[SPEAKER_08]: They keep sending me emails.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I get them every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, something funny about high
times and that whole situation,
[SPEAKER_04]: first of all, it just whole thing screams
Hard Rock Cafe to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like this idea of just these super
light commercial, just wonky looking
[SPEAKER_04]: places that have like Cheech's pipe in a
glass display or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: But funny high time story.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, Flo Khanna, we launched this
dirty money campaign on a Monday and we
[SPEAKER_04]: did an Instagram post that was basically
like encouraging people to contact the
[SPEAKER_04]: representative.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we don't want to have to
handle cash.
[SPEAKER_04]: What if we posted it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Some dude from high times who works there
commented and was like all his comment
[SPEAKER_04]: says was you're lobbying wrong or that's
not how you do it or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we responded and we were like,
you know, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: We think this is an issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: People would care about, especially since
you just purchased 13 dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_04]: this is about not having to handle cash in
a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they responded that of course they
care and that they invented grassroots
[SPEAKER_04]: lobbying.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in case folks didn't know that out
there, high times invented grassroots
[SPEAKER_04]: lobbying, which actually isn't even a
thing, but they invented it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, they obviously really
know what they're doing and they've got a
[SPEAKER_04]: great team.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did just read that Stormy Simon is no
longer the CEO.
[SPEAKER_04]: She has stepped down.
[SPEAKER_04]: She lasted four months.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I had conversations with Stormy where
I told her to get out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, you know where it started was when
I got the emails and, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: the one from today is coming, you know,
who sent it high times investor who sent
[SPEAKER_08]: it Adam Levin.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there was one that had Stormy's
name on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I immediately emailed her and said,
don't let them put your name.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, and then I was like,
don't, you do not a couple of years from
[SPEAKER_08]: now want to be associated with duping
little old ladies who invested in high
[SPEAKER_08]: times.
[SPEAKER_08]: You do not want your name associated with
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we had a long phone call and I've
been trading emails.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to try to get her on to do a
webcast, but just to be clear for anybody
[SPEAKER_08]: who's watching, cause I'm going to cut
this out as the end.
[SPEAKER_08]: The high time segments that people don't
have to wait till the end.
[SPEAKER_08]: The people who currently run high times
are a bunch of finance douchebags who have
[SPEAKER_08]: nothing to do with the grassroots history
of high times from the sick from the
[SPEAKER_08]: seventies and eighties.
[SPEAKER_08]: And any master, you know, any good grower
does not read high times today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just everybody who's thinking of
investing in high times or who thinks,
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God, that'd be amazing to go to a
high times dispensary.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a couple brands on here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Amanda is flow kind of going to rush to
supply product to high times retail.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shannon is fiddlers greens.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that going to be the first phone call
you make when they take over those retail
[SPEAKER_08]: operations?
[SPEAKER_08]: And shame on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, see, I blame high times in a lot of
ways for bringing this weird idea of what
[SPEAKER_04]: quality is to the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's really been hard for sun grown
because when I was growing up in Chicago
[SPEAKER_04]: and looking at high times magazine,
they had the centerfolds of buds that are
[SPEAKER_04]: supposed to be like the highest quality
buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like these were the buds and they were all
indoor and they were all grown like this
[SPEAKER_04]: far from the light.
[SPEAKER_04]: And none of them really look, I always
would compare it to like the playboy
[SPEAKER_04]: centerfold where like you grow up thinking
that that's what like the ideal woman
[SPEAKER_04]: looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you get out in the world and you
realize that that was all bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of feel like that's what high times
did.
[SPEAKER_04]: They set it up for people, consumers to
think that quality meant orange hairs and
[SPEAKER_04]: tight nugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're like the porn hub of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kevin, I have a video clip of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll play in the, in the on demand
version.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kevin Jodry said it best, which was the
article on the left side of the page,
[SPEAKER_08]: which is that hydro bud, its sole purpose
was to sell the product on the right side
[SPEAKER_08]: of the page, which was a, a, a,
an HPS light or whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you have is you have information
that's used as basically marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like reading old high times
because I haven't read this shit in years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like reading high times and every
article was basically to sell the material
[SPEAKER_00]: on the next page.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not giving you any information.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're giving you a marketing pitch
wrapped around some photos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, and, but unfortunately the
impact that it had on the consumer
[SPEAKER_04]: marketplace was that all these years
later, indoors being sold for $65 an
[SPEAKER_04]: eighth and sungrown is lucky to get 40.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do think that high times played a
huge role in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't think they'll ever take
responsibility for it, but I think they
[SPEAKER_04]: played a huge role in really leading the
consumer astray when it comes to knowing
[SPEAKER_04]: what a quality cannabis product is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a double-edged sword,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because for, you know, I grew up in Texas
and a lot of my first exposure to cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: was, you know, high times magazines that
we were able to look out and see.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it brought it to people who weren't in
Northern California, weren't part of the
[SPEAKER_06]: community.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like Amanda said, it was also
misbranding and misrepresenting.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was, you know, selling McDonald's
hamburgers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was filet mignon.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we've got to undo that at this
point.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that analogy, Shannon.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will not be rushing to do business with
high times retail shops.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not really in line with our brands
and our mission.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have, have, have we beaten high times
sufficiently?
[SPEAKER_08]: To a pulp.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we want to do a weed maps?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm cognizant that it's a 10 20.
[SPEAKER_08]: So why don't we do a quick wrap?
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone have any thoughts on a weed maps
and said, is that Gemma?
[SPEAKER_08]: Gemma come say hi to everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Quick, quick, quick, quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I, I left her.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're getting a tour of Greg's place
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I left her unsupervised with a bag of
tortilla chips.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are actually going to go on a
couple of a few deliveries with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what small business looks like.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing like getting a delivery from a
CEO.
[SPEAKER_09]: Customers love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're actually going out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greg on this subject can ask you a really
quick question in terms of staffing and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you had to go down?
[SPEAKER_02]: How has all of this impacted your,
you know, your staffing?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, it's impacted staffing in
multiple ways from staffers that I lose
[SPEAKER_09]: staff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mean, staffing, I've lost a lot of
staff, you know, And I've lost a lot of
staff.
I ended up losing a lot of staff.
But.
Who are we talking about with this?
This is going to, this is going to be
difficult.
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tom, let, let, let's quickly go to let,
let, let's talk a weed maps, and then
[SPEAKER_08]: we'll come back to Greg.
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So go for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh, Anyone want to talk, anybody been
following the weed map stuff?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: The subpoena.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, who doesn't love to read a good
subpoena?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the best one ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, obviously, there's going to be
more news to come.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just very ironic that it's the
Chinese Year of the Rat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people are going to go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like all the articles that have
been written about it suggest,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the federal government sure did
cast a very wide net, and it's not clear
[SPEAKER_07]: who they're after.
[SPEAKER_07]: But more definitely will be revealed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone else have any?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, do they think they're going after
the legal market now?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to take down law-abiding
shops during a pandemic that are one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the few businesses paying taxes now?
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, my hope is that they're going to be
a little discerning, and they're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: look deeper into the folks that are in
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's definitely some people that
have since or, you know, at the time were
[SPEAKER_04]: in process of getting their licensure and
maybe have been, you know, trying to move
[SPEAKER_04]: in that direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And other folks that have been flaunting,
you know, the fact that they are on need
[SPEAKER_04]: maps and not having licenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so my hope is that it's not a one size
fits all scenario and that they prioritize
[SPEAKER_04]: who they think are the bigger,
the more egregious actors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's hard to know what's really
behind this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a Bill Barr's agenda or something
else going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anyone has any insights
into that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just quickly, Greg, how many deliveries
are you about to go out with?
[SPEAKER_08]: How many orders?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm about to go out with three of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many are you doing a day?
[SPEAKER_09]: Around like 30 something or so.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not bad.
[SPEAKER_08]: And are you the main delivery driver or do
you have this gets back to your staffing?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm the main delivery driver.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what's happened.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I've lost like between people
getting sick, people being afraid to work,
[SPEAKER_09]: and also what's happening is, and this is
something that I'm sure a lot of people
[SPEAKER_09]: are, there's like a competition amongst
the businesses for good employees.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause people are just dropping off and to
find a good employee.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had another company, another retailer
outbid me for my own employee.
[SPEAKER_09]: Literally they stole my employee from me.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I've lost employees like that as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I pay really good, but I don't sugar
coat and I don't lie to employees.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't tell them something that's not
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I tell them, look, you,
you're not a manager.
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd still need to get this training.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't even know how to do metric.
[SPEAKER_09]: How can you even, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: How can you even, you don't know
QuickBooks.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't know metric.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't know this.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't know that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there's other employers that are
just, just feeding these employees with a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of stuff in their head and making
promises that they're never going to
[SPEAKER_09]: fulfill just so they could get the
employee there as a butt tender for the
[SPEAKER_09]: meantime.
[SPEAKER_09]: And some of those, how do I know?
[SPEAKER_09]: I, I know the owners.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm friends with all of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know their personalities.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know their characters.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we know each other.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's, it's really tough finding
good employees in this pandemic has made
[SPEAKER_09]: everything worse.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I mean, we get flooded like on
indeed I'll get 3000 emails of people
[SPEAKER_09]: applying for a job.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we specifically put must have
experience and over 2000 of them will be,
[SPEAKER_09]: will be bartenders or something like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, we do want to hire and we
want to give them a chance because people
[SPEAKER_09]: need jobs, but then they come in here and
it's, it's very hard because even
[SPEAKER_09]: bartenders, they have different habits.
[SPEAKER_09]: And different things that you can't do in
cannabis, in cannabis as a retail,
[SPEAKER_09]: if you're selling a product and it's
because the state one, the state says,
[SPEAKER_09]: check it in the front.
[SPEAKER_09]: The city says, check it at the register,
you know, and so you have to have an ID
[SPEAKER_09]: checker in the front and in the back.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot of times with bartenders,
if you don't look, if you look over 21,
[SPEAKER_09]: they don't even card you at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: So those are two big differences because
that could cost the business a big
[SPEAKER_09]: violation if you don't scan the person's
ID.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, it just, a good employee has
become a very big commodity, at least out
[SPEAKER_09]: here in Los Angeles, in cannabis,
very, very difficult to find.
[SPEAKER_09]: And a lot, I'm not the only owner,
business owner, unless you're one of the
[SPEAKER_09]: bigger companies who's funded and got a
billion dollar evaluation, us small
[SPEAKER_09]: business owners are having to either play
delivery boy, bud tender, doing whatever
[SPEAKER_09]: you have to do to make sure your small
business survives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what are we seeing in terms of
layoffs in the industry?
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of the layoffs are coming in
manufacturing is what I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not too much in cultivation and not too
much in retail because retail were hurting
[SPEAKER_09]: for employees, but manufacturing I've even
seen a few companies already go bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_09]: Example, Openn and District Edibles,
they're gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're never going to be around again.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, those two brands are gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: They are gone, gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were great brands.
[SPEAKER_09]: My customers loved it because the price
point was good.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you've already seen the first of a
few businesses because of this coronavirus
[SPEAKER_09]: already suffer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, because the whole pandemic
just, it just multiplied everything that
[SPEAKER_09]: we're feeling already.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, when you compound everything
that's going on, it makes it very,
[SPEAKER_09]: very difficult.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to say bye because I have to
go 10.30.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I appreciate you having me.
[SPEAKER_08]: So why don't we wrap on that and we can
always get back to MedMen in future
[SPEAKER_08]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_08]: But everyone get with calling it a day.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've gone for two and a half hours
strong.
[SPEAKER_08]: We still have like 30 something people
tuned in online.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like to thank those people for the
creature double feature on a Wednesday
[SPEAKER_08]: morning, Jackie.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bond.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a safety line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's PPE and a bond.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jackie, you didn't have to refrain from
hitting that to be.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Send me one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great day.
[SPEAKER_10]: See you guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Safe delivery.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Drive safe.
