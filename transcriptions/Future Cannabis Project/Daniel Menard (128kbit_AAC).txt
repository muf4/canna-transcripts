I have
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of face when I'm going to
pronounce a few words here and there,
[SPEAKER_00]: like this face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's coming out of this is pretty much,
you know, what is called French Canadian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another word, people living in Montreal,
not in Quebec City.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a few comments on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much, you know, I started my career
from the lab of Dr. Remy Kirion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Kirion is known to be, we call it,
you know, in Canada, the godfather of
[SPEAKER_00]: neurology and, of course, neuroscience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was working in his lab to get my
post-doc and, of course, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working on opioids and tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few days after that, I end up working
for Astra Pain Control.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were working only and only on opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The primary building was here in Montreal
and, of course, my boss used to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: Stockholm, Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 96, I did them 95, 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had this great opportunity because I
was really focusing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in the big pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, of course, that's a tunnel vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not quite happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So called back, you know, Sweden,
and I said, hey, guys, we have kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-project sitting on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, Dan, I mean, we have something,
but I don't think you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a nice cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we started officially in 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my baby, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, we found with this
particular molecule,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's talk about only analgesia for now,
that was even better than the opioids we
[SPEAKER_00]: were using in the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was impossible to believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until, I will share some data with
you, there's this nice patch pattern,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that CBD can provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, I mean, this molecule
has a potential that nobody can believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really the peak of the iceberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've moved fast forward and had
another great opportunity, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the cannabis program,
but that's not anything that can pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: much, you know, that was not only a great
molecule, we had nice analog, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for this molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we were totally in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you merge sometime with the
stopping control and Zeneca, you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: always win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically, you never win.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from one thing to another, I mean,
I end up in not only in Minnesota,
[SPEAKER_00]: but of course, you know, it was not cold
enough for me, so I went down to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: From ToxLab that I was managing in
Montreal to a different CRO, contract
[SPEAKER_00]: research organization, it was clear,
I mean, that there was something to win
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean by that is companies that
I recently worked with, 200,000 molecule
[SPEAKER_00]: that they had, just as CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only one antagonist that doesn't
penetrate the blood vein barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my previous work, I mean,
an undermined at 155, we made,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a lot of modification.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Injected locally, injected pretty much
everywhere in the brain as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, recently, and I see my colleague
over there, Nick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year, I mean, 2016, we, at
MicroSight, had pretty much all the pain
[SPEAKER_00]: models, and like CIT8 model, depression,
and so on, even a PTSD model.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at last, we found someone via the
network of Nick that we said, fine,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can go fast and furious with the CRO
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our lab is a schedule one, VA schedule
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much, you know, with this great
adventure, in less than six months,
[SPEAKER_00]: we end up with a nice compound,
I mean, that you can see tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think for now I'm gonna leave it like
this, but if you do have questions later
[SPEAKER_00]: on, please stop by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great evening.
Thank you.
