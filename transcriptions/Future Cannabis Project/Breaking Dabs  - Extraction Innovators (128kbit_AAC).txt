[SPEAKER_02]: So breaking dabs on Instagram,
he's really, when the short path
[SPEAKER_02]: distillation game came up, he put a lot of
energy into just figuring out all the
[SPEAKER_02]: variables and how to make great oil and
increase throughputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And writing it all down, which is so huge
in this industry for people to like write
[SPEAKER_00]: it down, create a very specific SOP and
then so people can duplicate that work
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly like that and verify the results,
so it becomes a standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a consultant that was very,
very generous in everything that he's put
[SPEAKER_02]: online.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, right now, he's worked towards
commoditizing it in some way, but I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know anybody that runs a short path that
doesn't typically get their hat to what he
[SPEAKER_02]: did for the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another big name.
[SPEAKER_02]: His hot condenser tech, the breaking dabs
hot condenser tech was absolutely a ground
[SPEAKER_02]: breaker for the distillation of
cannabinoids because people started
[SPEAKER_02]: realizing that they started selectively
condensing things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before it was all, you vaporize your
cannabinoids and everything that comes
[SPEAKER_02]: off, you condense it all and then you
just, you don't want anything to bypass
[SPEAKER_02]: and end up in your trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was the one that realized that there
will be things that co-distill and that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's ways of increasing your condenser
temperatures to let them bypass your the
[SPEAKER_02]: drop down for your oil and they'll
continue as a vapor and then they'll get
[SPEAKER_02]: deposited further down your path,
but not in your flask for targeted oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically in distillation, if I could
just like cut this down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically in distillation, you have a
boiling flash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pour your crude oil into this boiling
flask and as it gets to specific
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures, it fractions off by
vaporizing different compounds inside that
[SPEAKER_00]: boiling flask.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's THC, CBD, all your
cannabinoids, all your terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on their specific boiling point
is when they would fraction off of that
[SPEAKER_00]: main body of oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what breaking dabs did was most people
just had a cold fluid running through
[SPEAKER_00]: their condenser.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once that hot oil vapor would hit the
condenser, it would, this is just so for
[SPEAKER_00]: people who don't know this stuff,
I just want to like give them this short
[SPEAKER_00]: story, hit that condenser and it would
cool it to a point where it would
[SPEAKER_00]: re-solidify, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it would land on a, there's a
flask that would come off of that path.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is all done under very deep
backing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, but for cannabinoids specifically,
correct me if I'm wrong, they don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: to be so cold to, they're volatile in the
sense they want to go back, their natural
[SPEAKER_00]: state is oil, so you don't have to bring
the temperature up or down.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got a really low vapor pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very low vapor pressure is the better term
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this hot condenser tech allowed you to
pass more garbage and just really collect
[SPEAKER_00]: a much cleaner cannabinoid fraction into
your collection flask.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's almost like you can narrow the
band of what you're collecting versus
[SPEAKER_01]: being like a catch-all for stuff that
solidifies between a certain temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Co-distills, like you were saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so like selectively recondensing was
something that people started,
[SPEAKER_02]: it jogged something in a lot of people's
brains and got them thinking on another
[SPEAKER_02]: level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um...
