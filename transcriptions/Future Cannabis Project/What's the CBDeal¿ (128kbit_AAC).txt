[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a great panel together today to
discuss CBD, which is such a hot topic and
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a lot to discuss.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got pretty much from every kind of
angle, we've got an amazing researcher
[SPEAKER_04]: here, we've got a patient that every day
is involved with using CBD to heal the
[SPEAKER_04]: ailments that CBD can be so great for so
many things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also got Jessica that is involved in
making products and developing products
[SPEAKER_04]: with CBD and Nick who consults in the
industry and can actually build the
[SPEAKER_04]: platforms and build outs to derive and
produce CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did real quick though want to go into
the reasons and kind of something that
[SPEAKER_04]: came to me today and throughout this event
of why we all need to still hold a medical
[SPEAKER_04]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're ironically dealing with it at this
event straightforward with the fact that
[SPEAKER_04]: they're trying to say that we cannot
medicate and they point to Prop 64 and the
[SPEAKER_04]: fact that Prop 64 says you cannot smoke in
public places.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact is Prop 215 is still a law voted
on by the people and it absolutely
[SPEAKER_04]: authorizes us to medicate anywhere else
you can smoke tobacco and if you can smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: tobacco, you can smoke your medicine if
you hold a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're smoking cannabis as a 21 and up
recreational consumer then no,
[SPEAKER_04]: Prop 64 says you cannot smoke in public
places but the thing is though on private
[SPEAKER_04]: property they do have the right to tell
anybody to leave their private property
[SPEAKER_04]: and of course your recommendation is not
going to override that but this came to me
[SPEAKER_04]: and Susan talked to me about it and I
think it's something that we all need to
[SPEAKER_04]: remember is that we do still have our
medical rights and we should absolutely
[SPEAKER_04]: all have a recommendation so that we don't
get into this argument in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to bring that up first.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first I think the most important thing
to do is we'll go down the line and let
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody introduce themselves and give a
little background and we'll take it from
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Jessica Asoff and a few years
ago after getting my MBA at Harvard I
[SPEAKER_01]: finally felt confident to follow my heart
and pursue cannabis as my career so I came
[SPEAKER_01]: to LA and started a community called
Cannabis Feminist because in my heart I
[SPEAKER_01]: believe cannabis could be the first
billion dollar industry run by women and
[SPEAKER_01]: just watching the female entrepreneurs
come to life has been one of the best
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences of my life and now I'm working
on a line of hemp derived cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: product, wellness products because I
really want to get cannabinoids into the
[SPEAKER_01]: hands of women all over the country who
are taking Xanax and drinking white wine
[SPEAKER_01]: when they could be taking plant medicine
so that's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The line is called Prima and I'm focusing
on education first.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi my name is Chelsea.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually a DJ and so I came into this
space through my own condition which is
[SPEAKER_06]: epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was diagnosed with a form of epilepsy
called juvenile myclonic epilepsy at the
[SPEAKER_06]: age of 15 and epilepsy had already been a
huge part of my life because I have an
[SPEAKER_06]: older sister with a more severe form of
the condition and she lives in the UK and
[SPEAKER_06]: she lives in full time care and she can
have anywhere from five to 70 seizures a
[SPEAKER_06]: day and often has grand mal seizures,
falls to the floor without any warning at
[SPEAKER_06]: all so as I said when I was diagnosed this
condition had been something that I had
[SPEAKER_06]: experienced very intensely and I was put
on pharmaceutical medication at 15,
[SPEAKER_06]: a cocktail of different drugs which I
experienced some pretty horrific side
[SPEAKER_06]: effects from for those of you that have
taken anticonvulsants you will know and
[SPEAKER_06]: two years ago I started to take CBD
actually it was over two years ago two and
[SPEAKER_06]: a half years ago and two years ago I
weaned myself off of all my pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_06]: medication and have not had one seizure
since so so I come into this space as a
[SPEAKER_06]: patient and and you know have really in
many ways owe my life to this plant so
[SPEAKER_06]: that is why I'm sitting here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon I'm Dr. Annabel Manalo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a developmental biologist and I was a
government researcher for the last seven
[SPEAKER_00]: years I was the lead scientist on the
largest chemotherapy project in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this because we all have a story
and I think that ties us into this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and I think that's why a lot of
us are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a son two years ago and he was born
had a stroke and was having over 200
[SPEAKER_00]: seizures a day they removed 40% of his
brain we were told he would never walk
[SPEAKER_00]: talk you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know ultimately I was very
conservative and never even looked into
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis I have a clinical trial
certification I'm like hey this is
[SPEAKER_00]: federally unregulated I'm not trying this
stuff but as a mom I got pretty desperate
[SPEAKER_00]: when I saw a six month old who couldn't do
anything I mean he's six months old still
[SPEAKER_00]: not smiling at you not moving and that's
what led me to do my own research and
[SPEAKER_00]: study cannabis and eventually made my own
CBD oil that I now have seven patents
[SPEAKER_00]: around and didn't tell doctors didn't tell
anyone but my husband started giving it to
[SPEAKER_00]: my son and he's two years old now still
missing 40% of his brain but he has no
[SPEAKER_00]: developmental deficits so I'm in the space
to because I owe I own I owe this space
[SPEAKER_00]: you know my research my credibility and
I'm here today to advocate for it and to
[SPEAKER_00]: make good relationships and to really
educate and help people understand why
[SPEAKER_00]: this is such a critical industry not for
the money but for what it can do for this
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon everyone my story is
definitely not as cool as those ones I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: probably represent like a different voice
and opinion in some of this I am a
[SPEAKER_02]: disabled vet so equally owe much to this
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wisconsin Ag World to military to Colorado
at the right time 2016 and started a small
[SPEAKER_02]: company helping like with the business
aspect of this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now also manage for different venture
funds and just last week I was in nine
[SPEAKER_02]: different countries in Europe doing this
sort of work for licensing so when it
[SPEAKER_02]: comes to the CBD side I'm so thankful for
the possibilities of this but I also know
[SPEAKER_02]: from an investment stand sure a legality
stand like how do we actually do this
[SPEAKER_02]: correctly and I'd say a good 97 8 9
percent of it is not necessarily doing it
[SPEAKER_02]: correctly so it's trying to find the
balance of business cannabinoid science
[SPEAKER_02]: and like endocannabinoid system research
and actually helping patients because at
[SPEAKER_02]: the end of the day this is everything we
do this for all adults are patients too
[SPEAKER_02]: once it's legal but what we do now matters
and for a lot of these patients and their
[SPEAKER_02]: stories the businesses are not
representing this cannabinoid or like this
[SPEAKER_02]: industry correctly and we're thinking we
got to think long term in our decisions
[SPEAKER_02]: for patients not just today but deeply
inter generationally so pleasure to be
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know I think with with CBD you know
there has been a lot of information and it
[SPEAKER_04]: has been such the craze in the mainstream
over really five years but in the past
[SPEAKER_04]: three years we've really seen a
development almost of an entirely side
[SPEAKER_04]: industry that's definitely a part of
cannabis but it's become more known almost
[SPEAKER_04]: as hemp derived CBD especially on a
national level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you guys speak to your experience in
the difference of hemp derived CBD to the
[SPEAKER_04]: flower derived CBD meaning deriving from
the plant of that when it when it is grown
[SPEAKER_04]: since Amelia and grown as a flower and not
an industrial production?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're dealing with now is layers
and layers of consumer confusion while
[SPEAKER_01]: also experiencing a huge surge and buzz
around the term CBD without actually
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding what CBD is.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion we should stop calling it
CBD and instead call it a cannabinoid and
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference is while I agree that CBD
is a primary cannabinoid that we should
[SPEAKER_01]: really focus on it's one of over a hundred
active compounds in the plant and by
[SPEAKER_01]: calling it CBD we're putting so much focus
on a single molecule we're forgetting
[SPEAKER_01]: about the entourage effect the the fact
that the compounds need each other to
[SPEAKER_01]: activate and to work synergistically with
the body and I think that what's happening
[SPEAKER_01]: is we're almost showing consumers that we
know more than we actually do because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so much about the plant we do not
yet understand we don't understand how the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and the phenols and the
cannabinoids work together and how many
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors we have in our bodies in fact I
was just in Israel this summer speaking to
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Rafael Mishulam who first discovered
the endocannabinoid system and isolated
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD and THC and when I asked him about a
potential third receptor found in the body
[SPEAKER_01]: which was big news this summer he was like
honestly we have no idea how many
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors we have in our system and part
of the beauty and part of the magic with
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant is that there is a lot we do not
yet understand so as experts or advocates
[SPEAKER_01]: or users or patients we have to do a lot
of on the ground consumer education and we
[SPEAKER_01]: have to help people understand what
they're actually looking for which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid rich extract it's not just CBD
it's not just an isolated molecule it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid and active beyond cannabinoids
extract coming from either the flowers of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis or the hemp plant as long as
they're extracted from the flowers and not
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds because now we're also seeing
beauty products made with hemp seed oil
[SPEAKER_01]: calling it hemp oil calling it
cannabinoids which is doing a total
[SPEAKER_01]: disservice to the true benefit of the
plant so we need education we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: start using the word cannabinoid more than
using the word CBD because that's also
[SPEAKER_01]: misleading a single isolate is completely
different effect than a whole plant full
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum extract so in my mind it should
really be a cannabinoid conversation and
[SPEAKER_01]: where we can get the best cannabinoids
supported by phenols and and terpenes and
[SPEAKER_01]: other other molecules we do not yet
understand so just look for whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: full spectrum or broad spectrum in my
opinion and so I'm 100% agree there's this
[SPEAKER_00]: synergistic benefit that we hear about
from a whole plant or a full hemp extract
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know is profound and we haven't
been able to define it but I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just as important is our our lack of
research this industry has been moving for
[SPEAKER_00]: the last 25 years and we're just
extracting and extracting and extracting
[SPEAKER_00]: but that single isolate is important
because unless we isolate every single
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid we can't define the
synergistic benefit so we don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these cannabinoids can turn into
THC we don't know what happens when it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets decarboxylated and goes from an acid
form into a single form and most
[SPEAKER_00]: importantly we don't know what happens
when it enters into our body so instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: just saying hey you know everyone just go
all in go for a full hemp extract I think
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to have better standardizations
and understand what is in each hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: extract based on strain or whatever you
want to base that on make sure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality is right and then start building
up some data even if it's data within the
[SPEAKER_00]: user itself like hey I you know I got
fibromyalgia I'm gonna start trying CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: okay I'm gonna try a full hemp extract
what are the cannabinoids in there that we
[SPEAKER_00]: do know about and what may have helped me
unless we have you know 20 30 40 50 people
[SPEAKER_00]: a data collection we're never gonna know
what this synergistic benefit means not a
[SPEAKER_02]: lawyer not a lawyer at all I like them a
lot though sorry I like to look at like
[SPEAKER_02]: the controlled substances act that clearly
defines like what is legal and what is not
[SPEAKER_02]: from like a controlled one substance so it
lists cannabinoids all 117 known today CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: THC AG all of them all the fun new ones
and when we look at like the farm bill
[SPEAKER_02]: 2014 farm bill I was probably the one who
towed the fucking line the biggest on that
[SPEAKER_02]: with like a giant hemp project with like
tribal reservations you needed to
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially have like State Department of
Agricultural approval and an institution
[SPEAKER_02]: of higher education that had the authority
to work with the farm bill to cultivate
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp for the extraction thereof of seeds
fibers holes like not un-pollinated female
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers which we all know are so great
anything that happened after that point
[SPEAKER_02]: when you look at like 1961 UN conventions
single conventions on psychotropic
[SPEAKER_02]: substances even now like WHO last week had
a pretty good new finding on this but
[SPEAKER_02]: everything CBD is completely as illegal as
THC and without the coal memo you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: really like which doesn't really mean crap
anymore but we still follow those eight
[SPEAKER_02]: rules it's really important you
essentially like could not be doing
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction as a business of CBD unless you
had a state licensed medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: operation for cultivation and extraction
but then you couldn't be selling like non
[SPEAKER_02]: THC products like in Colorado is where we
originated so we started to test this
[SPEAKER_02]: 2014-15 is when they made the OLS decision
letter in Colorado that pretty much stated
[SPEAKER_02]: that unless it was derived from a state
farm bill program or from a state medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis program you couldn't be doing
this sort of thing so it's all completely
[SPEAKER_02]: illegal the 2018 farm bill which it passes
is going to really carve out some great
[SPEAKER_02]: new things for this but from a business
standpoint of the definition you think
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and hemp kind of same thing
biological definition of a species the
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to create sexually viable
offspring I believe Bill Nye so cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got like your Great Danes your
poodles like hemp is the Great Dane poodle
[SPEAKER_02]: bulldog shih tzu's mix them around the
world you've had point three point four or
[SPEAKER_02]: one percent based on these THC thresholds
which should have been THC a but they
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't really understand the science there
so legality of like you look at Andoka
[SPEAKER_02]: Stanley Brothers Bluebird a few of those
initial ones that some have now had
[SPEAKER_02]: Canadian IPOs for over a hundred million
Canadian which is much less so it's not as
[SPEAKER_02]: cool sounding but they're doing some big
things right now but also when you look at
[SPEAKER_02]: the USDA and the EPA USDA when they issued
the warning letters also with the FDA to
[SPEAKER_02]: it was like 94 CBD companies like we
tested your products there's not even
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids in them that's horrible
pressing credibility for a molecule or
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's really doing amazing work
that we're barely beginning to understand
[SPEAKER_02]: but normally with CBD when I look at it
it's like not interested because like from
[SPEAKER_02]: an investment standpoint it's like market
risk it's not legal what they're doing we
[SPEAKER_02]: already towed the line as an industry so
now the companies that are doing this
[SPEAKER_02]: correctly under state programs or hemp
programs like to actually create this
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine hopefully if we don't have a
standards program patient focus
[SPEAKER_02]: certification like from the cannabis side
from Americans for Safe Access does a
[SPEAKER_02]: great job for like cultivation extraction
retail GMP GAP global graph like all those
[SPEAKER_02]: standards but right now we're in this
moment where we know it's helping people
[SPEAKER_02]: we know the definitions no one's following
those rules practically other than a few
[SPEAKER_02]: companies and it's like how do we actually
create new companies to help people
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing the rules well touching on that I
know that California Nevada Oregon they
[SPEAKER_00]: are now requiring a hemp handler
certificate when selling CBD products so
[SPEAKER_00]: basically it's a traceability factor where
you have to show where your hemp comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from I don't know how you show whether
you're extracting from the flower stem I
[SPEAKER_00]: would hope that we just do it but um you
know traceability leads to hemp where that
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp is either shipped to or extracted
what that first certificate of analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: shows which cannabinoids terpenes are
present as well as are there any
[SPEAKER_00]: microbials pesticides the whole nine and
then you have your final batch testing
[SPEAKER_00]: which also shows if someone says there's a
thousand milligrams of CBD in there is
[SPEAKER_00]: there really a thousand milligrams of CBD
because when you have a full hemp extract
[SPEAKER_00]: or a whole plant I think that's brilliant
that you said we should call it a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid product opposed to a CBD
product because with the way it is now
[SPEAKER_00]: you're only really getting maybe 60 70
percent CBD because it's so abundant in
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp the rest of it is terpenes other
cannabinoids so it's it is a full extract
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not really just CBD now if it is
99.9% CBD isolate then call it a CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: product you know so that is you know what
is being required now in states such as
[SPEAKER_00]: California Colorado where marijuana is
legalized they're trying to kind of have
[SPEAKER_00]: the same standardizations besides behind
CBD a lot of companies do not like it but
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that I think it's phenomenal I
think that you know as a consumer when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're spending 200 bucks 300 bucks on a
product you should get something you can
[SPEAKER_02]: trust yeah no and I'm you know where do
you sell those products so Colorado in all
[SPEAKER_02]: of those states then even with a
Department of Ag license for hemp and a
[SPEAKER_02]: Department of Health license for
extraction and like the handling they
[SPEAKER_02]: can't actually sell those products and
dispensaries in Colorado because the only
[SPEAKER_02]: things that can be sold in Colorado
dispensaries or these other states are
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana products through they're like so
then they have to do the low CBD or the
[SPEAKER_02]: high CBD low THC varieties through their
cannabis operations tracking metric all
[SPEAKER_02]: those things to even have CBD products for
sale in medical dispensaries or adult use
[SPEAKER_04]: well but Nick I would say and I would
argue that you know for the patient and
[SPEAKER_04]: actually for delivering medicine to the
patient that that is the framework that
[SPEAKER_04]: has been set by the regulatory agencies
it's the framework that actually allows
[SPEAKER_04]: for the patient to get analytics that are
guaranteed and from the flower and this
[SPEAKER_04]: would go to Chelsea as the patient you
know experiencing hemp derived CBD that
[SPEAKER_04]: you can buy at any store compared to what
you're gonna get out of a legal dispensary
[SPEAKER_04]: that in California is more or less going
to be guaranteed to come from the flower I
[SPEAKER_04]: do hear stories of dispensaries selling
hemp derived CBD which is mindless to me
[SPEAKER_04]: but people I have heard do that but for
the majority of our especially our major
[SPEAKER_04]: brands are going to be derived from the
flower and as a patient what is your
[SPEAKER_06]: experience well I just wanted to add to
that I think it's always important as well
[SPEAKER_06]: to look at this as a sort of global issue
you know and as you know I'm from England
[SPEAKER_06]: and I split my time between England and
New York and you know due to my
[SPEAKER_06]: geographical postcode I'm lucky enough
that I have a medical marijuana card you
[SPEAKER_06]: know I'm able to go and speak with a
physician that I trust have an open
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation with someone that's well
informed I can trust the product that I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: using you know that it's well regulated
that it's standardized that it's
[SPEAKER_06]: pharmaceutical grade but you know when I
initially started using CBD it was derived
[SPEAKER_06]: from hemp I didn't know what I was using
where it come from I didn't even know the
[SPEAKER_06]: difference between CBD from from hemp
versus whole plant until and I and I went
[SPEAKER_06]: down the road of self medicating because
my journey started in England where it's
[SPEAKER_06]: schedule one and it's illegal and now I've
arrived at this point where you know I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: using product that I can trust but let's
not forget when I get on the airplane with
[SPEAKER_06]: my you know one-to-one and my CBD the
whole plant you know I'm breaking the law
[SPEAKER_06]: which is the most ludicrous thing ever so
that in itself just I think almost you
[SPEAKER_06]: know sort of sums up the the current
landscape and where we're at and it's
[SPEAKER_06]: always interesting for me to come to
California and you know hearing these
[SPEAKER_06]: conversations and just seeing how far
ahead we are but we have to remember where
[SPEAKER_06]: the rest of the world is you know I think
one of the biggest issues that I'm seeing
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot to mention before that I'm also
making a doctorate documentary that is
[SPEAKER_06]: exploring the medicinal cannabis climate
with a focus on on epilepsy through sort
[SPEAKER_06]: of the personal lens of my own experience
and that of my sister but you know my
[SPEAKER_06]: sister doesn't have access to this
medicine she can't get on an airplane
[SPEAKER_06]: because she's too sick to travel so until
you know there is a product that has been
[SPEAKER_06]: clinically trialed she has no chance of
being able to to use you know this this as
[SPEAKER_06]: a form of treatment and so yes now that
I'm using a 20 to 1 you know high CBD
[SPEAKER_06]: strain from whole plant the difference is
just incomparable it it's hard to sort of
[SPEAKER_06]: communicate that to someone perhaps that
that doesn't have epilepsy but it's like
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm taking the medicine that I really
should you know it's almost like it's a
[SPEAKER_06]: big brain balancing effect that using the
product that really really works you know
[SPEAKER_06]: for my brain and for my body but one of
the issues that I think that I'm seeing
[SPEAKER_06]: tremendously so in the UK is that you know
because of all these beautiful anecdotal
[SPEAKER_06]: stories that people are reading in the
media it's creating this buzz we know
[SPEAKER_06]: around CBD and and and patients are going
to their local organic whole food store
[SPEAKER_06]: and buying a bottle of CBD to treat their
epilepsy and making really poor decisions
[SPEAKER_06]: and you know jumping off medicine and
thinking that they are now taking this
[SPEAKER_06]: product that's going to treat their
seizures and I think that there we see the
[SPEAKER_06]: importance of education and that you know
and labeling and where is this product
[SPEAKER_06]: coming from and in the UK people aren't
even having this conversation they're just
[SPEAKER_06]: at the point of wow this is a form of
treatment that can treat seizures that's
[SPEAKER_06]: where we are in the UK so I just think it
you know it's so important just to to
[SPEAKER_06]: really begin to educate people and about
whole plant and the difference between CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: from hemp I also think we have to go a
step further and actually uphold some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the same high standards from the natural
foods industry or the natural products
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and carry that through the entire
production and manufacturing product
[SPEAKER_01]: process because my fear coming from ten
years in the clean beauty industry
[SPEAKER_01]: starting from the beginning and watching
it evolve is that we're also doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: disservice to the plant by not formulating
the products in in a clean sophisticated
[SPEAKER_01]: environment that upholds certifications
and standards that we would feel
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable with because it's great that
you have to test the active but what about
[SPEAKER_01]: the final product what about any
contaminants or chemicals or pesticides
[SPEAKER_01]: that have come in through the
manufacturing process that it sometimes is
[SPEAKER_01]: happening in a home or in a facility that
isn't up to our standards so I just think
[SPEAKER_01]: that as the consumer and as the advocate
we also have to take a step further and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually make sure that the cannabinoids
are housed safely within the final
[SPEAKER_01]: formulation without any pesticides or
chemicals or industrial chemicals that are
[SPEAKER_01]: found in a lot of the products we put on
our skin and in our bodies because I would
[SPEAKER_01]: hate for this true medicine to be hidden
by ingredients that don't belong in our
[SPEAKER_04]: products we still have a major problem
with access and with a patient being able
[SPEAKER_04]: to get access to the whole plant
extraction and and maybe that is pointing
[SPEAKER_04]: to why we found loopholes to find ways to
extract from the legal source of hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: however we're hearing that it really isn't
the true medicine for the patient and so
[SPEAKER_04]: you know what that could do is seriously
discredit cannabis moving into the world
[SPEAKER_04]: of research moving into the world of
medicine and really also for the consumer
[SPEAKER_04]: what is it that we can do as an industry
and I think this may be pointed more to
[SPEAKER_04]: Annabelle somebody that's really worked in
the science world and on projects what
[SPEAKER_04]: what do we need to do to educate the
researchers and the doctors that whole
[SPEAKER_04]: plant is really what they need to be
sending their patients to what they really
[SPEAKER_04]: need to be getting to do their research
how do we do that as an industry as a
[SPEAKER_00]: patient you need to ask your doctor and
make them feel like idiots when they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know anything about this plant because
whether they like it or not it's coming
[SPEAKER_00]: and what I'm trying to do is reach out to
my colleagues I you know speak weekly to
[SPEAKER_00]: neurology neurology teams no former
athletes other doctors cardiologists
[SPEAKER_00]: oncologists and you know there's just a
lot of patients and parents that come to
[SPEAKER_00]: me that are just desperate for help and
for knowledge and ultimately you know when
[SPEAKER_00]: when I decided to become a doctor it was
to have proper training and credibility to
[SPEAKER_00]: help people and I think as as doctors we
owe that to the people to have knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: on on this on this plant but there's not
any proper educational courses set up and
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors are like well hey this isn't
federally regulated I don't I'm not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: you know vouch for it or I don't know
anything about it but when someone like me
[SPEAKER_00]: steps in the room and educates them on it
you know their views change and so you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I think as a patient what you can do
is ask your doctor about it be forward
[SPEAKER_00]: take a stand for your for your own health
and you know and if you have any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: power whether you're a lawyer or whatever
you are you know take take a stand and
[SPEAKER_00]: push those that you know have credibility
in this industry that can get research
[SPEAKER_00]: done to do that I mean you have to be a
voice and that's really all we can do we
[SPEAKER_00]: can we can form groups all day advocate
groups but unless we really like you know
[SPEAKER_00]: advocate for the research and advocate for
the education and and you know it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: about telling your doctors hey prescribe
whole plant it's about telling your
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors look every person is different we
need to treat each individual as a as an
[SPEAKER_00]: individual patient that's what we're doing
in the medical industry it's called
[SPEAKER_00]: precision medicine or personalized
customized treatment we need to be just
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing cannabis in there the same
way we implement any other medication
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have amazing modern technology
we have amazing plant resources and we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be able to put that together and
our problem right now is we're not
[SPEAKER_02]: bridging that gap how do you make a
prescription of something that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: federally like so here in the United
States recommendations so we can't like
[SPEAKER_02]: actually classify this in the same way but
for those rules are like what we can do
[SPEAKER_02]: like as a business an operator a regulator
or a patient like there's this little
[SPEAKER_02]: thing called like the American herbal
pharmacopeia like kind of an old thing
[SPEAKER_02]: that talks about like pharmaceutical
medicine derived from plants Germany is
[SPEAKER_02]: what illuminated my understanding of when
I had to import I normally would do GAP
[SPEAKER_02]: GMP like GDP and then they're like no you
need like GACP I'm like what the heck is
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's like good agricultural
collection practices so even though like
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis is doing like agricultural
production like it's for how you would
[SPEAKER_02]: like dig roots in the forest and preserve
those and process those are wild flowers
[SPEAKER_02]: for like let's say saffron or something
like anything like that so that it's a new
[SPEAKER_02]: type of standard that's like international
anyone like since we're already sketchy
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like any business like follow normal
business rules so like American herbal
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmacopeia GAP type good agricultural
practices good agricultural collection
[SPEAKER_02]: practices GMP for like your oils and
certifications and like manufacturing
[SPEAKER_02]: formulations compounding but even in your
country like for 3,300 US a year or K a
[SPEAKER_02]: year you could have your point 2.5 2.5
from some skunk number three derived you
[SPEAKER_02]: know in the UK but then like that's for
2.5 and 2.5 and then like those sorts of
[SPEAKER_02]: companies like when we're getting like the
access to the doctors and that's true
[SPEAKER_02]: prescription side but then like their
stocks almost 750 million dollars right
[SPEAKER_02]: now for one product for like one small
condition like that's where you get the
[SPEAKER_02]: access but seven years of those trials
like titration like doing this correctly
[SPEAKER_02]: like that's the hard part because what
people know of the CBD industry now
[SPEAKER_02]: especially the medical industry they see
like these great case studies but then
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like well like the studies aren't
large enough a lot of this isn't like
[SPEAKER_02]: anecdotal it's like not clinical science
we're finding we've got some great medical
[SPEAKER_02]: representatives here that I mean some of
the warriors out there I mean that one
[SPEAKER_02]: over there it's like incredible to see
what they've done or just like to mention
[SPEAKER_02]: Mishulam but now with what we can do with
this we have to like have the business
[SPEAKER_02]: legal side that's correct with the
pharmaceutical side and like realize like
[SPEAKER_02]: what you said originally with the medical
card that's just a fucking Costco
[SPEAKER_02]: membership anymore I mean you're not
paying the adult use excise tax you can
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe grow a few more plants it's like if
you buy in least an ounce a year it makes
[SPEAKER_02]: sense to still pay your doctor but then
most doctors you're like go talk to your
[SPEAKER_02]: doctor think about like doctor feel-good
down on Venice Beach where it's like oh my
[SPEAKER_02]: medical patient my my wrist hurts and like
many of those doctors have no idea that
[SPEAKER_02]: have actually made the initial
recommendations like can of care docs
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a few that can help but it's like
which doctors do we educate because so I
[SPEAKER_04]: would be curious though just after you
know hearing from Chelsea and in
[SPEAKER_04]: understanding that you know as a medicine
it really is better to have a 1 to 12 or a
[SPEAKER_04]: 1 to 20 you know with THC blended from the
flower plant in the industry and from the
[SPEAKER_04]: clients that you work with is there a want
to enter into the the legal market in the
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial market of cannabis to provide
CBD in the legal markets or is it that
[SPEAKER_04]: know the path of hemp without having to
deal with licensing and is a much better
[SPEAKER_04]: investment in it and it makes so much more
money that that's just where the money is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to stay until we have maybe a full
all national legalization but is there any
[SPEAKER_04]: interest that you're hearing of people
that want to get into whole plant CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction instead of the hemp derived
huge I mean there's probably 150 million
[SPEAKER_02]: right now of capex investments I know
about in the United States with like West
[SPEAKER_02]: Virginia projects or large extraction
Kentucky like the wildest wild market it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really like the best laws for legality
Kentucky's like fuck you is what their law
[SPEAKER_02]: is pretty much it's like it's legal to
export it out of state lines and it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: well but once you're out of Kentucky your
rule doesn't really apply anymore I am
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely as an individual as entities
and people are but there's too much risk
[SPEAKER_02]: with a lot of the US CBD companies right
now just like the state-to-state illegal
[SPEAKER_02]: ambiguity but I think of like one thing
I'm looking at deeply right now is like
[SPEAKER_02]: fibromyalgia 22 billion dollar market
share last year and when we think about
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis derived products taking up to 10%
of that market by 2027 projected to be
[SPEAKER_02]: about 28 billion 10% of 28 billion that's
2.8 billion there's five companies doing
[SPEAKER_02]: clinical trials right now one sucks ones
mildly sucking ones doing great and the
[SPEAKER_02]: other two are like they haven't released
yet like of course those initial
[SPEAKER_02]: investments like to capture that much
market share to help that many patients
[SPEAKER_02]: great the problem is the companies doing
it are like not saying GW Pharma good bad
[SPEAKER_02]: ugly I don't like to trash companies
unless it's still Ray but just kidding
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of others worth trashing but
that company for that medicine derived
[SPEAKER_02]: from a not even very good variety like
Epidex Sativex like the cost of like
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical companies getting that they
can afford the research like I'm just
[SPEAKER_02]: scared that the ones that are interested
in investing into the real of this
[SPEAKER_02]: industry are going to be the ones that
control it and then don't allow safe like
[SPEAKER_02]: affordable access other than just like a
different tax rate for like I have a
[SPEAKER_02]: medical card I mean Colorado medical cards
peak like 130 ish K and like now they're
[SPEAKER_02]: like around 80,000 just for a few more
plants and less taxes California is the
[SPEAKER_02]: same way but like we have to remember the
medical basis of this but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: investment interests but not in like hey I
make these products and CBD and I used to
[SPEAKER_02]: do THC and I couldn't get legal in that
now I have all the stuff and I extract and
[SPEAKER_02]: I blow stuff and now I do it from hamper
low varieties it's all gonna be changing
[SPEAKER_02]: over the next two to five years based on
too many shitheads fucking it up right now
[SPEAKER_02]: for the people who actually need it from a
business investment standpoint.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are saying then that yeah we're gonna
see a shift in the investment to want to
[SPEAKER_04]: get into the legal commercial world with
CBD because I think that you know that
[SPEAKER_04]: it's causing a disservice major mainly to
the consumer and especially at a time when
[SPEAKER_04]: so many people are embracing CBD as a
whole and there's places to get it and we
[SPEAKER_04]: refer to it almost commonly as snake oil
because you're sending a patient or a
[SPEAKER_04]: doctor is sending a patient to an open
consumer market to buy something over the
[SPEAKER_04]: counter that isn't truly what it is and
you know what can we do and I think from a
[SPEAKER_04]: patient's perspective Chelsea's story
really shines light to it and what we need
[SPEAKER_04]: to educate the consumer and you know
Annabelle talked about the you know the
[SPEAKER_04]: doctors and the researchers but what is it
that we all do Jessica as a company that's
[SPEAKER_04]: producing hemp derived CBD but knowing
from the patient that clearly it's better
[SPEAKER_04]: from the whole plant how do we get that
through to the consumer and what can you
[SPEAKER_01]: do from your point of view I think before
we start talking about what to invest in
[SPEAKER_01]: we should talk about the fact that most of
us don't invest in ourselves enough and
[SPEAKER_01]: the issue is that we can say talk to
doctors but doctors aren't taught about
[SPEAKER_01]: the endocannabinoid system in medical
school so the doctors actually aren't the
[SPEAKER_01]: experts in the room and in my eyes
functional medicine isn't enough and until
[SPEAKER_01]: people learn to listen to their bodies
before they listen to the advice of
[SPEAKER_01]: doctors I got started in this space
because I met this girl named Tony Shaw
[SPEAKER_01]: who was diagnosed with stage four liver
cancer and given six months to live and
[SPEAKER_01]: she shook her head at her doctor and she
said no you won't tell me how much longer
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to live and she found cannabis oil
early and kept herself alive for almost
[SPEAKER_01]: four years until she was ready to go and
so in my mind the conversation starts from
[SPEAKER_01]: within and it's actually empowering people
at a young age to actually listen to
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves listen to not just their
intuition but their bodies and understand
[SPEAKER_01]: when something's off and actually work
towards prevention because I'm a patient
[SPEAKER_01]: we're all patients if we believe in the
plan and if we use it and I think there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a major blurred line between what it means
to be a social user and a medical user
[SPEAKER_01]: when we could all probably acknowledge
that the plant makes us feel good which is
[SPEAKER_01]: an extension of health and happiness so in
my mind it's just all the rest is noise
[SPEAKER_01]: even sometimes what the doctors are saying
is noise and what we should be teaching
[SPEAKER_01]: people from an early age is to listen to
our bodies trust plants over pills at
[SPEAKER_01]: least initially do have enough faith in
nature to do a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: experimentation realize that you are your
own guinea pig and best advocate so it
[SPEAKER_01]: might take a few high nights you know pass
out go to sleep eat some snacks it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of the world if you see what's
happening on the pharmaceutical side what
[SPEAKER_01]: doctors are giving you before they trust
the plant and the things that patients
[SPEAKER_01]: experience initially upfront when they're
diagnosed with cancer any of these
[SPEAKER_01]: horrendous illnesses it's it's just it's
crazy and I think that we all have an
[SPEAKER_01]: innate responsibility to use our personal
knowledge and experience with the plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: teach people to listen to their bodies
sometimes you have to trust something
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond medical advice and trust the
mysticism of the world and just keep
[SPEAKER_01]: trying because that's what we're all here
for yeah just to add to that I think
[SPEAKER_06]: sometimes we underestimate you know the
power of our own experience as you were
[SPEAKER_06]: saying and I think you know it's very easy
to be intimidated by you know our
[SPEAKER_06]: physicians and perhaps for someone like
myself that comes from a patient
[SPEAKER_06]: standpoint okay so I don't speak that
language and so you know when I was I must
[SPEAKER_06]: have been in my teens when I went to my
neurologist and I said I've seen this
[SPEAKER_06]: video it was a Charlotte's web video that
was the first time I ever you know learned
[SPEAKER_06]: anything about medicinal cannabis and he
laughed in my face and had I have listened
[SPEAKER_06]: to my doctor I wouldn't be sitting here
two years seizure-free of pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine with no side effects I was
suicidal on that medicine that medicine
[SPEAKER_06]: ruined my life and I'm off it it has
changed my life and I think when I say we
[SPEAKER_06]: underestimate that you know we have to
believe in ourselves as Jess was saying
[SPEAKER_06]: and I think you know sorry to bring back
to the UK but again looking you know I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: sure many of you have read about this
little boy called Billy Caldwell and his
[SPEAKER_06]: mother Charlotte we've been following them
for the documentary and she is honestly
[SPEAKER_06]: you know one of the most incredible
activists out there right now because she
[SPEAKER_06]: said no to her doctor and she said no to
conforming and the government you know
[SPEAKER_06]: they tried to take the medicine away and
she said I have three weeks of medicine
[SPEAKER_06]: left this is my son's medicine this stops
his seizures they you know they refused
[SPEAKER_06]: she she challenged the government she got
on a plane to Canada and she brought his
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine back through Heathrow the
medicine was then seized and her son went
[SPEAKER_06]: into hospital and it was because of her
bravery and her fight and she didn't give
[SPEAKER_06]: up and she said you know what I know that
I could get this medicine and keep my
[SPEAKER_06]: mouth shut just like the other little boy
Alfie Dingby in the UK did but she said I
[SPEAKER_06]: am doing this for all the other little
boys and little girls and other patients
[SPEAKER_06]: in the United Kingdom and because of her
bravery the you that the Home Secretary
[SPEAKER_06]: Sajid Javid announced that the UK is
rescheduling cannabis now that is
[SPEAKER_06]: humongous obviously because it moves from
a schedule one to schedule two and that
[SPEAKER_06]: you know is the beginning but then you
have the issue of so now you know they've
[SPEAKER_06]: announced this rescheduling people think
they have access to this medicine people
[SPEAKER_06]: are applying for license they're getting
denied because the doctors have that they
[SPEAKER_06]: have had no education a doctor isn't going
to suddenly go from knowing nothing about
[SPEAKER_06]: medicinal cannabis to prescribing it as
you said they don't know about the
[SPEAKER_06]: endocannabinoid system so I think it is
our job as as patients as people in this
[SPEAKER_06]: industry first of all to remember I think
there's so much excitement around you know
[SPEAKER_06]: investment and the business side but to
remember that we are here because of the
[SPEAKER_06]: patients and this is you know a movement
that needs to be led by by the patients by
[SPEAKER_06]: science you know not by politics and so I
think you know if we can go to our doctors
[SPEAKER_06]: and say how we feel you know if I can go
to my neurologist and say I feel different
[SPEAKER_06]: using a one-to-one or a CBD from whole
plant versus CBD Isola if I can present
[SPEAKER_06]: the you know some research if I can look
at other you know even anecdotal stories I
[SPEAKER_06]: think that does carry weight because we
see these when you tug on the heartstrings
[SPEAKER_06]: that's what sparks change and you see that
now happening in the UK so I think we have
[SPEAKER_06]: to believe in ourselves and use our
experience to you know spearhead this this
[SPEAKER_01]: this change in this movement I also
quickly want to call out Jeff Chen who's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually creating educational materials
that will be distributed among medical
[SPEAKER_01]: schools and so there are a lot of young
researchers who are super hungry and
[SPEAKER_01]: committed to not just the patients but to
training doctors and medical professionals
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's happening at UCLA one of my
questions like with that night I agree
[SPEAKER_02]: with all that you just said there but like
who funds medical research like companies
[SPEAKER_02]: and this is really sad like as a patient I
the dreaming side of this industry of love
[SPEAKER_02]: it and like I come from it but then I saw
it all like leading to crap and never
[SPEAKER_02]: getting done and then like all the
concepts not happening so it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: patients equal clients clients equal
revenue revenue equals business without
[SPEAKER_02]: serving my patients as like actual clients
I don't have a business if I don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: qualifying conditions in a market or a
state that can buy my product if they're
[SPEAKER_02]: just doing like an absolute epilepsy study
and they didn't do pain like which they
[SPEAKER_02]: should have maybe because their market
share would been huge but it would have
[SPEAKER_02]: been too much to take on at one time but
it's like we need the businesses to
[SPEAKER_02]: actually serve the patients but we can't
do this without the businesses because the
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses doing it were so shitty and
misrepresenting this and not scaling like
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a I'm a biologist farm dude like
this is a little new over the last decade
[SPEAKER_02]: here but without robust good quality
businesses that can raise capital and have
[SPEAKER_02]: investors interested in a product like
that don't show crazy market risk or like
[SPEAKER_02]: the team's insane like the Stanley
brothers to see what they've done over the
[SPEAKER_02]: years like from Colorado in the roots and
now it's like it's impressive but like
[SPEAKER_02]: that's one out of a thousand type stories
but then they're gonna turn into a
[SPEAKER_02]: business now that's gonna make medicine
for how many some of the past violations
[SPEAKER_02]: and lawsuits might come back and hurt him
for like past violations but that'd be
[SPEAKER_02]: long-term things but it's the businesses
that can do it but we need the patients to
[SPEAKER_02]: ask and like also like vote with your
dollars when it comes to these products
[SPEAKER_02]: like if you don't buy crappy products from
companies they go out of business so like
[SPEAKER_02]: knowing I'd love to see like patient
advocacy groups that like actually went
[SPEAKER_02]: with testing and said like these are
actually the products that are not crap
[SPEAKER_02]: that we know of today and these are the
ones that are total crap to stay away from
[SPEAKER_02]: like I would love to see a source for that
too for patients I think though you know
[SPEAKER_04]: and I completely agree I think that that's
absolutely what we need but I think that
[SPEAKER_04]: what that is is essentially your
commercial licensed cannabis producers and
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a there's a very clear
division between your commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: producers and hemp-derived CBD and I think
that that's you know we're hearing that
[SPEAKER_04]: from patients I hear it from patients
every day at Tahoe Wellness that have gone
[SPEAKER_04]: down the road of kind of getting
hemp-derived CBD from typical stores and
[SPEAKER_04]: then they come back to you know a 20 to 1
or even a 1 to 1 whatever it is and
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a clear difference and as Chelsea
told us so how you know one of the things
[SPEAKER_04]: is how do we after this huge investment
and all of this is going into hemp-derived
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD is there talk about what is the
transition which there's a very great and
[SPEAKER_04]: natural transition for all the hemp fields
that are being planted which is a great
[SPEAKER_04]: thing and the farm bill that's going to
come is that discussion starting to happen
[SPEAKER_04]: the transition into textiles and do
industrial hemp so that these investments
[SPEAKER_04]: can transition and not be at a total loss
when this is realized by the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean like four years ago that big hemp
project I was like taping discs like
[SPEAKER_02]: seeding discs to like there's a vegetable
seeder like vacuum seeder to plant these
[SPEAKER_02]: things in rows because like no hemp discs
were in the United States it's been
[SPEAKER_02]: illegal forever and I realized that I'm
like wow the US hemp industry that
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone's gonna talk about and loves
which will be huge and robust someday was
[SPEAKER_02]: still at that point a quarter billion
dollar shy of initial infrastructure for
[SPEAKER_02]: decorters, redders and then I kept seeing
all these producers grow huge hemp fields
[SPEAKER_02]: in Colorado and have all of these material
and be like what do we do with this now
[SPEAKER_02]: how do we dry this like oh shoot and then
like trying to import it and move it the
[SPEAKER_02]: shift I really see though that already has
been discussed though with this sort once
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a legalization is a question of when
especially like with our farm bill with
[SPEAKER_02]: certain pieces but the hemp side will get
huge but we need copious amounts of
[SPEAKER_02]: investment because most of like the
Canadian most of the Chinese most of like
[SPEAKER_02]: those like for the products it's just like
we can do this this is like a seven eight
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred million dollar annual industry now
but just think we're all wearing clothes
[SPEAKER_02]: we all need protein sources we all need
like it's gonna be enormous but I like
[SPEAKER_02]: using the cannabis side to fund that side
but for hemp derived CBD or like cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: derived I mean based on Colombian law
right now I work deeply international
[SPEAKER_02]: being able to export bulk oils and like on
the equator for it doesn't matter cost of
[SPEAKER_02]: production in the United States like most
of the cannabinoids from like hemp derived
[SPEAKER_02]: or like cannabis derived once federally
legal and these things are happening will
[SPEAKER_02]: be coming from Colombia even though we can
grow great hemp here and in Canada but
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's just low cost reduction cannabis
varieties it's about cost of production
[SPEAKER_02]: when it comes to business if it's allowed
for the import side well but you know
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada just recently till ray will be
providing cannabis for research here in
[SPEAKER_04]: the US and they will be bringing what
night is night is cannabis wasn't quality
[SPEAKER_04]: enough well it's ridiculous I completely
agree but CBD whole plant derived cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: oils are gonna be available on the global
market from Canada so they are currently
[SPEAKER_02]: from actually 11 other countries there's
27 countries that allow import 21 actually
[SPEAKER_04]: doing it actively right so the idea not
just from Canada but the idea of hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: derived CBD I mean don't you think that
that further shows the consumer when
[SPEAKER_04]: there's availability of whole plant from
legal countries we're not one of those
[SPEAKER_04]: legal countries yet but I think that just
furthers that point you know and so I
[SPEAKER_04]: guess my point here is how do we get those
investment diverted to where they should
[SPEAKER_04]: be which is textiles and not medicine the
industrial the industrial grown hemp is
[SPEAKER_00]: what I I know that in the state of
Kentucky and Tennessee they are putting
[SPEAKER_00]: millions hundreds of millions of dollars
into it's like a I don't know anything
[SPEAKER_00]: about tractors but it's a double-cut
technology where they're able to at
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest time they're able to get the flour
for the oils and the resin but also get
[SPEAKER_00]: the stock as well so that you can utilize
the whole plant I mean hemp has over 25
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred I think more uses and so to look
at it as just medicine or to grow it only
[SPEAKER_00]: for the medicine part or only for the
textiles part is wrong I mean if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna put a ton of money into this we
should try to definitely use the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: plant so I know that in Tennessee and
Kentucky there's a lot of money a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: big corporations going behind that but I
don't know the business side of the rest
[SPEAKER_02]: of the country one to two million is like
a combine and then you look at like the
[SPEAKER_02]: ten million investment for a decoder
redder they're like Kemp's amazing but
[SPEAKER_02]: like to do industrial manufacturing
biggest hemp stuff in the United States
[SPEAKER_02]: will be mostly like where you can grow
hemp based on like 25 to 35 inches of
[SPEAKER_02]: annual precip daytime high nighttime low
you look at like the Iowa's the
[SPEAKER_02]: Minnesota's Wisconsin's but like those
sorts of instruments that the problem is
[SPEAKER_02]: we Tennessee I've clients in Tennessee
hemp farmers like even last year thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: well Hemp's really high in CBD that's
bullshit I've grown like varieties that
[SPEAKER_02]: were like point zero two percent CBD like
wow that five acres isn't even worth doing
[SPEAKER_02]: anything with and then if it's a cannabis
side like we actually have to like grind
[SPEAKER_02]: all the stocks and like it's amazing the
amount of like biomass we have to destroy
[SPEAKER_02]: based on either being medical cannabis or
hemp side and if it's really high like
[SPEAKER_02]: potency the genetics like then it's worth
extracting but I can't even touch for CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction something less than three
percent commercially to make it viable at
[SPEAKER_02]: least on industrial scale but you're right
like those places are gonna grow copious
[SPEAKER_02]: amounts most of them just they don't have
anywhere to send it or use it right now
[SPEAKER_02]: and then it actually dissuades a lot of
farmers to keep planting it because like
[SPEAKER_02]: what do you do with it and then one male
plant have you seen a 15 foot tall male
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp plant like it changes everything when
it comes to whole plant extraction because
[SPEAKER_02]: then you're no longer on pollen eyes or
even if you're doing feminized your
[SPEAKER_02]: neighbor ten miles away with his horny
boys if I can find those virgin girls in
[SPEAKER_02]: it just you can it's hemp pollen is insane
so the states that allow it all you look
[SPEAKER_02]: at Pueblo in Colorado they wouldn't allow
male outdoor plants in the hemp or
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry only like outdoor
feminized because south pace like from a
[SPEAKER_02]: revenue standpoint realized they like hey
if we're trying to do major oil extraction
[SPEAKER_02]: in these places for hemp CBD and others
like we can't let the boys anywhere in the
[SPEAKER_04]: county so so Annabelle I wanted to talk to
you about the the CBD oil that you made
[SPEAKER_04]: which I believe you said was in Tennessee
when you were when you were doing that so
[SPEAKER_04]: what was the process that you took and
especially if you're comfortable with
[SPEAKER_04]: talking with you know using it with your
child and kind of understanding the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects and and how that went sure so I
learned quickly that you know my focus
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was in school I was a medical
school first and I learned quickly that
[SPEAKER_00]: every patient is different and we're
treating you know patient a with lung
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer the same way we're treating patient
B with lung cancer and that's absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong so then I went towards a PhD because
I wanted to understand more about the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease more about why we you know
formulate medications the way that we do
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know that all I think came down to
help me when it when it when I had a son
[SPEAKER_00]: who you know was in an emergency situation
so when formulating for him I started
[SPEAKER_00]: educating myself obviously first thing
with the endocannabinoid system I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know if I wanted to try THC or CBD or any
of that but what I ended up doing was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a genetic test on my own son and I
found out that with him I thought that CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: alone as an isolate would replace his
medications now I've worked with different
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD extracts and other cannabinoids and
you know that doesn't work for every
[SPEAKER_00]: epilepsy child but and I'm gonna say child
because you know that's what's most dear
[SPEAKER_00]: to me but for my own son a very potent
isolate I felt was going to replace the
[SPEAKER_00]: five medications that he was on and so it
was kind of scientific calculation to be
[SPEAKER_00]: honest I also looked into the delivery you
know currently we use a lot of coconut
[SPEAKER_00]: oils palm oils MCT oils I wanted something
that would potentially have a better
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption rate because those oils we know
they're good for us but then you have
[SPEAKER_00]: digestion problems because that is a lot
of fat and if you think about using fat as
[SPEAKER_00]: a delivery system once you break it down
how much bioavailability do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the absorption rate where does the
CBD go how much do we metabolize so I
[SPEAKER_00]: actually my patents are not necessarily
around extraction they're around delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: and formulation and protocol because
another problem that you have with any
[SPEAKER_00]: products like let it be to Merrick or
whatever you want to call it anything in
[SPEAKER_00]: an oil is the dispersion rate so is every
drop the same do we have five milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: in every single drop and these are things
that we learn you know when when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're doing clinical trial
certifications we learn how to make things
[SPEAKER_00]: properly and you know even though I think
it's really important that we listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: our bodies man that's number one on the
list you know we need to change the view
[SPEAKER_00]: of doctors from being so so stuck to these
protocols and to be more open-minded and
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that every patient is different
every patient might need different
[SPEAKER_00]: formulations one might need one to one
might one might need twenty to one and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and a lot of it has to do with being
in tune with yourself you know and and
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors need to be more more you know more
like somebody to come to and talk to and
[SPEAKER_00]: work with opposed to all right that's
wrong with you here you go you know so my
[SPEAKER_00]: specific formulation was you know for my
son and it worked very well for him and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seeing it work for a lot of people I
feel like CBD is obviously better with
[SPEAKER_00]: other parts of the plant we haven't
defined those other parts of the plant so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's tricky it's kind of a risk it's a
good risk because cannabis doesn't hurt us
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know just my scientific mind I
really have been an advocate for CBD alone
[SPEAKER_00]: THC alone mixing the two and doing
research to figure out what the what the
[SPEAKER_00]: other benefits of the other molecules are
and and so that's kind of been the focus I
[SPEAKER_00]: really want to mention as well I'm working
with the president of the American
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmacy Association to make an accredited
continuing education course for both
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmacists and doctors I think it's
really important that you know we don't be
[SPEAKER_00]: oh say no to your doctor don't even go to
a doctor but to to stand up for for
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine in a way that to help change the
way that that we we do medicine because
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine is important and it's never going
away and biofarms important and it's worth
[SPEAKER_00]: billions of dollars and it's never going
away so unless we educate ourselves and
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know be better patients instead of
fighting let's find a way to work together
[SPEAKER_05]: really impressed with the knowledge you
have as far as what's happening from the
[SPEAKER_05]: scientific level of especially around
cannabinoid based research but my question
[SPEAKER_05]: specifically we talked a lot about the
plant today from the standpoint of you
[SPEAKER_05]: know having worked in the company that
worked on the biosynthetic and bio
[SPEAKER_05]: catalytic side of this Annabelle
specifically for you as a medical
[SPEAKER_05]: background is you know where do you see
the the industry going when I think about
[SPEAKER_05]: the bifurcation of the industry between
the scientific side the medical side away
[SPEAKER_05]: from like the adult use recreational even
like the nutraceutical side is where do
[SPEAKER_05]: you see the the pharmacy industry going
with biosynthetics bio catalytics and
[SPEAKER_05]: synthetic biology in general to produce
cannabinoids that are you know identical
[SPEAKER_05]: and actually produced through a biological
enzymatic process rather than just through
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant extraction that's a fight you know
we we we've made a lot of money on the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical side with synthetics and
and making things I call it plastic and I
[SPEAKER_00]: really don't think and went from what I
see I really don't think that most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical industry is interested in
setting up greenhouses and doing it the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant way to be honest and so you know
that's the fight other parts of the world
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing it right Israel's doing it right
Canada's about to do it right Germany but
[SPEAKER_00]: on this side you know from what I I've
seen what I know I cannot see the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical side thinking that they'll
make enough money off of setting up
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses and big extractors and because
imagine how big these extraction units
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be to push out a million products
a month so no I mean if we're gonna fight
[SPEAKER_02]: anything it's gonna be that I do think
it's a negative synthetics are not the
[SPEAKER_00]: same as a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah you see the problems with that like
when you see the side effects of the
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic side but then also like some of
the research we've been looking at from
[SPEAKER_02]: like also like the insulin side of do like
they're looking at it from all angles to
[SPEAKER_02]: make it easier but I think we'll also find
like there's something about biomimicry
[SPEAKER_02]: and the cost that the plant will still I
think be involved deeply okay this is our
[SPEAKER_03]: last question I had a medical situation
eight months ago I had brain surgery
[SPEAKER_03]: because I found that I had a brain tumor
and through the medication that they did
[SPEAKER_03]: give me part of it from a seizure
standpoint I agree with you I don't like
[SPEAKER_03]: the side effects and everything that I'm
going through that the doctor had
[SPEAKER_03]: prescribed and I did talk to the doctor
about CBD and he wasn't quite giving
[SPEAKER_03]: enough information so what type of
research I should do to determine what
[SPEAKER_03]: type of CBD I should take in regards to
the prescribed medicine that I'm taking
[SPEAKER_00]: from the hospital or from the doctor
that's a hard question CBD is gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: safe for you with a lot of research that
I've been reading there are good there's
[SPEAKER_00]: solid research showing that THC is very
beneficial for the brain mixed with CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: and the reason being is that THC works a
lot like the opioids and a lot a lot like
[SPEAKER_00]: these psychoactive drugs that we have in a
way that it binds directly to neurons so
[SPEAKER_00]: when you've had any kind of brain damage
or injury you've lost a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroprotectivity which means you've lost
a lot of your simple signaling senses CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: is more of a catalyst or an activator and
that's why we don't get high when we take
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD and together you know not only do we
reduce the psychoactivity of THC but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like it's almost like you're you're
putting a stop to something and holding it
[SPEAKER_00]: in place so that CBD can come and react
and work on the problem if that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense I always tell people you know to to
try a CBD with THC and then you got a kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of just if you don't have proper you know
somebody proper to talk to you or a doctor
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to I mean you can take my number but
you know it really this industry's we're
[SPEAKER_00]: in a growing position to where we can't
look at you and say take CBD one-to-one
[SPEAKER_00]: take CBD one-to-two I mean she discovered
what works for her that may not work for
[SPEAKER_00]: you what works for my son doesn't work for
several other children and so I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: best thing about you being here is that
you're here and that you're willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize cannabis and try what's going to
be best for you whether it is to wean off
[SPEAKER_00]: the medications or to work with them you
know you're in a good place so yeah you
[SPEAKER_06]: can get my number after the show it was
just to add to that as well is that with
[SPEAKER_06]: my work with making this documentary a lot
of people have started to come to me you
[SPEAKER_06]: know through social media through my
website and asking these same questions
[SPEAKER_06]: you know which way do I turn and I think
that with the buzz and the excitement of
[SPEAKER_06]: this industry and you know CBD as a form
of treatment for some for a condition like
[SPEAKER_06]: epilepsy I feel that there is so much out
there as you were saying in regards to it
[SPEAKER_06]: being like snake oil and people don't know
which way to turn but I you know the
[SPEAKER_06]: number one thing that I always tell
patients is you know introduce it with
[SPEAKER_06]: your medicine never ever give up your
medicine always introduce it and see how
[SPEAKER_06]: you feel for yeah for a while because I'm
abruptly stopping your current pharmacy
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine is you know recipe for disaster
and one little thing to add to that is
[SPEAKER_04]: just to you know find your local licensed
dispensary and go there to try to find you
[SPEAKER_04]: know full whole plant extraction in
California that's where you're gonna find
[SPEAKER_04]: it instead of going to you know a natural
food store or somewhere where it's
[SPEAKER_04]: available from their derived all right
well thank you guys so much you you
