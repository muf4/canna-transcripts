[SPEAKER_00]: The state was wonderful enough to give me
my permit on July 11th, you know It's like
[SPEAKER_00]: wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had it I had my application in in
November.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave up I was just like, okay Yeah,
so, you know this this year or last year
[SPEAKER_00]: was our first year out there We had
started the whole process in November the
[SPEAKER_00]: year before We got dragged through the mud
and hemmed and hawn Did you get one cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, we did but going in the ground
on July 13th was you know, two and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: months late I mean I had given up like I
Okay, it's not happening this year Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I open up my mailbox It's like this is
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so exciting, but Wow You know,
what do I do now?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I haven't ordered dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't you know, so how many cycles do
you typically have a year?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this year we did not do any light depth
situation Santa Barbara, you know didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: allow it this year So we just applied for
an outdoor permit, you know canopy permit
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they issued my permit on July
11th And then they came out with a new
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation that outdoor if we did light
Depth that we had to apply for a mixed-use
[SPEAKER_00]: permit as if we had supplemental life Yeah
It's just like just because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulating the time cycle with a black
cloth You're requiring me to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different permit Wow You know
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like another way for them to
make money off you exactly exactly and You
[SPEAKER_00]: know Santa Barbara's just been rough
They've been really rough to deal with as
[SPEAKER_00]: as have every other County here in the
nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I was so in the next nine days
3,500 grow permits are going to expire
[SPEAKER_00]: statewide 3,500 of people who have been
Under temporary and they have no intention
[SPEAKER_00]: of issuing new temperate So it's gonna be
really interesting to see what happens In
[SPEAKER_00]: nine days, yeah, which is when we all want
to be planet, you know Do you have any
[SPEAKER_00]: advocates in Sacramento they're gonna help
We yeah, we do but you know, it's like the
[SPEAKER_00]: blind leading the blind
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have no intention Of issuing,
you know, we're on it every day Of issuing
[SPEAKER_00]: new temperates, are they trying to just
stop it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using regulation to shut it down
And there's no path forward This is gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be an interesting year, you know,
the last two years have been interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: years Well, Santa Barbara is not unique in
any way shape or form no They were the
[SPEAKER_00]: most lenient in giving out temporary
permits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean they handed out a lot but Now
they've gotten fish and game Coastal
[SPEAKER_00]: Commission, you know EPA everybody else
involved, you know and None of them know
[SPEAKER_00]: what to do with each other our our big
holdup out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Call it the catch for 20 We applied to
get a power drop, you know for for the
[SPEAKER_00]: field We paid the $7,000 to to the power
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put us on their schedule Then they
came to us and said we can't drop your
[SPEAKER_00]: transformer till you have your land use
permit in place Well, then Santa Barbara
[SPEAKER_00]: came and they're like well We can't issue
your land use permit till you have your
[SPEAKER_00]: security cameras up and running Well,
you explained to me how we install
[SPEAKER_00]: security cameras and make them up and
running when we have no power and you
[SPEAKER_00]: won't even tell us where you're gonna put
the transformer on the property so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can't temporarily run the power we can't
do anything to that location and then The
[SPEAKER_00]: fish and game is coming and saying well,
you know We can't issue we can't sign off
[SPEAKER_00]: on your land use permit until the power
company has dropped the power and You have
[SPEAKER_00]: your security system in place So none of
them will sign the document Or be the
[SPEAKER_00]: first one To say hey, you need a land use
permit, which we've already been up and
[SPEAKER_00]: running We already got a state permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already got a county permit and now
they want this permit further we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: have the Indian console come out do an
archaeological dig on the property to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure it wasn't some ancient hunting ground
or ancient burial ground and we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: pay them $15,000 to bring their experts
out to do this day Before fish and game
[SPEAKER_00]: will sign off So it's the catch-420
they're like, yeah, sure you can do it
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna create a great regulatory
process where this is gonna be successful
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're gonna make every agency out
there have the power to tell you go jump
[SPEAKER_00]: in a lake Yeah, do you have a temporary
permit that's gonna expire in eight days?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a temporary permit that expires in
nine days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah With no permit to go forward Not in
any way shape or form, it's the blind
[SPEAKER_00]: leading the blind Is that the same for
hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does hemp have a more likely scenario to
move forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no No, because they put The
Department of Agriculture in charge of
[SPEAKER_00]: that one and they were supposed to have
their regulations out, but they are
[SPEAKER_00]: nowhere close So, you know, we're all
prepped and ready to go We actually
[SPEAKER_00]: cracked seeds, you know, we're all ready
and Even that doesn't have a legal path
[SPEAKER_00]: forward in the state of California the
farm the You know, they're supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: have their regulations done supposedly by
July 1st They're not even close They're
[SPEAKER_00]: not even close So my confidence
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly affect that oversupply problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a reason the traditional
markets booming right now exactly Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason the tradition but even
the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lack of supply out there right
now right now, it's Just like back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day Farmers and distributors are becoming
much nicer to farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, and it was for a long time
farmers were just Getting raped,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I mean raped that I have no
other word for it
