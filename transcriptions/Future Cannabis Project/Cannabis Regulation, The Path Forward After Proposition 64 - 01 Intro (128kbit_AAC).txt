[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to call the Joint Informational
Hearing between the Assembly Committee on
[SPEAKER_00]: Business and Professions, the Assembly
Committee on Health, and the Assembly
[SPEAKER_00]: Committee on Agriculture to order.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, today's hearing is going to
focus on the cannabis regulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: the path forward after Proposition 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a joint informational hearing
between the Assembly Committee on Business
[SPEAKER_00]: and Professions, the Assembly Committee on
Health, the Assembly Committee on
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's topic is cannabis regulation,
the path forward after Proposition 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the three committees, we will be
having members coming in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some members have trainings that
they need to get to and meetings and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we will also be joined by other
members, not in these three committees,
[SPEAKER_00]: who have asked for the opportunity to sit
in because they're interested in the
[SPEAKER_00]: topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see a couple of those members here,
which is our Chairman from Governmental
[SPEAKER_00]: Organization, Adam Gray.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the authors of the legislation that
put all of this into effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: Assemblymember Ken Cooley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we'll have, I believe
Assemblymember Tom Lackey and a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: others that are not on the three mentioned
committees join us as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, colleagues, for joining us
and learning about our topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, this is going to be an issue
that we're going to deal with for years to
[SPEAKER_00]: come, but most immediately, are we ready
for next January?
[SPEAKER_00]: So today's hearing will examine a rapidly
evolving policy topic that has captured
[SPEAKER_00]: the attention of the state and many local
municipalities concerned with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation, now that the voters have
passed by initiative medical and
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue of cannabis regulation is not
new to California and local governments
[SPEAKER_00]: have been grappling with it for
approximately 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the 1996 passage of Proposition 215,
the state mostly deferred to cities and
[SPEAKER_00]: counties as it created a patchwork of
local laws in an attempt to regulate this
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 2015 enactment of the Medical
Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act,
[SPEAKER_00]: MCRSA, for the first time helped to
establish a statewide framework for the
[SPEAKER_00]: use of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: MCRSA charged three agencies, the
California Department of Food and Ag,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Department of Public Health,
and the Department of Consumer Affairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the responsibility of creating
regulations that would protect patients,
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, and the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: The November 8th passage of Proposition
64, or the Adult Use of Marijuana Act,
[SPEAKER_00]: further intensified the need for oversight
of the regulatory process, with the
[SPEAKER_00]: looming January 1, 2018 deadline for
implementation of the new regulations now
[SPEAKER_00]: applicable for both adult use and medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is even more essential for honest and
consistent communication between the
[SPEAKER_00]: legislature and the state regulators and
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Business and Professions Committee is
invested in the oversight and regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: framework of California's professional
licensing boards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this hearing today gives us an
opportunity to identify solutions to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure optimal regulatory oversight for
both professional licensees and the bureau
[SPEAKER_00]: charged with regulating and bringing this
industry into the sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: With us today are representatives from the
state agencies for regulating cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as representatives from law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cities, counties, and all segments of the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go ahead and open opening comments
to the two other chairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mr. Wood, would you like to have some
brief opening comments, please?
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be brief.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in a brave new world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very interested to see,
as we move forward and here today,
[SPEAKER_02]: how are we going to interface Prop 64 with
the work of the legislature.
[SPEAKER_02]: As one of the authors of the MCRSA,
I'm particularly interested in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the chair of the health committee,
I have some interest and concern about how
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to input regulations around
protecting public safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is an emerging industry that
changes rapidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm very interested in the strategies
that our public health department is
[SPEAKER_02]: taking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to say too much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's going to be plenty of
comments here today, but I'm looking
[SPEAKER_02]: forward to how, in particular,
when MCRSA was signed by the governor in
[SPEAKER_02]: October 2015, it had a very particular way
in which agencies were going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: performing oversight in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: In June, through a budget trailer bill,
there were changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were significant changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Prop 64 threw some of those
things back the way they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm interested in how we reconcile
where we were in June of 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in 2016, prior to the election,
and then with the election in 2016 in
[SPEAKER_02]: November, how we reconcile those two
challenges, which I think are potentially
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty daunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. Wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms. Caballero, Chair of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER_01]: With this brave new world comes a
significant amount of anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the opportunity that we have
here today is to talk about how the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory process is proceeding and to
give some kind of oversight to hopefully
[SPEAKER_01]: allay some of the anxiety, whether it be
in cities and counties or for the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look forward to hearing the testimony
here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, let me also mention that this
is a public hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anyone wishes to speak, please go
ahead and check in with the sergeant at
[SPEAKER_00]: arms and we will have you speak at the
appropriate time in the agenda labeled
[SPEAKER_00]: public comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this time, let's go ahead and bring
up our first panelist, which is an
[SPEAKER_00]: overview of state and federal law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Mr. Robert Sumner, Director,
Office of Legislative Affairs for the
[SPEAKER_00]: California Department of Justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe we have Mr. Captain Desmond
here from the California Highway Patrol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
