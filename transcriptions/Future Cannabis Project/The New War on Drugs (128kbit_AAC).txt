[SPEAKER_00]: Matt Cumin, you represent a new client
that was a licensed transporter that had
[SPEAKER_00]: $230,000 seized by the Department of
Homeland Security.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first... Seized by the CHP and
turned over to the Department of Homeland
[SPEAKER_00]: Security.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since this technically is the first shot
across the bow against the licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: industry by the federal government,
I am curious, does that licensed operator
[SPEAKER_00]: owe taxes on that money or are we going to
wait until a settlement is reached before
[SPEAKER_00]: that's determined?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell if I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, first of all, that... Should I
take two minutes to tell the story or does
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone want to hear about what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great case that we're going to
use to smash open the contradictions,
[SPEAKER_01]: so keep following it, support us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CHP did stop my clients first for a
mudflap violation on their pickup truck,
[SPEAKER_01]: then let them go and then they followed
them up the road, stopped them again
[SPEAKER_01]: because it turned out that the CHP had it
in for my clients who had both been in the
[SPEAKER_01]: CHP and had left the CHP.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the clients had been fired from the
CHP.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got reinstated and then he resigned.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one was accused of stealing from
a locker room at the CHP.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was actually charged criminally and the
jury did not find him guilty and he is
[SPEAKER_01]: therefore innocent, but the CHP terminated
him for insubordination because he
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't tell them what happened upon his
advice of his lawyer during that criminal
[SPEAKER_01]: proceeding, so he was fired for
insubordination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are my guys, so when you hear all
the press stuff about how dirty my guys
[SPEAKER_01]: are, just remember that these were guys
who were just doing their job and neither
[SPEAKER_01]: of them, you know, were... I mean,
there was a real story behind who they
[SPEAKER_01]: were.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened was once they were stopped
on the second stop, they were treated like
[SPEAKER_01]: animals by the CHP officers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were taken to the Merced CHP station.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CHP called the Fresno office of the
United States Citizenship and Immigration
[SPEAKER_01]: Services, had an officer from that office
in Fresno come up to Merced and take the
[SPEAKER_01]: $230,000 into custody.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was a clear workaround to the Roy
Barker Blumenauer Amendment, for those of
[SPEAKER_01]: you who don't know, federal law that
prohibits the departure of the Department
[SPEAKER_01]: of Justice from spending money on cannabis
interdiction in medical cannabis states,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Department of Homeland Security has a
separate budget, so isn't that tricky?
[SPEAKER_01]: The federal government has shown us what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when we challenge, and I just will be
filing forfeiture administrative claims
[SPEAKER_01]: and so forth, and we're gonna be
challenging that in federal court in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Eastern District, when the Eastern
District forfeiture attorney for the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States Attorney walks into the
courtroom, guess what I'm gonna tell the
[SPEAKER_01]: judge?
[SPEAKER_01]: He can't be here because his budget
doesn't allow him to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I've spoken to a couple of other
attorneys, notably Eric Shevin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't gotten a lot of details from
him, but we know this is a trend.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna take the money and give it
to DHS as a workaround around Roy Barker
[SPEAKER_01]: Blumenauer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should really, really make everybody
stand up and shout, and I hope everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: will do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the basic story.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna be filing all sorts of
actions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm already talking to clients around the
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna, Mark Wasserman and his
brother Craig, where are you guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Raise your hands, my co-counsel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be creating a huge stir
about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna be getting attorneys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna get an attorney from every county
in the state to be on the pleadings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna get a class action injunction
against the CHP, and then, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then when this thing is revealed for
its absurdity, then the legislature will
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna fix this because this is all
about a legislative fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: The courts are gonna just follow the law,
call balls and strikes, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not gonna give us anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really haven't, and they don't plan
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not where you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the legislative arena.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's what's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow us.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's gonna be lots of stories about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't believe a goddamn word the CHP is
saying.
