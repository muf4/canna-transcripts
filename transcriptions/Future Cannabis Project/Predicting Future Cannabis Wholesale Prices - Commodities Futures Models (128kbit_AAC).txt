[SPEAKER_01]: So Amos, in your talk, there was a point
where you started to introduce pricing as
[SPEAKER_01]: a new component to this data set.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the prospective outlooks for data
in that space?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you done anything with financial time
series regressions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So financial time series regression,
in a basic linear regression, we say that
[SPEAKER_00]: a conditioned variable is, you know,
the dependent variable is conditioned on
[SPEAKER_00]: the independent variable, and there's some
usually linear coefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about how that would work
with a financial time series, what you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: be saying is that the price is equal to
some coefficient times time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means the price would be a straight
line going some way up, hopefully,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe down, who knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's obviously not how prices work in
the real world.
[SPEAKER_00]: A slightly more complex model is called an
autoregressive model, where what we say is
[SPEAKER_00]: that the price at time t is conditioned on
the price at times t minus 1 times some
[SPEAKER_00]: coefficient plus some random distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's linear over short time frames?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what we'd say is that it's a random
walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the randomness is in, is in the
movement from yesterday's price.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would be more in line with like a
Monte Carlo type simulation?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only at AR1.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not close to where we're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at AR1, we say that the randomness is
in the price movement from one day to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next, and we say that those price
movements are drawn from a common shared
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not really how pricing works
either, because as we saw in the financial
[SPEAKER_00]: crisis, volatility is not constant over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have periods of high volatility,
and we have periods of low volatility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can move from an AR model to
what we call an ARCH model, which is an
[SPEAKER_00]: autoregressive conditional
heteroskedasticity model, where we say
[SPEAKER_00]: that the price movement at time x,
that the sigma at time t, or rather,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's go away from x, let's stick with
time t, that the sigma at time t is
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioned on sigma at time t minus 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can even become more sophisticated
than that, and we can go to a generalized
[SPEAKER_00]: autoregressive conditional
heteroskedasticity model, where we say
[SPEAKER_00]: that volatility is seasonal, volatility is
periodically conditioned, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That only gives us, though, a single
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives us a good estimate of what
volatility is going to be in the price
[SPEAKER_00]: risk for the near term, but only for a
single price point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can take our GARCH model,
and we can lay it out in a multivariate
[SPEAKER_00]: normal model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we lay out our GARCH in a
multivariate normal, it becomes a model
[SPEAKER_00]: called a C-cubed GARCH, where sigma at
each point is related to the sigma and the
[SPEAKER_00]: price movements of the other prices in our
model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sigma now is dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, our sigma, instead of being in a
single price model, whether it's AR or
[SPEAKER_00]: GARCH, sigma is one number.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a scalar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you go on to regress those,
then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in a multivariate model,
though, sigma is a symmetric positive
[SPEAKER_00]: definite matrix, because it has to relate
the covariance of every price to every
[SPEAKER_00]: other price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the concept that I was trying
to introduce in short form today,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is that in CONNECT, we have
positions in CONNECT that are related to
[SPEAKER_00]: each other according to the economic
substitutability of two different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: How close or distant two strains are from
each other is how good they are as
[SPEAKER_00]: substitutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about that, and if you think
about how that should relate to a pricing
[SPEAKER_00]: model, their substitutability is inversely
proportional or should be inversely
[SPEAKER_00]: proportional to the covariance of the
price shocks, which means that our CONNECT
[SPEAKER_00]: distances have a natural relationship to
the sigma matrix in that C-cubed GARCH
[SPEAKER_00]: model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it becomes possible at that point,
if you tried to figure out the price,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what I was alluding to today,
if you try and figure out the price of a
[SPEAKER_00]: strain tomorrow, when that strain hasn't
traded in five months, because there are
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of strains and they don't trade
that often, if you tried to figure out the
[SPEAKER_00]: price of that strain tomorrow when it
hasn't traded in five months and do that
[SPEAKER_00]: directly, you would have a very rough
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other hand, if you have a
covariance matrix and you have intervening
[SPEAKER_00]: prices in that intervening five months for
other prices in that covariance matrix,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can have a pretty well-grounded
estimate of what the new price will be for
[SPEAKER_00]: this strain that hasn't traded recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are wholesale prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't worry about the retail level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a company that operates at the
wholesale level.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this lets us do is to predict not an
individual, this is your likely price
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow, it lets us predict a pretty
narrow range of probabilistic prices for
[SPEAKER_00]: not today, but for a week from today,
two weeks from today, a month from today,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that lets us help people to figure out
what price they can expect to obtain and
[SPEAKER_00]: help people price their product on the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so you're talking about enabling
what's now a commodity and now giving
[SPEAKER_01]: futures to that commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a very insightful person,
Vaughn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the direction you're heading?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly the direction we're
heading, is to figure out to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: accurately estimate not just the price,
but what's the price risk over the next
[SPEAKER_00]: month, two months, six months,
how much volatility is there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: market, how much volatility is going to be
associated with the price of this strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how other commodities are priced,
and we would like to be able to start
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that as cannabis moves into an
ordinary commodity, that is to say a
[SPEAKER_00]: commodity that's readily available,
that's efficiently priced, where buyers
[SPEAKER_00]: can get a reliable stream of commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of risk assessment that
you need to be able to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you, as a chemist, could you take a
similar model and apply it to state
[SPEAKER_01]: statements about the potency of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is cannabis becoming more potent over time
or less potent, or is it stagnating out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you apply it to questions like,
are we seeing more what are they referred
[SPEAKER_01]: to as indicas versus sativas, more uppers
or downers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could we get a sense of what's out on the
market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Indicas and sativas are chemically
indistinguishable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see no significant differentiation
between indicas and sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's uplifting and what's down?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of a tendency for
sativas to have more tepidoline,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that there are uppers and
downers distinctions that I can find
[SPEAKER_00]: chemically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the amount of THC growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're selling cannabis as flour,
there are people who walk into the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary, and what they're going to pick
is, what has the most THC in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me the stuff that's the strongest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me the most THC by THC dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Producers are marketing to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to tell you, I think from the
consumer's perspective, I think they're
[SPEAKER_00]: making a terrible mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have cannabis that has more than
20%, 25% THC in it, there's a limit to how
[SPEAKER_00]: high you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certainly a limit to how high you
want to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people, myself included, but really
anybody that we've talked to, whenever
[SPEAKER_00]: we've done research into this,
people are much happier with a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: that's 10% THC and 10% CBD than they are
with a cannabis that's 35% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get frankly too high,
but nevertheless, that's what producers
[SPEAKER_00]: are moving towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other place where producers are moving
towards very high THC amounts is in
[SPEAKER_00]: production for extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certainly demand for very high
THC, very high cannabinoid content for
[SPEAKER_00]: sale to extractors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consumers would probably be happier if
they focused less on getting as much THC
[SPEAKER_00]: as they can and more on getting a balance
of other psychoactive chemicals in their
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Amos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Thank you.
