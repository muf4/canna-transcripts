[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I am really curious since since we
all have some Knowledge on the forefront
[SPEAKER_04]: of what's going on in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really curious what New innovations,
you know, maybe not your own maybe other
[SPEAKER_04]: people's You are most excited about like
what's happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's being created that you think could
be really impactful right now I saw today
[SPEAKER_00]: actually this this company out of UK is
called skipping skipping rocks lab and
[SPEAKER_00]: they have developed from from seaweed a
They have like the little Water like balls
[SPEAKER_00]: that are that you can actually eat so you
eat the packaging so it's it's meant to
[SPEAKER_00]: offset You know plastic bottle usage so
the applications from that are just
[SPEAKER_00]: immense but you know going into a store
and having a hand like a grenade like a
[SPEAKER_00]: water balloon that you can just put in
your mouth as in place of a single-use
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was pretty pretty cool to
see and then there's other companies like
[SPEAKER_00]: a company in Mexico has developed some
sustainable packaging that's actually Made
[SPEAKER_00]: the for the liquor and beer industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made from the byproduct of spent
grain of the brewing process So marine
[SPEAKER_00]: life can actually eat it So like sick like
a six pack ring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually more like thermo formed So
it's a kind of like a like a hot food tray
[SPEAKER_00]: like You get at Whole Foods or something
like that at the salad bar But they I
[SPEAKER_04]: thought that was really really innovative
kind of like this product.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is Chips chips board and it's just
pressed Waste from potato chip
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturing and it's out of the UK too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like super hard, but it's not
necessarily they doesn't go through the
[SPEAKER_04]: Chemical transformations to become a
plastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just no chemical additive just in
order to keep it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just pressed Potato peels or like
just the waste from from a potato chip
[SPEAKER_04]: factory It doesn't really smell like
anything Yeah, let's do that yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been working with a really
innovative team that is producing
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're they're they're they're doing
hemp building materials and from steel rod
[SPEAKER_01]: replacements to wallboard they can do You
know an entire, you know 100% hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: wallboard replacement and Building and
homes so at at a lower cost than
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional Building materials they can
and they're doing it now with basically
[SPEAKER_01]: just you know 40 foot containers coming in
from from Canada But now that we now that
[SPEAKER_01]: we can grow hemp here, you know,
there's there's this this opens up so many
[SPEAKER_04]: Opportunities, this is a company in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so and you know, so it's an emerging
technology So it's not in the marketplace
[SPEAKER_01]: today, but the selling point for them is
that it's fireproof so it's fireproof
[SPEAKER_01]: building materials for California and
That's like a that's a that's an exciting
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the in the innovative space is how
do you get from?
[SPEAKER_01]: concept to prototypes to And then they
call it the valley of death, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do you how do you get into the
marketplace and and commercialize
[SPEAKER_01]: something but You know, they're working on
it and it's exciting just to see it gives
[SPEAKER_01]: me some hope You know that wow,
we can we can grow our way, you know out
[SPEAKER_01]: of this mess that we're in with I mean the
way that we build houses today is not
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable, you know, we can we can do
better We can build housing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like this community here is a nice,
you know You know new urbanism,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know But and it can be you know from
hemp Crete on the floors to you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can do so many parts of all kinds of
our industrial, you know processes can be
[SPEAKER_01]: Can be done more or more sustainably and
how do you help to drive that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know drive that conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they working out of Lacey?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they working at a no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just just yeah Happy to introduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I know that I know that from my
limited knowledge and in hemp Crete I know
[SPEAKER_00]: that some of the regulation around
building it here in state it has to you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't you couldn't have built it into an
existing organic structure like it would
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be a steel frame because of some
kind of fire codes or some kind of issue
[SPEAKER_00]: with the the Structural issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I'd love to talk to him for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a company out of France that
does a wall board repair Replacement as
[SPEAKER_01]: well But it's not hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's it's it's another Material and
we've done, you know, it's blowtorch
[SPEAKER_01]: tests, you know for you know 24 hours and
you know And I have to say mycelium
[SPEAKER_04]: building products are also fireproof.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like they they get torched They like
it's self extinguished.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like redwood.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah One I love the six pack ring because
it gives me hope on marine degradables I
[SPEAKER_03]: the fiber based material that has no no
liner to it Like a plastic liner a poly
[SPEAKER_03]: lactic acid bioplastic liner If this
material were to get out into the ocean it
[SPEAKER_03]: will degrade so I am very interested in
marine degradable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I it's Emerging it's it's not perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's expensive to get the certification
it's you know, so I Am very nerded out in
[SPEAKER_03]: that area and want to see it grow and I
want to see success there See in some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the the larger My my thought process and
goes towards those products that I see on
[SPEAKER_03]: a daily basis That when I have to have a
conversation with someone I'm like,
[SPEAKER_03]: sorry, I know that you want to throw it
away and makes you feel good But it's it's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to trash that if we can't first and
foremost work the solution work it out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the system that's that's 100% my You know
what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I go towards first as the solutions
work it out the system reuse as much as
[SPEAKER_03]: possible implement reuse systems Like
there's a conversation in regards to loop
[SPEAKER_03]: and if we want to talk about loop we can I
have issues with loop a little bit,
[SPEAKER_03]: but talk about loop in a second,
but that's a reuse but but if we're
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about product I Start to pinpoint
where I'm most interested to see change in
[SPEAKER_03]: product So we talked about construction
demolition materials and the Crete that I
[SPEAKER_03]: have an interest in I have an interest in
soundboard Textiles is a huge issue
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's extremely hard To recycle
this material because you're looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not like textiles is a material
textiles has a thousand different
[SPEAKER_03]: materials It could it has its own murph
for all the time different compounds that
[SPEAKER_03]: poly mixed fibers and everything that's in
there and so being able to find solutions
[SPEAKER_03]: after the reduce and the reuse being able
to find solutions for those materials
[SPEAKER_03]: soundboard and You know other ways that
they're taking this material and re
[SPEAKER_03]: spinning it and redone it without water
and being able to create new product out
[SPEAKER_03]: of it and and you know keeping my eye on
that because right now a lot of that's not
[SPEAKER_03]: scalable and A lot of it's gonna work its
way out of the market because it is too
[SPEAKER_03]: expensive And their issues may be attached
to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just watching that is so very important
one of the other areas that Is a big issue
[SPEAKER_03]: and because is a contaminant has always
been a contaminant But before the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: thing with China happened, you know,
we'd shove a little Bit here and there
[SPEAKER_03]: into a bale and we ship it off and it was
fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: We meaning the whole general market of
recycling and haulers is waxed Cardboard
[SPEAKER_03]: wax OCC and everyone thinks that's
recyclable because it's a cardboard box.
[SPEAKER_03]: They think the container that their their
Coca-Cola or their beer comes in is well,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's it's paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's recyclable Well, it's it's a wet
strength that it you need water to be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to break this material down It propels
water on purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a design Feature so that it doesn't
soak through the container and break when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're taking it home But I would love
same with Tetra packs too, which everyone
[SPEAKER_04]: thinks there's like better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're all plastic Tetra packs do
have plastic and then they have aluminum
[SPEAKER_03]: in there There are recycling systems for
it Some of the haulers here in Los Angeles
[SPEAKER_03]: can't take it but it's few and far between
and it's getting less and less and less
[SPEAKER_03]: and It takes more energy and water pretty
much to recycle the Tetra pack than it
[SPEAKER_04]: does to actually create a new one And
there's a company that we met at Lacey
[SPEAKER_03]: brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to say yes an aseptic container I
didn't know that word But yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: we met I wish I can remember their name We
met that company at the annual upcyclers
[SPEAKER_04]: gathering that is just pressing and using
the Tetra packs for construction material
[SPEAKER_04]: so instead of like solutions, but yeah
instead of having all that Energy to
[SPEAKER_04]: recycle them in terms of something new to
actually just press them and use them and
[SPEAKER_03]: that the loop thing So the loop things
getting a lot of press right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is I think it's Procter and Gamble if
I'm correct About but if they're it's
[SPEAKER_03]: Terra cycle partnering with the likes of
Procter and Gamble and their products and
[SPEAKER_03]: and sewing being able to say, okay We're
gonna set up a reuse delivery system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a reusable box, you know people order
their food to be delivered to their house
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's a reusable box with the material
that comes in it and Then having
[SPEAKER_03]: containers that you pay a deposit for and
I think it's upwards of a hundred dollars
[SPEAKER_03]: or something So like right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's it's priced down the market for
a lot of people the way it works but it's
[SPEAKER_03]: only in New York and Is it Paris right now
and so they they're taking it so there's
[SPEAKER_03]: there's certain products that can come in
these reusable containers certain products
[SPEAKER_03]: that are in I think It's Procter and
Gamble in that in their market of what
[SPEAKER_03]: they they create of cleaning materials
beauty products that sort of thing and
[SPEAKER_03]: It's set up on a system that somehow knows
that when you are getting low that they'll
[SPEAKER_03]: refill it It's creepy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how that works.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that wasn't the right up for it And
that it's supposed to be creating this
[SPEAKER_03]: loop system that we are starting to
incorporate reusable Into that market that
[SPEAKER_03]: is growing exponentially at the moment
that that at-home delivery service market
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are issues with that that we
don't recognize when we talk about the
[SPEAKER_03]: human the human equity social equity
concept We're peddling products that palm
[SPEAKER_03]: oil products.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're peddling products that are toxic to
humans products that exactly and and so
[SPEAKER_03]: the hope within the system for me in that
situation is You know, and I understand
[SPEAKER_03]: people are saying but other people Who
aren't on that zero waste movement?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a way for them to reduce their
footprint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear you I still think the other issues
are much greater on But the part that I
[SPEAKER_03]: really loved in the article that I read
was I said that they're going to try to
[SPEAKER_03]: bring this model to expand Reuse into
stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: So taking big box stores again I'd rather
shop local but taking big box stores and
[SPEAKER_03]: making sure that we have affordable bulk
options in our big box stores and that we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have to Lie on these at-home
delivery systems because that in and of
[SPEAKER_03]: self comes with a lot of other issues,
too and loss of jobs and many or
[SPEAKER_03]: low-paying jobs and so in that model what
I'm hoping is going to come out of it is
[SPEAKER_03]: that if we if we are able to incorporate
this reuse model within our big box stores
[SPEAKER_03]: that that trickles down and that
conversation and the safety conversation
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're going to have to have the
Public Health Department trickles down
[SPEAKER_03]: into smaller stores localized stores the
local market on the street so that we are
[SPEAKER_03]: able to open up that market open up that
infrastructure in that sense and make
[SPEAKER_03]: those options more readily available and
affordable and cleaner and safer and
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's really hard that The Public
Health Department on what you can and
[SPEAKER_03]: can't use for reuse.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's hard for them to really say
well, I guess you can maybe use that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I guess it kind of means this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean they have regulations in place,
but they're still up in the air about
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping that this maybe creates that
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my local organic grocery store right
here in the corner.
[SPEAKER_04]: They no longer will let us like bring in
our own bottle.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying that like oh, we can't fill
up your coffee cup like it's against
[SPEAKER_04]: health code.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it not true?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the health code the LA County Public LA
County Department of Public Health I can
[SPEAKER_03]: introduce you to the woman who runs the
whole overseas that section.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way the law is written is that the
container cannot touch the the vessel in
[SPEAKER_03]: which it's giving you your drink your food
your soup or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you had a container and you wanted
to pour soup in it just don't touch it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already gotten a okay from the Public
Health Department.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to put soup in it's fine that
the drinks it's usually because I
[SPEAKER_03]: especially like major corporate chains
like Starbucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a policy that says they're not
supposed to reject your reusable cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they reject your reusable cup email
corporate air one is guilty of this too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They like I don't know their policy but
just email corporate.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a separate vessel where they
create the drink and they can pour it into
[SPEAKER_03]: your drink and it doesn't touch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that is completely protected
completely protected.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the problem is is if you're preparing
sandwiches and you put the container down
[SPEAKER_03]: where you're preparing the sandwich is and
then you put it over that is an issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're taking tongs putting it in
having the tongs touch the container that
[SPEAKER_03]: is an issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do we get over these issues by putting
down a thin layer of hemp paper right and
[SPEAKER_03]: so that the tongs are touching the hemp
paper and they're not touching the
[SPEAKER_03]: reusable.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where I'm gonna be pushing a
policy just our adventures and ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to have clarity on that because I
never I like didn't believe that like I
[SPEAKER_04]: just feel like you're lying to me why
won't you take my mug.
[SPEAKER_04]: you you you
