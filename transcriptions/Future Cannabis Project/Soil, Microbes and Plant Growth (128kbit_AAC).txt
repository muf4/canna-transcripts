[SPEAKER_05]: Did you guys have any of the, I heard
there was like a spider mites issue up in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Aphids.
[SPEAKER_05]: The bang aphids, the cannabis bang aphids.
[SPEAKER_05]: It came and banged you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was rampant, but I mean it ended up not
being as big of a deal as we were really
[SPEAKER_05]: concerned about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't affect the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you using banker plants or just
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you eat like the barley?
[SPEAKER_05]: The barley?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, now we're looking for what did you
do?
[SPEAKER_05]: Insecticidal soap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, to knock them down.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after the buds set, they didn't
really like infest in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were like elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't like to be nesting and
proliferating in the buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you were grateful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the green lace wings, they started
showing up in fours and the ladybugs larva
[SPEAKER_05]: and they were, they're voracious,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think in the future we won't spray
insecticidal soap because it affects the
[SPEAKER_05]: green lace wings and the ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other bugs, the good guys.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you're aware of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the kicker.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people don't get that part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You killed the fungi.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You killed all the good guys too.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we're transitioning.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been in the process of transitioning
from hugel beds or from smart pots to
[SPEAKER_05]: hugel beds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And wherever there's hugel beds,
there's a lot less pest pressure.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that fungal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is that fungal dominant bed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smart pots are not smart.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you that right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a solution to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: For reals.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Geobin.
[SPEAKER_04]: They make a compost bin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use it all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this year I cut it in half.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it makes an 18 inch tall bed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a 104 gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the cool part.
[SPEAKER_04]: The way it's built, you can link them
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I played with my cold hearts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're almost like a dovetail or
like a Lego stack kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll show you.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tuned all my beds this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the fun part.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are they made out of?
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do weird work with weird companies
and put it together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think they're doing the best
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the smart pots sound really smart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we're going to do is for the hugel
beds, we'll mount it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have a plethora of fallen logs
that just fall in the road.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll just make some beds out of
those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got a larger decomposition zone.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have to bring anything in really.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all the stuff that we need is pretty
available in abundance.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like for the horsetail,
it grows wild everywhere around the ponds.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been playing with that, like
fermenting it and using it raw.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we did do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Saw some really good results from it last
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very happy with that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, and the silica from the
horsetail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to heat it up with honey,
right, to break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it heats up at a higher pH than
the acidic, like the lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hadn't heard that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: The silica is usually alkalizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So honey is like the, there's something
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have to heat it up to a certain
degree and a certain pH.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this your brainchild, the future
cannabis project?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, that was a pain in the butt last
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: The future cannabis project.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is your brain, baby.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my baby.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to get people, I think,
to serve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Q, what's you been up to?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what are you spending your energy on
this year lately, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, you know, trying to get these
microbes to grow, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivating and encouraging, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: You working with Katherine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're Team Simsoil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a farmer, trying to be more
regenerative.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to bring in, truck in bulk
soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any, like, I mean, we would like
to amend the native soil and the soil that
[SPEAKER_05]: we've already trucked in.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys offer something that could help
us with that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can never amend something
until you figure out what it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the problem with a lot of
amending or recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because your neighbor needs,
you know, more nitrogen or more potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't mean you necessarily do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we offer various types of soil testing
for soil biology as well as soil chemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: interpretation, which we're mostly
biologically based.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think the microbes should do the work
so you don't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you can determine what microbes
you have and make sure there aren't any
[SPEAKER_00]: bad ones that are going to get in the way
of the good ones doing their job,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can really dial in a system,
you know, based on what your soil actually
[SPEAKER_00]: needs using cover crops, you know,
top dressing, compost, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever waste streams you dealt with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you definitely don't want to just go
throw in everything in the wood pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: So can you give some examples of recent
projects of like what you noticed when you
[SPEAKER_03]: looked at the soil, whether it was
microbes or nutrients and then like what
[SPEAKER_03]: your prescription was?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of times we deal with very
bacterial dominated soils because people
[SPEAKER_00]: just overly applying nitrogen,
you know, and also phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that doesn't get broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just sitting in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see, as you look at it through a
microscope, it kind of looks like a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of clear crystals just overlapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always relate it to like that game
Plinko, you know, where you drop the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: and it kind of goes down the chain,
like the price is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when there's too many particles in the
soil, too many minerals, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: overlapping the water, which would be that
little like token you're dropping down has
[SPEAKER_00]: nowhere to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's like completely compaction.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's seeing a lattice kind of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you think about how you would want
water to flow through soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to go laterally and spread out
and then down when it just either goes
[SPEAKER_00]: straight down or it just puddles up at the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's not really plant
available capillary action.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I look at soil through the
microscope, I like to see a lot of big
[SPEAKER_00]: chunks, but with some flow in between
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's air space and that's
where the water and oxygen is going to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be like a texture or like a
consistency that you're looking,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're analyzing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and so that's the thing as you use
the biology as the organic matter is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, given back to that soil
structure, then the byproduct of those
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms, like reproducing and
processing and eating and chelating all
[SPEAKER_01]: these minerals and this organic matter is
that they're going to change that
[SPEAKER_01]: structure and they're going to have the
glues, the glomulins, the humic acids,
[SPEAKER_01]: the fulvics that will then bond those
particles together to make the structure
[SPEAKER_01]: different, changes that crumb structure,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you guys recommend any cover crops in
conjunction with your amendments and the
[SPEAKER_05]: testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think you should always be
growing cover crops for the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just for the microbes, but for your
plants to increase terpene profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, ward off, you know,
attract beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the only, you should really
never have bare exposed soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's either subject to the elements in one
way or another.
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Try and keep our soil charged,
you know, and always alive with the worms
[SPEAKER_05]: and some type of cover crop and usually
some type of native, what do they call it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Lamb's quarter, I think, and mint and wild
stuff just kind of occurs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we actually, we use a lot of the local
oak that is decomposing or we've been kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of collecting it and the Melody's been
collecting it for a long time too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that, as mulch, it just makes
mushrooms explode out of the beds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I think they're called inky top
mushrooms or something, but every day it's
[SPEAKER_05]: like boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those beds produce, like the stank
comes off of those beds a lot more than
[SPEAKER_05]: the smart pots for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're introducing microbes that are
already acclimated to that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all like, you know, I think at
every level diversity is key, but you
[SPEAKER_00]: still don't want to go outside of whatever
is available to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in, in that environment, those
microbes are already, they love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love the temperature there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their home ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the home team advantage a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those guys, there's no delay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They immediately start working for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing about cover crops too is
collect using cover crops that share the
[SPEAKER_00]: same mycorrhizal relationship with the
cannabis specific cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: As you guys can, can guide us towards
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I know that there's like,
like native and native pollinating mixes
[SPEAKER_05]: and you played with different clovers,
but we're hearing from our neighbors that
[SPEAKER_05]: some of the clovers are spider mite prone
and like trying to navigate.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to, we don't want to
jeopardize.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to invite the wrong friends
to dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a, this is an ice cream cake,
a number nine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, it's not the, the one that we
entered in the cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the purple Fino, but I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it looks pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I've rolled up some, some hand
solo.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you guys want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me more about this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what farm?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is raised cannabis, raised goods is
the brand that it's entered in the
[SPEAKER_05]: competition under.
[SPEAKER_05]: We grew it at Humboldt Sunrise Farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Light depth in not a hugel bed,
but a raised bed with cover crops with
[SPEAKER_05]: native pollinators and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we didn't have any like big tree
branches and stuff that we buried
[SPEAKER_05]: underneath.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's, she's been growing for 40 years,
so she's accumulated a lot of soil and
[SPEAKER_05]: every year she'll like, re-amend it with
some herb goat worm castings.
[SPEAKER_05]: So she's like, she empties out the barn
and puts it on this huge windrow and the
[SPEAKER_05]: goats just move through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, after the rest of the team.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: After a season, it has no smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just, and the rain, the rain's
hopefully washed out a lot of like stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: that we wouldn't want to accumulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using that season to your advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That winterizing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It helps for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: How far away from the coast?
[SPEAKER_05]: As the crow flies, I want to say like
between 20 and 30 miles, maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're at 1,700 feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about an hour drive to the coast,
hour, 15 minutes drive to the coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: 1,700 feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that in relationship to,
is that pretty, pretty high in that range?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean, it's, there's, there's a lot
of variation.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of our properties will be at 1,100,
another at 1,300.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's 17.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there's another one at like 21 or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do see a little variation in
quality, mostly because the temperature is
[SPEAKER_05]: different and the humidity is different in
those areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you get some of that coastal effects
still?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We definitely have a maritime climate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Each morning that fog rolls in and it's,
it's right in that little pocket where
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not too much fog.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every morning, it kind of, it burns off
around 11 o'clock and rolls back in and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So every time it rolls in, a lot of
growers like, oh crap, here comes the
[SPEAKER_04]: moisture, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But think of it as an inoculation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That out, those IMOs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're getting all that marine layer,
all that stuff that's come up off the land
[SPEAKER_04]: and been trapped up into that moisture and
it's coming onto the land.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in some places that have been abused
and used, exposed and just dirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's literally what they are is dirt,
just minerals.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is one of those first steps.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of those first steps of mother
nature, shifting that succession and
[SPEAKER_04]: introducing that bacteria onto the land,
which then progresses and continues to
[SPEAKER_04]: grow and it gets more complex and more
complex.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what you're doing is you're just
speeding up the process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trying to work with the natural systems as
much as possible, you know, adaptively
[SPEAKER_05]: manage the forest with the goats a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really, really helps with fire
prevention.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like all of our neighborhood went up in
smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really sad actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Melody, she's got water for the
neighborhood in case there is a fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only so much brush cleanup you can
do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if everybody had goats,
there would be a lot less wildfires going
[SPEAKER_05]: on.
[SPEAKER_04]: A really cool benefit to goats,
which is something that in the soil
[SPEAKER_04]: profile that we're always looking for are
what are called micro archipods,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is another way to say it's just
teeny tiny crabs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And their job is to shred up that
material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a hypoaspis, my hypoaspis Niles.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to know what it's really like?
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're looking through the
microscope, it's like Godzilla walking
[SPEAKER_04]: through Tokyo.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a crab.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, like straight up king crab with
long spindly arms and pinches.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can only see it with a microscope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the nematodes and all those guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it just moves through and it
doesn't care about anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that one called?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called a micro archipod.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's job is to shred.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like a family though, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's macro arthropods,
which are what you're referring to that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see with your naked eye or with
like a very mild objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's micro arthropods that you
can see at about a hundred to two hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: X, but to really like see them and you're,
you're going to like 400 and they do like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you ever worked on the
microscope when you see a nematode,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know how like you can see everything
moving around where the nematode,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you think about the T rex going boom,
boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing with the micro
arthropod.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just pulls everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just imagine like a wrecking ball coming
in.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's happening in your soil or it's
supposed to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's creating air pockets and what
you were talking about Q with aggregates
[SPEAKER_04]: that crumble.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when you haven't abused your soil,
you go out there, you should be able to do
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it be like a cottage cheese,
you know, where the curds and stuff like
[SPEAKER_04]: it should be lumpy like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've literally, well, I've literally
worked in a, in a heavy, heavy clay soil
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can hit it with a dig bar and
you're only going in concrete or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And literally from like a cover cropping
and top dressing and then like sheet
[SPEAKER_01]: mulching it and like stoking it out and
teeing it up, taking care of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next year you could literally go
and like break into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and it was crazy cause like the
clay would literally just break up in it
[SPEAKER_01]: and like crumble up the color chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just like, Whoa, like that's,
that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the cool part.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't have to take 20 years,
10,000 years mother nature's schedule one
[SPEAKER_04]: season.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go from dirt to reaching your arm
into three feet of alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's because you add the life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do you guys recommend that the life
comes from?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I like wood chips.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we've been doing some wood chip
in and cotton, trying to compost that
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff down with the, with the goat manure,
but like the hay, I guess is good and
[SPEAKER_05]: cover crop making our own residues and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But like to really get like, to get three
feet of, of, of 4,000 square feet of,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, that's like, that's a lot of,
that's a lot of material you're talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is where wonderful
companies who understand this reality go,
[SPEAKER_04]: we have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can show you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can either show you and teach you,
or we can sell you a product that can do
[SPEAKER_00]: it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, what you put into it is
what you get out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think to think of it as a
wheel with all the spokes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have one of those spokes
functional, the wheel's not going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to kind of look, you know,
what are my waste streams?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I utilize that's available to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you have a lot of food waste,
worms are great.
[SPEAKER_05]: True.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the PG&E companies, they'll do
clearing and they'll chip it and they'll
[SPEAKER_05]: just leave it and that's something we can
scoop up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if you really want to charge it,
like go, make it go crazy, you add the
[SPEAKER_04]: life.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then you get an extract or a compost
tea or a grave material and you go to
[SPEAKER_04]: those piles that you're just going to let
it sit for a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have to be on your property,
but you can put those microbes to work,
[SPEAKER_04]: changing that biology and then take that
and put it on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and as long as you set it up
correctly, it gets stronger over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the longer it sits, the better it
gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, so where anybody tells you
you're going to see this decline or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's not correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just not doing the steps in the
right order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biology concentrates life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it takes the forces and it
concentrates it into like a denser form,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And really that's where that amino acid
complex is coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the diversity of life and eating and
processing that matter and that mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it puts it into the amino acid,
which is like the body force, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, when that feeds the
plant, that's complexity and that's flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: complexity and that's like, you know,
all the turp complexity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where that comes from, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Working with the exudates of the plant and
boosting their ability to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant is really the one in charge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're putting the plant in charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, I want to eat this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to eat this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant can choose because it has the
intelligence.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, it's not just choose.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant can help dictate.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant can say, hey, I know it's not
out here on the buffet line with 50
[SPEAKER_04]: options, but could you really make me some
of grandma's pie?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will encourage that growth and then
be able to access it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: UC Davis right now is saying minimum of 15
cover crop species, minimum, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And optimum like 20, 35 or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, if you want to talk about
diversity and sugar, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution and because there's going to
be different microbes for different
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like different preferences of food types
for different folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the easiest way to start is gaining
that knowledge of your place and what
[SPEAKER_04]: resources you have.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also the life that lives there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of the team.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jeff, Jeff's got an amazing book.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've talked to Jeff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm very familiar.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, it is part of the teaming with
microbes, teaming with nutrients,
[SPEAKER_04]: teaming with fungi needs to be the other
meaning of the word too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It requires a active, diverse team robust
life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody needs to initiate the symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how plants grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how they always grow long before we
were ever around.
[SPEAKER_04]: But over the last 60 to 80 years,
we've killed everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's sad.
[SPEAKER_05]: The situation is bleak.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Dismal and a lot of like how we
get our food is pretty messed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've taken the idea of what plants grow
in and turned it from soil, which when I
[SPEAKER_04]: spell that out on my phone, it auto
corrects the soul, like the soul of the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where Tara is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when French and Elaine were talking,
it's like, yeah, that's where it's at.
[SPEAKER_04]: It starts with the microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You take that and it translates through
the plant and it changes to idealize
[SPEAKER_04]: itself in that growing environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like magic, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can see it with a microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy doing some work,
you know, with CBD, growing the same CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar for like 20 years, switched to
more fungal dominated soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden, the plant started showing
a complete diverse cannabinoid profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it's having all of those
enzymes, all those amino acids available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where those little complexities or
nuances can, you know, actually be
[SPEAKER_00]: produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hitting the switches.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hitting the TGHC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's those genome switches that are
getting hit by the enzymes, getting hit by
[SPEAKER_01]: the amino, you know, turn it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triggered by different conditions to
produce a different cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have our own gut biome, microbiome
inside of our bodies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you eat crappy food, it makes you
feel like this, you know, where it gives
[SPEAKER_04]: you, you know, some on the backside,
you know, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or some, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's because you don't have what it
takes literally to process that material.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your plants don't have what it takes to do
what they want to do because they don't
[SPEAKER_04]: have what they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and if you think about it,
the root hair of a plant is so fine,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's sucking in the mineral, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sucking in that and the hyphae.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fungal hyphae is 10 times smaller than
a root hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so the follicle on the, on,
on, on the root tip, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sucking in molecules like super
small, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of that nutrient mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Micromicros.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but it's not digesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have a stomach like an animal,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Animal has a stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can micronize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's the microscopic animals,
then they can digest that food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when it comes out and it hits the
root hair, it's going in, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's that it's small enough to like
make the trick.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see it like, we're kind of on a debate
transitioning from these like salts and
[SPEAKER_05]: minerals and organic salt mineral things
where you need to use a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you require like because we have
all of that here in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, are you guys implementing water
savings like strategies as part of the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole system?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have quite a few and a lot of it,
like I said, it depends on what works with
[SPEAKER_00]: your operation and process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we utilize biochar in a lot of
different ways, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the char that we work with can hold
even up to like, I think 13 gallons of
[SPEAKER_00]: water per cubic foot for a cubic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's seven and a half gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it almost is too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it's like, you have to use like five
to 10%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Five to 10% biochar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very carefully.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be inoculated.
[SPEAKER_04]: The biochar is a structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the carbon sponge.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's not inoculated with the life,
it's a sponge that will suck nutrients and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff out of your soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you'll often have a lot of
people who use a bunch of raw wood chips
[SPEAKER_04]: and they'll have a big nitrogen sink.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then initially, yeah, your plants
aren't growing quite right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what they need is being sucked up.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got to get soaked with all that water
and the color starts to go from tan to
[SPEAKER_04]: like dirt looking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are humics.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's humic acid.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's working through.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's actually because of the fungi
breaking that down and breaking up the
[SPEAKER_04]: lignans and turning it into the most
beautiful, complex organic molecule that's
[SPEAKER_04]: literally just made by these little
creatures exuding different things and
[SPEAKER_04]: even gluing different things together.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's like you think of a piece of,
go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was just going to say,
if you think about it, right, on the
[SPEAKER_01]: simplest level, like a simple salt isn't
going to give you a complex flavor,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it in the finished product.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how it burns.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the biggest thing about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stand how it burns.
[SPEAKER_05]: How it tastes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just like, ah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You only get to smoke about 30% of your
wheat.
[SPEAKER_05]: The joint doesn't last long.
[SPEAKER_05]: The fucking bowl doesn't last long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just cleaning all the charred shit
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the microbes are breaking down the
lignans and making these humic acids.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what do the worms do to that?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're making a plant available nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: What don't they do?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you've gone from micro to worm,
you've like giant jumps in who eats who.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The worm is like the great white shark
swimming through the soil in comparison to
[SPEAKER_04]: the T-Rex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beyond.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what it's doing is the worms don't eat
the mineral.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're eating the bacteria on the
minerals.
Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_04]: And the bacteria are breaking down the
minerals.
[SPEAKER_04]: The slime and the stuff from rotting,
decomposing stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, all the time you have like a piece
of cardboard.
[SPEAKER_04]: You put your pot down for a day and
there's a worm underneath.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there isn't, there should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that means that your ground is
alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you seen the Fantastic Fungi movie?
[SPEAKER_04]: Highly recommend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got some visuals of like at the
bottom of the pool looking up from the
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective of below the roots without
seeing the soil and just seeing all the
[SPEAKER_04]: life moving through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what we think.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get locked off because we can't see
what's moving around everywhere or should
[SPEAKER_04]: be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've noticed I can feel it when you are
monitoring the moisture level in the soil
[SPEAKER_05]: every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like pretty much your main focus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're watching how much moisture is
in the soil versus how much is transpired
[SPEAKER_05]: through the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: How much is evaporated because of,
you know, humidity and the wind and heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see when the roots fill out,
like you get x-ray vision down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's like, OK, I'm starting to
develop this relationship with the soil
[SPEAKER_05]: where I can't really put words on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Talks to you differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you want to have all those nutrients
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you just get those tap roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want those little feeder roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want those lateral growth,
those little feeders that are like your
[SPEAKER_00]: foot soldiers out there reaching for food
all of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to touch on the worms,
another cool thing about worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's only two ways to like sterilize
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's through thermal composting at
reaching up temperatures between 130 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 160 for a certain amount of time and then
passing through the digestive system of a
[SPEAKER_00]: worm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only two ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that little worm does just as good of
a job as us shoveling and turning and all
[SPEAKER_00]: this little homie in there is just eating
and pooping.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been really concerned about not
thermophilically composting this goat
[SPEAKER_05]: manure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like that's a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to there's some things you
want to like test to see with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like also it's like aging is also that
time where the goat manure, it does get a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit hotter, but it manure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends what they're eating on the
spectrum of maneuvers.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like we know the spectrum of
maneuver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends if it's mixed with urine,
then it definitely will be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: spicier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if you go out for Thai food.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the worms will chew it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing with the worms, you got to
watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need it to be moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to watch that moisture level a
little bit more with compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like a 70 percent moisture,
opposed to like the 50 percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_04]: The microbes need water.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they can drown, which we all know when
you overwater.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you let your pots dry out,
they literally shrivel up and are like,
[SPEAKER_04]: hey, it's not OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll go dormant for a little while and
it'll take them a minute to reactivate and
[SPEAKER_05]: get reestablished.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what has happened to your plants
during that time period?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally, your entire team went,
we're out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not safe here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't live here anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their bodies literally shrivel up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because their bodies are 70 percent water.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you're watering your soil,
really what you're doing is you're
[SPEAKER_04]: rehydrating the life that's there and you
want to maintain it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you played with stress factors in the
plants?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the plant having a beneficial,
you know, having any benefit in the
[SPEAKER_05]: terpene profile of the finished product?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I see like it's important for the
plant to experience that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you choose to, you know,
put the plants through some stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can break that down, too, because
there's microbes that are keyed into the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that when the plant is sending out
stress signals, they start producing
[SPEAKER_00]: polysaccharides, sugars to feed the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where you see that from.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times there's one type we use in
our grow cubes, a type of bacterium called
[SPEAKER_00]: an endophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a type.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an actual there's a couple hundred
different species of them, but they
[SPEAKER_00]: colonize within the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's literally its only job is to
make sure that plant has food because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how it stays alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when that plant is like, ah,
it's just like, OK, sugar, sugar,
[SPEAKER_00]: sugar, sugar, whatever you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't don't leave me hanging, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's I think why a lot, you know,
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like that level of stress and how
fast like the microbes can survive if that
[SPEAKER_00]: stress level or like climate change or
environment change is gradual.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's like boom within an hour or
two, it kills everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where like you why you see mixed
results, I would imagine, with like
[SPEAKER_00]: stressing the plants, because I've seen it
go both ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did a test plan on some CBD Ringo's
gift.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I didn't water.
[SPEAKER_05]: I stopped watering it in the in a hugel
bed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted, I stopped watering it in August.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't water it all September and I
chopped it in October.
[SPEAKER_05]: Didn't water it one time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It rained a couple of times, but it was
delicious.
[SPEAKER_05]: The flavor and the the the resin heads.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I looked at them under the scope.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were so full and robust compared to
everything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you're stressed out,
doesn't your sweat smell differently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody gets stressed your plant,
but where it grew was in this giant fungal
[SPEAKER_04]: community of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Within that giant fungal community,
that giant fungal community actually will
[SPEAKER_04]: share water.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was tapped into that whole bed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But because it was tapped into it,
it had to depend on its friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, hey, buddies, I need some
help here.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy's not watering me anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some things to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they gave to it and it changed its
profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was playing with the bacillus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Megatarium bacillus.
[SPEAKER_05]: What should we call it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Lactobacillus, bacterias.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I noticed like when I put the bacillus
on there, the stem, the diameter of the
[SPEAKER_05]: stem doubles damn near, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems to help with drought type
situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that same thing where it's like
colonizes so close to that root zone that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're putting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the gatekeeper for the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're putting that bacillus in
there, that's where it likes to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really close to this root.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you take like my brother and his
wife have a yogurt company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the byproducts is whey.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they make a whey probiotic drink out
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you could basically read those.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could like make a tea and like keep
the population.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother it or make similar to like kombucha
scoby or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit different process than
kombucha because with kombucha you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with yeast more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you take us down the path of how to
inoculate labs?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like how to make some labs or how do you
guys do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a lot of different ways to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get like I like to do use a variety of
different seed washes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everybody says rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I also was using for a while when
I was making bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best labs I ever made, I would use the
recycled bubble hash water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have pictures of it on my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would come out, you know,
the curd would come out like almost
[SPEAKER_00]: iridescent, like rainbow colored.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different grains would have different
patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the barley was like really looked
like brains.
[SPEAKER_05]: In my mind, that looks crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to dig up a picture, but I have it
on my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was barley, using barley seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like blue corn seed wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm a big fan of like the sprouted
sea teas or enzyme teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like hold them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Genius.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It works though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the hash water, because it's like you
got all those polyphenols in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what those like those tough guy
bacteria is really like to chew on or
[SPEAKER_00]: those like kind of like selecting food
compounds that break down slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same way people say not to use
eucalyptus in compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that it doesn't break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes longer because of all those
polyphenols and aromatic compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tougher.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very volatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be chewed on a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which also inhibits other fungal growth or
other growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about brassicas?
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone was telling me that the brassicas
are hurting the my.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't colonize with fungi.
[SPEAKER_05]: They put out an acid.
OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're cold season.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of cold season.
[SPEAKER_04]: That entire group of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's your cauliflower.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, things things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you saying those are not good as
companion crops?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not good as a companion crop if
you're trying to promote specifically
[SPEAKER_04]: mycorrhizae growth and support that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it doesn't inhibit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not allopathic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it kind of has a part to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just prefers a different soil biome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's kind of a simple, very simple
kind of basic sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like grew with dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like some of the first plants that
grew on land.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they want something very similar to
like rock or sand.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they don't need that mineral
rich environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why you see them pop up as weeds
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have that biology there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a lot of fungi, they won't
pop up because they can't grow in that
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's rewind that and listen to them one
at a time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it going to hurt my cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like grew with dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like some of the first plants that
grew on land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want something very similar to
like rock or sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they don't need that mineral
rich environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why you see them pop up as weeds
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have that biology there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a lot of fungi, they won't
pop up because they can't grow in that
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ryan, what are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it going to hurt my cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like grew with dinosaurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like some of the first plants that
grew on land.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they want something very similar to
like rock or sand.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they don't need that mineral rich
environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why you see them pop up as weeds
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't have that biology there.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you have a lot of fungi, they won't
pop up because they can't grow in that
environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why you see them pop up as weeds
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because think about it, the biology in the
soil is more complex.
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, the guys are kind of just doing
their own thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't have the team to support them,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: When that brassica is all by himself,
it doesn't have the team support.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's more vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Therefore, those are the ones that the
plants or the insects are going to go
[SPEAKER_04]: after.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the strong healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the nutrient content too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like aphids like go after whatever has the
most sugar in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why a lot of times I've seen where
you're able to... Oh, I like that you know
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people don't even know about bricks
testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the higher the bricks rating,
it's not based on sugar.
[SPEAKER_04]: They use sugar to calibrate it,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's based on viscosity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like how much stuff is in it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we know that there's a lot more
than just sugar in sap.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, but that's the misnomer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if the bricks rating is high enough,
like even to the 10 to 12, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: possible, that really just means
everybody's working together.
[SPEAKER_04]: That plant's cruising.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their cell wall is thicker and aphid
cannot pierce it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the plant literally is like,
you can't bother me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go mess with that broccoli.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go over there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Leave cannabis alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's really what's happening
on the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a big believer in the chitin,
chitinase process, you know, and how that
[SPEAKER_05]: activates within of the cells and you
know, it starts to produce its own
[SPEAKER_05]: chitinase and deter pests and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been seeing, I learned it from this
guy, John Parr.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has a farm called Viridis or had a farm
called Viridis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the core protocracy screwed,
they fucked him over big time,
[SPEAKER_05]: but he developed the world's largest
aquaponics, certified organic aquaponics
[SPEAKER_05]: system down there in Watsonville.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the man is just dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's told, mentioned this guy to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually I lived down in Watsonville.
[SPEAKER_05]: Legend, legend.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was open sourcing everything,
just teaching people how to feed
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're using this high chitin worm
casting extract to reverse pine beetle
[SPEAKER_05]: infestation in like Montana and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feeds the like, you know, like if you
want to look at it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's like that PFR 97.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like, Maroon Bio makes a couple of
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the insect eating fungi,
you know, they feed off of chitin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they eat insects because
they're high, they're exoskeletons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skeletons are full of chitin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you need a heavy, like some heavy
control, like that's those chitin,
[SPEAKER_05]: chitin, chitinase based solutions seem to
be like pretty ecological, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like chitin worm castings.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're using life to support life,
not what do I have to kill, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're, you're progressing the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're progressing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're making the biology, you're making
it more diverse, more complex.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that, the plant becomes more
diverse and more complex.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know anybody trying to say,
can I just be more middle of the road?
[SPEAKER_04]: No flavor, no nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we're trying to push it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's trying to push to differentiate the
genetic potential, which is where we're
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about terroir and appellations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the reality that the microbes
of your place change your plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which makes them, how could we get more
chitin in our system?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's different options,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always, you can always go buy
some, which is somebody else collecting
[SPEAKER_04]: it, or you can go and collect from
different sources.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is where understanding your
resource opportunities and waste streams.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just talking about resource,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Resource on your farm, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your soil and your fertility, like that
should be the biggest resource because
[SPEAKER_01]: like, that complex that is the soil,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That structure is what's going to grow
your plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And other than that, it's temperature and
light, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But that structure is like all that
mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really like on that budget and on that
plan, that fertility plan, that soil plan,
[SPEAKER_01]: that management plan, like that's going to
like, you know, I mean, that's your
[SPEAKER_01]: management plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like health insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it should be, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should be on the books like as,
Hey, this is important to like investing
[SPEAKER_01]: and work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are creatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're feeding a whole ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have an opportunity to interact with
it as someone who's like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that I want to promote this and
because that I'm going to feed this
[SPEAKER_04]: material, either a fish amino acid or the
robust structure of, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the compost because the compost is that
bacteria, fungi, protozoa, nematodes,
[SPEAKER_04]: all these creatures breaking down organic
material and making it plant available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's literally what they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: The end result of really good compost,
if you just let it sit, it's called
[SPEAKER_04]: topsoil.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what, you know, it turns into.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of ways to do that though,
like that solidization and micronization
[SPEAKER_00]: of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where like, you know,
you talk a lot about this when you go back
[SPEAKER_00]: and forth, you know, cause it's like,
it's, you know, it's not so much how you
[SPEAKER_00]: get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the fact that you're,
you know, are able to create this closed
[SPEAKER_00]: loop system using your own, your research
sources that you have on hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and what works with your flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's going to cost you more time or
labor energy to do it, then it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: really that probably, you know,
going to work for the next 10 years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and that's, that's a good way to
describe it is what do you want your farm
[SPEAKER_00]: to look like?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want it to look like a bunch of
plastic jugs filled with liquid nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if we need some, some plant
available nutrition, I would like to be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to make it onsite.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somehow, you know, like, so like,
cause the, the, the compost is,
[SPEAKER_05]: I it's the key.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a, it's a for terroir, like you're
saying, but sometimes you are in a cold
[SPEAKER_05]: spell, you know, and you need to like,
you need something right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that compost, you know, it's going to
have that nutrition short and long-term,
[SPEAKER_04]: but like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it's gone, it's gone through an
undesirable stress factor.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just been cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: The sun hasn't come out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's no, like there's some
serious calcium activity.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, there's no calcium moving,
but it's really immobile because the
[SPEAKER_05]: physics aren't there, you know,
and the compost can be great, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: but when there's calcium and mobility,
because the physics aren't there,
[SPEAKER_05]: I only know that we need to put some
calcium chloride on there and do it for
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like where you come with the
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a short term, but the short term
will often inhibit the longterm.
[SPEAKER_05]: You say in spring some calcium chloride
and do it like, some sticky conditions
[SPEAKER_04]: would inhibit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's an example.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're growing on old farm or old work
land, there's so much phosphorus dumped
[SPEAKER_04]: onto work land and it doesn't leave.
[SPEAKER_04]: That phosphorus is inhibiting mycorrhizae
growth because they don't need the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant doesn't need it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why support this other guy?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need a middleman.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that, that understanding of what's
going on in your soil, what changes that
[SPEAKER_04]: is the biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now what are we adding?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to add CalMag.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to add the things that make it
available.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So now the question is who's doing the
work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there's an abundance from like an
over input of phosphorus, then we want to
[SPEAKER_05]: use some fixing plants, like some,
some cover crops to fix it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And try to remediate the.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we're talking because you're using
life to promote life.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I'm going to have a plant that has
a job so I don't have to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that job is, can be anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if a dandelion fixes calcium in the
soil that we just turned into a part of
[SPEAKER_04]: the team.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: I like, like the idea of, you know,
making the dandelion plant extract,
[SPEAKER_05]: a liquid plant extract.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you're taking not only what it
does, but what it is, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're putting that into the process
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where the enzymes are such a
big part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that, if you want to like get,
you know, you're talking about calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake, you want to get your buds swell on
a little bit and like just everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that's, everything that's in the soil,
get them to kind of take up what's in
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The barley, it's full of amylase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually the enzyme that's in our
saliva that breaks down things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a ton of other enzymes and more
complex sugars in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either do like a barley sprouted
seed tea, or if you're trying to do like a
[SPEAKER_00]: large scale, you can just get the malted
milled barley, put it in a teabag,
[SPEAKER_00]: seep it for like, aerate it for like 30
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within a day or two, like there's
different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also are full in plant growth
hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So barley is full in oxen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be your like apicable,
like vertical growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like I use blue corn more in
bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's lateral growth and like bud
strength and branch strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, that's like the two like feeds
where within 12 to 24 hours, like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that sheen come out and like,
you know, like I have to see that shiny
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not shiny, it's not healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually the fat.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how the plant's telling you it's
fat and happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's literally making.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's their lipids.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're lipids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lipids, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called the waxy cuticle.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes it shiny.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's wax.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fat.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant's literally going, I'm a plant,
but I'm a fat plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see it on the new growth where it looks
almost like plastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks almost like plastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what happens, usually people,
the temperature increases and what
[SPEAKER_04]: happens?
[SPEAKER_04]: The cells start to spread out a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: The life in the soil got stressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So therefore it was able, no, no,
that plant knows how to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to give it some credit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can adapt to tremendously good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's real good at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It generally wants to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree on the genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in my garden, literally if it
doesn't grow, sorry, we tried,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's one of those things where
no hard feelings.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to stress this.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like we'll be cloning, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes we'll have like,
we'll just have really good success on a
[SPEAKER_05]: clone and from the clone form to a
finished product.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, hold on.
[SPEAKER_04]: That plant looks healthy mother.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same mother, same mother plant,
tray of clones from same mother,
[SPEAKER_05]: but that one tray or no, like a handful of
plants in that tray are just like,
[SPEAKER_05]: like they yield more there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have less problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: They grow faster.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just, they're like, they,
they just dominate.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would find out who's that cutter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a way to like even it out
afterwards?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, because we seem, it seems to be
the only work around is to make twice as
[SPEAKER_05]: many plants as we need to, and then select
the best half of those to get the most
[SPEAKER_05]: robust ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, for, to take a plant that's
hurt and bring it back, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: to full strength is like you, there's some
liquid fast things we can do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't you do that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause we're out, we're farmers on a time
crunch basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a produce to survive and make it
pencil.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to be at a certain scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we're just talking about having the
right tool to do the right job so that the
[SPEAKER_04]: force, whatever team you have can get the
job done.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can then go and have fun with your
friends and take your kids to the beach,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like, ideally that would be
cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is an entire world and universe of
creatures that their sole purpose is to
[SPEAKER_04]: love on your plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're part of the team.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm all about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if I don't watch my plants every day,
something goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was working like you're trying
to cut 1500 to like I had another place
[SPEAKER_00]: that was cutting 11,000 clones a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, so there is like that
degree and it is like when you're and with
[SPEAKER_00]: anything with more like more margin for
error because you're increasing in your
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it, I think is like
accidental contamination in between how
[SPEAKER_00]: like the light cycle the moms are and like
where you're cutting, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to the health, you know,
because like, and you could solve that by
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, like doing brick testing or like
tissue testing in the top middle or bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: to see, you know, if it's if those
nutrients are actually going all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where the cuts are coming from on that mom
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even determining even then,
I mean, we did like a lot of clone trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a grow cube product that we're
really seeing that's like inoculated with
[SPEAKER_00]: all of our biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can introduce it to the life,
even if it's not in soil, because it coats
[SPEAKER_04]: it and then helps.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called the rhizosphere platform.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's this whole world right along the
route that can happen inside an indoor
[SPEAKER_04]: grow too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you guys got a product that is
binoculant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've seen a lot of like, you know,
where it pretty much generates the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: immune system from day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the issues like the biggest
thing, too, like when production,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have a tray that goes bad and dies,
well, they're going to mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't find them or there's one that's
bad in the middle and it just takes one
[SPEAKER_00]: and it spreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where like we came in and we
were working with these cats that had like
[SPEAKER_00]: fusarium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had like three different kinds of
like umices, like water molds in their
[SPEAKER_00]: clone room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would just contaminate and
recontaminate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the biggest thing we saw
from our cubes is they didn't get PM from
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, you know, there was enough good
guys to eat the PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of it with cloning, like actual
rooting and successful cloning,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you want 90% humidity for like
three to five days, then 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like over 14 days, you slowly act
like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to have a good time if
you don't have a good mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just genetics.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doing moms with salts, like versus moms in
soil, there's no comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had like a thing that's what they hired
us or we were working with them for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I finally just applied some of
our compost on the moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like in this cocoa core mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within 24 hours, the moms look great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the compost was white because it had
literally just like pulled all the salt
[SPEAKER_00]: out and the plants were like, oh,
I can drink again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have to keep re-applying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were so locked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working with salt-based systems,
like there's definitely like an ebb and
[SPEAKER_00]: flow you can get into with it,
but you're still always going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: add more and add more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like just add it once and maintain
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to save you a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys aren't going to like this,
but I went and worked on an indoor farm,
[SPEAKER_05]: a real big thousand lighter for a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they don't use their soil more than
one time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nuts and all the rock wool is what
kills me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rock wool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plastic trays.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cocoa, the tupper.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just pallets and pallets and pallets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's painful.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you have to put on your
blinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, we'll play by the rules,
but we know plants grow in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really sad, but it's just more,
a lot of it is like just lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: information and people also don't feel
like it applies to them or they can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, I have to tear down my
whole system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have so much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't lose a day of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like finding a way to integrate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like, you know, it's a succession
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You integrate it over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you should always be, you know,
it's a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's profit oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of times with big
operations, your profits come from
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency, not from numbers or yields or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just being efficient, not having
somebody walk back and forth 20 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then he's tired,
but he actually has to go do what he needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like little things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like make way more of a difference
in like when, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that there's, we have a really big
challenge with product differentiation and
[SPEAKER_05]: product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the indoor brand, just like indoor
weed is being better is like so
[SPEAKER_05]: entrenched.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's so like fighting against that
educate, providing some type of platform
[SPEAKER_05]: or education and like places like this
should be open 24 every day of the week
[SPEAKER_05]: where you can go to a farmer's market and
gets a pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's education right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then people will start to experience
where their weeds coming from.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can meet the farmer, you know,
and hopefully we work in that direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people out at the farmer's
market all day, every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing it right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're living the dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of stuff going on and it's
really cool because of technology,
[SPEAKER_04]: because of events and because people are
feeling more comfortable to come out of a
[SPEAKER_04]: shell type, you know, I mean, you've been
around that there's, there's no longer the
[SPEAKER_04]: same feeling of aloneness, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The garden got bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because of that, we have almost,
it's called a quorum, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the microbes have it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called quorum sensing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you have bad guys on you and in
you right now, like the bad bacteria is
[SPEAKER_04]: another stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: They literally talk to each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they get to the right level,
they go, let's party.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you get sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: The same thing happens in your soil,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the plants, the soil's talking to you
long before your plant turns a color
[SPEAKER_04]: because that life is what's actually
helping that plant process and grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so no matter how that plant grew,
the plant literally just needs the right
[SPEAKER_04]: team to work with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it works out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm loving it, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm loving seeing like the, the,
the, the regenerative stuff really work.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really, really works like without a
doubt.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no comparison.
[SPEAKER_05]: Living soil pot is better than salt based
mineral base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Longer shelf life, longer shelf life,
lasts a lot longer, smells fresher,
[SPEAKER_00]: stays cleaner, longer every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: More cost effective, higher profit margin,
greater markup value, better carbon story,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: All the things you're supposed to talk to
your marketing guy about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you grow like this, like here's
another example.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you prove yours is different?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's actually tests that you can
do that says my plant was grown in a 98%
[SPEAKER_04]: alive soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called a Haney test.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like, but you can say that
this plant is special and different
[SPEAKER_04]: because of how it was grown.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: That can be added to the value of your
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't heard of the Haney test.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: The microbes are the, what creates the
terroir.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have tests for the microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can literally make it tangible that
says, no, this is why I'm different.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are my creatures, my team.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys have any like isolated like
specific blends of trichoderma or Glomis
[SPEAKER_05]: or bacillus or like, or do you guys,
is that your inoculant is like a full
[SPEAKER_05]: spectrum kind of thing or you have select
microbes to like, cause I know for like
[SPEAKER_05]: mother plants to get more apical growth,
the trichoderma in the root seems to
[SPEAKER_05]: really work well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also for like, a botrytis prevention,
you know, in the root, it's, it's
[SPEAKER_05]: tremendous.
[SPEAKER_05]: The hard cyanum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely has its benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to me, it's like kind of like,
you know, you don't want to use that until
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, you really like it
doesn't, it overtakes everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of have to use it sparingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the trichoderma products,
like I've looked at under the scope and
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't really germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people don't like,
you have to refrigerate them for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's definitely ones that are more
viable than others in different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, I, I, we don't really work
with it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a need to, but I do believe like,
I think they all work better together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when like the protozoa eats the
bacteria, you know, that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the nematode eats the protozoa and
that cycling and digesting, you create,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I think, but we also do offer,
we have our endophyte product that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: our grow cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a specific class of bacteria and
that colonizes in the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really good for moms or something
in a pot because it's never going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: washed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's actually, it's a specific type
of endophyte that helps like what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about polysaccharide production.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an endophyte.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, that's what it's inside plant
tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that means for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you could say systemic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Organic systemic plant boosters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gate, I like to think of it as like
the gatekeeper, you know, and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: like, it's really good also for,
for breaking down like salts or crease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasing salinity tolerance,
you know, salt soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of success using it in like
hydroponic situations, but you can
[SPEAKER_00]: remediate salt soil too with compost
really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just cycle it, mix it in,
let it sit, you know, and by spring,
[SPEAKER_05]: I was farming in the East Bay and soil
salinity is a big problem out there with
[SPEAKER_05]: like the, all the farmers pretty much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you guys doing anything?
[SPEAKER_05]: With non-cannabis farms, helping grow,
like remediate fields and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They could use some help with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely be open to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we work with, you know,
all types and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the job is the same and we have the
team to do the job, all the microbes,
[SPEAKER_04]: you just got to get them to the right
spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got to create the environment,
the conditions and the systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what lactobacillus is really good
at breaking down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you always give them analogies in
microbe terms?
[SPEAKER_03]: The cakes and cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: My children have their own plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: They help breed genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: My kids play in the garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know no different.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have any of the drama.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's literally just the habit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happiest place on earth.
[SPEAKER_04]: My kid this season, I posted on Instagram,
I don't know if you already started,
[SPEAKER_04]: but he's like, dad, I want to do an
experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, sure, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, I want to see if peas
change the pH.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's seven, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's check.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we put out and did a little soil or
a water pH and he tested it and he's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: how many peas?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause he understands about dose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we measure stuff to put in because
their small life, a small amount packs a
[SPEAKER_04]: punch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they do that job, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he's like, let's start with 10
peas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like shucking peas and putting it
into the peach.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we tested the pH and guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's valuable information.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is though, but now you know,
because if it did, holy crap.
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't had a new way to change pH.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knew?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's okay to experiment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you talking about the peas,
the plant peas or urine?
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done both.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought you were talking about urine the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I have to pee myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you shut peas?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how you do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotcha.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would think that they'd be alkaline.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you're saying nitrogen is there's
different types of nitrogen though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we're playing with nitrate based
nitrogen versus aminical nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a difference in how soluble they
are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much nitrogen does your plant need?
[SPEAKER_04]: We have bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not as much as a lot of people will give
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have bacteria that literally fix
nitrogen out of the air into the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: The azospirillium, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You got that part of the team too,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: If like, I only had one thing that would
change farming, stop, make like nitrogen
[SPEAKER_04]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you change that one input and you just
stop doing that, it would change
[SPEAKER_04]: everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can cover crop with legumes and get
plenty of nitrogen, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It changes everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: From close to a hundred pounds,
it's like a hundred pounds an acre they
[SPEAKER_01]: can fixate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think like the legumes can do
like 200 or something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, this is where your cover crop
is literally working all year long doing
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's, it's absolutely amazing that the
it's alive and the more diverse,
[SPEAKER_04]: the more crazy, the more intense,
how high is your garden?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Your garden's three dimensional.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have understory plants and middle
story plants and in the middle right here
[SPEAKER_04]: because they branch out over, like you can
change everything with layers of life with
[SPEAKER_04]: the understanding that as above,
so below.
[SPEAKER_04]: All that life is freaking exploding in the
surface of the earth and it's healing the
[SPEAKER_04]: planet and us in the process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going for a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah.
