[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say something about
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big mess in California,
and a lot of people are suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm really proud to say that I've been
involved in legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you think it's our fault they're all
now in this mess?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, and I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nonetheless, a lot of less people are
going to jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was our priority, no?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: A regulation or legalization, whatever you
want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember eight years ago, and during the
High Times Cup, I declared the war on
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs that we wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a little ahead of your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, that's when Debbie
Goldsberry and Steve D'Angelo started all
[SPEAKER_00]: their dispensaries in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but we're still not fully legal in
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I think 2020 will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think Donald Trump is going to pull
the cards?
[SPEAKER_00]: You think so?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the Democratic people on the East
and West Coast that are not really a big
[SPEAKER_00]: fan of him are going to vote for him?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a Democrat from New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: That ain't going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, five percent is going to say,
oh, yeah, you're maybe a cool guy because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to legalize marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you get my vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, the Democrats didn't do
a lot of good things for us, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, politicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it that Bill Clinton put more people
in prison than anybody else for marijuana?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we say about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to leave the DT name out of
this, but let's not go into politics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, on the global scale of
legalization, you travel a lot more than I
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you tell us about the global
legalization scene?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you look at Europe, you know,
especially Holland, it was the leader for
[SPEAKER_00]: many, many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think to take it from there,
world's biggest economic disaster ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a country threw away a whole
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could have been leaders worldwide,
which are now the Americans and Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holland could have been that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we fucked it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we threw away a hundred billion dollar
prosperity in the next 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and then the rest of Europe slowly,
slowly coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, you've been in my clubs in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit movement there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit movement in Italy
with CBD shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit movement in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're moving to Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as you know, we have a license in the
suit and we have a license in Congo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly, we're opening up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're opening the boundaries in Africa,
which is a really good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, South Africa,
I'm from Zambia, but South Africa just two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks ago, High Supreme Court allowed
personal use, which opens a lot of doors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did hear something about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very good opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Portugal, Europe also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So South America was South America,
you know, now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chile, Colombia giving license out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Argentina willing to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uruguay was the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was one of the personal advisors of
President Mujica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me and Olaf and Haiko, we were there
three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paraguay, Haiko just came from Paraguay a
month ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brazil, eight license, small license,
R&D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uruguay?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, Uruguay was the first one to have
eight license.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm talking about Paraguay.
[SPEAKER_00]: New ones, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paraguay and Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look, the main thing is what we're
waiting for is America has to change on a
[SPEAKER_00]: federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada did.
[SPEAKER_00]: America is going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 2020, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that there will be a letter from
the government declaring all states do
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also on a recreational level, which means
that banks and other important assets for
[SPEAKER_00]: us can come into the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Descheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Descheduling will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will make the rest of the world
change a little bit faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're waiting for,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's all been about for me is
the normalization and the legalization of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved to California about 17 years ago
for the sole reason of not being a
[SPEAKER_01]: criminal for the first time in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reason why I moved to
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked you that question 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you go there where it's easy?
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my family and blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so California is a lovely place,
although it's on fire right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish prayers to everybody that's having
to evacuate their homes and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's why we've all been here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I can say that I'm proud to
be your friend, because we've always
[SPEAKER_01]: championed the legalization and the
normalization of cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not criminals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're no different from anybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, you people are all crazy if you
don't want to try a little cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we've been very big activists.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been 15 years chairman of the
Cannabis Retail Association in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I advise still mayors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joachim, our partner, you know Joachim
very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's still advising the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: We changed the law in Dutch parliament
last year together with one political
[SPEAKER_00]: party.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went through the second parliament,
which is really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's our duty as a human being to
be in the forefront with all our knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: and to be an activist and to help legalize
and for many, many reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for most important reason is
decriminalization and health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think within 10 to 20 years,
we will all be eating oil and it will
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent us getting sick in 80 percent of
the cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we know now this oil is a great
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it stops, in some cases,
the dividing of aggressive cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, whatever cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very good kind of antioxidant
for the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the medicinal properties
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you get into the hemp seed itself,
get into the hemp seed itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a great food stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all lacking in EFAs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, legalization and
spreading it around the world has been a
[SPEAKER_01]: privilege and an honor for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And getting to know you as young bucks as
we were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'll look at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not even gray yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke greenhouse seeds and marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, is that a new tagline?
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll never go gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ha, ha, ha, ha.
