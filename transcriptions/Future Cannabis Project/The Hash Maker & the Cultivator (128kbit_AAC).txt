[SPEAKER_10]: This is your chalice ash right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's sour OG.
[SPEAKER_07]: I brought some stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Older stuff before me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before I was working there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah?
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's nice and cured.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Aged.
[SPEAKER_09]: Aged, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That looks nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Straight that up.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's ice cream cake number one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you give Mike any of this?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no one's done any of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So why don't you throw this here,
Joe?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just put it right in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fucking bomb.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then just bring... I'm gonna smoke it
all day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It smells good, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, this is what I'm used to right here,
man.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm used to.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the ice cream cake right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ice cream cake?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Come on, boys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sit down.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, join us.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the map.
You too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come here, Wonder Brett.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sit down.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm an old trapper.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can actually sit next to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not an old trapper.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been doing this before you were born.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a joke because we're eating an old
trapper.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you bring it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the old trapper?
[SPEAKER_05]: Dang.
[SPEAKER_07]: Juicy, juicy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should go that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all wet.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have that joint.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's smoke that.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the lube ring, huh?
[SPEAKER_15]: Aw, here we go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not raw, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, but I've seen this.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys were posting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I started that.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see it from here.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's not.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you just put that on there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Joe, help me out here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I blame you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I blame you, Joel.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, what do you call this one,
man?
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Marathon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Marathon, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, damn.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sit down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come here.
[SPEAKER_08]: You already got this one out in the
stores?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not shy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_08]: The camera adds 10 pounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has a nice earthy tone.
[SPEAKER_10]: It smells gassy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, like a nice gassy.
[SPEAKER_10]: It has a gassy, earthy undertone to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you call this one?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you call this one?
[SPEAKER_10]: This is Peach X Gelati X Cushman's.
[SPEAKER_10]: I smelled Cushman's in it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It reminds me of a Cushman.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a reminder, but there's something
else going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you have there?
[SPEAKER_08]: The Sunkist?
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is something we hunted.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is ice cream cake number one.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have like four different phenols.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a 6, an 11, and a 14 that we just
ran.
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably going to run this one one more
time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And probably keep this one, actually.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, very nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right that one right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a cheap one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good bud structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a good smell off the bat.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of strains that you get,
they might be great off, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: they might look good and might have good
crystal content, but what they lack is
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe smell off the bat.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want a cultivar that has smell right
off the bat if you can.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have to work for it and like burp
it and baby it, I really, those are great,
[SPEAKER_08]: but you want it strong.
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you agree?
[SPEAKER_08]: My triangle mince that we used to run was
like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just, in the room it was stinky.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know, hunting through so much
shit, you find so much garbage you really
[SPEAKER_08]: don't want.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard finding keepers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys hunt a lot over at Cookies,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: When do you find yourself start taking
away, eliminating cuts from a hunt?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what stage?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like how, when it's like third no,
do you be like, okay, this one's got to
[SPEAKER_07]: go?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we run it all the way through.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: We run them all the way through and then
we, the guys that don't want to get on
[SPEAKER_08]: camera, the guys that don't want to get on
camera are the guys I go to to see which
[SPEAKER_08]: strains we like.
[SPEAKER_08]: They help me make a lot of decisions on,
because I can't smoke them all,
[SPEAKER_08]: but they can.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, he can, he helps us.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we, we, we give a lot of weed
out, you know, we, we see, we see the
[SPEAKER_08]: feedback, but most importantly,
it doesn't just have to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: vigor and THC and crystal content.
[SPEAKER_08]: Trimming weed too, also takes a place,
whether you're going to keep it or not.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it trims like shit and it breaks down,
like Cushman's breaks down the little
[SPEAKER_08]: buds.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, it's as far as in a pack,
it looks like shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: You, you know, it's good for packaging,
but little tiny buds, it's not appealing
[SPEAKER_08]: to someone.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want buds like are this size,
you know, bigger, you know, that's
[SPEAKER_08]: probably almost an eighth, but this is
probably an eighth right there,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, so we have to think about what
you want to bring to the market and
[SPEAKER_08]: actually use and put in a jar and
streamline as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's important to take, take that all into
consideration, you know, all of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I smell that?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I hold it?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh no, that probably improved it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And these guys hunt a lot over cookies.
[SPEAKER_08]: They work over Maywood.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right on, right on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they,
[SPEAKER_07]: not like not in this area, but more of the
Valley.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, as far as a retail store.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what were we just looking at?
[SPEAKER_14]: This is what ice cream cake?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the shape.
[SPEAKER_14]: You getting that Tom?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Should I pass this over or should I pass
it this way?
[SPEAKER_14]: And then what's this?
[SPEAKER_14]: Who made this?
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the Mac one jar tech.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's the Mac one jar tech full
term.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dry cured.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a different temperature that it was
pressed at.
[SPEAKER_10]: As a matter of fact, that's the same Mac
that we pressed here with puffin.
[SPEAKER_10]: And because we pressed it at that 225
temperature, the only option for it was to
[SPEAKER_10]: become jar tech.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I, I jar teched it and that's it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise it would look like that with the
way I would normally press it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's temperature based.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is temp.
[SPEAKER_10]: At, at 180, 225.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's, they're both Mac, the same
material, same press is just different
[SPEAKER_10]: temps.
[SPEAKER_10]: These are the tests that I actually
similar.
[SPEAKER_10]: I sent them off to the lab.
[SPEAKER_10]: I took my ice water hash, my 159 to my
45U.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my base line.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I sent that in for analysis of potency
and terpene content.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I did the 180 degree,
50 second press, getting that potency and
[SPEAKER_10]: terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I did another press at 210,
50 seconds also terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the jar tech at 225, three days,
80 degrees in the jar.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're going to see what happens with
the cannabinoid profiles as the extra heat
[SPEAKER_10]: is applied, seeing what kind of acids are
going to convert, seeing if there's any
[SPEAKER_10]: change in the terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what I'm looking to find out.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll know by the end of the week.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually have something in the truck.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a, it's a, it's like, it's a
spectrometer to, to actually test weed
[SPEAKER_08]: right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: THC.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's to test.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just got that a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's designed by an Israeli company to be
able to give you THC analysis on the go.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it can do flower in a room.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I like about it is the phenol testing
aspect behind it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I might not need to test every single
plant and set it off to test.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can basically test it there.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it tests really low, I can
eliminate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's like 18, 17, 16%, I can eliminate
it quickly.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just got it two days ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to, I think the membership online
is like $20 and you just pay yearly
[SPEAKER_08]: membership and you can basically test any
flower in a room.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the name of the company?
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to go get it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to bring it up?
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want one of the guys to go grab it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it easy to find or is it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's my truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: He needs to go to the car.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you're busy.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to go that way.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm, I've got a little cold, so I'm not
going to share the smoking with you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got a little coronavirus going on?
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got, I got the Corona.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not even a cold.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's more of a chest issue, breathing,
smoking too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, this is the one, the finer joints I
smoked.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now this week.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you want to look at some different
rosin that we pressed recently?
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely, bro.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: And who's the other, I met him and who's
that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Chris?
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that who you met?
[SPEAKER_10]: Who you're thinking of that you met at
Frenchies?
[SPEAKER_10]: He's not here.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a sun kiss.
[SPEAKER_10]: See these are the two.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the 180 and the 210 and then
Jartek.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can see they're all the same
material, just pressed a little bit
[SPEAKER_10]: different.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is that post, the recent post,
I think, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: This I didn't test.
[SPEAKER_10]: I, I, what I did was the kushments.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, yeah, I sent off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tom was asking early.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I look for with rosin and I said
texture and then taste.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't judge on look too much,
you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: And like with this one, see I would a
hundred percent choose this over this.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, it's, it's, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's definitely up to the person because
it goes both ways.
[SPEAKER_10]: Opposite people say they love this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not your consumer, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: I like this too.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I, and I'm hoping the test results.
[SPEAKER_10]: Point to that one as the, as the positive,
like the most effective, the most concert,
[SPEAKER_10]: the most preserved.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm making an educated decision,
you know, from experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, experience decision, I guess not
educated, but experienced.
[SPEAKER_07]: This look, I know it was like,
okay, this was a little too hot and maybe
[SPEAKER_07]: like fresh.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like more fresh kind of, this one
looks more.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're both pressed same day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just that the hotter temp has melted
the acids.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what that lower temp preserves.
[SPEAKER_10]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a difference.
[SPEAKER_10]: In it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the, the, the taste and stuff,
they have a different effect.
[SPEAKER_10]: There could be a decarboxylation effect
that could increase the actual Delta nine
[SPEAKER_10]: in here.
[SPEAKER_10]: What I was learning from Frenchie,
he was saying that pre dark
[SPEAKER_10]: decarboxylating our products could
possibly give us an additional 30% uptake
[SPEAKER_10]: into our bloodstream compared to smoking
at over 340 degrees, which most of us are
[SPEAKER_10]: dabbing at 500 smoking at like 700.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, where that's where a joint doesn't get
you as high because we're actually
[SPEAKER_10]: converting these Delta nines into CB ends
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So he's saying, it might be interesting to
see this, uh, initial pre decarboxylation
[SPEAKER_10]: that might make the product stronger when
we smoke it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, when I told him I was going to
send these to the test, he was excited.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's like, cause that's really the only
way we're going to know how these things,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, it wasn't, it wasn't cheap
either, you know, to run these sneaking
[SPEAKER_10]: tests.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to do one, two, three, four,
five, six, eight tests.
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to do eight tests.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, cause I'm doing potency and then I'm
doing terpene.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but yeah, it adds up quick just for
research.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do R and D testing tests though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you doing the 800 pop tests?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's Andrew Bucks a test?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, I'm not doing, I'm doing R and D
testing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not doing the full state lab testing
because that's, that I would not,
[SPEAKER_10]: I would not want to spend that much on R
and D.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That would have cost me a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd have been like, yeah, if I would
have it that way.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, this was already a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was like under 800 bucks.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's just for R and D.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the answers it's going to give me,
it's going to make me more educated.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be, allow me to actually
speak and more educated about my product,
[SPEAKER_10]: not just in theory.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause right now it's all in theory.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm based on what I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most people is in theory and most people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: They believe in theory first.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's all you know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, you go by what you believe in,
what you think and what you've,
[SPEAKER_10]: what you've experienced.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So having a test to give you another
experience to, to, to make a judgment off
[SPEAKER_10]: of is a lot more solid than just,
I think an idea theory.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_14]: I got closer.
[SPEAKER_14]: What lab you're testing with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the lab that I took it to was,
it's right here.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what do you, what's your preference on
these two?
[SPEAKER_14]: California cannabis testing lab.
[SPEAKER_14]: What would you prefer?
[SPEAKER_08]: Me?
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, these guys make so much different
types of rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard for me to keep up, but I like
this one better.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to say, uh, but they're both,
you know, everyone wants the white color,
[SPEAKER_08]: but white doesn't mean anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Brown doesn't mean anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: If anything, the brown aged hash,
tastes better in the long run in French.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can only tell it to say that,
uh, there's different compounds that are
[SPEAKER_08]: formed.
[SPEAKER_10]: The hashing, the terpene, uh, a terpene
that has been given the name hashing is
[SPEAKER_10]: only created during the concentrated form
in the pressing and applying the heat to
[SPEAKER_10]: hashish, which like this particular hash,
that's the traditional hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not sure if that hashing would come
out in rosin.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, well, it's your traditional ice water
hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's your Moroccan style.
[SPEAKER_10]: Traditional hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the there.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's, uh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the Cali.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's from the Cali hash there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the type of hash that,
that they talk about.
[SPEAKER_10]: The, the new terpene is created during the
production of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it doesn't grow on the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just when the chemicals get
concentrated and washed and pressed and
[SPEAKER_10]: heat applied, there's a new terpene that's
created.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's only found in hash and they,
they named it hashing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is Mac.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's Mac.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's Mac.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then this is the Cushmint.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do so many different flavors.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what I sent off to the lab.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so much different hash in the
whole lab.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one's this?
[SPEAKER_08]: K.M.?
[SPEAKER_08]: K.M.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cushmints, yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the rabbit hippy cut.
[SPEAKER_08]: Joel, you're right.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Sunkist rosin smells better than the
flower too.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to run it again.
[SPEAKER_08]: That looks good.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've only ran it once.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I told you when Dan brought it,
that's what he said.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said it looks great, smells great.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said it made great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, he did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, cause he dropped the nugget.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good thing it's not that sticky.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can fan it out.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_10]: What else we got up in here?
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've got some new stuff that we
pressed.
[SPEAKER_10]: Twisted velvet rosé.
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn, I just dried it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You already have rosin of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just cured it.
[SPEAKER_10]: As soon as I got it, I ran and washed it
the same night.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I've new names is where it's at.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a new strain, new flavor on the
deck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just posted pictures of the dry flower
and now he has rosin in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't wait.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys have velvet rosé.
[SPEAKER_07]: Velvet cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a lot of different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the lower temp press.
[SPEAKER_10]: It actually has a stronger smell.
[SPEAKER_07]: What would you say?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the same thing, but it's lower temp
press.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see the consistency on the look.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome to try them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope someone brought a rig or something.
[SPEAKER_10]: They got some peaks over there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys want to bring a peak over here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Off camera boys.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of them works for a famous brand out
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't want to join us, mister?
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: This other guy has probably been growing
longer than all of us combined.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been growing for a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: He grew at Josh D for many years in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_08]: The valley, 818.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where we're all from.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all grew at OG for 15 plus years before
we started growing all these exiles.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys should see this guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got a beard down to here.
[SPEAKER_07]: These guys just started going to rock
wool.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're on the rock wool tip now.
[SPEAKER_08]: HGV as well, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's amazing is the turnaround.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's better or what's amazing about it?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's amazing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Easier.
[SPEAKER_13]: Less work, a lot less work.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we're not watering, just hand watering
anymore whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's all lime fed.
[SPEAKER_13]: It grows a lot faster, especially in veg.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good, thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a lot cleaner, most importantly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cocoa's dirty.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just by default.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cocoa clogs up the drains.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's dusty.
[SPEAKER_08]: It gets everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: Filters, de-hues.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nowhere it doesn't get.
[SPEAKER_08]: They still have cocoa in the facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're still transitioning all the way
through.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think on a big scale production,
I do believe that rock wool is probably
[SPEAKER_07]: the best to get it going.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have 500 lights.
[SPEAKER_08]: 500 lights there.
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy's at Cookies.
[SPEAKER_08]: He works at Cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep forgetting that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're building a facility with 400
lights right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be done in two months.
Where?
[SPEAKER_08]: In Sylmar.
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait, so were you there when Adu was
setting up the solventless lab at Cookies?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blue ice.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he was only there for a couple months.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was running their stuff, but it's hard
to run.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, a lot of their trains are going
to be on the gelato mixes, and gelato
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't wash well.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to disprove that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, didn't we hear that about the
Cushmints at one time?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you watch gelato yourself too.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've never grown real gelato.
[SPEAKER_08]: We always thought we had gelato.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I would love to see some good
gelato rising.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to see that.
You will.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have my friend here that's going to
disprove that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But he's got to grow it first.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if somebody else grows it,
it may not come out the same way.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've taken other people's product that
are in this industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: None of it has ever washed like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the way they handle it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dry material.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying that conversation with Adu
and myself, that's exactly what he said.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the only reason why he brought it
up.
[SPEAKER_08]: What?
[SPEAKER_15]: He said it doesn't wash well because
there's a bunch of gelato.
[SPEAKER_15]: Gelato doesn't wash well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we heard from Field Extracts told me
that Cushmints doesn't wash well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it washes dark.
[SPEAKER_08]: And let me tell you, check out our
Cushmints right here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And actually, when it's like this,
it looks a lot darker.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when it's just one gram, it looks a
lot lighter.
[SPEAKER_10]: Watch what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, here's just one gram right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a Cushmints.
[SPEAKER_08]: Watch how white it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: See the difference?
[SPEAKER_08]: Same.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's just a different temperature
pressing.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was pressed at 180.
[SPEAKER_10]: So do I.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's a lot of consumers that like
that wet look.
[SPEAKER_10]: But most of the time, it's hard to get
white.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do like that, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: But as far as I like, I could do a lot
with this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Your hands.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can touch it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were thinking it was strain-dependent.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what I'm saying is that the
Cushmints we were told presses.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there's a peak.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was in.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was in for a dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Presses dark.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it doesn't press dark.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It cures darker or what?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just saying that when they said
they ran it, it came out darker.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when we ran it in a different way,
different tech, it came out lighter.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of it's coming out lighter.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a combination of the growing
techniques and the washing techniques.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's our flour.
[SPEAKER_08]: So wherever they source their flour from,
it didn't turn out right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Strains get bad names.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to grow your own or know your
source.
[SPEAKER_10]: The practices that are taken during that
flour stage, the temperatures of the room,
[SPEAKER_10]: the temperatures of the entire grow,
how close the buds end up to the light,
[SPEAKER_10]: how bright the lights are, shining on
these buds, those all take a toll on those
[SPEAKER_10]: trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_10]: So just like the sunlight, midsummer,
it gets hot.
[SPEAKER_10]: So those things, you really got to pay
attention to.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I believe because LA Family Farms pays
attention to every detail from genetics,
[SPEAKER_10]: from choosing a seed pack even.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll sit around table and we'll all talk
about them just looking at packs and then
[SPEAKER_10]: try to figure out and this guy's got
thousands of packs.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's not an easy task.
[SPEAKER_10]: And obviously, you want to go with what's
out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got to cut your ears to the industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're trying to see what they like,
what their flavor is at, what's their
[SPEAKER_08]: palate.
[SPEAKER_08]: We follow the hype.
[SPEAKER_08]: We follow a lot of hype.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cushmints, Mac, animal mints, a lot of
what Cookies is now breeding with,
[SPEAKER_08]: like the Cushmints, that's the hype.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're creating a lot of crosses with
that, like the Gelati and KM.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the Georgia pie?
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say Georgia pie.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be cut next.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we were just talking to this on
the way here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So KM 11 and Gelati is Georgia pie.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's like there's a lot of crosses.
[SPEAKER_08]: That are being used now to form other
lines, which is great because we follow
[SPEAKER_08]: the hype.
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be nice to find packs and go
through seeds and then hunt and find the
[SPEAKER_08]: really the big winners and just create
that hype.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to say who created it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's like Capulet created the hype
with the Mac.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Mac now everyone's producing all kinds
of raws and crosses.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually seen a lot of shitty Mac,
but I saw recently Caps Mac.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Caps Mac is, that's how Mac should be
grown.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Caps cut, which is one we have,
which ours is tissue culture too.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it does grow a little bit more
vigorous, we're told through tissue
[SPEAKER_08]: culture, but it still grows fucking slow
as fuck.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's not something Joel,
you wouldn't, I offered you the cut to
[SPEAKER_08]: grow at your place.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'd only want to grow it.
[SPEAKER_07]: How about GMO?
[SPEAKER_07]: That had a little hype to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: GMO goes long.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can go 70, 80 days in the commercial
spot and the rec market.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't really want to go 80 days.
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes too long.
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes too long.
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially what you're going to be charged
by landlords as far as prices per square
[SPEAKER_08]: foot.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it adds up.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you want to utilize your space as best
as possible.
[SPEAKER_08]: And having GMO go 80 days isn't something
you want.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most strains, what do you guys pull?
[SPEAKER_08]: 63, 65 days on your strains?
[SPEAKER_13]: About three, three months?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you pull about 65 days.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think your brother said you pull about
65 days.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most places don't finish full term.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were talking about this before you guys
came about pulling early or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have to keep in mind that this
is for the legal market.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so time matters.
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone at home may have time to do
something 80 days.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been times when they've run them.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have run just to see.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've gone 80 days.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to see what are you missing out on?
[SPEAKER_08]: I've gone 81 days.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I did that on triangle mints.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we hit 4.3 alike.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's kind of worth it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's kind of worth it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you get a lot of yield per square
foot.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great if it's all buds that are like
this and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if it's buds that are like this and
you're having to labor intensive,
[SPEAKER_08]: having people trim it, it's not cost
effective.
[SPEAKER_08]: Less plants, and this is what we're going
to do in the next spot, less plants per
[SPEAKER_08]: square foot.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's always growing nine plants always.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he can get the same yield we do with
nine plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because you're using the whole 25
square feet and you're just letting the
[SPEAKER_08]: plants grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: About 60 inches, which is four and a half
to five feet max.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have A to B buds rather than A,
B, and C buds.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it makes it to where you can actually
trim.
[SPEAKER_08]: It streamlines everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's less labor to fucking de-leaf.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's all kinds of benefits.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're talking less plant count than
larger plants, giving them more room.
[SPEAKER_07]: More air flow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Better yield and better quality structure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Better bud all the way through.
[SPEAKER_08]: Light penetration.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can literally, we don't strip our
plants two feet up like most people do and
[SPEAKER_08]: strip it because all that you can produce
buds through there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the reason you can't is because you've
made the top canopy so cluttered and not
[SPEAKER_08]: allowing any light to come through with
too many plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: People think too many plants are going to
equal more money, more pounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've proven through with three rows or
nine plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: In a 25, you can produce the same yield
and the better quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: And less labor.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can be.
[SPEAKER_10]: It can be if you take care of them,
give them the individual attention.
[SPEAKER_08]: But certain strains is that strain
dependent like the Mac.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could put 12 plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: 12 plants, they're shorties.
[SPEAKER_08]: You really have to run the numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do a table or two.
[SPEAKER_08]: And see where you yield at and then do it
three rows or nine plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or and then do the 12 plants and run the
numbers and see where your yield is.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll probably get more from the 12.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cush mints grows kind of like really
narrow and short.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, at least the ones we have.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know, it's just a strain dependent
really.
[SPEAKER_07]: Knowing the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Knowing, yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we grew OG for so long.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like we knew that plant well.
[SPEAKER_08]: We grew triangle mints for a year.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it starts the hunt.
[SPEAKER_08]: I told you the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are so detailed down from the
very beginning.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's tough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Feno hunting sucks.
[SPEAKER_09]: A little shotgun.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can.
[SPEAKER_09]: What does that owe?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's my little personal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where's your guy?
[SPEAKER_10]: I made a little half stubby, a mini joint
for myself.
That's right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what else?
[SPEAKER_10]: What else are we talking about?
[SPEAKER_10]: What else are we talking?
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys want to talk about medium,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing rock wall.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you guys know anybody doing like living
soil the same kind of scale as you guys?
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy does.
[SPEAKER_08]: He won't come on camera because he's
fucking shy.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, he knows a dispensary that will
only buy living soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do living soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: They grow living soil in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Sarah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just open up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Sarah in Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go buy some Wonderbret from over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at you pumping Wonderbret.
[SPEAKER_08]: But he won't come on camera.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're wearing all Wonderbret gear,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you wearing Wonderbret underwear?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's working.
[SPEAKER_07]: He can't smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy's going to help us sell all kinds
of stuff in the rec market.
[SPEAKER_14]: And how is the rec market?
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear no one's making money right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear no one's making money because
there's so many illegal shops open,
[SPEAKER_08]: so many illegal grows for the black
market.
[SPEAKER_08]: People are probably taking rec market weed
and selling it in the black market.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wouldn't be surprised.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you see it all the time.
[SPEAKER_10]: It can happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen it in other states.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never seen it local.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people don't believe in quality or
quantity.
[SPEAKER_07]: They want quantity.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: But people don't pay you what your weed is
worth a lot of the times.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they want to resell it so they can
make the profit.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people come here from all over
the country.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wanting to buy all the Cali weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because on the East Coast, it's all worth
more.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all worth more.
[SPEAKER_08]: And California has the best weed in the
nation, if not the planet.
[SPEAKER_08]: It used to be Europe, Amsterdam,
Canada.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think it's California now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And OG has really spawned this whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Western Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: OG created all this.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then cookies came along.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that would happen with cookies.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now there's the next generation of who
knows what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jungle Boys helped push the whole brand of
wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Spawn helped seed junkies.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's become a whole crazy industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just the beginning.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really history, if you think about
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis in the United States and
California.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're at the right place at the right
time, all of us.
[SPEAKER_08]: We should appreciate it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we're crossing over that line that
so many people have been in trouble.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think all the alcohol companies'
prohibition would happen then.
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as all the companies that wanted to
stay in business that couldn't because the
[SPEAKER_08]: bigger companies actually bought them out
or pushed them out.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to happen in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we can all be self-funded and ride
it out as much as you can and do it for
[SPEAKER_08]: the love of the plant and bring good
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because a lot of us grew up on the valley.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people did PGRs, phospholode,
to increase yield and sprayed with
[SPEAKER_08]: microbutanol.
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't know any better at the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And no one knew.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're that generation that has been
smoking that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to all suffer from it.
[SPEAKER_08]: This next generation of kids, they're
going to be smoking recreational weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not going to do that shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not going to be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it sucks that we had to be a part of
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's somehow benefiting the next
generation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now as I have coffee.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is all clean weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would offer this to my niece if she
smoked.
[SPEAKER_08]: If she wanted to.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: We use salts and we use a very simple way
of growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it works for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really experience that allows you to
grow like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Truly.
[SPEAKER_08]: The more you grow, the more you understand
the strain, the better it can turn out.
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you making your own nutrient mixes?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we're buying HGV.
[SPEAKER_07]: You said a lot of good things right there.
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys use anything else besides HGV?
[SPEAKER_13]: HGV.
[SPEAKER_13]: I actually didn't mean to wear the shirt
that I had on.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a nutrient line?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a lot of people are using it.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people are using it.
[SPEAKER_08]: These guys just started using it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are they out of?
[SPEAKER_08]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy named Ron Goldman owns the
company.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's there to help you.
[SPEAKER_08]: He wants to see you succeed.
[SPEAKER_08]: He knows how to grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's not just like a guy that created
nutrients just to make money.
[SPEAKER_08]: But he actually helps you.
[SPEAKER_08]: He believes if you succeed, he will too.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's helped a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they don't sell to everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's only one shop that I know in
Southern California that actually sells
[SPEAKER_08]: HGV.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they want it that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: They want it limited.
[SPEAKER_08]: But all the big growers are starting to
use it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cookies, Tradecraft Farms.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's catching on.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of people, other names I
don't want to mention.
[SPEAKER_08]: JBZ.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all using it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Green Thumbs.
[SPEAKER_08]: They all use it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's a good nutrient.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a high quality, chelated,
clean nutrient.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's basically what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's one of the cleanest nutrient lines.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it for rockwool a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: You see the way the plants grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't see any deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty stable.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically a tomato formula,
he told me.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just tweaked tomato formula.
[SPEAKER_08]: He says those plants grow really very
similar.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you tell that to me, Joel,
one time?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You did.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why we used to always say we're
growing tomatoes at the hydro store.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is pretty much the same food.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the hydro store would have tomatoes
growing in there as an example.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate it going to hydro stores.
[SPEAKER_08]: I still do.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're about being followed all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about Dr. Pepper?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Recently, people used to use Dr. Pepper in
the formula.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you ever hear that, Joel?
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: He told me about that recently.
[SPEAKER_08]: Guys were using Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was an old OG recipe that was going
around that Joel has been using for 20
[SPEAKER_08]: plus years.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've grown OG with HGV, and it's just not
the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: Something about that formula, when you
have real OG from this valley,
[SPEAKER_08]: where you walk into a room, and the whole
room smells it with an eighth in your
[SPEAKER_08]: pocket.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have weed like that anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think those formulas really were keyed
in to those specific strains, because OG
[SPEAKER_08]: was growing for so long in this valley.
[SPEAKER_08]: How many years?
[SPEAKER_08]: 25 years now?
[SPEAKER_08]: 96.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before that, they supposedly claimed that
they were growing something very similar
[SPEAKER_04]: in the chemo type.
[SPEAKER_04]: In other places.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard that recently, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: In bunkers underground.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because it has Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_08]: Real OG is Hindu Kush and emerald
triangle.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's OG.
[SPEAKER_08]: The bag seed from that was found by people
that Origins TK Marty knows.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how the original OG was found,
through bag seed.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's where the TK was found,
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Triangle Kush.
[SPEAKER_08]: He came to my farm and actually told the
story to all our trimmers.
[SPEAKER_08]: He told the whole OG story.
[SPEAKER_08]: He told it to everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of cool to have a guy that was
a part of that history.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a High Hopes Summit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys saw it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Origins of Kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was in Josh D.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we were all at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, High Hopes.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where they all go on stage with Marty,
D-Real, Kenji, Wonder Brett, Josh D.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bubba wasn't there, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bubba supposedly was the one that put the
cut in his pocket and brought it over on
[SPEAKER_08]: the airplane.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was in LA.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's the one going to jail at the Biltmore
in downtown LA.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the same day as the job fair,
correct?
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the second day after the job fair.
[SPEAKER_10]: First they did a job fair and then they
did the whole award ceremony.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we went to was the award
ceremony.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was actually there for the job fair.
[SPEAKER_10]: You were there with the homies just to
support him because we knew that they were
[SPEAKER_10]: going to be talking about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I met someone from Wonder Brett.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to roll one of these?
[SPEAKER_07]: He was at the job fair.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot his name, though.
[SPEAKER_07]: From somewhere off camera.
[SPEAKER_14]: If anyone's listening to me, I say yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's roll that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Grind it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Smell it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has this unique smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cakey gelato.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you approve of my ice cream cake number
one?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you're so critical.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see the other ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: You said what, number three?
[SPEAKER_08]: I only brought this because I have so
much.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have so many.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I brought all of it, it's too many.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a Twisted Velvet Rosé cross,
which is purple like no other.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like black almost.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you put them next to this,
you're like, whoa, that's dark.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then I have mint julep.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the rosin.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the rosin.
[SPEAKER_10]: Believe it or not, it doesn't come out
dark.
[SPEAKER_08]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have mint julep, which is mint chocolate
chip and kosher kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mint chocolate chip.
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe it has a lot to do with the
growing conditions and how the farmer
[SPEAKER_10]: treated it during the time it was grown.
[SPEAKER_10]: The spraying of stuff completely has a big
effect.
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't spray.
[SPEAKER_10]: That helps preserve the turps and the
heads.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not getting melted with any oils
or alcohol or any kind of H2O2,
[SPEAKER_10]: which can change those things.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of these natural oils, neem oil,
citronella, all these extra plant extract
[SPEAKER_10]: oils that are organic and they're good for
pests because they're organic.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're real organic.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're made from plants and trees,
but these plants have natural turps that
[SPEAKER_10]: they're using and they're spraying them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then it changes the profile.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then when you actually extract it with ice
water and hash and you do that,
[SPEAKER_10]: you start smelling those other smells come
through.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those things change the color.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of times where after you've
done the work, you get it to the press.
[SPEAKER_10]: It cures the next day.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you're just like, I smell this
ingredient.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a palette.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something that you have to acquire
because there's a lot of times where I
[SPEAKER_10]: would blame myself thinking that I did a
bad job on the wash.
[SPEAKER_10]: I beat it up too much.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I did something wrong.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then we started, whenever I would notice
that, we started not washing the full
[SPEAKER_10]: batches.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do a small test batch.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dry it, press it, see what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_10]: If we didn't like what it looked like,
then we would send it off to a BHO
[SPEAKER_10]: processing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then sometimes the product would come out
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then there's other times where they would
send it back and they say there's nothing
[SPEAKER_10]: we can do with it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's when I'm like, okay, it wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was the material.
[SPEAKER_10]: Growing conditions, how you stored it,
what you sprayed on it, all of those
[SPEAKER_10]: things.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were talking about consistency of
sourcing and how important that was.
[SPEAKER_12]: It saves you time and money.
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially if someone wants to try to do
this.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been a lot of material that we've
processed that we can't sell.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just part of the risk factor that you
take.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an education.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's an education, for one.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the biggest benefit that we can put
on it versus saying it's a total loss.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the experience that we acquired
that's now in our head forever.
[SPEAKER_10]: I enjoy that process.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't enjoy taking the loss,
but you have to acquire that knowledge.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you were able to go to the facility
they're processing at and still show them
[SPEAKER_08]: exactly how you process it to not beat it
up and handle it with care, whatever they
[SPEAKER_08]: did before that would have an effect on
the hash in the long run.
[SPEAKER_12]: What was your thing?
[SPEAKER_12]: Grow it or know it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Know your grower or grow your own,
basically.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you got a close relationship with the
farmer, I'm able to show him what's
[SPEAKER_10]: happening at the end.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then he's able to go and make changes.
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't do this the first day.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been making rosin together for a
couple of years now, hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't produce stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: We used to spray organics up until a
certain week.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the things that we learned.
[SPEAKER_08]: You learn through that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an evolving process.
[SPEAKER_08]: Someone was using plant therapy.
[SPEAKER_08]: We found out they were using plant
therapy, which is totally fine to use.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just that that has an effect on how
the outcome of the rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we pinpointed it to when it
was turning out like... You had mentioned
[SPEAKER_14]: that before, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark rosin isn't necessarily bad rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just that the consumer wants white,
pretty rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: To tell you the truth, I like the color
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nicer, but hash is hash.
[SPEAKER_08]: Taste is where it's at.
[SPEAKER_10]: The darker sign is just due to light and
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Simple, basic, natural things.
[SPEAKER_10]: These flowers are naturally going to
oxidize, get yellow, brown, just because
[SPEAKER_10]: light and heat.
[SPEAKER_10]: Room temperature is heat.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything over, say, 40 degrees is fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's warm.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I humidify where I store all my
weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I humidify the room.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have been as of recently.
[SPEAKER_08]: To what humidity?
[SPEAKER_08]: Anywhere from 50 to 60.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want it a little more humid because the
valley is dry this time of year because
[SPEAKER_08]: it's really windy.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys don't really know, but every day
I walk into a grow room.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in our 30s right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I keep all my genetics at my house.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm around at 24-7.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't escape it.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing like living with it and
growing there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the worst.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can be.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can be nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can never get away from it.
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy does.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of these guys do, or two of them,
have many, many times.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all started indoors in homes,
all of us, from a one lighter to now a 400
[SPEAKER_08]: lighter.
[SPEAKER_10]: My first grow was in a PC grow box.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember he had a dispenser in this
valley.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was back in those seven years.
[SPEAKER_12]: We were just at this event down in San
Diego.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was all about indoor energy saving.
[SPEAKER_12]: Total focus on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: Vertical grow rooms from back east cost a
lot.
[SPEAKER_14]: HVAC experts were there, lighting experts.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's from Fluence and BIOS and the
other lighting companies were there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Water experts.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was really fun and interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going LED in our veg room.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a double stacked LED room with 160
to 200 lights in there, roughly.
[SPEAKER_08]: What kind of lights?
[SPEAKER_08]: We're actually going with a company you've
probably never heard of.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Signify.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're the ones, if you remember
Phillips.
[SPEAKER_14]: They were at the conference.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_14]: Down in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_08]: Signify is a Phillips company.
[SPEAKER_08]: Phillips has been making components for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: I met one of their lighting scientists at
the conference.
[SPEAKER_08]: PL Lighting and other companies that
they've been making components for.
[SPEAKER_08]: They waited until all these lights came
out.
[SPEAKER_08]: They took all the lights.
[SPEAKER_08]: They R&D'd them with a specialist from
Holland.
[SPEAKER_08]: They put together, they believe,
a better light.
[SPEAKER_08]: What I like about this company is that it
comes with a specialist.
[SPEAKER_08]: For 30 days, he teaches us how to grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: No lighting company that ever gives you a
light says, here, I'm going to sell you a
[SPEAKER_08]: light.
[SPEAKER_08]: Buy.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all they do.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all they do.
[SPEAKER_12]: They do.
[SPEAKER_08]: They did that for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: We wanted to go ... You give them the
square feet of the room and the plan of
[SPEAKER_08]: your facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: They map it out per square foot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kavita was 108 lights for a room that we
had.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lux was 81, so we went with 81 lights per
room.
[SPEAKER_08]: We wanted to go with Signify just because
it came with someone.
[SPEAKER_12]: Is the energy a factor?
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: Power.
[SPEAKER_08]: Power, of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what power costs in LA County?
[SPEAKER_08]: Astronomical.
[SPEAKER_08]: 100 lighters is $12,000, $13,000,
$14,000 a month.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you imagine when it costs for hundreds
and hundreds of lights?
[SPEAKER_08]: These guys have 550 lights.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a flower.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not even talking about veg.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to have a total of 800 lights.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a lot of power, 3,000 amps.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a pole dropped out front,
so it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a big risk at a time when no one is
actually doing well, so I'm taking a big
[SPEAKER_08]: risk here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all self-funded, so it's my brother,
my sister, I, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_12]: There was this one company there that
sells a lighting system that's like
[SPEAKER_12]: mirrors.
[SPEAKER_12]: Solatube.
[SPEAKER_12]: Solatube.
[SPEAKER_12]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_12]: They do it with actual sunlight.
[SPEAKER_14]: You basically punch a hole in your roof
and you bring ...
I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what they are.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a construction company that's
basically punch a hole in the ceiling up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's say you have a drop ceiling right
here and up is inclined.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could put a hole in it and run a tube,
like just a duct.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a mirror.
[SPEAKER_08]: A duct.
[SPEAKER_10]: A periscope.
[SPEAKER_08]: A duct with reflective material like Mylar
inside.
[SPEAKER_08]: They run it down and you can actually get
sunlight that way.
It's a periscope.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dope, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've actually put one in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were talking about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been in so many acts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about mixed lighting.
[SPEAKER_12]: They have a school room.
[SPEAKER_14]: They use them for ... This guy,
Jonathan Cache, he did a proof of concept
[SPEAKER_14]: where he, in Sonoma, he had an indoor grow
entirely with those lights.
[SPEAKER_08]: Solar tubes?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just sun?
[SPEAKER_10]: Just sun.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if he had enough hours to keep it
through four hours.
[SPEAKER_10]: Had to have at least ... Why don't you
just do a whole ... I think they did have
[SPEAKER_10]: some supplemental lighting.
[SPEAKER_10]: To keep the lights on a cycle.
[SPEAKER_14]: But in conjunction with the solar tubes,
they ... Why don't you just do a glass
[SPEAKER_08]: roof?
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't there a glass roof spot somewhere
down near Palomar, like the mountain
[SPEAKER_07]: somewhere?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a hundred ... There's a lot of
places.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's thousands and thousands of lights
going up right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know someone that just finished 2,000
lights and they're doing another 2,000 in
[SPEAKER_08]: Atalanto.
[SPEAKER_08]: These guys just got a 48,000 square foot
place in Atalanto.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be 700, 800 lights.
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Cookies.
[SPEAKER_08]: His brother, Mike, is partners with Surge
in the Maywood Cookies.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all good friends.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's good to be in a group of people that
have the same drive and passion as your
[SPEAKER_10]: own.
[SPEAKER_10]: To bounce ideas off.
[SPEAKER_10]: To go and ask them what they think.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_10]: The pilots that these guys have is ...
Would you throw us in a room together?
[SPEAKER_10]: The amount of weed that we have consumed
is uncountable.
[SPEAKER_10]: That knowledge is what the corporate
cannabis doesn't have when they come from
[SPEAKER_10]: a different business background.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's something that we try to cherish
and keep each other and help each other.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not in it to beat each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you redefine corporate weed?
[SPEAKER_12]: When you're scaling up, at what point does
craft weed scale up to something else?
[SPEAKER_12]: Or can you maintain your quality at scale?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we're going to find out.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's only one way to find out.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you look at Samuel Adams, they're still
in business.
[SPEAKER_08]: Firestone, they're a family company still.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hog and Dogs, Ben and Jerry's.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are companies that still been
around.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not going to say we're going to be
anywhere near those companies,
[SPEAKER_08]: but we just want to produce craft cannabis
and just have a 27,000-quart facility in
[SPEAKER_08]: the grand scope of what growing has
become.
It's small.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's tiny.
[SPEAKER_08]: Compared to the big world.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where is the facility?
[SPEAKER_14]: What town?
[SPEAKER_14]: Syilmore.
[SPEAKER_08]: Syilmore, California.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have licensing up there.
[SPEAKER_08]: These guys have licensing in Maywood,
and they'll have licensing in Alonzo
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's small compared to these big,
huge facilities.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're talking 2,000 lights.
[SPEAKER_10]: The fact that these guys have been growing
for so long from a little tiny room to
[SPEAKER_10]: more rooms to a nice, decent-sized
facility, but the same concepts are being
[SPEAKER_10]: applied, the same knowledge that you've
acquired is being transitioned.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like, let's just grow some weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the challenge that a lot of the
corporate business are going to have.
[SPEAKER_10]: They haven't had the failures or the
losses that we have taken.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're a strong crew of people that we
don't take losses lightly.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've all lost big, big ways, and we've
picked ourselves up.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've picked ourselves up and rebuilt
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only way, my dad used to say,
the only way to learn how to make money is
[SPEAKER_08]: to lose money.
[SPEAKER_08]: Scared money don't make money.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of true.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of us have been robbed.
[SPEAKER_08]: These guys, he had a facility where,
first harvest, they stole everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very first.
[SPEAKER_08]: He never even got a run out of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Starting strong.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they fucked him up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was so pissed.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was hoping so well for him.
[SPEAKER_08]: He worked at a famous farm.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not going to say the name right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: He turned around their whole company in
propagation and clones, because really,
[SPEAKER_08]: to produce craft cannabis, I'm going to
tell you this right now, mom stock and veg
[SPEAKER_08]: is by far the most important, which is
always undersized in most facilities.
[SPEAKER_08]: We, fortunately, oversized it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We went less on the flower rooms,
but more on mom space and veg space,
[SPEAKER_08]: so we could produce.
[SPEAKER_08]: Think about if you took way more clones
than you needed and way more veg plants
[SPEAKER_08]: than you needed, and you could put the
best of the best, the most elite plants in
[SPEAKER_08]: there, you'd crush.
[SPEAKER_08]: There'd be no reason why you wouldn't
ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Precision watering, the way we water now
these days is the way athletes eat.
[SPEAKER_08]: They eat 10 times a day, five times a day,
small meals.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look how they look.
[SPEAKER_08]: Their metabolism is high, and we can feed
plants and ride EC.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just heard today, my buddy Ramsey says
he goes in his medium up to 12 EC.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you know what that is,
12 EC.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 12 times 500.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do the math.
[SPEAKER_08]: 12 times 700.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or 700.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's times 700, so that's how much PPMs it
would be.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there parts of a million inside of it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Riding the medium.
[SPEAKER_08]: HGV.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's going on back there?
[SPEAKER_07]: They're playing this peak and tickle.
[SPEAKER_07]: The puff goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you were talking about athletes.
Huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: When you were talking about athletes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hashleats.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hashleats?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what we're growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're growing hashleats.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we were to say that we're hash guys,
these guys are definitely sauce guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those guys are not there.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're on the opposite spectrum.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably why they're back there and
not on camera, because they're sauce guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sauce guys want to just dab.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, they haven't stopped dabbing since
we've been here.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only reason they stopped is because
when we first came in, they didn't have a
[SPEAKER_08]: rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're dabbing in Glu River.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're dabbing in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We smoke everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't dab LA Family Farms?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the preference, though?
[SPEAKER_03]: We dab everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: LA Family Farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: We dab everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't need some of this?
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing is that we dab more and smoke
more than 97%, 8% of the population.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, these guys are the guys I come to to
really run flavors through.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I could find a way to put Joel into a
company that just- I don't know if you
[SPEAKER_03]: guys know my profession is research and
development.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am very gifted.
[SPEAKER_08]: He could really test for people.
[SPEAKER_08]: He has the best palate I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_08]: He can spot things.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will second.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've learned from him how to grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's my mentor.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've all come so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm second in line.
[SPEAKER_05]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm second in line.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're having the best palate.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not even old enough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not even old enough.
[SPEAKER_10]: I do got to give it to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got the visual perspective that we
don't have.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, we have it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't say that.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's in shops more than- He's seen more
shops than I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're talking to a guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen his weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: He grows.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not talking about the way he grows.
[SPEAKER_08]: He doesn't know what good weed looks like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't listen to him, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't grow weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: Only when he comes to my house.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, at least he's seen a lot of stuff in
the stores because he's definitely been to
[SPEAKER_10]: a lot more retail outlets.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's seen more brands.
[SPEAKER_10]: Probably smelled and smoked more brands
than I have.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got to give him that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's not good because most of the
brands out there don't produce good
[SPEAKER_08]: quality.
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't say it wasn't good.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what the hardest thing in the rec
market is?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is consistency.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like you want someone to open up-
I'll just use Gary Payton as an example.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I've seen some really good Gary
Payton.
[SPEAKER_08]: Snowmen in the Y.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the cross.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want someone to basically open up the
Gary Payton and go, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: This is dank.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then six months, a year later,
if they're still growing it, open it again
[SPEAKER_08]: and go, you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: This is just as good or better.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what you want.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how you get people to go,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: I have respect for that brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still good.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how you get a customer like-
Because we're all consumers.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've all bought weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the hardest part of growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's key.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people think you guys have an SOP and
it'd be done.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have an SOP, but it doesn't translate
to everybody's grow just because of the
[SPEAKER_10]: SOP that they're using.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, yeah, we have an SOP,
but there's so many details that go into
[SPEAKER_10]: this one.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't fully transfer it over unless
you built an exact duplicate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of important things like plant
health is one of the most important things
[SPEAKER_08]: in a grow, if not the most important.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I said, moms and veg, without that,
your facility for flowering is not gonna
[SPEAKER_08]: come out with flour like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We turn over moms every, we take cuttings
three times and the moms go away.
[SPEAKER_08]: The most we keep a mom is like three
months.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The healthier the mom, the more you
replenish them and then we call it every
[SPEAKER_08]: stage, which means when we take cuts for
300 plants, we take 500 cuts.
[SPEAKER_08]: We take way more and the ones that usually
root first we separate because those for
[SPEAKER_08]: sure most likely are gonna end up in the
flower room.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most nine times out of ten, unless you
fuck up, that's just gonna end up in the
[SPEAKER_08]: flower room and you're gonna kill it with
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we separate the ones that root first.
[SPEAKER_07]: Front runners.
[SPEAKER_08]: Front runners, basically.
[SPEAKER_08]: Separate those and that's the key to
success.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most likely, if you're calling for moms,
if you're calling for moms, you're taking
[SPEAKER_08]: from the healthiest mom in that mom room,
the best one.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're taking only cuts from that one and
then the cuts that come off of that,
[SPEAKER_08]: that root first, are the best cuts that go
on to be moms.
[SPEAKER_08]: Only the best of the best that go on.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not gonna take an unhealthy mom and
take cuts from a whole room.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you're gonna take from the healthiest
mom.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the way we do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly, that's the way I do it at my
house.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the way my sister Jackie does it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've taught her.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like that's- And again, that took how
many years you guys have been doing this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Over 20 years?
[SPEAKER_08]: I gave you our secret, one of our secrets,
but I can write down exactly what to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a chef can give you a recipe and go,
here you go, but it will not translate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, Joel?
[SPEAKER_08]: The magic's in the head.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's trial and error.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like you have to have that experience
to be able to understand it, like what the
[SPEAKER_08]: room may need.
[SPEAKER_08]: But once you figure out a strain,
you can dial things in and kind of almost
[SPEAKER_08]: walk away because it's just like
clockwork.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, bam, I got it figured out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got her figured out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, once you ran it two or three times.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm talking 10 years, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Try keeping a cut alive since 2002,
2001.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had the OG cut since then and we've
kept it alive.
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't been growing the whole time,
so think about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even when we weren't growing, guess what?
[SPEAKER_08]: We still kept that bitch alive.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was the mama.
[SPEAKER_08]: We always had moms of it, so we've always
kept it alive.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've actually recently tissue cultured
her and gave her to Josh D Farms to
[SPEAKER_08]: actually run in a greenhouse and see how
they run.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's dedication and passion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Try keeping a house plant alive for a
year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Try keeping a house plant alive for a year
and then come to me.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to be a grower?
[SPEAKER_08]: Grow a house plant for a year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Grow it, be successful, and then come back
and we'll talk about growing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's supposed to be an annual.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's supposed to be an annual.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's supposed to live one year.
[SPEAKER_08]: My brother says that to people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm keeping my soil alive for three years
and that's an accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not keeping a plant alive for three
years.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got two jobs now.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're feeding your soil and your plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Two jobs, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone asked what breeders you respect.
[SPEAKER_08]: I respect all of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I respect all of them.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every single one.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of them might be known as pollen
chuckers that just take a male.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just chuck it on a female and find seeds
and sell them and not even test them.
[SPEAKER_08]: There could be hermies.
[SPEAKER_08]: There could be all kinds of problems.
Mutants.
[SPEAKER_08]: There could be all kinds of issues.
[SPEAKER_08]: They might not germinate.
[SPEAKER_08]: You might pick a male that you pollinate
with a female and it might produce 40%
[SPEAKER_08]: females.
[SPEAKER_08]: You might get a high male to female.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of thought.
[SPEAKER_08]: Breeding in the life of breeding cannabis
is very short.
[SPEAKER_08]: People haven't been breeding cannabis for
50, 70 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_08]: How many people?
[SPEAKER_08]: Mostly started in the late 80s.
[SPEAKER_08]: In Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_08]: Joe, where did it start?
[SPEAKER_08]: Breeding up north, probably northern.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_08]: People breeding there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That happened naturally.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a natural breeding.
[SPEAKER_08]: You breed with land race too.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything that's bred with the MAC,
which has land race in it, turns out that
[SPEAKER_08]: train wreck kind of hazy kind of smell.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are strains that survived the
environments in real life and actually
[SPEAKER_10]: traveled in the wind and made their
crossbreedings.
[SPEAKER_10]: They owned that land.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why they call them the land races.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are the ones that came from those
regions.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're strong.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're strong genetics.
[SPEAKER_10]: When you get those crossed in,
they stand out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the genetics breeders.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like seed junkies.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really have a favorite,
but I've popped seed junkies, symbiotic
[SPEAKER_08]: genetics, which has done the purple punch.
[SPEAKER_10]: You did relentless recently.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oni seeds?
You did.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, symbiotic actually took someone
else's cut of purple punch and brought it
[SPEAKER_08]: to breed with.
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't actually create it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Garlic juice.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've done oni seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now I'm hunting some oni seeds,
which is... Papaya.
[SPEAKER_08]: Garlic juice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you tell them what it is?
[SPEAKER_05]: Papaya GMO.
[SPEAKER_08]: Papaya GMO.
[SPEAKER_08]: This nameless guy back there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to nameless genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's our genetic library over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: He convinced me to pop those seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: They also call me Terps if you guys don't
know.
[SPEAKER_05]: They call you Terpless.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because the way I smoke,
shit, it's going to be gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Matter of fact, I'm about to take another
dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to my peoples.
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Dab it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do you have a mic and you're not on
camera?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because he drops the mic like a vandal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you're reading comments there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're straight trapping on the comments,
bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are my peoples.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: How exotic genetics is a terrible seed
company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to grease monkey.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen a lot of people pressing grease
monkey in the hash world.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_05]: My boys from Vietnam, the wafer shout out
to
[SPEAKER_10]: Fah.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's world renowned.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's all over.
[SPEAKER_05]: The train wrecks parents came from
Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God, please take it back.
[SPEAKER_10]: That was pressed at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wafer says he needs rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: So do we all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody needs rosin, sir.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the lower temp.
[SPEAKER_10]: This one actually has a little.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can smoke some of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to need a peek?
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's make one more joint.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want me to roll you one?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you want to use some ICC?
[SPEAKER_10]: Ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just using the acronyms because
they're too damn long.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm used to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything is all codes.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're like, what the hell is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to JBZ.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just realized that tray is glowing.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a dope tray.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a dope, dope tray.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the vibes, you got the vibes,
you know, the vibes with that funky field
[SPEAKER_05]: tip.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we're going to put some twisted
velvet rose up in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not a fan of that one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you tried it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you?
[SPEAKER_05]: No comment.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, did you try this, though?
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that beef jerky?
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Old Trapper.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Trapper.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hot and spicy.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is more of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_10]: The sun kiss.
[SPEAKER_10]: This one right here.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Trapper.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: How'd you saw?
[SPEAKER_10]: You knew it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Pull some of that out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: For you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't answer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not getting paid here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a question for you, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which by papers do you prefer,
the Ultra Thin or the Rice?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say Ultra Thin.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ultra Thin, definitely.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the Rice.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're both pretty thin, super smooth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you have to pick one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Ultra Thin.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: I see.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cubano's I got to try.
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't tried them yet.
[SPEAKER_13]: Have you seen them?
[SPEAKER_05]: The Cubano's, the Frato Leafs?
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'll show you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, like the big jumbo ones.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.
[SPEAKER_13]: 8.3 grams.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: There he is, my boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said I can't ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have one question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was going to ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why my nickname for you is Blondie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask you a question,
but you turned me down.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said not to ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to hear the question.
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't want me to ask him a question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on, Brett.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Wonder Brett.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get at that pineapple OG at your nearest
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got that OZK, bruv.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't know, it's popping in London.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is the pink Picasso, along with that
black Orchid Gelato 33 and OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to the Biscay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Biscotti boys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god, you had to throw the Biscotti
boys in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Biscotti boys.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I say your name on camera?
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I allowed to?
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Terps.
[SPEAKER_08]: What?
[SPEAKER_05]: A.K.A.
[SPEAKER_05]: Terps?
[SPEAKER_05]: R&D development specialist, vice
president, because he is the president
[SPEAKER_05]: right here next door to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: The president.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just a vice president.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just protege.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys do know Terps.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I brought you.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are sitting back there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Antisocial.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: In fairness to both of us, we didn't know
that we were going to come.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need signed contracts.
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't know we were going to come into
a recording studio.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need signed contracts.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fairness to us, we were told that we
were going to come and hang out and have a
[SPEAKER_05]: massage.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had no idea we were going to come into
a universal studio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we had to lie to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't have came here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, Whoa, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you think did you think we were just
going to tie you up?
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought we were just going to come and
hang out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we are.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm scared, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm camera shy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're camera shy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not shy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you brought cameras?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're not here.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every reality show has to show someone
changing on camera these days.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Marmalade extracts.
[SPEAKER_08]: Marmalade extracts, that is.
That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he was the one who found that.
[SPEAKER_10]: He don't cut there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop while you're ahead.
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone said, tell them to get on camera.
[SPEAKER_14]: I had some orange dynamite stick extracted
by Wonder Brett.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that orange dynamite wax I've ever
dabbed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Sublime with Rome.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did a collaboration.
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange dynamite sticks.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, look at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's on fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a Wonder Brett fan out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now what?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to get you on camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to see you repping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're going to turn them down,
the fans.
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you the one who did the extract?
[SPEAKER_14]: No.
[SPEAKER_14]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did the smoking of the extraction.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he sold the extraction.
[SPEAKER_08]: He smokes it and sells it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's his job.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's their head salesman there.
[SPEAKER_08]: No one can outsell this guy there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody.
[SPEAKER_05]: We definitely have a bunch of great
salesmen at the team.
[SPEAKER_05]: They all do great.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's so humble.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's so humble.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's so humble.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why he's good at what he does.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that about Terp-less.
[SPEAKER_08]: Terp-less.
[SPEAKER_05]: Terp-less.
[SPEAKER_05]: He smokes them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stasia?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just shout out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just shout out.
[SPEAKER_14]: He's listing home addresses over there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hyping you guys up.
[SPEAKER_08]: What?
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hyping you guys up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all love, all family here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all know each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of us know each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: The cannabis industry at this stage in LA,
in this level, most people know each other
[SPEAKER_08]: or know of each other.
[SPEAKER_10]: Or know someone who knows somebody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the guy back there, he knows pretty
much everyone in the industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Six degrees.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we don't know him, he can find him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or know his best friend is Josh D.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're well known in the industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: OG growers.
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you come to the event we did in Venice
where I had him speak with Mojave?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: You were there?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mojave is our buddy from way back in the
day, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So Mojave is going to come in here with
Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mojave is awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mojave is great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super smart.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super nice guy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Making a little donut.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_14]: What are you rolling now?
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it the same thing or something
different?
[SPEAKER_10]: What we got there?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's the flour on that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ice cream cake with some sun kissed.
[SPEAKER_14]: We smoked the joint.
[SPEAKER_14]: What did we smoke in the last joint?
[SPEAKER_14]: Ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_14]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: The last joint was ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_08]: I should have brought more strains.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got some ugly little buds.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you guys want to just taste.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they'll grind up nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, these are the ones you gave me last
night from that other day.
[SPEAKER_11]: How many are you growing at any time?
[SPEAKER_08]: This last room, we had so many different
varieties.
[SPEAKER_08]: Point break.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had Mac.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had Twisted Velvet Rosé.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had Alien Orange Cookies 2 and 3.
[SPEAKER_08]: Junior Mints.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me double check.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, that's not.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_08]: Number one, number six, number 11 and
number 14.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we had some animal face.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a lot of mint julep as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had mint julep.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we had a lot of different flavors in
one room.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were doing a lot of feno hunting.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've got that Tropicana Cookies in the
back of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But this next round we have some Tropicana
Cookies crossed with Trophy Wife.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sun kissed.
[SPEAKER_10]: It adds a lot of.
[SPEAKER_08]: Skittles cake.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some more animal mints.
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of different varieties.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just too many.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why haven't you popped the Skittles and KM
11?
[SPEAKER_08]: The Zushi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Zushi.
[SPEAKER_05]: They killing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: A.K.A.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, he wants me to pop these seeds
because there's a brand out there that
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of built their their whole,
you know, line off the Zushi.
[SPEAKER_08]: They call Zushi, which is Skittles and KM
11.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, which is Cushmint's 11, which is a
male.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just for people out there that buy seed
packs, when you see it says Skittles,
[SPEAKER_08]: Skittles is the female.
[SPEAKER_08]: The first word is the female and the
second word is the male.
[SPEAKER_08]: Think of it as ladies first.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll always remember ladies first.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Skittles and Cushmint's 11,
the male is the second half.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Cushmint's 11, they found a male from
their line and they pollinated the
[SPEAKER_08]: Skittles and they're able to make these
crosses.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why you ask about that, Turplus?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the world needs it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The world needs more Skittles.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: He came over like a couple of months ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I told you all the right ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all the right ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have so many.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, I got the whole Wyeast line.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got the exotic Mike line, pretty much
the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got green fire genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, this is a female breeder.
[SPEAKER_08]: Watch out, she's hot too.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why she makes fire.
[SPEAKER_08]: She does.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they really, they give the,
if you ever go to green fire genetics and
[SPEAKER_08]: you see their list of strains,
they give you such a detailed,
[SPEAKER_08]: detailed of what they did, what they
crossed, what male they used from what
[SPEAKER_08]: line.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a seed collector, I really enjoy
seeing that because they really give you,
[SPEAKER_08]: because all the seed packs we buy,
they give you no information.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's key when you're buying genetics
that cost $200 and you're hoping that
[SPEAKER_08]: there's good work that's behind it,
like good breeding practices.
[SPEAKER_08]: They use good, stable stock.
[SPEAKER_08]: What kind of male do they use?
[SPEAKER_08]: Breeding is all interpretation really on
what you like.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a male, do you want a male that's
short stout?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want a male that's vigorous,
tall and skinny?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's based on traits.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why I got a lot of people pick
different males and they'll use pollen
[SPEAKER_08]: from each male to hit each one of their
females.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they'll still, they'll label
everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of work and you need a lot
of space.
[SPEAKER_08]: The place they're building, you're
breeding a breeding area, aren't you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Up in Atalanto?
[SPEAKER_08]: Got him with his mouth full.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Fiora.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's their brand.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that brand there means flower in
French, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Fiora.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it does.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Flower in French.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's another perk.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it?
[SPEAKER_07]: You couldn't open it?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, it's another perk to the name.
[SPEAKER_07]: It means flower.
[SPEAKER_13]: Also washing area.
[SPEAKER_13]: A couple of different areas.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to make hash affordable for the
rec market.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were talking about that today on the
way before we came here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were talking about the same thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make hash affordable.
[SPEAKER_14]: County hash philosophy.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're eventually going to have to make it
affordable because no one can,
[SPEAKER_08]: except the guys behind you, they're the
only guys in the room that can afford to
[SPEAKER_08]: buy Blue River Terps or 710 Labs,
Percy Presses.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're snobs.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're such snobs, they didn't even come
on a fucking camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how fucking snobby they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: So dab in a bit is asking, what's your
opinion on coma?
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to prolific seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Coma?
[SPEAKER_08]: I love coma.
[SPEAKER_08]: Coma says what he fucking needs,
dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have a lot of his seed packs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have actually all of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the honey tree.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got the 500 seed pack that was having a
sale.
[SPEAKER_09]: The honey tree.
[SPEAKER_08]: What else are there?
[SPEAKER_08]: The meow.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the meow and the, help me out here
Mr. Turplus.
[SPEAKER_08]: The cookies, cold cookies.
[SPEAKER_08]: S'mores, cold cookies, honey tree.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got all of the packs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait to pop his line.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: I hear he does a lot of work on his lines.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he breathes with a lot of gas.
[SPEAKER_08]: And guys from LA and California,
they love gas because they all grew up on
[SPEAKER_08]: OG.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've always been a big fan of his as a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_08]: He is, he is.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's funny too.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a character.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's an interesting character.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can go up and meet and he'll
welcome you into his place and show you
[SPEAKER_07]: around.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to be on coma's good side.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: He'll also call you out too and fight you.
[SPEAKER_08]: To the guy who's asking.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to be on coma's good side.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't go troll his shit because he'll turn
around and troll your ass.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, he's a fighter.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a boxer.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's trained.
[SPEAKER_08]: He just got back into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a fan.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have love for the plant,
we have a lot in common.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't talk about anything else.
[SPEAKER_08]: Neither does he.
[SPEAKER_08]: He doesn't have any friends because of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: People don't want to talk to me because
all I can talk about is weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you can't hang, then there's
nothing for us to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Turplus back there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I've talked to anything but
cannabis to you since we've met.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't talk about anything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: What else is there to talk about other
than Clipper Nation?
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't know if he has brothers or
sisters.
Take the mic.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all grew up in LA and most of us are
Laker fans.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Joel back there, my brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a huge Laker fan.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Kobe Black Mamba.
[SPEAKER_08]: Love you, Kobe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be saying that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's too soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rest in peace, bro.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a Clipper fan.
[SPEAKER_08]: Has been.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who?
[SPEAKER_05]: Him?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Terpy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Turplus.
[SPEAKER_08]: Turplus.
[SPEAKER_08]: Turplus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Turplus.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's usually what the baller jars are,
the Turplus, because they're gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Smoking, dabbing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Rozin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Rozin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I got that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys don't even know I got that new,
new Rozin Jam jar tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got it down?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I got down.
[SPEAKER_05]: You did your 27 degree press.
[SPEAKER_05]: That real, real.
[SPEAKER_08]: I asked him when I first met him,
I was like, I don't know you can be loyal.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's like, dude, I've been a Clipper fan.
[SPEAKER_08]: For fucking ever.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's like for me with the
Patriots, like I went through a lot of
[SPEAKER_14]: years where there were five and 11,
like the entire for the Tom Brady era 90s.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: My entire youth was the Patriots,
like the Bucks, like or the Bills.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the Bills now.
[SPEAKER_14]: But back then, the Bills went to like four
straight Super Bowls.
[SPEAKER_14]: Shout out to Ballmer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go, baby.
[SPEAKER_05]: Start buying everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please, if you're not going to,
if you're not going to be in front of
[SPEAKER_08]: camera, you can't call out Clipper Nation.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just shouting out my boy Ballmer.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just keep buying stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: My boy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the owner of the Clippers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Terrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Ballmer.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's actually a good people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't listen to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He is.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a good man.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a good man.
[SPEAKER_05]: He tries to do well.
[SPEAKER_05]: He gives back to the community,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_14]: Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't believe you don't ask more.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're just about to ash on the table.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, just leave it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just leave it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just leave it.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, there's already ash.
[SPEAKER_14]: He was about to ash around the same like,
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: People are people are asking to go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the comments are like, put put it on
the picture or show me the white ash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, why does it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you guys think about white ash?
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that even matter?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Say what?
[SPEAKER_05]: White ash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it even matter?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because coma is speaking about coma,
coma is a big believer that white ash
[SPEAKER_05]: theory is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what do you guys think about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because let's just be real.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something can be clean and can be in soil,
supposedly all organic living soil the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole night.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be a burn black.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, there's different takes on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've heard that scientifically it could
be one of the elements that is in the
[SPEAKER_10]: nutrients that burns that way.
[SPEAKER_10]: What if there's not even nutrients?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is living soil all organic and it still
burns black?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you can't flush living soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's supposed to be the most organic
way.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you didn't do it in a bag, you could
flush it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The theory of white ash, I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: The soil itself could have too much of
something, though.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could produce too much of one thing,
the soil itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta test the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely understand that part.
[SPEAKER_05]: But my question would be to you guys,
does that necessarily make the whole white
[SPEAKER_05]: ash theory bullshit?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I'm just asking.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't say much about the theory.
[SPEAKER_07]: All bomb buzz I've had is burn white ash.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you roll a joint in a trim room when
it's not fully dry.
[SPEAKER_08]: It depends on moisture, too, though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's what I'm about to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: You burn that, that shit will burn black
no matter what.
[SPEAKER_08]: After it cures, even right now,
this is only like a week and a half old.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's burning whiter and whiter and whiter.
[SPEAKER_08]: The better it cures and drier,
the less water it produces.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree to somewhat with coma.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's becoming a super hype right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like the whole white ash thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would agree, too, because think about
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_10]: They add chemicals into cigarettes to make
them light.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a good way to judge your weed on.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's white ash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do people like the light colors?
[SPEAKER_05]: People, that's all they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all they do.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not exactly what I mean.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like judging your extractions on
color.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how they judge it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know people, straight up, will roll up a
joint, they'll sit there, they'll smoke
[SPEAKER_05]: it, and they'll start looking at the ash.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not tasting their palate.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not looking at all the other
important factors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I 100% agree with you, but I'm not saying
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: With him, it's crazy how people are
judging just off that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying it's right or not.
[SPEAKER_10]: The same thing goes down to all of the
products.
[SPEAKER_10]: All of the products are getting visually
judged before the smell or the taste,
[SPEAKER_10]: or the effect even.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most of the consumers now, they can't open
a jar up and smell the flower.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have to look through a piece of glass
or look through a jar.
[SPEAKER_14]: And look at numbers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, they're just told percentages and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then, by the time they get their jar,
they still can't see the one they're
[SPEAKER_10]: buying until they've actually paid for it,
and then they can crack it.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone wanted you to share some flush
secrets, best practices.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys have to use Dr. Pepper.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead and flush it for as long as you
can.
[SPEAKER_05]: You basically start.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you guys, you guys want Dr.
Pepper.
[SPEAKER_05]: Turnpless, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me, am I bullshitting that people use
Dr. Pepper as their flush?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, with the SVA recipe.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, hey, I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not making it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've flushed all different types of
ways.
[SPEAKER_08]: We used to flush with straight RO.
[SPEAKER_08]: We used to flush with clear X.
[SPEAKER_08]: We used to flush with final flush.
[SPEAKER_08]: We used to flush with molasses.
[SPEAKER_08]: Joel, help me out here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I missing anything?
[SPEAKER_08]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I flushed with sweet before of you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have sweet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Many different things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we found out, since we've went to
salts, we actually never flush now
[SPEAKER_08]: currently ever with just straight RO.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just don't do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We flush usually up to 0.5.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a dilution more than a flush.
[SPEAKER_08]: More diluting it, bringing it down,
and we change the climate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Without saying too much, we basically
manipulate it in a way.
[SPEAKER_10]: Wean her off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, wean her off.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've actually done, as of recently,
we flush to 1.5 EC, which is higher than
[SPEAKER_08]: most anyone would go.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have seen no difference in flushing
with nutrient versus RO versus anything
[SPEAKER_08]: else I've done.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see no difference personally.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's depending on the nutrient you're
using.
[SPEAKER_08]: You couldn't do that with advanced
nutrient, the EC that we water.
[SPEAKER_08]: You would kill your plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Heavy 16, you would murder them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even the old recipes we used to use with
OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to gravity.
[SPEAKER_08]: We couldn't do it at that EC.
[SPEAKER_08]: We couldn't do much because most plants,
like you said, it's chelated.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they'll build up and the salts will
get too hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: All these people online, they're talking
about you use soil and do all this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Better not see you out there selling PGR
packs, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you know, the 818 is full of people
that use PGRs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if people actually ever tested it,
like PGRs, you get pachybutazole.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you also get something called
dimenzanine.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I'm not pronouncing these correctly,
I'm sorry, but those are very harmful
[SPEAKER_08]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_08]: And no matter if you use 0.3, 0.5,
1.0, 1.5, two mils, you're still
[SPEAKER_08]: microdosing yourself with toxins.
[SPEAKER_08]: People spray microbutanol, you're going to
basically produce toxic weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: But as long as you know how to fight
against proper pathogens, you don't need
[SPEAKER_08]: to use that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can fight, do it all organically.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the healthiness of the plant that
keeps your harvest away from pests and
[SPEAKER_10]: disease.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you keep it clean and healthy,
you're going to have way less chance of a
[SPEAKER_10]: pest or disease.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of that stuff is introduced.
[SPEAKER_08]: Joel, you ever had just a mite just show
up?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_08]: It always introduced, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Bring a cut in, you know, PM.
[SPEAKER_08]: PM just doesn't come on your shoulder and
then you go into a room and you put it on
[SPEAKER_08]: in a room.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's almost like you're introducing that
thing, those cuts, those dirty cuts.
[SPEAKER_08]: How many times you got it?
[SPEAKER_06]: It can come in on your shoulder.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can bring it in off plants outside.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're outside, you can.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're conscious of it and you're
not parking up against a rose bush and
[SPEAKER_08]: rubbing up against a rose bush that has PM
and you're not changing your clothes,
[SPEAKER_08]: yeah, you can bring it in.
[SPEAKER_08]: But most likely, the way I've always ever
had problems is getting a cut that you
[SPEAKER_08]: think is clean.
[SPEAKER_08]: The first time we ever got powdery mildew,
at least I got powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_08]: was by introducing a cut that was dirty
from a clone nursery.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys got your pre-share of problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: What clone nursery was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's shout them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: What clone nursery was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's shout them out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just say this.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I'll say.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're in Santa Cruz, which is a lot of
the strains coming from up north.
[SPEAKER_08]: Skittles and a lot of the cuts that we've
got down here.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Girl Scout cookies all came from up
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: All created up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Skittles is the one, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Skittles?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a bitch to root.
[SPEAKER_08]: My buddy Nigel talked about this quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: To root skittles, you have to bring it to
a point of almost death.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, Joel?
[SPEAKER_08]: To a point of death.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you know a plant so well, you know how
to root it, you learn it well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Skittles is an ugly short plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: The buds never look great, but the turps
on it are wonderful.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why people breed with it,
to get that turp, that sherb turp.
[SPEAKER_08]: What did we hear recently?
[SPEAKER_08]: That skittles is actually related to
Sunset Sherbert, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Bag seed, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sherb bag seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Sherbinski.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all doing a fine job out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Sherbinski.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're doing his boccio as Gelato 41 right
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: 41 boccio.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring the one in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or hey, I gotta say, that 25, that guava,
or that 33.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people don't grow the guava.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a hard cut to get.
[SPEAKER_05]: The guava's not all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the mochi, the 47?
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't grown the mochi.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've grown the 33.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really want to.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the acai berry?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I want to grow the 41, the boccio.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or about that 43, that's that jello.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why aren't you up here?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know more about strain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, you don't, but you know as much
as me, as far as strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Knowing as much as you, that's all I need.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, we sat down and we looked through
all my seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: One night till like three in the morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we separated what we felt was we
couldn't pipe with.
[SPEAKER_08]: I put all the best ones in one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we put all in one tupperware.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was like, it started off as a small
pile.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it got bigger and bigger.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we had to take that pile and
dwindle it down from there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a lot of really good breeders
in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I pretty much buy from everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: I try to.
[SPEAKER_08]: And these guys turned me on to Green Fire.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you, Joel, Green Fire?
[SPEAKER_08]: You did, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot of good Britain,
like small breeders out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like we're hunting Oni seeds right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Garlic juice and golden papaya.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then why East should be next.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why East will be next.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe Green Fire genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe coma.
[SPEAKER_08]: Coma has some honey tree.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to do that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard spores is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I heard it's one of the like,
it's like an OG, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure about the cross.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: Once I grow them, I know what the cross is
because people ask me all the time what's
[SPEAKER_08]: in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of the OGs that may hash pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I remember correctly when I first heard
about it, I think it's what turned me on
[SPEAKER_07]: to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice, because that's what we look at at
the end.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when I was talking about
checking the boxes, hash is also on that
[SPEAKER_08]: list.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like how it has like trimming and,
you know, vigor and all that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, whether it makes good hash is
also important for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, maybe the sun kiss, they said,
you know, maybe isn't as pretty as a
[SPEAKER_08]: flower and great as some of some of this
right here, but it produces really good,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of my, but I've only grown sun
kiss once.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was gifted to us from a, it's pretty.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the flower looked good.
[SPEAKER_08]: It did.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was purple.
[SPEAKER_08]: It yielded 4.7 a light.
[SPEAKER_08]: Five plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got 4.7 pounds per light.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was 19 plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got five and a half pounds.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think when we were actually around
4.7, I think it was like around 18.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't use this trim though.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a sun kiss, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a sun kiss.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is sour strawberry Kush and triangle
mints F2.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to surfer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to surfer.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_10]: They made the sour strawberries.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's a homie of ours.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Triangle mint male there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then he also made the point break.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_10]: Which we're going to put that in the
rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: He uses trophy wife, which is just male,
which is trying.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you talk about it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Turplus trophy white.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good old triangle mints, you know,
and then they got that, uh, wedding,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is the GMO and triangle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got the point break.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am hunting the point break too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a, I like that from them too,
from Tahoe nugs, Dan shout out to Dan
[SPEAKER_08]: point break, which is, uh, Tropicana
cookies and triangle mints F2.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was trophy white.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the triangle mints F2.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Triangle mints F2 is, is the AKA trophy
wife.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the male version.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: See the shout out to the powers up and my
people's up there at cookies and they're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing a great job too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cross it all a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got some other stuff coming.
[SPEAKER_08]: The, my buddy Joel has some ZTK,
some, uh, sees that we probably would just
[SPEAKER_08]: skittles and triangle Kush.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we have a cut of, uh, our own OZK
coming soon, which is a OZK cut.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a matter of fact, guys, go to your
nearest dispenser.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get the OZK selling out fast right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not lying to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, here's that skittles cake.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: OZK skittles cake.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of this stuff I've only, this one was
number two and this is two.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is skittles.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is number two.
[SPEAKER_08]: We only ran that once.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're running it right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really have some high hopes for that
one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_08]: These guys know Terps and I really listen
to them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even the plant, if it doesn't grow ideal,
if it has the Terps, these, uh,
[SPEAKER_08]: these maniacs back there want,
you know, I'm cool with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can never have too much Terps guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sad.
[SPEAKER_05]: A world without Terps, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not a Terp sniffer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need more people like us to,
and less Chad's in this industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to smell this.
[SPEAKER_08]: What does this remind you of boys?
[SPEAKER_08]: Smell that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just shush.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no rainbow shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are on camera.
Huh?
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys are... What does that smell
like to you?
[SPEAKER_08]: There's some Terps in there, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not Terp-less.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I only ran that once.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hunted that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you should.
[SPEAKER_08]: You should.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that is some rare stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: See, when, you know, hunted is the best
part is that no one in the world has that
[SPEAKER_08]: right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're the only ones in here that really
can consume that because we're the only
[SPEAKER_08]: ones that have it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the best part.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like having children.
[SPEAKER_08]: And each child has its own way of growing
and absorbing water and giving you a
[SPEAKER_08]: fucking...
[SPEAKER_08]: make you hate them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give you a heart attack or make you fall
in love.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're asking about tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're using it, but what's the future of
it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God, the future is bright for tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: This guy, we did, I mean, that's how
everyone's going to hold their genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless you're buying from nurseries and...
Makes it easier to grow a plant for 15
[SPEAKER_07]: years.
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes it a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, you can hold moms in a tube like
this and a whole wall.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can have a thousand on the shelf here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can park strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: Easily holding onto your strains for 20
plus years now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And no genetic problems, no loss.
[SPEAKER_07]: No mother plants, all that stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you need a tissue culture or some
bubba?
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a little thing in the tube.
[SPEAKER_10]: Little tubes like this and you can have
like a bunch of them in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's helping a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: I tissue cultured the MAC and I have
tissue cultured our triangle mints and I
[SPEAKER_08]: have tissue cultured our 90s OG.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so far all of them, all of them have
increased in vigor except unfortunately
[SPEAKER_08]: the OG.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the OG roots... The OG now roots,
the tissue culture OG roots great.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just haven't really ran it too much.
[SPEAKER_08]: She hasn't had a room on her own.
[SPEAKER_08]: She hasn't had a room on her own.
[SPEAKER_08]: To really tile in strains, you really want
to run it with one strain.
[SPEAKER_08]: But these days everyone wants flavors,
you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: But that OG was raised on the old recipe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's something that says that that
OG really likes that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when you ran it in its own little,
what, little section, it was covered by
[SPEAKER_10]: everybody else, whole different
environment, whole different set of newts.
[SPEAKER_10]: She wasn't having it.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, she wasn't.
[SPEAKER_10]: She wasn't.
[SPEAKER_08]: She extracted great though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_06]: She extracted all the newts.
[SPEAKER_08]: She extracted unbelievably and the plants
smell like A to me, even when it was still
[SPEAKER_08]: growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, there's something wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, other than that,
tissue culture is great.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a lot of people can marry stem a
lot of, you know, viroids out potentially
[SPEAKER_08]: like Fusarium or what else?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, dudding disease also,
dudding disease.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hot latent viroid.
[SPEAKER_08]: Any kind of viroids you can tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: May not, but you can also tissue culture
something a couple of times to potentially
[SPEAKER_08]: marry stem it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that could take, you know,
a year.
[SPEAKER_08]: It could take a year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes the OG really doesn't bring,
you know, the OG is temperamental,
[SPEAKER_08]: even in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Has anyone had the Skittles tissue culture
turned out yet?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I don't know anyone that has a tissue
culture to Skittles.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we don't want to grow Skittles.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to grow crosses of Skittles like
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That we just passed around right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Skittles cake.
[SPEAKER_08]: Skittles cake.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you get the yield, you get
different structure, but you get that turp
[SPEAKER_08]: that really.
[SPEAKER_06]: OZK or the ZTK.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or the ZTK, which is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're trying to find that gas Skittles
turp that everyone else, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of loves.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it has a potency, most importantly,
because we're all OG smokers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're trying to find one that has the
look too.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bag appeal and the, you know,
the will actually run better for hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like put off some trikes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Skittles doesn't do much of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you roll that Skittles cake?
[SPEAKER_10]: Showing us some new little vape devices.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, that's the mini portable.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_10]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_10]: This is the miniature Volcano.
[SPEAKER_10]: Same company that makes Volcano.
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh huh, made that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the portable version of a
vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sean, what's your favorite cookie strain?
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd say Gary Payton for sure.
[SPEAKER_13]: LPC.
[SPEAKER_13]: LPC 75.
[SPEAKER_10]: London pound cake.
[SPEAKER_13]: London pound cake.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I like the Gary Payton.
[SPEAKER_08]: Gary Payton vest out of all the strains.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that goes back to our OG heritage.
[SPEAKER_08]: It has that gas.
[SPEAKER_08]: Piney, gassy, strong.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jaladi too.
[SPEAKER_13]: Jaladi is very strong.
[SPEAKER_08]: AKA Biscotti.
[SPEAKER_08]: Shout out to Doja.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doja packs.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the RS-11.
[SPEAKER_05]: That shit is fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for wizard trees.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I like wizard trees stuff in Dale
Farms.
[SPEAKER_08]: They do the rainbow sherbert.
[SPEAKER_08]: RS-11.
[SPEAKER_08]: RS-11.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have an RS-7 now.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just came out.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have that GM-3 too, even though it
comes from... GM-3?
[SPEAKER_08]: You mean the dark matter?
[SPEAKER_05]: Grease monkey from... Oh, that's from
Exotic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Get your breeder right.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they have a GM-3.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that?
[SPEAKER_05]: He has a GM-3 that he always talks about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wizard trees.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Turplus.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you doing this to me?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not even on camera.
[SPEAKER_08]: No one can see you.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not about seeing or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just about believing, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about believing.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are doing great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Weren't you tired earlier at my house?
[SPEAKER_08]: Ready to go home?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to go to this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was tired, but this is actually kind of
fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're having fun, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're communicating with the... You like
being behind the scenes, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're so fucked up.
[SPEAKER_08]: You represent a great brand.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not even promoting them.
[SPEAKER_08]: How fucked up is that for all the people
out there watching?
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys go to nearest dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys try to find that wonder bread.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you, it's fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys would like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Start off with that OzDK.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the one, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this the Skittles?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_13]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it is a Skittles Cross OG.
[SPEAKER_13]: That one is the Marathon.
[SPEAKER_08]: OG?
[SPEAKER_08]: Pink Picasso.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that from Fidel?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the Cure Company.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cure Company, Josh?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Pat?
[SPEAKER_05]: RIP Nipsey.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Pat.
[SPEAKER_05]: RIP Nipsey.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Marathon is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out Cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out Dr. Green Dumps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look for the wonder bread over there as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can find it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Promoting, always selling, always
trapping, even in the rec market.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got to sell, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got to sell the dream.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can grow the best weed on the planet,
and if you can't sell it in the rec
[SPEAKER_08]: market, it's over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Growing Passions and that
Lemonade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you guys for it.
Cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lemonade, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who said that if they give you lemons,
it won't work?
[SPEAKER_14]: I like that he's just been quietly rolling
joints.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're like the quiet guy on the side just
rolling joints the entire time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my boy right there, killing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing enough talking for no reason.
[SPEAKER_08]: Chant works in one of the biggest
facilities in LA.
[SPEAKER_08]: These joints are pretty fat.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what it's like to have headaches
at scale.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know the vibes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you been watching the place we're
building online, the stories I'm putting
[SPEAKER_08]: up?
[SPEAKER_08]: The one we're building?
[SPEAKER_13]: I went there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you did?
[SPEAKER_13]: The one we're building.
[SPEAKER_14]: In Sylmar.
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you guys build a facility down in
Orange County?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Long Beach.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're no longer in the Sun Valley.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was our first facility in the valley.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was there in Northridge.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I went there with Kevin Jodry.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we hung out with Brett and was it Cam?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_14]: And did they move south because of the
Long Beach is more cannabis friendly in
[SPEAKER_14]: terms of cultivation?
[SPEAKER_15]: It happened to be that they got a license
there that was able to accommodate the
[SPEAKER_15]: facility they needed.
[SPEAKER_15]: Strictly that, just more necessity.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes it's not a choice of where you
kind of go.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's more of what's available.
[SPEAKER_15]: Licenses aren't available like that
easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially on a bigger scale and being
able to provide for a brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in wonder by their big believers on
being able to provide the brand their own
[SPEAKER_04]: product and nothing else.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not really big into basically
forcing product.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to get to that point.
[SPEAKER_14]: So how many square feet is the new
facility?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an amazing state of the art facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's 180,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_08]: 1,300 lights, 36 rooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's done in small batches.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a grower builder.
[SPEAKER_08]: I pay attention to those things.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's impressive.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very impressive.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's flower lights, by the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: 1,300 flower lights.
[SPEAKER_08]: 200 employees, probably.
[SPEAKER_08]: How many employees you guys got there?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: But everything's done in small batches,
though.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they harvest three times a week.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: Harvest three times a week.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_08]: That means you're planting three times a
week, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: And taking cuts three times a week.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we could run that place.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe with 12 foot ceilings.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be a lot of hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that your Instagram?
[SPEAKER_07]: I sent it to your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: The link.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that about done after three or four
hits or you just keep puffing?
[SPEAKER_13]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's good.
[SPEAKER_10]: If I go too hot, it's going to change the
taste.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's about the temp.
[SPEAKER_10]: I put it usually about 360, 380 on my
volcano.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hybrid?
[SPEAKER_13]: The one with the hose.
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone keeps saying, go get the Israeli
portable THC tester from the truck.
[SPEAKER_14]: And he's saying it like 100 times.
[SPEAKER_14]: But you don't have it here.
[SPEAKER_08]: What happened is that before we came here,
they all came in my truck.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I took everything out of my truck.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I put it in my Audi.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's in there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just think it's funny that someone
remembered that you had mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And was like, show the damn thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I ever come back on the show,
I'll bring that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll bring it.
[SPEAKER_05]: My boy grows mushrooms, he says.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, bring me that fungi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm a fungi.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the volcano.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're asking us if you guys seen the
thermometer.
[SPEAKER_10]: The thermometer?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I didn't buy it.
[SPEAKER_10]: But instead, I bought the Harbor Freight
on sale for like $10, the digital
[SPEAKER_10]: thermometer.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my thermometer.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I use it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I go in around 530.
[SPEAKER_07]: Timer in hand still.
[SPEAKER_10]: You still do all of the wrist?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: I always say, well, if it's too hot for
the wrist, then it's too hot for the
[SPEAKER_10]: lungs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I time it, for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: People always ask, because why does it
burn?
[SPEAKER_08]: It hurt my throat.
[SPEAKER_08]: It tastes like plastic when I smoke it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, are you smoking it like you
would BHO?
[SPEAKER_08]: If you smoke it at a high, high
temperature, it rosin.
[SPEAKER_08]: It tastes like shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It burns black.
[SPEAKER_03]: Torches it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I preferably like to cold start.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just heat it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: In there in a rig that you basically,
once it starts to bubble right past that,
[SPEAKER_08]: you go a little longer, a little bubble,
and you get a really good, clean hit.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when you heat it up, which is about
500.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is right around 500.
[SPEAKER_08]: 500, 510, 520 in that range.
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect chirpy, yet it still gets you
high.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything hotter than that, like 600.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do we usually do?
[SPEAKER_08]: Put a heat gun?
[SPEAKER_10]: They were just saying the terpometer is
like a hundred and some dollar device that
[SPEAKER_10]: you pay, but all it is is a digital
infrared thermometer.
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I said, I'd bought one for like 10
bucks at Harvard Freight, and we use that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: We put it on a vice right above it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just hangs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_08]: With the rubber band on the trigger.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were just doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: 500 pretty much works.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So 530 is when we get our dab ready.
[SPEAKER_10]: By the time you drop it, it's between 5,
510.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then throw your carb on top.
[SPEAKER_08]: What does 710 and those guys say?
[SPEAKER_08]: Do they talk about that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Turplus, what do they say?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're the fucking master at concentrates.
[SPEAKER_08]: What do they recommend?
[SPEAKER_08]: Mostly BHO.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just like smoking them.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you like to drop in at?
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so what do you guys do?
[SPEAKER_05]: He uses the peak.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Joel Helen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get yourself a Cold Star Banger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to Dementia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to my boy, Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spend some money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get yourself a nice piece.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you go hit that boy up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just use, honestly, a cheap lighter.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, like literally a cheap torch.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's the best thing ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get six, seven rips off of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're just lit, like lit on some
other level.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what temperature?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just heat it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cold start.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cold start.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so you're talking cold start.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we were saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actual banger used for a cold start.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Joel Helen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got the curves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The rounded bottom.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it 100% German quartz?
[SPEAKER_10]: I just picked up a black market one with
the red quartz.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's called black market glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: But black market glass.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's got a red quartz.
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently this red quartz is supposed
to hold a steadier temp for a longer
[SPEAKER_10]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also got my custom logo.
[SPEAKER_10]: I engraved on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's coming this week.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm excited for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Turplist, do you have a question?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I got many questions, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you were on an island and you were
stuck there, what five turps would you
[SPEAKER_05]: have the mason jar ballers of?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like for me, instance, it's the papaya,
because that's, you know, we definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: need that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to need a Skittles of some
sort.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to go ahead and get that straw
nana.
[SPEAKER_05]: GMO, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a good lineup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that lineup.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know why?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hawaiian fruit stand.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know why?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you've smoked every single one of
those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, many times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many different brands.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to Cali Kosher.
[SPEAKER_05]: They got a good papaya.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like Cali Kosher.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring a turp to the island.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to bring a turp that you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me ask you guys the same question.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you guys were on this island and you
were cast away, Mr. Tom, what would you
[SPEAKER_05]: guys have on this island?
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, I like the triangle mints.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a big favorite of mine.
[SPEAKER_10]: It may not be the blingiest, but but our
kind of triangle that the effect that it
[SPEAKER_10]: has on me, the the the taste, the smell,
the effect.
[SPEAKER_10]: I still like that triangle mints,
but shout out.
[SPEAKER_10]: See, I'd like to keep that one.
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be a good one.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's still one of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say triangle to it for me as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, gee, for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would do a I would do a gelato in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I throw a gelato turp in there,
but you say, you know, makes shitty hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't say that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you guys again are killing the
messenger.
[SPEAKER_05]: A question was brought up by this
gentleman next to me asking what about a
[SPEAKER_05]: duel?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just said what he told me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had a conversation with him.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to prove you wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not about proof once again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, I was told and it proved me
wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen it myself either.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than shout out to Blue River,
the gelato cream, 14 percent terpenes
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's the imaginary number,
the deconstructed, reconstructed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you get that, then you might have a
good combination of project flora.
[SPEAKER_05]: Project four, five, six.
[SPEAKER_14]: Sam, do you want to smoke some more?
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you ready to call it?
[SPEAKER_14]: And Tom says meeting adjourned.
Done.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it's great.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for having us out again.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Enjoy the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_10]: Come and kick it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Chit chat.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll bring the spectrometer next time.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll see you next time.
