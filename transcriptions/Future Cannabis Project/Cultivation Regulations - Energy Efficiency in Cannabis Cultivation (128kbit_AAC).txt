[SPEAKER_01]: If you could explain kind of conceptually
that state by state regulations are put in
[SPEAKER_01]: place that address, I guess, energy
consumption, which affects cultivators,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, less outdoor, but indoor and
greenhouse, and then kind of what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: on in different markets that you've seen
that's interesting, that's making you pull
[SPEAKER_01]: your hair out and then talk about
California specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Massachusetts just released its rules
related to how they will regulate energy
[SPEAKER_00]: and carbon impacts of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially Massachusetts has set the
model for how states are going to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: these issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts is the number one state on
energy efficiency ranked eight years in a
[SPEAKER_00]: row by an organization called ACEEE,
which looks at how states are adjusting
[SPEAKER_00]: their responses to climate change and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Massachusetts is out in the lead on
this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have essentially set lighting
standards that are equivalent to an energy
[SPEAKER_00]: code and essentially clearly preferring
LED lighting technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also collecting survey data from
growers about how they're using energy and
[SPEAKER_00]: water and how much waste they're creating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that data, the thinking is that
they will inform targets that they may set
[SPEAKER_00]: for increased efficiency over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the good news is that the state is
not just providing a heavy hand of
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also providing some investments in
Resource Innovation Institute to help us
[SPEAKER_00]: reach out to growers so they know how to
report on their energy, water and waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they can tap into resources like
best practices on how to cultivate under
[SPEAKER_00]: LED lighting, how to operate HVAC more
efficiently in both indoor and greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that for the most part,
outdoor cultivation is, as far as we've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen, is getting somewhat of a pass on
these regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois essentially just copied what
Massachusetts did, added a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: nuance to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're seeing replication happen
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois also banned outdoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a different wrinkle on energy
and carbon impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we've seen various local
jurisdictions in many states ban outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation, which is not a smart decision
for a number of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Economic development, energy and carbon
impacts, impact on the rest of the utility
[SPEAKER_00]: rate payers in the area who may have rates
increase because of all the new
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure that needs to be built in
to support these energy intensive indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see a wide range of things that
governments are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what's important for the
cultivation community to understand is
[SPEAKER_00]: that California is now in the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: The California Energy Commission is
currently reviewing proposals through its
[SPEAKER_00]: Title 24 code proposal process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking at establishing lighting
standards They're looking at establishing
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient dehumidification standards,
requirements on reuse of water,
[SPEAKER_00]: and requiring environmental and irrigation
controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a number of elements of
cultivation that will be impacted by
[SPEAKER_00]: California's codes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they may apply to every form of
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even a sungrown grower that has
generally very little energy and carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: impact, at least in the flowering stage,
may be impacted by these regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's important that growers pay
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important, especially for the
cultivation community in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they engage in the stakeholder
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we at Resource Innovation
Institute are facilitating is ways for the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation community to interact with
governments as governments set out to
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate energy use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, what we want to do is encourage
governments to not just have a heavy hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to support cultivators with good
unbiased information that's from experts
[SPEAKER_00]: who can help them learn how to be more
efficient with energy use, connect
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators who are succeeding with
cultivators who are having challenges,
[SPEAKER_00]: and just really expand the knowledge base
and the transfer of knowledge throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can raise the bar on best practices
and help everybody be more profitable,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then obviously make compliance with
all of these regulations a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just quickly, does the California
Energy Commission currently, is there
[SPEAKER_01]: currently any regulation on the books or
is this like they have a blank slate and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're about to institute something for
the first time and they're in the kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like data gathering, reaching out to those
who are going to be affected by it
[SPEAKER_01]: process?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: California's energy code process is
generally a long process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's generally a three year process and
we're still at the relatively early stage
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the perfect time for people to get
in and contribute their ideas about what
[SPEAKER_00]: makes sense and what's functional for the
cultivation community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the stakeholder engagement process
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is happening right now over the next
several months.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when the state of California,
the California Energy Commission is
[SPEAKER_00]: encouraging the industry to provide input
to code proposal writers who literally are
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to go out and talk to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're helping the code proposal
writers for Title 24 connect with experts
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry, with cultivators who have
figured out how to do things efficiently
[SPEAKER_00]: with LED lighting manufacturers,
HVAC manufacturers, HVAC engineers,
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting engineers, utilities,
everybody that can have, can contribute
[SPEAKER_00]: some understanding to what the challenges
are, what the roadblocks are, where the
[SPEAKER_00]: easiest sort of low hanging fruit is,
where the real savings are, where the real
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts on a business model might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, it's critically important
that people get involved now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the important thing about California
is not just that it affects one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: largest cultivation markets in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically as California energy codes go,
so go the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we already have Massachusetts,
the number one ranked state on energy
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have California, the number two
state, usually on those rankings and
[SPEAKER_00]: generally the most forward state on carbon
commitments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we're talking about ranking,
just for clarification, it's not cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just Massachusetts is an energy
efficient state across all industries or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always thought California was leading
the way, but Massachusetts is number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so this process is typically,
I mean, is it like tip?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously it can be, it can vary,
but is it like a six month process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if we're in February right now and
they're just starting the process,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's the listening period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they go draft some proposals based on
all the information they've gathered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I assume they get some public
feedback and that's another opportunity
[SPEAKER_01]: for cultivators to be like, Oh my God,
like that's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have something to say about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are, um, draft proposals that are
already put forward on those subjects that
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier, the lighting standards and
dehumidification efficiency standards,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, water reuse, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and if, if folks go to our,
uh, blog page, they can get a link to
[SPEAKER_00]: everything they need to know about the
California codes and, um, how they can be
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, um, the proposals are
already out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting feedback right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do several iterations of,
uh, larger stakeholder engagement sessions
[SPEAKER_00]: that are funded by the utilities in the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one of those is coming up in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then, uh, they're, they're going
to continue to refine the proposals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then ultimately they, they get through
a energy commission review process and
[SPEAKER_00]: then approval and then a rollout process
to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, like I said, it's, it's still
early enough in the process that uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: input is valued and can impact what the
outcome is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if we, if the industry waits too,
too long to provide input, the proposal's
[SPEAKER_00]: rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are giving input and we
just need to make sure the cultivators are
[SPEAKER_00]: checking into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that, um, the market is really
challenging in California in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's really busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a legislative session.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, challenges with taxes and a
number of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this is, this is a critical long-term
business model, uh, uh, consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I'm just, we want to make this as
easy as possible for cultivators to engage
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, this is, we are trying to help
the industry become more efficient in the
[SPEAKER_00]: best ways that work for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so within those different buckets that
you mentioned, lighting, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidification, water reuse in the
current draft proposals, is there anything
[SPEAKER_01]: in any of those buckets that jumps out at
you as very concerning or very positive?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like either they got something right from
your perspective or, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is going to be devastating to a lot
of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't view California as doing anything,
um, extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely see that they are looking to
Massachusetts and Illinois and learning
[SPEAKER_00]: from some challenges have, have,
uh, come up in those markets with the
[SPEAKER_00]: initial regulatory rollout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they are, uh, clearly very open to
getting stakeholder input and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: creating a lot of opportunities for that
to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so I've, I've been impressed with
the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely the most, um, rigorous
engagement process I've seen from,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, government on the issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so I think it's going to come out
as, as a pretty reasonable, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: set of expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's important for cultivators to
assess that, uh, and to assess it soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when we spoke before you had
talked about, like, I think lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: versus just kind of overall energy
footprint and how some, sometimes things
[SPEAKER_01]: are, are regulations are drafted in a way
that, that, that don't lead to,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, if it's focused on one thing,
let's say just lighting, it doesn't take
[SPEAKER_01]: into account overall energy, or if it's
focused on another, like examples of,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, how certain States or even countries
around the world, uh, are drafting things
[SPEAKER_01]: related to lighting or energy that is
maybe the wrong way to approach it,
[SPEAKER_01]: which will, which will lead to adverse
outcomes in terms of people not in here,
[SPEAKER_01]: adhering to the spirit of, uh,
what the hope is, but they are adhering to
[SPEAKER_01]: the letter of it, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initial, uh, thinking that went into,
um, early regulatory concepts,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, essentially tried to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way governments regulate buildings
that have humans in them and apply those
[SPEAKER_00]: standards to buildings that have plants in
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for, for a variety of reasons,
that doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's, it's, it's not apples and
apples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, that's an example of,
can you give a concrete example of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of, of something specific, like they had X
in the regulations, which if it were
[SPEAKER_01]: humans would make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's plants, so it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one example is, um, uh, lighting
standards in a, in an office building,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would think about Watts per square
foot and set a limit on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in a grow environment, it isn't Watts
per square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's necessarily going to drive
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watts is a capacity of, of how much energy
can be delivered.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want to measure is actually how
efficiently is a light fixture delivering
[SPEAKER_00]: the electricity that's required to
stimulate effective plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a whole new measurement system
that literally is not relevant to humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's critically important to,
um, understanding how you can think about
[SPEAKER_00]: producing a product with a less of an
energy impact on a unit basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we, we are recommending
cultivators think about not just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, grams per watt as an example,
but grams produced per kilowatt hour
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed or KBTU, which is really a
standardized way of looking at all energy
[SPEAKER_00]: sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the way we need to be thinking
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's the way the tools that we're
establishing, like our cannabis power
[SPEAKER_00]: score, um, energy benchmarking tool are
measuring things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what all of our advisors,
our advisors are telling us the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to move toward those types of
metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need to make sure that
governments are aligning the way that they
[SPEAKER_00]: will evaluate energy performance to what
will work for a business model in this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and again, if industry is not
involved, governments will go down a path
[SPEAKER_00]: that they think makes sense in the absence
of input.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will become law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and so we have a unique
opportunity right now as an industry to
[SPEAKER_00]: affect what will be the likely consistent
replicable rollout of regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so taking the example you just gave of
like Watts per square foot is kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: if humans were in the building,
if, if lighting regulations were drafted
[SPEAKER_01]: that way, what kind of actions would
cultivators take that would adhere to the
[SPEAKER_01]: letter of the law, but like not really the
spirit of the law or the regulations,
[SPEAKER_01]: like what, what's kind of the adverse
outcome of drafting regulations,
[SPEAKER_01]: measuring, uh, energy efficiency in that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just as an example, 36 Watts per square
foot is, is, um, a number that's out there
[SPEAKER_00]: that's being referred to by number of
governments, um, somewhat arbitrary,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, definitely is looking at HPS lights,
uh, and how to graduate them out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: market over time, or at least the
inefficient ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so you can think about,
you know, on a four by four fixture
[SPEAKER_00]: pattern, you know, how many lights are
over a square feet of a canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you would be in the 60 plus Watts per
square foot range at using an HPS light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you could, you could spread that one
light fixture out over a larger period or
[SPEAKER_00]: larger space, like a five by six or a six
by six pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not get as much of the light that
you want coming from those HPS lights to
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulate growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're spread out over more of the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so you might be meeting the law,
but you might be impacting your
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we, it's really important how
governments write the little nuance of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, what metric they're using to evaluate,
uh, performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so photon efficacy, the,
um, ability of the light fixture to
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver that the, uh, light that the plant
needs for growth is just a much more
[SPEAKER_00]: functional way to evaluate performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it accounts for, uh, generally
all forms of lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's definitely pushing toward the
fixtures, uh, like led and others,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that are performing at a higher micro
mole per joule, uh, performance level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and looking at organizations like the
design lights consortium, which is third
[SPEAKER_00]: party verifying manufacturer claims on
performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and supporting the market in
those directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, that, that was a great, uh,
concrete example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, do, do you have one in either
dehumidification or water reuse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like an example of regulations written in
a way that's not really a right fit,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a, you know, square peg round hole
fit rather than a square peg square hole
[SPEAKER_00]: in a grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there, there is, there are so many
energy, there are so many systems that are
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of fighting each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the, the heat from the lights is
fighting the cooling systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just a lot of energy thrown at
the production process that, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: is inefficient, but also basically the
entire supply chain and nearly every
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator I talked to, uh, nobody knows
exactly how to optimize these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you're driving the most plant
growth for the least energy input.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's because we need more data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need, this is all relatively new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously cannabis cultivation and
indoor facilities is not new, but
[SPEAKER_01]: governments and utilities and others
government involvement in that process is
[SPEAKER_01]: new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at least, uh, energy, uh,
energy departments of governments being
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in, in cannabis cultivation is,
is new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so everybody's got to learn,
uh, and, and what we need is more data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, literally everybody needs more
data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivators need more data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Investors need more data, utilities,
governments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's important is that again,
the utility gets involved in these
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations so that governments don't
set arbitrary, um, numbers on desired
[SPEAKER_00]: performance that cultivators must meet in
the absence of actually knowing if those
[SPEAKER_00]: targets are appropriate or achievable or
at what cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need to, we need to join
together as an entire supply chain,
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting manufacturers, HVAC engineers,
et cetera, architects, contractors,
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators, and inform the process or at
least, you know, and that's, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what we've been working on is a way
to standardize the data collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're actually have all the data points
that can, when disaggregated, we can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually understand how much does a
watering rate or the soil and media that's
[SPEAKER_00]: being used affect the dehumidification,
uh, energy that is needed in, in this
[SPEAKER_00]: building or this grow environment in this
climate zone, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are, those are examples of the data
points that are needed to really unpack
[SPEAKER_00]: how to optimize efficiency in cultivation
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, you know, it's a little cart
before the horse to be setting extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: targets in a regulatory construct when we
don't know how to optimize efficiency and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so we just need to be very thoughtful
and ensure that everybody involved is
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughtful right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as somebody who I kind of view as like
a hummingbird going around from grower to
[SPEAKER_01]: grower, uh, wearing the hat of,
you know, energy efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know when we'd spoke a year ago,
uh, Jesse Peters was kind of held up as an
[SPEAKER_01]: example of somebody who's brought kind of
is, is the measurement cost per pound of
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that kind of what he was crushing or
doing a really good job of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cost per pound of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what did he get the cost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cost per pound down to, uh, Jesse Peters
at one point was, uh, audited,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, to be producing at $189 a pound was
the number he was quoting, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: in an, in a vertical stacked, highly
automated, led lit, uh, indoor facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, in, in, uh, the Willamette Valley of
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that's definitely the lowest cost
of production I've seen in an indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and he believes it could be cut in
half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as far as I can tell, um, basically
every cultivation environment out there
[SPEAKER_00]: can probably save 50% on energy,
indoor greenhouse outdoor, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, sun grown, um, obviously in the
flowering stage is not using energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, you know, they're still using
lighting, still using HVAC and drying and
[SPEAKER_00]: curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and as far as I can tell, most people
can save a lot on energy because we just
[SPEAKER_00]: need to learn how to adopt best practices
at a, at a higher rate, uh, throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that's the type of community
we're building in RII is people to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to share that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and again, raise the bar on the
industry so that we can all figure out how
[SPEAKER_00]: to be more profitable and, and have a
lower carbon footprint and be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible market actor.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so just with some, some concrete
examples again, uh, so two, two questions,
[SPEAKER_01]: one, what are some low hanging fruit in
terms of, uh, just things that you've seen
[SPEAKER_01]: that people can do that don't take much
time and effort that lead to a marginally
[SPEAKER_01]: dramatic reduction in energy usage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then part two is who are the
innovators and, and, or have you seen
[SPEAKER_01]: anything in the past couple months that's
kind of blown your mind of, Oh my God,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's genius.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, in terms of energy efficiency that
somebody's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think, I think the basic place where
everybody should start is just get a
[SPEAKER_00]: handle on how much energy they are using
and how does that compare to their class
[SPEAKER_00]: of cultivation in their climate zone,
in their preferred method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor outdoor greenhouse, even within
greenhouse, you know, as what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, it's the old adage,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What gets measured gets done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really understanding where your
baseline is of current performance is
[SPEAKER_00]: critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you get a handle on that,
then you can figure out from there where
[SPEAKER_00]: to, where to chip away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's why we created the cannabis
power score, uh, as a standardized way to
[SPEAKER_00]: measure energy usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Energy as a function of how much
cultivation output you're providing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, from there, you know, at the end of
the day, this is, this is largely lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: and HVAC and it's really about how,
what type of lighting you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then how you're adjusting the set
points on your environmental controls
[SPEAKER_00]: through your HVAC systems and whatnot,
how you're automating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, it's, I would say
there's not really a silver bullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's really like, you have to pick
what we say is, you know, uh, tweak and
[SPEAKER_00]: peak, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, make some adjustments, understand what
it, how it impacted you and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then continue to refine from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, again, we just released,
um, two best practices guides,
[SPEAKER_00]: one, one on led lighting and one on HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and these are chock full of good peer
reviewed information and what every,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, cultivator, architect,
manufacturer, engineer, the folks who were
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in this from throughout the
industry, basically all we're saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's make sure we're talking the same
language.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make sure we understand the terms as
they should be defined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make sure we understand how to
measure PPFD correctly with a,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make sure that we think about having
independent commissioning done of
[SPEAKER_00]: buildings after all the equipment is
installed so that, you know, you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: just hear from your engineer who designed
the space that everything's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually have somebody independent
come in and, and value, validate that
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is going to operate the way
that you are being told.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it, you know, it really starts with
deciding to who's on your team,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's on your construction or your
retrofit team and making sure you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: good set of people surrounding you,
um, and, and challenging each other and
[SPEAKER_00]: then, um, and then moving forward from
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so just that last question,
something you've seen in the past couple
[SPEAKER_01]: months that, or even the past year or
whatever, that is just kind of an
[SPEAKER_01]: innovation that, that blew your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we're seeing in the market
is, um, uh, some evolution of technologies
[SPEAKER_00]: that are beginning to talk to each other
and work with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to see a lot around
the automation space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like smart controllers kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, uh, where lighting systems are
talking to HVAC systems and, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually functioning well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, things like that, I think,
um, we're going to see in the marketplace
[SPEAKER_00]: soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and they're actually beginning to
appear, um, as well as, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: connections to renewable resources of
energy, um, and just using energy more
[SPEAKER_00]: creatively, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: More, more, um, more dynamically
throughout the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I will, I want to throw out something
else and that is, uh, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're, we're hearing at least in some
markets and some climate zones,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouses appear to be using when,
when you standardize to a BTU level,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that, you know, a common unit of
energy across all sources of energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: propane, natural gas, electricity,
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouses appear to be in some cases
using as much energy as a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so there's a lot to learn there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to understand, um,
how to make greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: More efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just really want to make sure
everybody understands these codes and
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations that are continuing to come
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and in particular in California,
they are addressing, uh, warehouses and
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, some stages of
cultivation that will be relevant to even
[SPEAKER_00]: sungrown producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's, it's, it's an entire industry
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we all need to get involved and we all
can do so much better, uh, and thrive
[SPEAKER_00]: together, but we, we got to work together
on these issues and we got to do it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's why we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're here to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually a surprising finding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most people would be taken by it
or that would take them by surprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anybody doing, uh, some
interesting kind of distributed power,
[SPEAKER_01]: like local generation, whether solar
panels, wind, algae, biofuel, something
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, uh, is, is crushing their energy
consumption or, or their need for the grid
[SPEAKER_01]: basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm seeing, I think the state of
Colorado just announced the, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the partnership between, um, some
cultivators and some brewery operations
[SPEAKER_00]: where they're actually exchanging CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so the brewery has CO2 that they don't
want, and they're essentially sharing it
[SPEAKER_00]: with the cultivation community.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a way that's bringing everybody's costs
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and obviously lowering the carbon
footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the cannabis industry can do so
much to partner with other industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and also can learn from the broader
world of agriculture, which we are part
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody wants to believe that,
but, or accept that, but it is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's so much that
cannabis cultivators can teach on
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there's also other things we can
learn from like big vertical warehouses
[SPEAKER_00]: in, you know, dense urban environments
that are doing CO2 recapture from a nearby
[SPEAKER_00]: facility and just literally piping it from
that facility right into the facility
[SPEAKER_00]: growing lettuce or basil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we just need to, I think,
open our minds, collaborate and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, work on these issues together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I think we'll see a lot of
positive returns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Derek, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you, Peter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll see you in a couple of weeks down
in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
