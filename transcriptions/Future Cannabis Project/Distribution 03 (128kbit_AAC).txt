[SPEAKER_00]: I said, because I need to make sure I can
get rid of product for my cultivators and
[SPEAKER_00]: pay my cultivators before I ask them for
another set of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, well, those are great
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to go to another
distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, it's more important for me to hand
a chunk of money or write a check to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator and miss the market and not
have enough product going into phase two
[SPEAKER_00]: and phase three than for me not to be able
to look somebody in the eyes that I love
[SPEAKER_00]: dearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And say, I can't pay you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too much of that going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was the right decision at the
table, because none of us, and I could
[SPEAKER_00]: probably speak for all of us, didn't
realize how hard the distribution model
[SPEAKER_00]: was going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, if there's anybody that tells
you they know this game, she said in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning, man, turn around and walk away,
because that guy knows the littlest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hands down, they don't know nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very difficult being a distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the distributor, because you're
the middleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing, I'm a broker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a broker my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is no new game.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the exact same situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in bed, and I'm in business with the
government and the state of California,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cities, and everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the same game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have integrity back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always had the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody pays up in front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything gets paid in my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't lose a bunch of money by fronting
a bunch of stuff on stuff I've never seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the day, I forget what
the questions were.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she did say, I think, at the last one,
what's important was what are we doing now
[SPEAKER_00]: for the cultivator, but what do we plan on
doing for the cultivator next?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really excited to tell you that
we're doing remediation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing flower remediation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're handling that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be kicking in gear pretty
soon here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take care of a lot of
flower remediation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be another service.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to go to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can go back to your distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm willing to work with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like I'm a distributor that wants
to hoard everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a cultivator, and you did an R&D
test, and you found some powder mildews or
[SPEAKER_00]: some molds or some botrytis or something
on your flower on your R&D test,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you what.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those other big distributors out there
are going to say, it's worth $100 a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to run it all into a BHO
extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're going to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to make huge margins.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to help you remediate it
and find a solution that is still putting
[SPEAKER_00]: money back in your pocket by doing a
service, taking it back to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: transporting it to another distributor,
or bringing in one of our other ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: extracting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a need.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do pre-rolls, white labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is why I find it so
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just fascinating what you guys are
doing for the market and how deep it gets.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's super exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the questions that I have as a
lawyer, we want to see a lot of written
[SPEAKER_03]: agreements.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it look like, the contracts that
you're seeing today with the farmers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there written agreements?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the primary terms?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the just kind of basics that
you're seeing in terms of these contracts?
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever the agreements with the farmers
or manufacturers are as for distro,
[SPEAKER_03]: when do you take title?
[SPEAKER_03]: When do you not take title?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you need a motor carrier permit if
you're going to go pick it up from them
[SPEAKER_03]: and not buy it until they get,
you know, until after a COA?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the weirdness that you're seeing
in the actual agreements that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: wrestling out right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I imagine it's got to be complex
and so novel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the first time it's ever
happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no industry that does it quite
like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are you guys seeing in terms of
those written agreements?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how does that work?
[SPEAKER_02]: So my only experience of written
agreements are the ones coming from our
[SPEAKER_02]: company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thus, so far from all the transactions
we've done, I have not seen yet seen one
[SPEAKER_02]: document come from any other entity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's been really bizarre.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as our contracts with our supply
chain partners, we do a consignment
[SPEAKER_02]: contract.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can come pick up your flower or your
product, bring that in house, have a
[SPEAKER_02]: target price, and then be able to sell
that the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we pay biweekly, depending on
what sells.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one contract that we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we have a direct purchase contract.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we pay upfront.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, when we take in the money
from the buyer and bring it into our
[SPEAKER_02]: distro as an escrow, obviously do the QC
and the R&D test before we procure it and
[SPEAKER_02]: all of that procurement work, bring that
in and then pay the farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that seems to be pretty black and white
and straightforward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're developing contracts around this
integrated partnership model that I spoke
[SPEAKER_02]: of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, depending on that farmer's
business model, they're all very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would think it's, oh, you know,
growing weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, everybody's kind of got their own
strength in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're really trying to streamline
our contract for either a split contract
[SPEAKER_02]: toll processing to where you can give me
your flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: We extract the whole thing and then we
split the revenues depending on the
[SPEAKER_02]: operational cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those comes off the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we can do an output model.
[SPEAKER_02]: So depending on the yield, the grams,
that come out, the farmers get paid
[SPEAKER_02]: accordingly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another type of toll processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a few different
companies, actually a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution companies that are industry
pioneers, as well as a processing company
[SPEAKER_02]: who's really moving forward on this really
unique model that I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have, I'm trying to think of the name
of the structure, but it's they manage the
[SPEAKER_02]: farms in a way where they'll come to the
farm once a month, make sure everything is
[SPEAKER_02]: passing tests, look at their IPM,
make sure everything's going to pass tests
[SPEAKER_02]: and provide that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That management service in a way that
oversight, along with potential capital
[SPEAKER_02]: injection initially.
[SPEAKER_02]: So subsidizing the farm with either clones
or capital to maintain their operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the end of the harvest,
it's kind of a set price per square foot
[SPEAKER_02]: that sold back to that other entity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they take that flower and either
extract it or sell it for tops,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on the relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's really interesting out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of really great ways that
all the supply chain partners are linking
[SPEAKER_02]: together and figuring it out depending on
what everyone's focus is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to talk more about it,
we have a booth over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of spells out our three
different models for these integrated
[SPEAKER_02]: partnerships for farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll have our contracts ready for
those very shortly.
[SPEAKER_02]: In addition to that, we also have a
nursery in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So supplying genetics and making sure all
of these clones are clean really offsets
[SPEAKER_02]: that upfront cost for farmers too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just streamline everyone's integration
and intentions for the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need to keep our machines fed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to have exact oils for all of our
brands and products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the brands we work with need
specific strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of opportunity to really
sync up depending on what your focus is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so where you're growing for a purpose
every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been moving towards more of a
once we receive CRAs cashing out then
[SPEAKER_01]: before we do it in terms of model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now we review our contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our president's a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's been managing a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally just manage a lot of just the
sales end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't really tell you how the
contracts come from when we're procuring.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll tell you that we've seen an
evolution of contracts where I've worked
[SPEAKER_01]: with manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about splits and then what happens
after split.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that we found kind of hard to
figure out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was easy to figure out,
but it was hard when they didn't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: velocity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was we wanted them to take all the product
and then do a split afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're distributing sales and that
just became kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going through contracts, kind of
figuring out where the weak points are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're doing, especially when
we work with partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Contracts are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Handshakes are better, but contracts are
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never give up the handshake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we do a split for all of our extracts
we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do the split.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we'll do a purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: A number of different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hit it really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a consignment.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, our contracts are thorough.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been crafted and created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Created from our attorneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other attorneys have read them and
called us up and said, damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only you cover yourself, which is
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier, we want to cover the
whole relationship with a cultivator too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of contracts that I've read are
completely one-sided that cultivators are
[SPEAKER_00]: signing and they are losing their asses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of distributors out
there that do not care about you,
[SPEAKER_00]: know that right out the gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know these ones sitting up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do care about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably why we're invited to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for contracts, we started out with a
60 after testing was approved,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But 60-day payout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if it comes out earlier than that,
it comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been one instance that we had some
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It extended out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, we've held and
we've paid pretty well or before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have purchase contracts as well for
those great value.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get rid of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a purchase contract set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the same thing with the extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of different biomass
contracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of different markets for a
lot of different things to land.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is logistics and price
point and negotiating that at the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing level.
[SPEAKER_00]: For biomass and all that, everything's so
changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no model that's been set or
created yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, I'm self-made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no venture capitalists on me
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every penny I ever made, I threw it in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm standing here today still owning
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sitting where I can write a
$200,000 check to buy a cultivator's
[SPEAKER_00]: product up front.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm also going to pay you within the
time of the contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a crazy model out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys can see us.
[SPEAKER_00]: What worked two weeks ago is totally
different now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it hasn't been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what distributor who has 30
years in the alcohol industry and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: telling you he knows what they're doing or
she knows what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This industry hasn't been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a person says, I've been in the alcohol
industry and I know what they're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know distribution, walk away
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walk away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, too, one of the things that
really concerns me sometimes is some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the distributors or purchasers,
it doesn't necessarily need to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: distributor where the contracts don't make
sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not written in plain language.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're written in very legalese.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to connect with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually, that's a red flag to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we can't understand it as just humans,
something's not right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's something to think about in terms
of looking at contracts and also having a
[SPEAKER_03]: distributor who's willing to negotiate
those terms with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because like you said, we're here for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's done this before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can present some kind of language.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it doesn't necessarily mean that when
we present it and somebody says,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, what about this scenario?
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't thought about that scenario.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we think about it together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we create something together that
works for all of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of how I feel those good
relationships are going to be born out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've recently seen a distro contract that
said they had 40% on their contract distro
[SPEAKER_00]: fee, 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they held 200 pounds and couldn't get
rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking the product away from that
distro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to name who it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the other douchebags in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll ask you when we're offline here.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so it's time for us to get off,
but just a quick closing thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you guys seeing any trends in
distribution, anything that you're seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: that is a positive, is a negative?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you guys seeing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like a two-second summary of what
you're seeing, what the company is
[SPEAKER_03]: providing, and what you guys see we're
going for the future, and just something
[SPEAKER_03]: that we can latch onto and look forward to
in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm really excited to see a lot more
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year, with coming out of the shadows,
as you call it, it's really nerve wracking
[SPEAKER_02]: for a lot of people who've been in this
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only that, but seeing all the big
capital coming in, the new companies
[SPEAKER_02]: coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone's really used to being very
private, not necessarily trusting,
[SPEAKER_02]: and really working by themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the last year, I've seen that
dramatically shift.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are coming together in
cooperatives, as Hezekiah was talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other supply chain and stakeholder
partners who are sharing information and
[SPEAKER_02]: linking arms together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big distributors that are all pioneers
want to work with only the pioneer
[SPEAKER_02]: companies and really stick to that model.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really, really happy to see the
collaboration.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's one thing that has been
missing in the last couple of decades that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in cannabis, in a way,
of really sharing resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: Creating co-ops for efficiencies in what
you're purchasing, streamlining genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: and really keeping that operational cost
as low as possible at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very important for cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am excited to see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: People coming together, I think Humboldt
has really led the way in that regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were one of the first counties to
allow cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've gone to several events up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the HCGA, the Humboldt Growers
Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see these just old school farmers
coming together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's stronger together is that
mission.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we really are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they really paved the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's exciting to see Nevada County now
taking steps towards that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited to see who's come forward and
got licensing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're here to support.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're based out in Nevada City.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy to have anybody come in and talk to
any of us about ways that we can plug in
[SPEAKER_02]: together and integrate your farms and with
all of the sales and the supply chain
[SPEAKER_02]: efforts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.
