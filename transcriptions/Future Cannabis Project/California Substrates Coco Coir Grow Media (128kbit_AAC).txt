[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be taking a look at root
systems in California substrate's coir and
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the things first we're going to see
is that this particular pot here will have
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit of a mass of root on that part
and if we go to the other side much less.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because in this particular instance
we had a drip that was pretty much only on
[SPEAKER_00]: one side and if we take a look at this one
I believe here we look at it and the root
[SPEAKER_00]: system is much more even all the way
around and it's not like we had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different drippers in there is basically
just two, one on each side so the
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution of water was more completely
even in the nutrient system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we're going to do is we're going
to take one of these pots and cut it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a machete here because we're going
to find that the root system throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole pot is relatively even.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see I'm in the mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to try the saw bit just to get
through this one bit of a root I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we're through down to the bottom and
if we can look on here we've got fine
[SPEAKER_00]: roots sitting all through the middle of
the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't gone sent out big roots right
to the outside edge and wrapped all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got just a fine network of roots
around there and that is because the coir
[SPEAKER_00]: has such a good air fill porosity in it
and the other thing that it has is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: it distributes the water very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It absorbs and moves sideways so you get a
reasonably equal amount of water all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way around it and you have the roots
growing through the inside because it has
[SPEAKER_00]: that good air fill porosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is yeah it's got a nice look
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could grow a lot longer in this
because the root system certainly has a
[SPEAKER_00]: great deal more air or room that it could
be using in there and through the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: it would get thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen plants that have grown in a pot
a couple of years because they used to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow roses and you'd have them in there
the root system so thick you could just
[SPEAKER_00]: barely stick a watering pick into the
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will continue to grow and have
roots and not really look to go anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: else as long as you are providing the
amount of water and nutrients that they
[SPEAKER_00]: want right where their root system is and
it will grow that dense if you allow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at using coir versus soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil the variabilities in soil are well
they're quite there's quite a bit of it
[SPEAKER_00]: but there is in coir also though the soil
having micronutrients in it and different
[SPEAKER_00]: things is is a difficulty because you
never know exactly what you have and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going to be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have more organics more different
chemicals I guess you'd say it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: really chemicals as we think of them
because usually think then of man-made
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals but these are natural chemicals
that appear in the soil and they will
[SPEAKER_00]: interfere with the way different nutrients
are available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get into coir most coir is not or
I shouldn't say most coir is not buffered
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say a lot of it is but if
you get it that coir that isn't buffered
[SPEAKER_00]: the and has a very large canine exchange
capacity very heavily loaded with sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: and potassium and when you first start
feeding this plant your nutrients is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to the the coir is going to start using
the calcium and magnesium on on the
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange sites or draw it onto the
exchange sites where this potassium and
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium is and as it attaches the calcium
and magnesium it will kick off the
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium and sodium and your nutrients
become out of balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potassium is not too bad although when
you get too much potassium it then tends
[SPEAKER_00]: to inhibit the uptake of other positive
ions such as your calcium magnesium iron a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of your your nutrients are on the
positive side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sodium is the other thing that gets kicked
off of the the canine exchange capacity it
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually be quite detrimental to
growth of plants even as low as 12 parts
[SPEAKER_00]: per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different plants different species are
have different tolerances for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why if you get into a coir that has
been buffered then you get into something
[SPEAKER_00]: that has already begun to exchange or
change the canine exchange capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: getting rid of the potassium and sodium
and already having attached the calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will give you a coir that has less of
a problem changing your or doesn't change
[SPEAKER_00]: your nutrient system so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: However most of the coirs that have been
buffered are not buffered completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: They leave really quite a large amount of
the potassium sodium on the exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they will do is oftentimes in the
last part of their processing give it a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge hit of calcium nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very short period of time 10-15
minutes and then it's washed out and then
[SPEAKER_00]: dried and packaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: California substrates use as a much longer
method of buffering their product and
[SPEAKER_00]: using a heavier dose of magnesium and
calcium to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we bring the can exchange capacity much
more fully loaded with calcium magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: very little potassium to be kicked off by
your nutrient system very little sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: and because we have done it that far
usually it won't interfere with your
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient system at all or the nutrient
that you are providing the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When looking at different types of coir
that you might buy there's quite a range
[SPEAKER_00]: in prices that you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all cheap coir is cheap and nasty not
all top end or top price coir is
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately good if you need to ultimately
all that worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you need to do is know a bit about
what you're looking for in coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cheapest of them is going to be
probably come without any buffering and
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly at this stage even without any
washing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The EC is going to be two or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't notice anything about the
buffering until you start to feed it and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're going to notice that you're
going to run out of calcium magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are going to work very poorly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may turn yellow and virtually just
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: California substrates coir it has a it has
been buffered.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a about 80 90 percent of the fines
have been taken out of it so that as we
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at this air this root system that
we had down here and we got the roots all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way through it that's because we've
taken a lot of the fine material out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the coir and you continue to get a air
space throughout the whole root ball and
[SPEAKER_00]: so the the plant can use the whole of the
root ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have that oftentimes what you
find is you got this root mass and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just winding around the outside and it
doesn't really matter how much is on the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside it's just not using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no air space in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots need air as much as they do
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always hear about people saying
something was over watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having too much water is not so much of a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not having enough air is more so.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say too much water it's not enough
air and that's where that comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where that that will go down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're out there looking for a coir
you ask a few questions and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: very good things about it there's a few of
them out there that have taken the finer
[SPEAKER_00]: material out of there not many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't do it because it costs quite a
bit to the manufacturer to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes out maybe 20 percent of the
volume of the coir so right at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning it costs whoever it is that's
making it 20 percent more because they get
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 percent less to to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing is going to be the
buffering process that they use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hear a lot of things about which is
better one way or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try them side-by-side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Side-by-side tests are the one thing that
will tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say doesn't need CalMag in our growing
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had many people try it and grow it
that way and it actually does not need to
[SPEAKER_00]: have any CalMag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it side-by-side.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality of coir can make such a
difference in the way your growth
[SPEAKER_00]: proceeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everything works just the way you're
supposed to just the way you're the way
[SPEAKER_00]: you planned it to do then everything will
work out and your plants will come through
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll grow what seems to be the best
you could have done.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have things that happen to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You forgot to do one thing or another or
the wind came through and blew something
[SPEAKER_00]: over or electricity went out for a couple
hours and nothing something didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you begin to know the
difference between a better quality and a
[SPEAKER_00]: less quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You run a side-by-side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had one happen where we had two rows of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One in California substrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: One in the local best-selling coir that
was in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going through it there was an incident
that happened with the nutrient system and
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of it we had the California
substrates coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the plants were sitting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were looking happy in the opposing
coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were 50% dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked weak and just brown and just
laying over and it's until you run into
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those instances before that you may
think yes everything is going well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do a side-by-side everything works
just the way it's supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still going to notice a difference
in a better quality of coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will let your plants grow more to their
fullest capabilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mistakes that happen they will point
out the difference between failing and
[SPEAKER_00]: growing but it's when everything works
when you do a side-by-side then you begin
[SPEAKER_00]: to see the actual quality of what the coir
will do because a good quality coir should
[SPEAKER_00]: allow that plant to outperform a poor
quality coir no matter what the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions or what happens during the
whole cycle of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we say with California
substrates feed your weed not your cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give the plants what they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a cocoa that allows the plant to use
what you're giving them and not to be
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusting it because the cocoa needs the
calcium magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: How I got into using cocoa and working
with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started out growing I grew roses first
in soil in a bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bed was prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were growing well because we had dug
a trench in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a tile in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put sand over the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pea rock over the top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they prepared soil over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the drainage we wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got everything that we wanted in the
proper ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought we were doing quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we went into hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using cocoa, using rockwool, and
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came out of the ground immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't change anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a 20% 25% change in production.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kept numbers on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specific numbers by variety of roses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw the difference in growth right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first started working with cocoa,
it was kind of the oldest, cheapest,
[SPEAKER_00]: nastiest stuff you can find around these
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were growing in using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still outperformed soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We began taking water samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would take a water sample of the drain
water coming out of these every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would send it in and have it examined.
[SPEAKER_00]: We began to notice that the calcium that
we were feeding was at about 200 parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was coming out was less than 10 parts
per million of calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did was we upped the calcium by
about 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went up to 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: No difference in the change in the amount
of calcium that was coming through the
[SPEAKER_00]: coir in the drain water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went up to another, I think we doubled
it after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been about 600.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say I think because this was 15 years
ago or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everything is remembered exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the extra calcium again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still got no difference in the
drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might have went from 10% to 15%,
but essentially nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That went on for about six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shortly after that, we began looking at
different ways we could treat coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I left the employment of a rose range
and went to work for a coir company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We began looking at how we could treat
coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going into Sri Lanka and India,
looking at how they made this stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: how they processed it, and gradually began
working with sieving material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought out different grades of
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, we were working not
necessarily use coir only, but mixing with
[SPEAKER_00]: perlite and having something that was more
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a grade that we called a three to
six.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was everything that was three mils and
under had been sieved out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything six mils and over had been
sieved out as a dry material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made a very nice thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually was a little bit too much on
the dry side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was through these processes of working
out different grades of coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: What could be done with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then also working on adding the different
nutrients into the system while we were in
[SPEAKER_00]: the country of origin that we fell into.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually a process of thinking
about and running testing and seeing how
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be done and how long it would
take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working with coir in trying to
perfect the way to do it for 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started back in probably 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't really start working in a coir
company until about 2000, 2001.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working on improving coir
since.
[SPEAKER_00]: At California Stub Straits, we believe
that they're continually improving coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: We believe also that what we need to do is
take out the things that are not good for
[SPEAKER_00]: the growth or not positive in the coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking out the fines, correcting the can
exchange capacity by getting rid of the
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium and the sodium so that you as a
grower don't have to correct those
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies in the coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also believe that there are going to be
more things that we will have to improve
[SPEAKER_00]: coir and it will get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a process of continual improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perlite is a mix in your cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the cocoa has been treated properly and
come to you, you shouldn't need anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California Stub Straits, we're quite
adamant the fact that you don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need hydroton or anything else
added as far as giving you airspace.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use perlite, you'll notice that the
roots within your growing media will tend
[SPEAKER_00]: to migrate to where there is air.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, where there's air when you're
adding perlite or other things that add
[SPEAKER_00]: air fill to your media, you don't find
nutrient there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look again in our root ball,
we don't have perlite or anything into
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but we've got root system
everywhere through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because there's air and nutrients
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have perlite in there, you're going
to find the roots are going to come to the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside because there's air there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very minimal nutrient because it only then
has the nutrient on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outside, of course, is where the pot
is and there's no nutrient out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would also find that if you had
perlite through there, the roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fine roots where most of your nutrient
is being up taken, especially the
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients, the fine roots are going
to gravitate toward where the perlite is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, no nutrient there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be air there,
but no nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will find the roots get to there and
there's nothing they can do except to go
[SPEAKER_00]: back out into the void where the air
isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using coir, it works in all situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have indoor growers with computers and
everything around them to keep everything
[SPEAKER_00]: just the way the grower wants it to an
outdoor grow where we're out open to the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing nice looking weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got nice size buds on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using California substrates coir,
these particular ones are in three gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three gallon pots will grow a very
nice plant and it can be quite large.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find that outdoors, it's a little bit
top heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have a system of supporting the tops
of the plants, they can remain upright and
[SPEAKER_00]: have less problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're thinking maybe the thing to do is
going to be some larger pots so they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get quite so top heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other would be to put a stake along
them to tie them down so they can't go
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are methods to helping a difficulty
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very usable media.
[SPEAKER_00]: In pretty much any type of a setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're under lights in a warehouse or
in a plastic structure, it can do whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can grow as big a plant as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The size of the pot is not any restriction
on how big the plant can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big the plant can get is really based
upon how you provide nutrients and how you
[SPEAKER_00]: provide the water that the plant needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can provide nutrients and water in
short bursts all day long, you could grow
[SPEAKER_00]: an eight, 10 foot plant in a one gallon
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have to be supplying water as
quickly as that plant is using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have less and less of a buffer system
so that when the water is done,
[SPEAKER_00]: how long before the water and nutrient is
used up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger the pot you have, the bigger
the buffer system you have for that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to get through an oops thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lack of water, something happens and you
can't get the water to them at a moment
[SPEAKER_00]: when they need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Electricity goes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that comes to mind.
