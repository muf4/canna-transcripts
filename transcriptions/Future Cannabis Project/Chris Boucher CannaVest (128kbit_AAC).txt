[SPEAKER_00]: Canavest, we're a publicly traded company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run a vertical operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our motto is from seed to shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically our business model is that we
grow all of the hemp, about 3,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: We contract the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We process it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We turn it into oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is hemp grown outside the U.S.,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, currently right now in the
Netherlands, Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got about 3,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: But currently we actually have some
research projects growing in Kentucky,
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Kentucky and Murray State.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're looking at the economics there
on growing stateside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our goal is to bring the European
model here to the United States and
[SPEAKER_00]: kickstart the industrial hemp revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is the European model?
[SPEAKER_00]: The European model is on an economic scale
in terms of the viability of the economic
[SPEAKER_00]: price points.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's basically been in the,
we'll call it like the micro brew or the
[SPEAKER_00]: home brew type industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you're going to see a big
switch from the home-based business in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis hemp sector to a large scale
operation with, like I said, thousands and
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of acres, which will basically
bring the price down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it's affordable and you'll get a
much larger market share.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of where our philosophy
lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sell bulk wholesale.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of our foundational parts of
our business model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides the vertical integration of
farming it, we in turn take the bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: wholesale and we sell to other
entrepreneurs, other businesses around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way they're developing their
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're entering the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do take a market share.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time we produce our own
finished label called Plus CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a line of capsules, pills,
tinctures, you know, a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: supplements and nutritional products that
we manufacture.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time we are competing against
some of our own customers, but I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace is wide enough and the market
share that there's plenty of room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the way it's going, the market has
just expanded, I would say from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, half a million dollars four
years ago to probably, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: well over a hundred million dollars this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's quite a jump and
we're going to see it get a lot bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to federal law, the Farming Act
of 2014 legalizes industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is industrial hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: And according to the federal government,
it's a cannabis sativa plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: registers 0.3 percent THC per plant or
less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by having that marker, it basically
determines that this plant is not
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it like the poppy seed bagel
theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you buy a poppy seed,
there's opiates in those poppy seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not enough to cause any type of,
you know, psychological activity or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it's derived from industrial hemp,
I like to call it agricultural hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word industrial kind of skews it in
terms of its environmental qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, industrial hemp, as long as it's
from that certified seed, there's about 60
[SPEAKER_00]: or 70 different certified varieties that
the United States recognizes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: legal in Canada and Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the great assets of the legal
opinion of CBD being legal in all 50
[SPEAKER_00]: states is that the trace parts of THC make
it legal so we can sell it in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, health food stores and retail
stores across America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're in all 50 states.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gets bigger and bigger the more
people find out about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course we can't make any claims of,
you know, medical value whatsoever,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the testimonials and the people out
there in the space that are using the CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: is just, it's astronomical the testimonies
that are coming from people that have
[SPEAKER_00]: changed their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: For it to be completely legal,
you know, first off, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it needs to be removed from schedule one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, depending on who is looking at
the law, according to the DEA and some
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of the federal government,
it's still schedule one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a few senators and
congresspeople right now that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: bills going on that want to remove
cannabis, sativa, from schedule one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it opens it up to the banking
sector, the investment, Wall Street,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll just see, you know,
a much quicker, faster growth for the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the future as legislation
becomes more important, especially here in
[SPEAKER_00]: California and other states, there'll be
much more clarity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now there's a little cloudy on
legal interpretations and I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the next step that really needs to be
clarified and made 100% illegal and that
[SPEAKER_00]: way 100% legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that right there, the clarity is
going to really make more, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: economic sense for people to invest in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way there's no risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality of the products from,
you know, all different sectors,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all the different manufacturers,
you know, I think in a new industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, people have to become compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to follow compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulation laws, you know, the products
that you manufacture, especially our
[SPEAKER_00]: products at Cannabest, we run GMP
facilities, which is a good manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically standardized that if,
like, you're selling a vitamin to a health
[SPEAKER_00]: food store, it has to meet certain
standards and operating procedures for it
[SPEAKER_00]: to be safe for people to consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the real issue that
maybe you're looking at there is,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, how do you bring everyone into
compliance and, you know, that's what the
[SPEAKER_00]: FDA is there for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where different herbal
associations, they, you know, basically
[SPEAKER_00]: are educating people on how to package and
process their products in a safe manner
[SPEAKER_00]: that's clean, healthy, and safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the real issue that
maybe you're looking at.
