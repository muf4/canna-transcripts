[SPEAKER_00]: My skill set was in fixing fucked up
operations because I could build an op and
[SPEAKER_00]: I could put the genetics in it and I could
tell you where to sell it and I could get
[SPEAKER_00]: it to happen and so people would have me
come in and just work on these giant
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking illegal operations to modernize
them and get them up to the money they
[SPEAKER_00]: should be making and then I didn't have to
have the infrastructure I could just get
[SPEAKER_00]: paid to come in make money and then leave
and it was nice and I was a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: consultant and I had such a good life
because of it that I was like man this is
[SPEAKER_00]: my thing I create I build I grow I do and
then I get into legal cannabis and I
[SPEAKER_00]: realized honestly that I was gonna have to
compete with 11 different people people
[SPEAKER_00]: who build scenes people that have PhD
teams and microbots all of a sudden you
[SPEAKER_00]: get Elaine Ingham fucking with your soil
so you're a soil wizard but all of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden they hire Dr. Elaine and all of a
sudden you're not as smart as you used to
[SPEAKER_00]: be so I realized I'm not Dr. Elaine and
I'm not the Dutch consulting company
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm not doing greenhouse ranges up
to a million square feet and I'm not a
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting company and I'm not who am I oh
I'm a fucking market analysis so I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: shifted out of being specific on a thing
that I used to do and became specific on a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that I believed I could do really
well that you couldn't compete with me and
[SPEAKER_00]: using any new technology or your PhD
because you'd have to have a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: career hustling degree to get this one so
I found out where my lane was and I stayed
[SPEAKER_00]: there and then I just make sure that I
detour off of it so I can go see how do we
[SPEAKER_00]: still build how do we still grow and I
still grow and I still do all this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't delve into it so deeply
because I can mine the material now too
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like a microbe or something kids
and cookies and I use the skills that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have which is I think I think I've been
historically accurate on where the
[SPEAKER_00]: market's going with what they use and the
people that have worked with me over time
[SPEAKER_00]: have made money and so you can that's how
you measure your business successes how
[SPEAKER_00]: much money did your business make
downstream a fuck what was your real
[SPEAKER_00]: impact in the in the industry you were in
it was fucking big so therefore I know I
[SPEAKER_00]: must be on point there you have to have an
end game and so for me I said I got you if
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna get into this new industrial
world of cannabis I saw this 11 12 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago I said if this is what the new world's
gonna look like in my opinion then let's
[SPEAKER_00]: be real clear here can you compete with a
PhD team from Cornell no no you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna fuck with people who study in the
microbe their whole life that's what they
[SPEAKER_00]: do take them out of that room they can't
fucking tie their shoes but in that room
[SPEAKER_00]: they're deadly and so I said all right I
can't be those people I can't be this
[SPEAKER_00]: person and I can't be that person I could
only be that the person that I am and I
[SPEAKER_00]: started to really take a look honestly and
determine who was that person and what I
[SPEAKER_00]: said was I got you man I got all these
other skills but the real skill is that I
[SPEAKER_00]: see the problem and that I can chase the
solution and if I could just do that then
[SPEAKER_00]: it would allow me to make the transition I
needed and while I'm doing it I'll build
[SPEAKER_00]: operations that let me have an opportunity
to make tangents so you have to have more
[SPEAKER_00]: than one situation because if you get
screwed as a farmer that means you failed
[SPEAKER_00]: well if you have a store no you didn't
fail you just you just shrink down the
[SPEAKER_00]: farm and if the store doesn't work then
you can use the farm and if you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: the nursery then you still can succeed and
if you can use a mix light or you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution something you have to have
multiple permits in hand and I always akin
[SPEAKER_00]: it to your mechanic and all you have is an
adjustable wrench so it works great until
[SPEAKER_00]: you get to a fucking Allen wrench and now
you're not even in mechanic work anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: so you have to have a toolbox with enough
tools to handle enough basic stuff so that
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what problem you're working on
you have the tool needed to help you solve
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem and because of that you're no
longer any of these people so I'm someone
[SPEAKER_00]: who runs all these operations but I'm
really not any of them anymore I'm all of
[SPEAKER_00]: them and none of them and for me what it
is is it's a survival technique of you
[SPEAKER_00]: better do all of this stuff all the time
continuously to see the interrelationship
[SPEAKER_00]: between them so you know how to move with
this thing because farmers are always like
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to do and the stores are
like I don't know what to do but if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have all the pieces in front of you you
have a kind of decent idea of how they
[SPEAKER_00]: work so you can better see what to do and
I wish I had a better plan it was easier
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was a busy one I mean I burned a
lot of mental hours over these years
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure out how do you do it and
then I just realized that if I released
[SPEAKER_00]: the information as I was doing it whether
I was winning or losing it would let
[SPEAKER_00]: people benefit from it and the people that
would benefit would be the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: were coming into the industry that were
going to populate the world around me so
[SPEAKER_00]: that when I was in my 60s I had people
that had been brought in and had been able
[SPEAKER_00]: to get kind of caught up and I got the
info in this manner this was how we
[SPEAKER_00]: behaved my introduction to 215 is through
like Dennis Perrone where I was an early
[SPEAKER_00]: 215 individual and I realized when I
looked at what Dennis was doing I said
[SPEAKER_00]: whoa he's doing something so elegant
because he's helping people who don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to help themselves and he's
not trying to gain some kind of fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: social credit from it it's genuine and I
said that's possible I said it when I'm in
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis that's how I'll behave
when I'm in hustle cannabis I'll do hustle
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis but if it's medical cannabis I'll
make sure I copy somebody that I respected
[SPEAKER_00]: because I thought it was just such a kind
human beautiful thing to see so I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: that if I could if I could succeed or I
could achieve and I was able to share the
[SPEAKER_00]: information I was able to help people out
then what I would do is I would I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recreate that same thing that happened to
me that somebody who I didn't know did
[SPEAKER_00]: something and I ended up meeting them I
end up getting to know them but when I
[SPEAKER_00]: started it was not that it was really just
knowing that this was possible it had been
[SPEAKER_00]: done and it had a huge impact and so why
couldn't I have that impact why couldn't I
[SPEAKER_00]: also do something beautiful and it adds a
value to your life that you just really
[SPEAKER_00]: can't calculate because it's it's a human
thing and you have to you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that because at some point in
time you will become older and the people
[SPEAKER_00]: who follow you you're basically trying to
create a link in a chain that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: connect to and if it's a good fucking link
man they're gonna stay connected and what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens is you end up really changing a
model and you end up developing people
[SPEAKER_00]: that you never wildest dreams realize they
were going to be that successful and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're able to be part of something that's
perpetual because you're the one that lit
[SPEAKER_00]: that fucking fire and put the wood in the
oven they baked that cake you part of that
[SPEAKER_00]: process and I just I just believe that
that's the only way to survive this shit I
[SPEAKER_00]: just didn't I sat down and thought I mean
I'm pretty good with a plan and I sat down
[SPEAKER_00]: and I said I can't outrun this problem I
don't have enough money for the next 60
[SPEAKER_00]: years because I was in my 40s then right
so I'm like do I got 60 years worth of
[SPEAKER_00]: money no that's a lot of fucking money and
can I make 60 years worth of money in a
[SPEAKER_00]: decade because I figured in a decade the
game would be over and it was about 13
[SPEAKER_00]: years so I was three years off on the pace
but I said no because any problem that
[SPEAKER_00]: happens will take me right out and if I
get one legal case I'll go I'll go blow a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple hundred grand to fight it because
you don't want to go to prison and miss
[SPEAKER_00]: the game completely so therefore how am I
gonna do this and I'm gonna need to have
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll need 11 million dollars to last that
long I said am I gonna make 11 million
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars over the next year and bank it no
no not in what we're doing unless we go so
[SPEAKER_00]: huge that we put ourselves in this
unbelievably risky position and so I just
[SPEAKER_00]: said I can't outrun the problem so I said
I'm just gonna figure out how to how to
[SPEAKER_00]: change and go into the future and I said
I'll just use the skill sets but what I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: do is I'll bring with me some stuff that I
think was important so that the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that follow me they didn't have to get
fucked around I didn't have to you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: pay your dues and I'm like you don't pay
your dues means be fucking be polite
[SPEAKER_00]: basically some said why did you give him
that plant I said because he was polite
[SPEAKER_00]: and he asked nicely and he wanted it for
to succeed yeah but they're gonna use it
[SPEAKER_00]: make money exactly that was that's what I
hope they do with it because otherwise
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have any money and for you you
having money and them not having money is
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of form of success or safety but
it's the opposite everyone around you paid
[SPEAKER_00]: is a much better life this I know when all
your friends have money you do you all are
[SPEAKER_00]: living better all your kids do better your
grandkids do better the neighbors do
[SPEAKER_00]: better because there's a higher level of
charity when blue-collar people have money
[SPEAKER_00]: and I learned that from career dope game
that the best charity I ever saw was from
[SPEAKER_00]: people who really were getting paid more
than they deserved as far as society was
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned it were way nicer and the people
who got all the money that society said
[SPEAKER_00]: should have it didn't share much they
share it when they're old and they give
[SPEAKER_00]: away a stipend to some organization we did
grassroots work and it created a way way
[SPEAKER_00]: better lifestyle for all of us in a sense
that I've never locked my door at my house
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have fucking house keys I have
keys and shit for everything else I touch
[SPEAKER_00]: but I never locked my fucking door I
locked my living room at night because my
[SPEAKER_00]: daughter likes to sleep on the couch now
right so I locked the door because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: afraid someone gonna steal my kid but I
don't lock the back door I just locked the
[SPEAKER_00]: one next to her but I've never locked it
with the key I don't have house keys
[SPEAKER_00]: because no one's ever robbing our houses
you know it used to be golden in that form
[SPEAKER_00]: and and you know things are changing in
the in the economy and in regions but man
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to see this incredible thing in
person and I said listen I said I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: try to bring that forward with me into
this new world of cannabis and now we're
[SPEAKER_00]: into this world of cannabis and this one's
a strange one because everybody that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to me now I'm good at picking it up I'm
good at picking up what your intent is and
[SPEAKER_00]: so everybody think they clever and they
come and ask you questions but I can tell
[SPEAKER_02]: by the question you ask what you're trying
to get so on that note seen like since
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization the economy and Humboldt has
been hurting like local businesses lose
[SPEAKER_02]: two-thirds of their revenue that's real
and what do you think like what do you
[SPEAKER_02]: think about that and do you think what are
you trying to create here with what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing you're giving people food I mean I
don't know this is a team effort but you
[SPEAKER_02]: were here put setting up chairs you know
and you believe this is something that
[SPEAKER_02]: people are coming from all over the world
to experience and you know what do you
[SPEAKER_02]: what do you hope what do you see how do
you see that correcting well the first
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the question is economy is getting
hammered but so much of it is because the
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals that were here that were able
to support local stores are having
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible problems getting licensed and by
the time you're done with licensing you're
[SPEAKER_00]: financially broken and it's tough and
people in the mainstream don't understand
[SPEAKER_00]: that the level of problem because to them
to get a business license is cheap and you
[SPEAKER_00]: just do some simple shit but tell me you
want to start a you know a chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: reclamation lab and now you're going to
have a tremendous amount of hearings and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have all kinds of zoning
well that's all of us that were in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is all of a sudden we're finding
we don't have the abilities and tools so
[SPEAKER_00]: you wiping out the local monies which then
make the stores had no longer people can
[SPEAKER_00]: shop and because we don't have enough
population here is a total it impacts them
[SPEAKER_00]: greatly this situation is I didn't put
this on not I was honored to be asked to
[SPEAKER_00]: be part of it and I even told him I don't
think I'm qualified because I'm not a
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative wizard like I understand the
concept but I am definitely a junior high
[SPEAKER_00]: school student in a room full of PhDs but
they said hey that's not why we're asking
[SPEAKER_00]: you what we're asking you do is do a
lecture on marketing on genetic choices
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you classify cannabis how do you
put it into categories so that you're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually have product differentiation
and then could you bring in all the
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic people you work with all over the
all over the world so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: interview them so that people can start to
see how they got their creativity what
[SPEAKER_00]: drives them what directions are they going
and I said hey I'm down I can do that so I
[SPEAKER_00]: get to be part of an incredible event
where what you're seeing is how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: create a craft model because cannabis to
me right now is all the same shit thrown
[SPEAKER_00]: in a box without without the mega
operations you can't have craft because
[SPEAKER_00]: their comparison contrast you can't have
love without hate otherwise it did their
[SPEAKER_00]: book their book ends so without one there
isn't another it can't be all one thing or
[SPEAKER_00]: it would just be wouldn't be called to be
called a normal so it would be a thing we
[SPEAKER_00]: define it we instantly limit it well when
you start to have commercial then you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to have craft because you have a clear
differentiation of what is craft and these
[SPEAKER_00]: are the models that really are going to
work and and for the first time you know
[SPEAKER_00]: you're really getting an incredible
cross-section of the population to come in
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's all these individuals that are
I call them biologically based but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: all getting together to share info share
the experience to question and argue out
[SPEAKER_00]: fine details of accuracy and I think what
happens is it allows you to start to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get groups together in the room
there's almost 200 people standing there
[SPEAKER_00]: it lets you get together and then now you
have community as cultivators that lets
[SPEAKER_00]: you start to have a voice and we know the
products better but the the main point the
[SPEAKER_00]: main point is that the cultivators start
to see each other they start to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: share this information you start to be
able to create a true culture that then
[SPEAKER_00]: makes an attraction for other people to
want to participate and the customer
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to be able to have a choice to pick
up product so say say 20 these farms run
[SPEAKER_00]: similar material it allows them to have
similar material throughout the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: fiscal year all of it done probiotically
all of it done regeneratively all of it
[SPEAKER_00]: done excuse me in an organic methodology
so the customer gets to have killer shit
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time and it allows all of us to
move forward so you may not have an
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to put enough product that you
made to cover entire years worth of sales
[SPEAKER_00]: on a quick pace but together as a group we
do and then that lets the mainstream start
[SPEAKER_00]: to experience these type of products
consistently and it's the consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure that gets them to want to do it
because pretty soon you just say hey that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit's better and I'm gonna go find it and
if it's available and it's convenient then
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an easy sale and if you make it to
where there's only X amount that comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: all year you have to make them remember
you and how do you make them remember you
[SPEAKER_00]: when you don't have a marketing budget big
enough to sink an ad through the nine
[SPEAKER_00]: months you're not selling herb so you have
to have other people succeeding using the
[SPEAKER_00]: same methodology so that people start to
become comfortable with sun-grown
[SPEAKER_00]: biologically based sustainable cultivation
and you're not trying to tax them
[SPEAKER_00]: excessively for that privilege you're
trying to give it to them at the fairest
[SPEAKER_00]: price you can so that what happens is
there's actually a competition that's
[SPEAKER_00]: possible because if you try to make them
pay too much money you start to make
[SPEAKER_00]: people feel that they're getting peeled
and it's easier to not go that route it's
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to make it competitive and then get
the share and then you're able to start
[SPEAKER_00]: educating the public because they're then
curious because why they want to know why
[SPEAKER_00]: they like your product but if you're
trying to tell them this is why you should
[SPEAKER_00]: like it they want to argue because people
don't like to be told what to do and so
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to be really intelligent with how
you approach this because fundamentally we
[SPEAKER_00]: as career smokers know that bio pot is
better and as somebody who's
[SPEAKER_00]: environmentally conscious we know that
it's better but the question is how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: get the mainstream to understand it and it
has to be through exposure and then
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure lets them get in get access
access gives enjoyment enjoyment gives
[SPEAKER_00]: curiosity as to why and now you get
education but people want to educate well
[SPEAKER_00]: who the fuck wants who wants to know
what's the point educationally comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: desire and so you got to give them the
desire then they'll get the education and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you'll start to have the loop where
you start to have individuals who only buy
[SPEAKER_00]: these kind of products the desire because
what you're giving them is a better
[SPEAKER_01]: product because what you're what you're
going to do is you're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to put products on the table
and so what I know is a good example is
[SPEAKER_00]: Las Vegas where Las Vegas is an aggressive
model but my friend Steve Cantwell has got
[SPEAKER_00]: a successful business doing the no-till
indoor so he uses an indoor model because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's too hot in the desert but his flower
is better than the chem-driven flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: he's pricing it at a fair price so that
this way what it is is a choice once you
[SPEAKER_00]: consume it there's no way you can deny
that it's not a better product and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you go whoa that was really good product
and then you go seek it out again and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you say well you know what let me go try
something else and you go hey that's
[SPEAKER_00]: flavorless let me go back to his stuff
it's rich let me go try something else
[SPEAKER_00]: it's flavorless let me go back to his shit
it's rich and all of a sudden it becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: apparent and if you're able to work in
this direction where for Steve because he
[SPEAKER_00]: was the first and he's running it but now
there's other no-till people pretty soon
[SPEAKER_00]: you can have people come into dispensaries
and say I'd like to get no if you guys get
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor you got any no-till indoor do you
have any farms that are tied into the DEM
[SPEAKER_00]: network do you have any farms that are
that are known for regenerative you have
[SPEAKER_00]: farms that are known for biologically
based stuff you got sun-grown out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the Sierras you got sun-grown out
of Mendo you got some killer sun-grown out
[SPEAKER_00]: of Humboldt what do you got from that
thing because they know from experiencing
[SPEAKER_00]: it that's what they like but the only way
to do that is to get enough product on the
[SPEAKER_00]: table to make it happen and the only way
it can happen for us as smaller canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: guys is if you're working in this this
collective model and I and I the words the
[SPEAKER_00]: words become their own word we're all of a
sudden everyone sees collective and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like oh fuck we're all tied
together but it just means we're all in
[SPEAKER_00]: the same production methodologies and
we're able to create a situation that
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits all of us because when I buy your
product I go oh this is good product it
[SPEAKER_00]: lets me want to try his product and when I
try his product they go hey this is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: sun-grown product too and in a minute
you'll be able to see this clearly because
[SPEAKER_00]: when you start to have education like this
you start to be able to get your inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: down to where sixty percent less cost to
grow the product that's six that's that's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of money so if it took you a hundred
dollars to grow your pound and only took
[SPEAKER_00]: me forty dollars to grow mine I can
literally take that sixty bucks that I
[SPEAKER_00]: saved and take it off of my top end still
make the same margin still make the same
[SPEAKER_00]: profit but I'm out competing you through
efficiency and that's what these larger
[SPEAKER_00]: operations are trying to do is they're
going to try to come at us with efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're going to come at us with
efficiency through shitty product and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the problem is that there is there
they're going to have an ocean of this
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out but the ultimately for people
who consume cannabis if you give them the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to experience good herb they
remember it and when they smoke other they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't like it they remember I didn't like
it and so I think that these events get
[SPEAKER_00]: the people together so that you unitize a
production style in a cultural style but
[SPEAKER_00]: you're you're able to start also getting
enough people together to where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: have events you can have meetings you can
have farming yep anything that lets you
[SPEAKER_00]: have access to the public things that
start to do great grading to where people
[SPEAKER_00]: can start to understand what are the
different grades of cannabis because all
[SPEAKER_00]: of a sudden the information is going to
want to be there because the people are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be into it without the stigma all
of a sudden you're free to learn as you
[SPEAKER_00]: choose and so the mainstream people didn't
want to get so caught up in it because
[SPEAKER_00]: they like look we can't celebrate our love
of weed because it'll fuck up our lives
[SPEAKER_00]: but now it has no impact in that form so
they can also now do their thing and so
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden you're going to see some
housewives that have been growing
[SPEAKER_00]: marigolds that are going to punch out some
cannabis out of their organic backyards
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to blow your mind in a minute
now they can only grow six you know in the
[SPEAKER_00]: legal but you're going to see to me a
radical change in the appreciation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product once people get a chance to really
check it out and hopefully you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: that drives people into Humboldt County
and places like this Richardson Grove
[SPEAKER_00]: where they go camp and then from here you
can have some farm touring you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: meet the farmer events you can have people
get exposed to cannabis from people who
[SPEAKER_00]: career who do it you can have seminars
like this but you just turn the volume
[SPEAKER_00]: down a little meaning you don't go so deep
into the science you go into an
[SPEAKER_00]: introductory level and then you could have
courses like this for people who are more
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced but for the general public you
make it you make it easy so they can you
[SPEAKER_00]: can learn some fundamentals about what it
is they're consuming why they consume it
[SPEAKER_00]: why they like it what what is these
constituents you bring in turp people that
[SPEAKER_00]: can explain these things have these
effects on you that's why so they start to
[SPEAKER_00]: know why they like what they like you get
cannabinoid experts to come in to explain
[SPEAKER_00]: to them why these ratios seem to work well
for you why you need to be aware of some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these things and how some of these
things don't matter because this
[SPEAKER_00]: information most of it isn't out what you
have is you have information that's used
[SPEAKER_00]: is basically marketing it's kind of like
reading old high times because I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: read this shit in years it's like reading
high times and every article was basically
[SPEAKER_00]: to sell the material on the next page so
they're not giving you any information
[SPEAKER_00]: they're giving you a marketing pitch
wrapped around some photos so the problem
[SPEAKER_00]: is you're not really getting true info
you're getting marketing and what people
[SPEAKER_00]: need is true info because that's what's
going to resonate and I think in these
[SPEAKER_00]: could this kind of community that's what
you get and when people come to hang out
[SPEAKER_00]: and experience that type of situation
their their education level skyrockets and
[SPEAKER_00]: their appreciation of cannabis culture
skyrockets and it means that they'll take
[SPEAKER_00]: the time to ask the person at the counter
could you direct me into something like
[SPEAKER_00]: this because the person at the counter
who's the lowest paid person in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary is the gatekeeper to every one
of your farm successes and people treat
[SPEAKER_00]: that person like shit and everybody always
wants to say they're under-educated they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know how to appreciate my shit and
I'm like no you're not making it easy for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to sell your shit they don't need to
have this ungodly education on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: that you do because you used to get paid
400,000 a year to have that education they
[SPEAKER_00]: get paid 15 an hour so you're you're
you're believing that they should have the
[SPEAKER_00]: same motivation you do because you made
eight times their fucking paycheck well it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't work like that these people are
coming in for jobs and they want to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: good job but they're under an unbelievable
amount of pressure from customers to make
[SPEAKER_00]: choices and how could you possibly know
the product from 400 farms well and then
[SPEAKER_00]: know everything that's coming out and know
everything about cannabinoids everything
[SPEAKER_00]: about terpenoids and about the inner relax
it just it's impossible for someone at
[SPEAKER_00]: that price level of pay to have invested
that much time in cannabis science
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah it'd be a plumber but the what he
does know is where the plumbing material
[SPEAKER_00]: is located and he knows enough to help you
understand hey when people come in they
[SPEAKER_00]: seem to buy this so when I go into
dispensaries I'll go I'll go talk to the
[SPEAKER_00]: person if I even shop at a dispensary I'll
go ask the person at the dispensary all
[SPEAKER_00]: right I'm looking at 300 choices you know
what give me something gassy right and
[SPEAKER_00]: then give me something fruity and then
give me something that you like yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: what are you into and they go all right
well this one right here seems to be
[SPEAKER_00]: moving with a lot of good feedback so
here's your gassy one we got a good good
[SPEAKER_00]: this at that time it was a face-off oh gee
I bought and then we got some killer
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry pie that was done out of this or
this organic farm out of the sea out of
[SPEAKER_00]: this place it was nasty he goes but I like
this weird shit where it has this crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: spicy tone it gives you this really
interesting high I said boom I'll try that
[SPEAKER_00]: because it gives them things that are
moving through observation and then what's
[SPEAKER_00]: his favorite based off of what he likes or
in her case it was a girl and it allows
[SPEAKER_00]: you to be able to go and make quick
decisions but it also cuts out 397 choices
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and so how did those how did those
things work the person who brought in the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that was interesting must have
introduced it to the bug tender so somehow
[SPEAKER_00]: they got exposed to your product in a
really nice way they don't need the hat
[SPEAKER_00]: and t-shirt they need to smoke the weed
they need to just experience the pot they
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to be able to say well that is an
interesting pot and now they can say to
[SPEAKER_00]: their friends man this was some
interesting stuff and when I smoked it I
[SPEAKER_00]: really enjoyed it I would recommend it to
people who wanted this well all of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden you are an ungodly powerhouse in
that dispensary as a farm because the
[SPEAKER_00]: people at the counter are moving your
product there's no other way to do it it
[SPEAKER_00]: has to be through they always say you know
bud tender now they're calling them
[SPEAKER_00]: consultants bud consultants but it has to
be through that person that does the
[SPEAKER_00]: retail they have to be aware of the
products that you're presenting and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can start to put together these organic
groups where they get to experience enough
[SPEAKER_00]: of it in enough directions and varieties
pretty soon they start to realize that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole genre higher-grown higher-grade
biopot and now you start to have tenders
[SPEAKER_00]: who are aficionados where they start
appreciating your product and now they
[SPEAKER_00]: start to push the product because they
start to they know that that's better
[SPEAKER_00]: product and they know that the people they
push it to will be happy and as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't tax the shit out of them with
too much premium for all the extra work I
[SPEAKER_00]: do because now all of a sudden it comes
back to competitiveness financially that
[SPEAKER_00]: only works in some very specific upscale
markets so if you're not in Beverly Hills
[SPEAKER_00]: and in Madison Ave you might not want to
go to these upper echelons you might want
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to more realistic and realize that
people who have jobs that want to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: good grass will pay an extra five bucks
but they won't pay an extra 25 bucks
[SPEAKER_01]: because I knew that it was always going to
disappear yeah run it runs away and you
[SPEAKER_00]: need velocity you need money to return and
cannabis has a shelf life it is not a
[SPEAKER_00]: widget so the the product that didn't move
quickly degrades and then when people
[SPEAKER_00]: consume it it turns them off and the
problem and the problem the problem with
[SPEAKER_00]: that is that now your label is attached to
a failure when really it's just happens
[SPEAKER_00]: but people go my god I don't like that
product then we'll try that one again and
[SPEAKER_00]: what they really didn't understand was it
might have been the best product they have
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked except that it was packaged eight
months ago and so you got something that
[SPEAKER_00]: was eight months old that had been sitting
in a warm distribution warehouse and now
[SPEAKER_00]: your product shot so what are you gonna do
with it and you look bad and people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to touch it and a lot of it is that's
why it has to be in clusters like this
[SPEAKER_00]: where you move your stuff in a form where
you're not competing with the other
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers meaning that you're doing good
product differentiation and you're making
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligent choices to what you're doing
all of you aren't running the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's trendy don't all run it make sure
that you figure out who has the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: run the trendies who has the ability to
run the bulks and but it's all under
[SPEAKER_00]: similar production methodology so it's
okay come on up it's all under similar
[SPEAKER_00]: methodologies and so what you have is you
have that as a mantra and people start to
[SPEAKER_00]: become aware of it and you start to be
able to develop it the only way that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do this stuff is to get it in people's
faces like eight times you want to hear a
[SPEAKER_00]: radio asking me like eight times if I hear
radio at eight times I hear it well how do
[SPEAKER_00]: you hear sun grown eight times is if you
got eight people spitting it because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: too hard for you to be in eight rooms all
the time talking about it and so you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to have many people hello I'm a microphone
what's that talking on a microphone see
[SPEAKER_00]: they're filming what am I talking about
we're talking about the problems in
[SPEAKER_00]: business when you're trying to develop a
new industry
[SPEAKER_00]: the real and I think that's the way
because I don't think any of us have the
[SPEAKER_00]: the marketing budget I don't think any of
us have the advertising budget I mean I
[SPEAKER_00]: spent a lot of time and money advertising
and marketing products for my company
[SPEAKER_00]: because we had the money when when we were
in a situation where you were making
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to do we played the game to the
best degree we could so we could
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the truth of it and so when I
tell people I said I'm telling you man you
[SPEAKER_00]: got to get yourself out there so hard that
it basically resonates in their ears then
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll listen otherwise you're invisible
and and that's why I like this event and
[SPEAKER_00]: and and the one in Canada that I was a
prior because I couldn't believe the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that came to the event and how
dedicated they were to moving forward in
[SPEAKER_00]: these methodologies and it made me realize
that we really were developing a new
[SPEAKER_00]: culture of cannabis production because we
could actually get together without having
[SPEAKER_00]: a Rico Act follow us you weren't gonna get
a Rico Act case we're in collusion as long
[SPEAKER_00]: as we don't set prices together yeah as
long as there's a few things as a few
[SPEAKER_00]: little things that we just don't do we can
actually figure this out together and you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to be everybody you just have
to be you so you don't have to be latent
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to understand how to
extract fulvic acid you can have them tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you how to do it and you don't have to be
Elaine and spend you know 50 years under a
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope you can you can have her
disciples come and say listen can I have
[SPEAKER_00]: you to come and scope my shit and teach me
how to do this so I know what I'm looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at and all of a sudden you know you're
able to really stay alive in my position I
[SPEAKER_00]: just I give people advice on how to
classify your genetic library how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: put together a library and how do you make
sure that you're catching the markets that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're supposed to be catching based off
of how people perceive cannabis and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can understand that picture then it lets
you understand how not to weigh all your
[SPEAKER_00]: choices in one basket because all you have
to do is have one problem and your basket
[SPEAKER_00]: falls out so they were up that
[SPEAKER_00]: is that we all made choices to not play
the conventional game and because of it we
[SPEAKER_00]: all had to kind of work together and none
of us really treat each other too bad
[SPEAKER_00]: because we can fuck each other's lives up
so we didn't and we had to trust each
[SPEAKER_00]: other enough because sometimes you know
you're the one who has the connect and so
[SPEAKER_00]: you're the one who's moving the packs I
had discussion people said we don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: along at all fucking hate each other
really but um I'm moving a bunch of work
[SPEAKER_00]: and I know you got a bunch of work and I
need that work and I know you need to move
[SPEAKER_00]: so let's just do the work shit and you'll
be like that was real life and that used
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen so people you didn't get along
with you'd still move the work because you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't need to get along you needed to
survive and I still see it the same way
[SPEAKER_00]: future I don't I don't see us having to be
poverty-stricken yes yes there is
[SPEAKER_00]: abundance it's just what you're gonna do
is you're gonna work in this capacity to
[SPEAKER_00]: where you have enough people that are
around you that you're loosely connected
[SPEAKER_00]: to so they have to combine each other's
skill sets and don't trip because
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's always so ultra protected you
