[SPEAKER_00]: Panga Canyon is an unincorporated area,
very well known, I think within the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis space itself as well too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone kind of hasn't understood that
there are growers there.
[SPEAKER_00]: People grow for their own personal use or
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been historically done there and it's
a great location for all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's been surprising to us in a very
positive way is that that community,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we look at that voting data,
the community was actually at 76% in favor
[SPEAKER_00]: of Prop 64 passing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by far they were one of the largest,
you know, highest rated communities that
[SPEAKER_00]: are in favor of illegal cannabis there.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the way the current zoning is set
up, their supervisor who represents them,
[SPEAKER_00]: Supervisor Sheila Kuhl, who is very
favorable to the topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has always been favorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: She wants to see a regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, she has not had a very loud voice
in this discussion because the zoning has
[SPEAKER_00]: made so that her district essentially
would only have the ability to have only
[SPEAKER_00]: one dispensary in the entire district for
her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivation would be hard to find anything
else on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the entire Topanga Canyon area,
all that stuff in there, there is no
[SPEAKER_00]: zoning that is allowed for any commercial
cannabis use, indoor, outdoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: you name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an example where the town
council started getting in the ear of the
[SPEAKER_01]: County Board of Supervisors saying,
Hey, we would like either indoor or
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor cultivation in the Topanga area
that maybe the Board of Supervisors would
[SPEAKER_01]: start to listen to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like the current policy is
that all cannabis cultivation in this
[SPEAKER_01]: little tiny needle pin sized area of the
entire county, that's where it's all going
[SPEAKER_01]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we need is people in different
areas saying, Hey, we'd like it in our
[SPEAKER_01]: area too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, we also like to do
greenhouse or outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's really important because
if that town council could voice that
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion more strongly to Supervisor Kuhl,
she would be even more encouraged to
[SPEAKER_00]: support, you know, expanding and actually
having a viable cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think right now what they have proposed
is not a viable market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also the contrast to where you
have certain town councils that have
[SPEAKER_00]: people that sit on them that are
considered to have based their opinion and
[SPEAKER_00]: they voice that opinion, but it doesn't
reflect what the actual voting data is for
[SPEAKER_00]: the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Topanga Canyon's town council has
decided that they've had this discussion
[SPEAKER_00]: previously last year when we went out to
do an opportunity to speak with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spoke about it for, you know,
about an hour on the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since that time they backed away and
said, great, there's not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: anything happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see that that is reflecting the
will of what the residents are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the residents are the ones that need
to show them that this is something they
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to go to their town council and
they need to talk to them and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: we voted for this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't do this, there are parents
that can be separated from their children.
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be so many other consequences
and stuff if they are continuing to do
[SPEAKER_00]: their grows because the laws no longer
support them to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of some people we vote,
no, it's Topanga.
[SPEAKER_01]: People started saying, Hey, town council,
I'd like to have a consumption lounge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to have a cottage cultivation
license.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to be the guy to, you know,
have the medical and or recreational
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary somewhere on Route 27.
[SPEAKER_01]: If those people all started getting vocal,
then the town council would start to
[SPEAKER_01]: listen, get educated, turn to the board of
supervisors and say things like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, that's 10 retail licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either one we want one into Topanga or
you've got to up it to 11 because we want
[SPEAKER_01]: to have a consumption and a retail
establishment in Topanga.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Topanga County itself, there is so much
opportunity there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even just the opportunity that's
addressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is obviously a market that has been
in existence there for a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: personal or otherwise going in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The climate is excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The land is excellent for cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, personal or commercial going in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps not to where you will have,
you know, acres and acres of a garage size
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, but this is where you have something
such as a cottage license that can come
[SPEAKER_00]: into effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state had allowed for what's called a
cottage license that was really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: more intended for I think almost like a
garage size grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so someone that could grow necessarily
on their property with the right,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, parameters that would go with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those parameters are still to be
determined and can be determined by the
[SPEAKER_00]: county as well, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw that as something that could be a
very good stimulus to the economy in
[SPEAKER_00]: general within the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made the committee had made a
recommendation saying that the county
[SPEAKER_00]: should prioritize cottage licenses and see
if they could get more of those online
[SPEAKER_00]: because then it would give smaller people
an opportunity to actually have a living
[SPEAKER_00]: for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have somewhere like the Topanga
Canyon that, you know, you could have 30,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40, you know, individual smaller farmers
that could come together or whatever they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do on that end and actually make a
market out there in a business that could
[SPEAKER_00]: be supporting both the community or going
beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just one license type
obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the example there is, let's say,
hypothetically, I live in Topanga.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have four acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: On my four acres, I could apply for a
permit, get a license, put the security in
[SPEAKER_01]: place and all that stuff and basically
grow 1,500 square feet of cannabis on my
[SPEAKER_01]: property legally, where then I could
theoretically bring it to the one retail
[SPEAKER_01]: outlet in Topanga, sell it to them as my
finest craft cannabis and then they sell
[SPEAKER_01]: it to my overall community who loves the
fact that it's local, outdoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: organic heirloom craft cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a... It's a very real market that
can exist there that the current
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations do not support or allow for in
any way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Topanga Canyon could be known very well
for a craft style cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be known for a farmers market
kind of event as well there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be something that where you can
promote really healthy product well along
[SPEAKER_00]: with the healthy lifestyle that many of
the residents up there are already into,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if they had the opportunity to be
able to grow 1,500 square feet or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: it was on their properties in there,
that smaller cultivation on there,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is an opportunity to give people a
benefit for them economically,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also who knows what else it could do
for the town itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, that is the spirit of what I had
hoped Prop 64 would be up and down the
[SPEAKER_01]: coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Topanga could be like, we don't have a
McDonald's in Topanga.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a Budweiser store.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: Topanga is craft and artisanal everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: For this awesome vision to happen,
people in Topanga need to start getting in
[SPEAKER_01]: the ears of the town council to be like,
this is how we want cannabis to play out
[SPEAKER_01]: in Topanga.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need to help us get that because
it's not it statewide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from a state policy level.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not dreaming here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the state says we could create a
Topanga utopia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I, on that note,
I mean, there, there is, there's so much
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity for Topanga and other
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say Topanga Canyon itself for
Topanga Canyon to essentially make a
[SPEAKER_00]: market that could be anything that they
want it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's only going to get there if they
come out to voice their opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a few people that have had the
supervisor's ears and the supervisor feels
[SPEAKER_00]: that that represents that a community out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And historically, I think we've seen that
us in general, you know, the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community has just stayed in the shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes we have not come in there
and yet we've had state regulations are
[SPEAKER_00]: just passed and given us this incredible
opportunity to create the future that we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to see happening in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Topanga Canyon, this can still happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is, there is time still left to make
this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing is at the end yet, but we are
coming up close to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that to happen, they need to voice to
their town council.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not just the town council,
they need to voice their opinion directly
[SPEAKER_00]: to the board of supervisors, their
supervisor, Sheila Kuehl, if nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: She needs to hear this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: She needs to hear that this is what our
community wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the community does not come out to say
that, whatever comes in the end is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not something that we want
going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, I don't think anyone here has wanted
or thought that Prop 64 would pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately that just means a complete
ban in your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not what the intention was for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we don't change these regulations,
we don't voice for what we want in our
[SPEAKER_00]: communities, nothing will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that ban will still be in effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Topanga could be 30 plus craft
cultivators, all the same people who are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you all know they're your fucking
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all growing amazing weed that you
smoke right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be bringing it to the monthly
farmer's market.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be bringing it to Holden's
consumption lounge and they could be
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing it to so-and-so's retail,
like liquor store versus bar, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Topanga, there's this thought that
runs, I think in many people's minds,
[SPEAKER_00]: what it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be driving up that beautiful
canyon to begin with and you're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone out there and you have your
neighbors, all of you who know you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing on that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could be growing legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be making this amazing product,
this craft product that is specific to
[SPEAKER_00]: Topanga Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: In itself, something to be very proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can bring this out into a legal
market, such as a farmer's market where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can give to everyone else on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see this to where it goes into a
onsite consumption, like a lounge where
[SPEAKER_00]: you could actually go and consume with
your friends and your neighbors on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right next to Mimosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right next to Mimosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could also be, it could be also
that you have a infused dinner experience
[SPEAKER_00]: up there as well, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many opportunities that can
come from this down here that would just
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulate just the life style in general
that comes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people like to see this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something to be even more proud
of for that market, that niche market
[SPEAKER_00]: that's kind of in there that kind of is
like, this only happens at Topanga Canyon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the laws are there to support it if we
want them to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they are coming into effect,
if the residents are asking for that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, if they are pushing their town
council, if the supervisors are hearing
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff, we can create these laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the voice of the supervisors
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to know more specifics behind
what's being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are currently recommendations only
that are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we aren't coming out there and
saying, hey, this is what I want in my
[SPEAKER_00]: community, it won't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Topanga has an incredible opportunity for
that stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they can make that, that's the way
it should go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
Thank you.
