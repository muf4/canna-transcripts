[SPEAKER_04]: Green Street Agency based out of Los
Angeles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And before we get into the panel,
I just want to say the topic we're talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about is brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for me, it's I'm like honored and
inspired to be talking about this topic
[SPEAKER_04]: because, you know, as a young attorney,
I was working with brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I say brands, but guys whose I only
knew their first name in my phone because
[SPEAKER_04]: they didn't have a brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't have logos.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't have websites or social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they didn't want anybody to know that
they were even associated with the product
[SPEAKER_04]: being sold in the store.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was a gray market and brands
didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the hyper growth and maturity that
I've seen over the last five to seven
[SPEAKER_04]: years is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's inspiring to see the success the
companies have built and the brands and
[SPEAKER_04]: the culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really what a brand is, is trust.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the consumer being able to connect
with your brand and trust that your
[SPEAKER_04]: product is something that they can consume
and value.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something I'm seeing more and
more every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's exciting to be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to welcome our panel to the
stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And let me introduce everybody and then we
get a warm welcome for everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Tim Morland with compliance and policy
director of River Wellness.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan Smith, founder of Leaf Link.
[SPEAKER_04]: Megan Phillips, the owner of the Honey
Agency.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dean Reyes, artist manager of C3
Management.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Amber Center, CEO of Leisure Life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please help me give them a warm welcome to
the stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have microphones for you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is all our first time meeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's great to meet everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hate that I'm standing up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'd rather just be with you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to just jump into a few
topics.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do a little bit of a
conversation with the panel over a few
[SPEAKER_04]: topics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love everybody, I think, will provide
some value to us as an industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: some information and some education.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're going to open it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because really I think what everybody is
here to do is if you're not a leader
[SPEAKER_04]: already is to become a leader in this
industry, understand what that takes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I assume that your brains are full of
a ton of questions that we are hopefully
[SPEAKER_04]: here to be able to answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's start off with our first topic,
which, you know, I think in our industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've worked with a lot of people that
because they've only worked in the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis industry, they feel like they are
inventing or creating certain aspects of
[SPEAKER_04]: their business, whether it had been
extraction or distillation or certain type
[SPEAKER_04]: of processes within their company.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cannabis industry is, you know,
doesn't have a lot of perspective from
[SPEAKER_04]: outside because it's self-made
millionaires with in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the things I think our panel can
help us with today is applying some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: history and trends of other industry,
parallel industries, and what types of
[SPEAKER_04]: things have made brands successful in
industries like fashion, music,
[SPEAKER_04]: sports, apparel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's talk about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to open it up to the panel,
maybe start with on this end and work this
[SPEAKER_04]: way as we see fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I have the privilege every day
of working with wine, coffee, tea and
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis is an amazing opportunity for
us to take what we can learn from other
[SPEAKER_01]: industries, but also remind ourselves that
we have the respect of a lot of farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to make sure that farmers are
still at the forefront of what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so every day, that's my job.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about an agricultural
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's an honor to be able to
work in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brands are one of those moments where you
break bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have the honor of being paneled
panelists on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you are selling something that
you can enjoy as a community and a
[SPEAKER_01]: communal event, where you do break bread,
it becomes a different experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not just a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is something that unites people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that unites a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that sort of branding is really
hard and really interesting because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not just a widget.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just a cog.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a very memorable experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's something that's even
harder in branding because we're taking
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's very, very passionate for
a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something we consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something we put in our bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely agree on the cultural elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the co-founders, Ryan Smith at
LeafLink, and we work with over 700
[SPEAKER_02]: brands, more than 2,300 retailers now in
12 states.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the primary bets we made when
we started the company was that this
[SPEAKER_02]: industry would be similar to, as it
matures, a lot of other industries,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Consumers looking for consistency,
same pricing, things that feel comfortable
[SPEAKER_02]: to them, especially if they're new to the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over the last two and a half,
three years since we started the company,
[SPEAKER_02]: we went from meeting with our first
clients that were running these middle
[SPEAKER_02]: eight-figure businesses on whiteboards,
text messages, Google Sheets, to saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, asking basic questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your most sold product yesterday?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we think it was this, kind of these
subjective answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're starting to see now more of
this professionalism, maturity around
[SPEAKER_02]: these businesses as they grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We build tools for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what clients at the end of
the day want to see the results of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's definitely quickly growing,
which is exciting to be a part of.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks again, Susan, for having us here
today to talk about branding.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to talk about branding from a
different perspective.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can talk about products.
[SPEAKER_08]: We manufacture a product that's infused
popcorn.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm also the co-founder of Supernova
Women, which is an organization that works
[SPEAKER_08]: to empower people of color to become
self-sufficient shareholders within the
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I bring up that brand because that
brand was something that we were able to
[SPEAKER_08]: create and create a movement behind it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's been a very powerful experience
just kind of speaking to needs within the
[SPEAKER_08]: community and getting people to rally
behind us.
[SPEAKER_08]: So of course, you can also build consumer
brands and things like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when you build a movement behind,
whether it's a product or a need within
[SPEAKER_08]: the industry or an industry need,
you can see a really exponential growth
[SPEAKER_08]: behind that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, movements behind brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name's Dean Reyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an artist manager at C3 Management.
[SPEAKER_03]: I come from the music side.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been working in cannabis for a couple
of years now, advising cannabis companies
[SPEAKER_03]: on branding strategy, marketing,
design, packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: At C3, we produce music festivals and
manage artists.
[SPEAKER_03]: We produce Lollapalooza in eight
countries, Bonnaroo, Austin City Limits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we manage about 65 bands.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Strokes, The Head and the Heart,
Sylvanesso, Justice, Phoenix, Gramatic,
[SPEAKER_03]: and several others.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I've been kind of coming into the
cannabis space the last couple of years,
[SPEAKER_03]: starting with Revolution as a reggae band
I've managed for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: We partnered with FlavorX a couple of
years ago to release some cartridges and
[SPEAKER_03]: disposable pens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was kind of my entry into the
cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And kind of looked around and saw that a
lot of the branding and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: products kind of all looked very similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And something that I've been trying to do
is normalization in branding and making
[SPEAKER_03]: sure that my family and other people that
are not your traditional and maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: newcomers to cannabis can feel comfortable
with their consumption and that they don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have to hide it and that the branding
looks very similar to other products such
[SPEAKER_03]: as a can of beer or a bottle of whiskey
and that it's just making sure that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: fine, that it sits on the coffee table and
that if somebody wants to consume cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: as opposed to drinking alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was kind of what I'm going for
in that space is making people feel
[SPEAKER_03]: comfortable about the consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's absolutely nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's healthier than some of the products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just felt like a lot of the branding
was kind of counterintuitive to that
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been focusing a lot on that and
having some fun and happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Tim Moreland.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am the compliance and policy director
for River Distributing, a large
[SPEAKER_05]: distribution company here in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: My background comes from, I'm on the
compliance side.
[SPEAKER_05]: My background comes, I was the legislative
director for Fiona Mahu speaking soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go Fiona, she's running for treasurer,
vote for her.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I gotta get my plug.
[SPEAKER_05]: And before that, I worked for the state
assembly for probably about almost eight
[SPEAKER_05]: years.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my focus right now with marketing and
with brands has been on the compliance
[SPEAKER_05]: angle, which as we probably all know,
that's been really tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had some major deadlines,
the July 1st, the grace period.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have another deadline coming for
branding and labeling and packaging with
[SPEAKER_05]: the proposed regs that will go into
effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, to be honest with you guys,
there are brands that are not on the
[SPEAKER_05]: shelves of retailers right now because of
labeling and packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something we fight every day at
River.
[SPEAKER_05]: We try and work with our brands and help
them and give them the blueprint to what
[SPEAKER_05]: they need to do to get their products on
the shelves because we wanna do that,
[SPEAKER_05]: we wanna sell that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been a constant battle and we're
gonna continue to fight it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's where I'm coming from.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure we'll talk about this more during
the panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our next topic I wanna talk about here
rather than just the parallels on the
[SPEAKER_04]: mainstream is have a plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the early companies we've worked
with were kind of shooting from the hip
[SPEAKER_04]: and creating a plan as they went.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd love to just pose it to the panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some of the essential elements
you guys think are necessary for a company
[SPEAKER_04]: when putting together a go-to-market or a
yearly marketing strategy plan?
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, guys, I'm gonna go on my
compliance angle.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're a brand, you need to figure
out exactly what needs to be on that
[SPEAKER_05]: packaging so you can sell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's step one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Work with your legal counsel, work with
your distributor.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have a good distributor,
I'm sorry, I'm kind of bragging,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they're gonna help you out with your
labeling and making sure that's compliant
[SPEAKER_05]: and they'll work with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I spend a good portion of my day working
with brands and just advising them on
[SPEAKER_05]: what's compliant labeling.
[SPEAKER_05]: So start out there and that's my two cents
on this and I'll let all these pros here
[SPEAKER_05]: jump in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say figure out at the core what
your story is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you come from?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is going to be that emotional
connection between you and your audience
[SPEAKER_03]: and your brand and your marketing and your
design and your social media and your
[SPEAKER_03]: photos and your articles?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is your story?
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't just figure it out at the core.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you doing this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you wanna go?
[SPEAKER_03]: And build a connection and try to find an
audience that agrees with that and give
[SPEAKER_03]: consumers something that they can connect
to that they feel a loyalty towards your
[SPEAKER_03]: product, whether it be a cause.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are you giving back to?
[SPEAKER_03]: What organizations are you supporting?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or what's your sustainability angle?
[SPEAKER_03]: What good are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: As well as where is your product coming
from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell the consumers everything about you
because they're going to find out and you
[SPEAKER_03]: want them to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't just go deeper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go deeper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to find something emotional or
something meaningful in there without just
[SPEAKER_03]: throwing a product into the marketplace
and expecting people to wanna buy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many products and people's
attention spans are so quick that if they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't like yours, they're gonna click to
something else and go somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to draw people in with something
meaningful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I couldn't agree more, Dean.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's one of the most important
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a company we all know and probably
have a device in our pocket from,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is Apple, their early mission
statement was about the why.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not to make great cell phones and
sell a lot of product.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was to make devices that make
communication easier for human beings.
[SPEAKER_04]: And something along that lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm paraphrasing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then it was, okay, in order to
accomplish that, why we're gonna make
[SPEAKER_04]: tablets and cell phones and reinvent all
of these devices in order to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was really the story and the
reason behind it and why people got behind
[SPEAKER_04]: every product that Apple brings is because
they connect with the why of the company.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's tremendously important.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I just wanna build on what Dean
mentioned as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Telling your story is essential and
connecting with your audience is key.
[SPEAKER_08]: So making sure that the visuals on your
packaging, the imagery that you choose and
[SPEAKER_08]: marketing your product, whether it be on
social media or on a billboard,
[SPEAKER_08]: that it connects with your audience and
who you're trying to target.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also be genuine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Be very genuine and be transparent.
[SPEAKER_08]: People wanna know where their cannabis is
coming from.
[SPEAKER_08]: They wanna know what they're putting into
their bodies.
[SPEAKER_08]: People really want transparency nowadays
and that's why the farm-to-table movement
[SPEAKER_08]: is so huge and had such success.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people are smart.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're smart.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have smart consumers.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the internet.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have information within the palm of our
hands that we can access right away.
[SPEAKER_08]: And all of that also plays into building
the movement behind your product.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can do this successfully,
you can get a lot of people on your side.
[SPEAKER_08]: And once you have a customer for life,
that person's gonna tell everybody about
[SPEAKER_08]: your product.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, just be genuine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Be real.
[SPEAKER_08]: Connect with your audience and yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanna add something real quick,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I was saying doesn't only pertain to
physical products.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a grower, your brand is who you
are and how you're growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell people the nutrients that you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell people what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell people where you're selling to.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a distributor, you have a brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how we take care of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mean brands just in terms of a jar
of flour on a shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean everything about your company.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are anything within the industry,
you have a brand, you have a story,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have an audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether your audience is B2B or B2C or if
it's consumers or if it's other
[SPEAKER_03]: professionals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's paying attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't take for granted that people just
know stuff about you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to make sure that you're telling who
you are and why you're doing what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the companies on our platform,
so we work with some leading brands like
[SPEAKER_02]: Kiva in California, Wana in Colorado,
Zoot's up in Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there really isn't yet a national
leader.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no Coke, no Pepsi.
[SPEAKER_02]: People like market caps might say
otherwise, but that's just today.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we are seeing is a lot of companies
are pretty small and they're looking to
[SPEAKER_02]: scale and getting to other markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think some of the mistakes that
we're seeing happen is we have companies
[SPEAKER_02]: that launch in Michigan or will launch in
Colorado because they work with us in
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of these are startups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone is a startup to a varying degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the eyes get really big.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to be Kraft.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to be everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you in the more internal
operational side haven't really set what
[SPEAKER_02]: your mission, what your goal is,
how you should be known is it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: business, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be operating at a certain level
of efficiency with accountability and
[SPEAKER_02]: transparency to actually be successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're seeing mistakes like people
jumping into these shotgun marriage JVs in
[SPEAKER_02]: other states to meet residency
requirements and just to get live.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's happening is if you only have a
team of 10 to 30 people in state one and
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to be in state two and three in
the next six months, things just start
[SPEAKER_02]: getting so sloppy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so forget about the beauty of the
packaging or the mission that the end
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer sees.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't keep it straight internally
and have a consistency of who you are as a
[SPEAKER_02]: team in a company, forget about being,
yeah, it's really through and through from
[SPEAKER_02]: what we've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, coming from the creative side,
I think we get a phone call every single
[SPEAKER_01]: week and it's, I need a logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, you gotta rephrase your
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's not about, a brand is so much
more than a logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: A brand is so much more than a package.
[SPEAKER_01]: A brand has many, many multifaceted
prongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really important that that brand
strategy, that written word is completed
[SPEAKER_01]: first before you ever put ink to paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong, I love putting ink to
paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what I get up in the morning and do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to create, I want to make design.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to create a package that's gonna be
unforgettable that you want to bring and
[SPEAKER_01]: share with your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it to be, the biggest thing also is
it needs to resonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just came back from Denver, Kat,
Joe, we were all in Denver for the past
[SPEAKER_01]: couple days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And six years have passed and I still
think the net was capped.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cast really wide and it was cast by
a category called cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't cast by a resonating audience
driven why.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's a moment here in
California where we can expedite what that
[SPEAKER_01]: process looks like by thinking of brand
strategy first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of looking at a big net that's
being cast and we're all going out into
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, we're actually targeting a
person on the other end who wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: resonate with the product that believes in
something that is bigger and beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think beyond a logo, think beyond
package, think about the strategy first
[SPEAKER_01]: and really make yourself stand out and be
different and be authentic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if that happens, you will pull out
from the crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will tell you, going to Denver,
there was only a few people that really
[SPEAKER_01]: stood out to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just all very similar and
homogenized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that if you saw real brand
strategy, you knew immediately and it
[SPEAKER_01]: popped off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it maybe even sometimes wasn't their
package.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was the way it was merchandised.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it was for that patient who needed
to open that child resistant package
[SPEAKER_01]: differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the innovation we have in
California right now and we have a really
[SPEAKER_01]: big chance to do it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we keep hitting on packaging,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's become, and I remember back in a
day when the retailer that I worked with
[SPEAKER_04]: was, I'll do retailer, didn't even have
packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd have to bring your own baggies.
[SPEAKER_04]: To now we have the most sophisticated
packaging I think in almost any industry
[SPEAKER_04]: with some of the child proofing that
exists.
[SPEAKER_04]: How important is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we need to consider?
[SPEAKER_04]: How expensive is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: How much should a company be contributing
into its packaging design and utility?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start with that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you seem excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can talk about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what I, I have a lot of,
I feel your pain because we can't design
[SPEAKER_01]: against it right now because we don't know
exactly where it's going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do feel the pain of the industry
because we cannot create the package yet
[SPEAKER_01]: based on where the regs are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't, we don't know where that child
resistant mark is going to land.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that said, I think that's also a
mistake that's happening right now with
[SPEAKER_01]: brands is they're thinking like they're
pulling back and waiting because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: just like, I'm not going to invest in my
brand yet because I can't, I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: where child resistance is going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going, you're going to lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to come out strong with your
brand and still feel like I'll,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll, I'll be able to pivot when I know
what the regs are going to lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just something I want to say is
I see too much of this pullback of people
[SPEAKER_01]: being like, you know, I don't know what my
brand looks like yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, your brand isn't your
package.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like don't, don't stress, but I feel your
pain because we don't know where that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mean to upset the order,
but please, please, whatever you do,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you're a brand, do not wait for the
regulations to drop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just can just act like you're under the
regs you are now and it has to be in child
[SPEAKER_05]: resistant packaging because if you're not,
and they do take out that requirement,
[SPEAKER_05]: guess what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't sell your product.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to be waiting to find
packaging and, and that could take months.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have brands right now, river reverts in
30 brands.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have brands right now who can't haven't
been able to secure packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the only reason why they are
not sitting on shelves.
[SPEAKER_05]: The retailers right now are being sold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you guys seeing more packaging locally
or from abroad?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that mainly from abroad?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I mean, to be honest, a lot of
it's just Chinese packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, and I don't know how the tariffs
are going to affect that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so there's a whole host of issues,
but just be proactive.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the child resistant standards or
the child resistant packaging will be
[SPEAKER_05]: placed on the retailers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately just kind of following what's
going on in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but you know, be prepared,
be prepared if it's not, because if you're
[SPEAKER_05]: not your, we can't sell your product.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a little bit of a wiggle room,
uh, with not knowing what was going to
[SPEAKER_08]: happen with the regulations.
[SPEAKER_08]: I went out and bought a $10,000 Epson
printer, label printer.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we would have the flexibility to be
able to print in-house no matter what
[SPEAKER_08]: regulations change tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: We go print.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, just be smart about it and
invest, you know, don't invest 10 grand in
[SPEAKER_08]: a pre-printed packaging.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the regs change in six weeks.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, have, make sure you have some
flexibility and sorry to jump in again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't think you're going to fool a
retailer because they're pretty smart
[SPEAKER_05]: right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: They refuse products, even product that's
compliant because they are seriously
[SPEAKER_05]: nervous about taking product that the BCC
is just going to pull off the shelf during
[SPEAKER_05]: an inspection.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, everyone's paying attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: Distributors are paying attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: I pay attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to send back product every day
because someone tried to get cute and
[SPEAKER_05]: place it in, you know, a bag that's
technically not child resistant or they
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't put the proper labels on.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't put the universal symbol in
the front of the product.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's a manufactured product,
there's all sorts of little nuances that,
[SPEAKER_05]: um, we simply just can't distribute your
product.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is, these are big, I have retailers
who, who will turn down products like
[SPEAKER_05]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: A perfect example, technically flower
doesn't, is not a manufactured cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really doesn't need the universal
symbol because CDPH regs, don't govern
[SPEAKER_05]: flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, retailers are freaking out about
it when there is a universal symbol in the
[SPEAKER_05]: back, but it's in a different color and
they're simply trying to refuse this
[SPEAKER_05]: product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have to get on the phone with the
retailer and we have to go back and forth
[SPEAKER_05]: and then I have to dig up emails from CDPH
saying that's not required for flower and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's this long process.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess what I'm saying is just make
sure you're dialed in.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not going to fool anybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not going to fool anybody,
but you know, eh, this is getting cute.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just place it over here, but you have
to really follow those, those guidelines
[SPEAKER_05]: that the state's giving you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I think it's a cool opportunity at
the same time, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we have, there's one brand I'm
thinking of in California that we went to
[SPEAKER_02]: visit their facility a few months back and
they had half of it was just packaging
[SPEAKER_02]: that they way over purchased and they knew
it was going to be beyond even,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if, if we weren't going to be
operating by a grace period or hoping for
[SPEAKER_02]: another one, this is what was going to be
compliant in the very least.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we released new badges now on leaf
link that you can be, be a compliant
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are asking and looking for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was a whole like methodology to
releasing this compliant packaging,
[SPEAKER_02]: which kind of keys into some retailers are
smart, but there's still like a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: lack of communication in the supply chain
and especially between buyers and sellers
[SPEAKER_02]: and regulators.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they not only pre-bought all their
packaging more than they were going to
[SPEAKER_02]: need for the next, you know, six,
12 months, but they also had a whole like
[SPEAKER_02]: educational one sheets that went in with
all the deliveries and they educated their
[SPEAKER_02]: sales reps to explain this is,
you know, what you can and cannot buy and
[SPEAKER_02]: here's why, because there's a lot of ideas
and there's granularity to those ideas and
[SPEAKER_02]: what's okay and what isn't okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's almost like launching a product in
a new product that people aren't quite yet
[SPEAKER_02]: familiar with and companies that did that
seem to be, we could see their transaction
[SPEAKER_02]: on the platform far and away where others
are really almost at a standstill.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're sitting on millions of dollars of
product, kind of like what we were going
[SPEAKER_02]: to earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of our recurring themes of the
panel is the regulation surrounding all of
[SPEAKER_04]: the marketing and branding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and it's the first time in our
industry, at least here in California,
[SPEAKER_04]: that we've ever had to deal with these
types of threat of losing your license.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to segue here into the don't
lose your license conversation and what
[SPEAKER_04]: are a few things, in addition to obviously
compliant packaging and everything being
[SPEAKER_04]: compliant, what are some pitfalls in just
the overall compliance area that brands
[SPEAKER_04]: should be aware of, whether it's marketing
to minors or children or caricatures or
[SPEAKER_04]: packaging?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about a few of those areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the issues that I dealt with when I
first came to River was marketing to
[SPEAKER_05]: children.
[SPEAKER_05]: I literally looked through all of our
SKUs, you know, looking for names,
[SPEAKER_05]: had to unfortunately tell a lot of brands,
you can't use the word candy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what does that, sorry to cut into,
but to you guys, what is your
[SPEAKER_04]: interpretation?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's not 100% where you can and
can't market.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's marketing to children is kind of the
general term.
[SPEAKER_05]: What does that mean to River?
[SPEAKER_05]: What does that mean to River?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we're just overly cautious.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want, you know, we look at these
brands, we looked at the packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really isn't too big of an issue
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, when I first came there,
we were really with a fine tooth at home
[SPEAKER_05]: going through these brands and looking at
them and looking for keywords,
[SPEAKER_05]: looking for cartoon figures and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was kind of silly, but it's actually
something that we had to do, because once
[SPEAKER_05]: again, you know, we want to sell these
brands, but we can't sell them,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, when they have certain names in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of candies, you know, and it's very
explicit in the regs.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't use the word candy on your
packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as far as what's like appealing
to children, I really don't know,
[SPEAKER_05]: so we kind of had to take kind of a
conservative approach, because no offense
[SPEAKER_05]: to the state, but there's really no
guidelines on, they just say it,
[SPEAKER_05]: and there's this kind of like,
oh, you interpret it, and there's just
[SPEAKER_05]: nothing there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's been an issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Copyright infringement is a real thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So don't make a candy bar that looks like
a Hershey bar and call it Stoner bar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Real companies are coming in, and that's
something that, as Tim kind of mentioned,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen a lot of cleaning up in the last
year or two of, you know, variations of
[SPEAKER_04]: Disney properties or Marvel properties or
Star Wars, and that was, I think,
[SPEAKER_04]: something that early on a lot of brands
would attract to and had these limited
[SPEAKER_04]: runs, and I think that's a pitfall,
at least at this point, because a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: the big boys are starting to step up,
and their IP departments are laboring
[SPEAKER_04]: litigation all across the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from an advertising standpoint,
you know, as we all know, we cannot take
[SPEAKER_01]: out anything that's federally FCC.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no advertising for television,
radio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what actually is kind of unique about
this is you get to drive a language in an
[SPEAKER_01]: organic fashion, and I think what we need
to look at is making sure that brands are
[SPEAKER_01]: very connected with the end consumer
through training and through connecting
[SPEAKER_01]: with their retailers and to make sure that
they're educating and changing and driving
[SPEAKER_01]: the message about their brand to the bud
tenders, even.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I think about alcohol and coffee,
there's a lot of trainings that are coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from the brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: The distributors are going and they're
meeting, and they're saying, this is how
[SPEAKER_01]: you administer the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what the product is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the farmer that grew it,
and that's an opportunity to kind of do
[SPEAKER_01]: the advertising in a very internal way
while we still have a lot of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of requirements where we can't
advertise our brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Social media, I know we're gonna get into
that, but that's another amazing place for
[SPEAKER_01]: you to drive your why.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to drive the message.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can connect and talk to the right
people that you wanna have resonate with
[SPEAKER_01]: your brand and your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is an amazing tool right now that can
be used to grow a very loyal following,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think it's really important that
that's addressed and looked at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think let's jump into,
sorry Tim, but let's just jump into social
[SPEAKER_04]: media now because, you know, as I've
watched the industry grow, and I think
[SPEAKER_04]: it's been more of a community rather than
an industry up until this point,
[SPEAKER_04]: social media has been a platform that was
readily used by everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd say, like, the cannabis industry
runs on Instagram essentially,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Despite the fact that we can't advertise,
people are touchy, accounts are shut down
[SPEAKER_04]: every other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same as, like, the bank accounts
have always been.
[SPEAKER_04]: So despite that, does the cannabis
industry run on Instagram and social
[SPEAKER_04]: media?
[SPEAKER_04]: How does our panel feel that brands should
be activating, and where should they use
[SPEAKER_04]: it, and what are good strategies for using
social media and other mainstream media
[SPEAKER_04]: channels?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think email's a great way to connect
with an audience as long as you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: over-emailing and pissing people off,
because a lot of people do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or texting, but, you know, a lot of,
I think everybody should be wary about
[SPEAKER_03]: what platform that you're building your
audience, because whose audience is still
[SPEAKER_03]: on MySpace?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, those social media companies
could go away, or they could, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: things could change.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't just, you know, build your
audience on Facebook or Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, use them to reach an audience,
but really try to collect emails and
[SPEAKER_03]: really try to, you know, build in-person
experiences with people and connections,
[SPEAKER_03]: because you know, those platforms could go
away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what types of mainstream platforms are
you guys utilizing or that you see at all,
[SPEAKER_04]: whether it be radio or television or ads
in print and magazines?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what have you guys seen be effective
for the brands that you guys work with?
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was a former COO of Magnolia
Wellness, which is a dispensary in West
[SPEAKER_08]: Oakland, and I think we were probably the
first dispensary to have a billboard on
[SPEAKER_08]: 580, which coming from San Francisco going
into Oakland.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had that billboard up for four
years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we saw a lot of success from that
billboard, mainly because we were the only
[SPEAKER_08]: dispensary in the state that had a
billboard.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was kind of expensive, but it paid
off.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we were able to kind of track
our returns on investment by seeing who
[SPEAKER_08]: was coming in, signing up, and how they
found out about us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you find out about us?
[SPEAKER_08]: Weed maps, billboard, what was it?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the billboard was cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: We also did a TV commercial, which was
really expensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're one of the only dispensaries
that did a TV commercial, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think our return on investment
was very good there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: They would show our commercial during SVU
at night.
[SPEAKER_08]: But print seems to be good.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do agree with Dean here about
collecting emails, because that's
[SPEAKER_08]: something that you will always have,
whereas all the other platforms could go
[SPEAKER_08]: away.
[SPEAKER_08]: You will always have a way to connect with
the audience through email.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of the main outlets,
or the ones that are industry leaders,
[SPEAKER_02]: are pretty underwhelming, at least on the
metrics that they give back on
[SPEAKER_02]: advertisements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Click-through rates and impressions are
usually pretty pathetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, at times, there are these very
what we call V1 tech companies in the
[SPEAKER_02]: space doing pretty predatory advertising
regimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's that side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's limitations around where even
getting access to billboards or public TV
[SPEAKER_02]: is challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nice part is the industry is so small,
and the community is pretty tightly knit.
[SPEAKER_02]: People ask, how do we get to 2,300
retailers?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we have over 350 in California?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're knocking on everyone's
doors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you could spend a few weeks and
pretty much meet everyone you need to meet
[SPEAKER_02]: in this space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people talk, and it's very communal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you may not have all these quick,
sexy methods of getting everyone's
[SPEAKER_02]: eyeballs, but you could pretty much get
everyone's bodies in a room pretty quickly
[SPEAKER_02]: and then meet them in the old-school,
old-fashioned way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a good thing that we've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to say, everyone in this
room is here because we're probably an
[SPEAKER_01]: authority on something, or we have a voice
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need all of our voices to be the
right voice for all of our advertisers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I always tell people, please,
be right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go and say you'll do an op-ed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Connect with influencers who are probably
not in cannabis to sort of change the tone
[SPEAKER_01]: and to get more people that are not even
thinking of cannabis as something that
[SPEAKER_01]: they should have as a budget line item and
a purchase in their household to think of
[SPEAKER_01]: it as something that they can bring into
their household.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of the thing that I want
to say, is that we need to get more
[SPEAKER_01]: communal connectivity and media to be
talking about it and writing great
[SPEAKER_01]: articles about brands that are doing it
well, cultivations that's doing it well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's our job, to really raise voices
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, from River's perspective,
we have a team of 23 sales managers who go
[SPEAKER_05]: out around the state and sell the product.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the brands that work with ourselves,
folks, are the ones who succeed,
[SPEAKER_05]: the brands who do the right along with us,
who go out and promote their own product
[SPEAKER_05]: with our team.
[SPEAKER_05]: The brands that show up to our sales
meetings and educate our sales associates
[SPEAKER_05]: about the brands and the benefits and the
message they all want to convey and the
[SPEAKER_05]: story about the brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is so important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just getting out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, social media and print and all that's
great.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just getting out there and preaching
your message and advertising your brand,
[SPEAKER_05]: those are the brands that River really we
really do well with.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's when they play an active part with
us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, we have the team, we have the foot
soldiers, sort of speak, to go out there
[SPEAKER_05]: and sell the product.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's the brands who actually step and
get away and advertise their products
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves in conjunction with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, hard work wins, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's going to take time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to take a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not set up to be able to get mass
media coverage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are a lot of limitations on the
marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to have a brand of any sort,
you're going to have to go out there on
[SPEAKER_03]: the road, foot soldier, go and make
connections one by one by one by one.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no launch a product and
immediately you've got a following and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're selling 10,000 units and it's going
to take a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So make sure you're managing your
expectations and the expectations of the
[SPEAKER_03]: people that you're working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really put in the effort and put in
the time and be really passionate about it
[SPEAKER_03]: because people can see that and they can
read it too.
[SPEAKER_08]: One more thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I moved to California four and a
half years ago, I worked for an edibles
[SPEAKER_08]: company with actually Beer Brothers,
those two guys in the back.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they were my sales team here in L.A.
[SPEAKER_08]: and I was working up north.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we took that brand, that edibles
company from four dispensaries to 50
[SPEAKER_08]: dispensaries in six months.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we did that because we were on the
ground going from dispensary to
[SPEAKER_08]: dispensary, talking to folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't depend on, you know,
it's great to have River as a distributor
[SPEAKER_08]: or a distribution company but you've
really, as the brand, got to go out and do
[SPEAKER_08]: your own work and build those
relationships.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think the point here is that the
industry is still young enough and still
[SPEAKER_04]: small enough that you could start a
company tomorrow, work hard and still play
[SPEAKER_04]: among the biggest in the game here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this industry is the epitome of
the American dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen more self-made millionaires than
any other industry I've ever worked in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I say that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're hitting here a lot on the issues
of the limitations of advertising and
[SPEAKER_04]: marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Advertising is a part of having a brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do we advertise and pay for ads and
get the word out there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because social media is limited,
Instagram, Google, Facebook, that's where
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody else in the world advertises and
spends millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've seen a turn in cannabis to a
lot of influencer or celebrity branded
[SPEAKER_04]: marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's been some good ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been some bad ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been how do we use celebrity
influencers?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we use just influencers on the
gram, the guys who have 20, 40,
[SPEAKER_04]: 50,000 followers as well?
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to throw that on the table and
let's get a little topic going there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I can speak a little bit to the
celebrity branded products.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've launched a couple.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been paying a lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Time will tell if it works, if people
care.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's difficult enough to have a product on
a shelf, especially in the state of
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then to now slap a celebrity logo on it,
charge a little bit more and actually have
[SPEAKER_03]: that work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's going to help because that
celebrity has a pre-existing following and
[SPEAKER_03]: an audience already.
[SPEAKER_03]: But who's to say that if we won't use any
names, but we'll say Celebrity X has a
[SPEAKER_03]: huge following and they go and they
partner with a farm or a manufacturer or
[SPEAKER_03]: something and they end up getting a
product on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: If their fans or their audience walk into
that dispensary and they see that the
[SPEAKER_03]: product is at a higher price point because
the pie has to be cut more ways,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the product isn't that good and it's
not as good as a much better product
[SPEAKER_03]: that's next to it on the shelf that's
cheaper.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care if you're the biggest fan of
Celebrity X in the world, you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: buying that product more than once and it
becomes a novelty item.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is that it lands up being
brand depreciating because the fan and the
[SPEAKER_03]: loyal follower of that celebrity will go
into the store and look at it and get
[SPEAKER_03]: pissed off and go, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're trying to sell me a product that's
not as good, that's more expensive and now
[SPEAKER_03]: you're just trying to cash grab and you
obviously haven't paid attention to the
[SPEAKER_03]: product.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not really a huge fan of it and
then that lands up being depreciating to
[SPEAKER_03]: the celebrity or the musician or the band
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think everybody needs to be a little bit
careful about what kind of products that
[SPEAKER_03]: they're putting out there and people
really need to make sure that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: legitimate because it could land up
backfiring on you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to piggyback on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_05]: River, we distribute Chi-Chan-Chong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to joke around, so we got both of
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about the quality of the product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure, it's a novelty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chi-Chan-Chong, it's great product.
[SPEAKER_05]: We sell it all the time only because it's
great product and that's why we have a
[SPEAKER_05]: team that goes out there and make sure
it's actually good product, actually good
[SPEAKER_05]: flower because we know that it's just
simply not going to sell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it might sell right away and it's
going to be a short time thing but that's
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely one to piggyback on that point
as a distributor who actually carries to
[SPEAKER_05]: brands for celebrities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think what they bring to the table
is attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a flash of look this way at your
company and they're encouraging an
[SPEAKER_04]: experience and if that experience is not
through the roof, people are for sure not
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be paying a premium.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a mistake that brands make
is charging the extra 20% over their
[SPEAKER_04]: standard thing to cover the licensing deal
that they just struck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Consumers won't pay it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know they can get the cheaper name of
your brand version and not the shiny
[SPEAKER_04]: package with the gold trim and it's the
same product inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I completely agree on that and I think
it works to a parallel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It depreciates the brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: It depreciates the celebrity or the
influencer involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the net result is that they've
lost money all the way around the envelope
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's expensive to bring brands.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's expensive to do new packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's expensive to do photo shoots and
coordinate social media content and do all
[SPEAKER_04]: these things that most of the brands in
this industry are just brand new at
[SPEAKER_04]: getting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, they strike up one of these expensive
deals, pay a large guarantee upfront and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's more high fives and pictures,
at least I've noticed, than actual value
[SPEAKER_04]: and ROI in the relationships.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's not as cut and dry as just
creating a product and putting it on the
[SPEAKER_03]: shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think everybody in here knows how
difficult that is and how to bring a
[SPEAKER_03]: product to market and I think if the
celebrity isn't fully endorsing and
[SPEAKER_03]: marketing the hell out of that product,
dispensaries are going to go, why am I
[SPEAKER_03]: carrying this product?
[SPEAKER_03]: The celebrity isn't even marketing it and
endorsing it and then you've got issues
[SPEAKER_03]: with distribution and sales teams and
people that are just trying to cash in and
[SPEAKER_03]: put products on the shelf that they don't
actually use that aren't authentic to the
[SPEAKER_03]: brand and dispensaries start asking
questions and they'll say, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: you just played a show in the city.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you guys come in and do meet and
greets?
[SPEAKER_03]: With Revolution, we've placed a big focus
on actually going into the stores and
[SPEAKER_03]: doing signings and doing giveaways and
marketing the product and posting videos
[SPEAKER_03]: and talking about it because the band
actually really does use and love the
[SPEAKER_03]: product and that comes across and I think
that people can see that there is an
[SPEAKER_03]: actual connection where they're not just
trying to slap their name on something and
[SPEAKER_03]: call it a day and hope that dispensaries
order the product and that sales teams
[SPEAKER_03]: sell the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's been an issue too but it's
also, we have seen it work for us because
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries are very open to something
like that and it's something special.
[SPEAKER_03]: Revolution just played two nights at Red
Rocks in Colorado and we went into the
[SPEAKER_03]: clinic and they sat down and they did a
table and they did a signing and everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: who comes in got a raffle to get tickets
to a sold out show and I think
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the fans can see that the band
actually loves and supports the product
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're more inclined to support it
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's a big thing to hit on
is that the band or the celebrity,
[SPEAKER_04]: the influencer, wherever it is needs to
love and support the product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's less about slapping that
name on the product and their followers
[SPEAKER_04]: knowing that they love and support
something because they want to participate
[SPEAKER_04]: and they want to enjoy the things that
those, the people that they idolize and
[SPEAKER_04]: that they think are the culture
tastemakers, they want to participate in
[SPEAKER_04]: the things that those people love and
participate in, not something that has
[SPEAKER_04]: their face on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something that's been
traditionally proven in I think other
[SPEAKER_04]: mainstream music, fashion, apparel
industries and now that it's coming over
[SPEAKER_04]: to cannabis, I think we had a flush of put
your face on it kind of brands and really
[SPEAKER_04]: generic products and we're seeing that
that's not something that's been effective
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think we're going to start seeing
more of a generalized brand that is
[SPEAKER_04]: supported by a collective of these
influencers that will be more effective
[SPEAKER_04]: long term.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to think about your brand
like this and I think that we can look at
[SPEAKER_01]: other industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have multiple products within your
portfolio that are going to be beyond,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to be tiered.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be some that are like
limited edition.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've poured your heart and soul into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it does have somebody that's being,
it's endorsed by, then think of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: look at your portfolio and say well I want
that shelf space up at the top and I want
[SPEAKER_01]: to have that beautiful high end product
that I maybe spent a lot more time
[SPEAKER_01]: curating or it has a little bit more sort
of something unique to it and then have
[SPEAKER_01]: your space in the middle where it's hey,
you might be targeting multiple consumers
[SPEAKER_01]: but do it in a way that resonates and has
a story behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be a reason why it's on that
top shelf and there should be a reason why
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have another piece of portfolio
that's taking that bottom I mean not to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it back to the alcohol industry but you go
into Safeway and there's three people in
[SPEAKER_01]: that game and they figured out ways to
create brands that are sitting on multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf spots and I think that's one thing
that I want to say is look at retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at what retail is doing and what
retail wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest thing that's going to happen
is if you don't have shelf space now,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to get it in a year
because that shelf space will be filled
[SPEAKER_01]: and if they're doing it right,
there's no one else that's going to,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not going to take that brand off
and put another brand on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fill that shelf space and do it in ways
that are creating a lot of value at each
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah and that's something we see with
brands.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone wants a high end brand and that's
all they want to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really great but using the
supermarket analogy, you're going to want
[SPEAKER_05]: your Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to want your Sierra Nevada.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to want some of those low to
mid to high grade products and you want to
[SPEAKER_05]: diversify your portfolio as a brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, you're not going to command
that shelf space and the shelf space
[SPEAKER_05]: issue, I could go on for days seeing that
as a distributor that's been an
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting challenge for distributors and
brands because you have some places in the
[SPEAKER_05]: state who are some retailers are saying
you have to pay me X amount of dollars to
[SPEAKER_05]: buy this shelf space and this goes on in
the liquor industry as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, it's been outlawed in the liquor
industry but you pay me X amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: dollars to put this on my shelf and I can
sell it and with no guarantees like
[SPEAKER_05]: they're going to push your brand or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something as brands and as
distributors, we need to have an honest
[SPEAKER_05]: discussion about maybe, sorry retailers,
I may be making you mad right now but
[SPEAKER_05]: that's one of the issues we've kind of
been dealing with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's a great point is look
to the retailers.
[SPEAKER_04]: In almost every other industry in the
world, the retailers are the one that
[SPEAKER_04]: determine size of package, type of
product, how many are sold together.
[SPEAKER_04]: They report back to the distributor.
[SPEAKER_04]: The distributor tells the manufacturers,
guys, this is what works at a retail level
[SPEAKER_04]: and this is how it's selling.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the product you need to make and a
lot of other industries, the retailer
[SPEAKER_04]: simply won't take product which means the
distributor won't buy it from the
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturer unless it meets their certain
criteria to encourage the most efficient
[SPEAKER_04]: sales in the store.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the retailers are eventually and it's
underrated now but you're starting to see
[SPEAKER_04]: retailers sell the shelf space and
understand their equity in the game.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be the determining factor on
what product is endorsed by a bud tender
[SPEAKER_04]: or somebody in the store level and what
actually gets sold.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that guys, let's give a big round
of applause for our panel that was
[SPEAKER_04]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to conclude our question
area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted to just open up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got about 15, 20 minutes of question
and answers, whatever you guys would like
[SPEAKER_04]: to answer and if you just want to stand up
or point, yep, perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Megan, okay, sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to elaborate on something
that you stated from the target
[SPEAKER_07]: segmentation and everything that is really
important.
[SPEAKER_07]: I come from the media marketing,
advertising background and I just wanted
[SPEAKER_07]: to kind of expand a little bit that yes,
that is definitely what brands and
[SPEAKER_07]: products need to do is to really look at,
you know, a strategic target segmentation.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also think that in addition to that,
the market research is also very
[SPEAKER_07]: important, understanding the market trends
and the category that you're in,
[SPEAKER_07]: what percentage that they're kind of.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I just asked him if I couldn't ask a
question.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I was just saying as well as
competitive, you know, analysis and so
[SPEAKER_07]: forth that it is really important to
understand and you guys were talking about
[SPEAKER_07]: in terms of, you know, the aisle and so
forth, the competitive analysis and
[SPEAKER_07]: information is just very important for
brands to make sure how they can also plan
[SPEAKER_07]: the same sandbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, and I, you know, when we,
when we look at brands in other
[SPEAKER_01]: industries, coffee, wine, commodity
products that we work in, we have data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that that person who is 35 years
old in San Francisco loves herself a pinot
[SPEAKER_01]: noir.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, the fact that we're not data
collecting and we're in it, there is a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of security and things at the dispensary
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back to what Dean said, you have to
control the end consumer, get their email,
[SPEAKER_01]: talk to them because you're not going to
get it from anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way that you're going to get
that information right now at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really try to get as much and gather as
much information about who's buying your
[SPEAKER_01]: product because that's the only way we're
going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was such a very good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to elaborate on the collecting
emails.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure everybody knows, but just in case
an easy way to do that is to just put an
[SPEAKER_03]: email signup form on your website right as
the website pops up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chances are it's going to say,
are you 21 and over?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have the email website up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're going in and you're doing in
dispensary demos, have an email signup
[SPEAKER_03]: sheet and just say, hey, someone comes up
like, oh, I love this product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really helped my back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sign up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us your email address.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the next time we launch a new product,
you'll get it first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the next time we're coming back to
Santa Ana at the front desk, on the earth
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary, you'll know first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can come in and you can check us
out and give us your email.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll give you discount codes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll run a contest on your website
and say, sign up for our email.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll give you 15% off your next order
of whatever the product is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be creative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give people incentives.
[SPEAKER_03]: But technically, that's the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go to companies like MailChimp,
and they have software that allows you to
[SPEAKER_03]: import all of the email addresses that
you've collected and then easily export
[SPEAKER_03]: and send out an email with whatever you
want to design and put on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wondered if you could comment on maybe
some less direct marketing things that
[SPEAKER_00]: companies can be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I really appreciate is
having a longer-term vision with it and
[SPEAKER_00]: education programs and sponsorship,
where it's not necessarily directly trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to sell a brand or product, but educating
the consumer on how to use it and how it
[SPEAKER_00]: might be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the companies that are maybe
using that approach as their way of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting in front of the consumer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think collaboration is key in
those things.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for instance, I'll just use my own
organization, Supernova.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do a lot of outreach to black and brown
communities.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't necessarily do expungement
clinics, because that's very
[SPEAKER_08]: labor-intensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've partnered with SSDP, and they do
expungement clinics.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we just sponsor them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, sponsoring with other maybe
nonprofit organizations or any
[SPEAKER_08]: organizations that are doing educational
outreach.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just your logo being on there is brand
recognition.
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes five to seven times for someone
to see your logo in order for it to really
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of click and resonate with them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, it makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: And with that, it's really just a lot
about collaborating with other folks.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have the bandwidth to do certain
things.
[SPEAKER_08]: You collaborate with someone that can.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of our top brands at River do
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they're doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going out and promoting the
benefits of their product.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's with the retailers alongside our
sales team.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And get on board.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, something that I've seen be very
effective in that regard is supporting the
[SPEAKER_04]: community, holding it up, being a part of
it, and participating.
[SPEAKER_04]: The most successful brands that I've seen
to date are the ones who have invested the
[SPEAKER_04]: most in supporting in hidden ways,
helping other people carry boxes,
[SPEAKER_04]: helping companies use their license when
they were going out of business,
[SPEAKER_04]: housing people during the fires.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not things that hit the news
headlights, but our brand is doing a great
[SPEAKER_04]: job of building equity and building within
the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like building up your social equity is a
very real thing here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the industry is still cottage enough
where that has a ton of value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to add to that, get on nonprofit
boards in your community.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not seeing enough people in the
cannabis industry having a voice in
[SPEAKER_01]: powerful boards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe there's a lot of nonprofits that
could use more education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not even the thought of a
cannabis industry having a seat at the
[SPEAKER_01]: table.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have banking.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of big health professionals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have electeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have people in different industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sit on boards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be a voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work a lot in food and agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just doing this huge event called
Women in Ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was so disappointed that there was
no one represented in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is that even possible that we're
having a legal environment here where
[SPEAKER_01]: people are growing something and that
there was not one woman in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: So please sit at the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please make sure that you're on nonprofit
boards, even outside your industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great way for you to show that
there's brand equity and that you're also
[SPEAKER_01]: making a difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: And get on your local chamber of commerce.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we're an economic powerhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're bringing tax revenue to the door for
these cities.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the state, we'll bring more
eventually to the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's been a whole nother issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we are really an economic powerhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: And cities are looking to us for a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for revenue, they're struggling.
[SPEAKER_05]: All these cities are struggling.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have pension debt.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have all sorts of debt.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're looking at the cannabis industry
to kind of help solve those problems.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do have some power when we come to
those tables.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also do consulting around branding and
packaging work.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wanted to ask each panelist,
just real quick, can you name or think of
[SPEAKER_06]: one brand besides your own that you love
the design, you think the branding is on
[SPEAKER_06]: point, something that's really sharp and
that stands out to you in today's market?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Broccoli Magazine is doing an
amazing job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's beautifully designed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It talks to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love lifestyle brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Kinfolk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love great design.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Broccoli Magazine's doing a
great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that are advertising in
Broccoli Magazine are doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a product standpoint, I think Bebo's
doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bloom Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bloom Farms does a great job for multiple
reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great packaging, great design,
but even better transparency in their
[SPEAKER_01]: storytelling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I know the cold front.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I know the cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I know the farmers,
and they're doing a great job through
[SPEAKER_01]: social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'd say Dosist has done a really
good job of spanning people that are not
[SPEAKER_02]: in the industry again and to understand
the value of the brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, there's a lot of brands
that make a lot of noise but don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: the sales that really follow on being on
existing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do, and so I think that'd be one that
I'd call out.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to be a fangirl to you and say Big
Peach Treats.
[SPEAKER_08]: Big Peach Treats website just blew me
away.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: And really the story and what Big Peach
Treats has been doing over the years.
[SPEAKER_08]: They participate very heavily within the
Santa Cruz community.
[SPEAKER_08]: They do a lot of beach cleanups.
[SPEAKER_08]: They work with the veterans in the area in
the Santa Cruz Veterans Alliance.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have so much respect for Big Peach
Treats.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're doing an amazing job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Flo Conner is doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think their storytelling is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think their message is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the designs are great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with Dosist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a simple man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the clean lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like minimalism.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're doing great in terms of
their packaging and their design.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't necessarily like to be told how
much I should be consuming for like the
[SPEAKER_03]: dose part of it with the vibration,
but that's just my personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I like to take a smaller or a
bigger, and I don't like to be told,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you need to be doing this much
because each person is different,
[SPEAKER_03]: but their packaging is outstanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really like what they're doing with
trying to push sustainability and
[SPEAKER_03]: recycling, how they have the drop stations
and the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's really cool too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to use two brands, the River
Carries, Lulz and Utopia.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're all doing a great brand,
especially Utopia on the community
[SPEAKER_05]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once again, based out of Santa Cruz,
they're just a really great company,
[SPEAKER_05]: really great people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is Lulz.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're killing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's other brands out there like
Candesit and stuff that I feel are doing
[SPEAKER_05]: really well, so kudos to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need more of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I think for me, it would have to
be Apothecanna from a lotion side.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think their aesthetic and their company
angle and mission is one that really
[SPEAKER_04]: resonates with us and a lot of people in
our kind of world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the other end, from like a flower
product, I think Henry's and their story
[SPEAKER_04]: and their packaging and the way their
employees and the way they talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: their brand, their language is something
that they've really entitled to.
I think that's really cool.
