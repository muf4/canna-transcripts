[SPEAKER_00]: I always just do, you know, wet paper
towel and wait a couple days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what, what's your, if you had,
for example, these are all from Pacific
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest roots, I have other stuff,
but like, if you had 20 seeds or 50 seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: for your home grow, what's kind of your
starting point from a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: hard seed to sprouting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So seed germination is really what the
main goal is to, is to get liquid to be
[SPEAKER_01]: imbibed into the actual embryo so that we
can activate it chemically, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We get the enzymes moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the problem is, is that people
sometimes think old seed will,
[SPEAKER_01]: will not open up quickly and new seed will
open up quickly because all you see is the
[SPEAKER_01]: exterior of the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you're, the tough to make,
the part that makes it hard to crack seed
[SPEAKER_01]: knowingly is did the person who made the
seed or did the seed that was collected in
[SPEAKER_01]: wild, did it actually go through its full
cycle and put on a full carbohydrate load
[SPEAKER_01]: within the embryo so that it's stored in
the quarterly as they come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it starts to turn into a plant
once we start to get real photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact that you don't know how much
carbohydrate is stored in the seed is the
[SPEAKER_01]: issue that I see most people have seed
crack and issues with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what happens is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have enough food in the seed
when it opens, when it imbibes and the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant starts to emerge, there's not enough
stored carbohydrates for this plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually open up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when people go into soil direct,
which is really how like all farms are run
[SPEAKER_01]: in all other ag, they don't start them and
then transplant and they go direct seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the thing is, is they know that the
seed they're using is loaded and ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with cannabis seed, certain people
do better jobs with their seed production
[SPEAKER_01]: and some batches come out better than
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them that have been stored for
time on is viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I always recommend with cannabis
seed is not to direct seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I like to do first is take the
collection of seed that I'm going to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with by variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just put it into a little baby food
jar or a shot glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I have extremely rare seeds that I
think are something from the past that I
[SPEAKER_01]: know are old, I go a little bit further
than just putting water in the container.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll use something like a seed tea so you
can germinate beans and pull the liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: off and use that liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that liquid is loaded with all these
hormones and enzymes that came from that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's directly a stimulant for other
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, when you say germinate beans,
do you mean like dry, like white beans?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything you want to germinate because
ultimately any bean that you can get your
[SPEAKER_01]: hands on that you soak in water and pull
off that liquid, it's enzymatically
[SPEAKER_01]: charged to assist in the germination of
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go really deep into seed tea
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is, is if you have stuff
that's old, so in your hands right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have all this brand new stuff and Kai
is a good breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he knows what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He produces a really good product and he's
been doing it for a long time
[SPEAKER_01]: consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with stock like his, all I need to do
is open that container, get a container of
[SPEAKER_01]: regular water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be distilled water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pull it right off the tap.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're lucky in the country where our taps
come in around like six, seven,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're in the Bay area and you had
eight, three, really treated water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what LA and stuff like that
is, but same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it'd be better if you picked up some
distilled water because all you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to use that water for is just to moisten
the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I do is I throw the seed into
that container and I usually add like a
[SPEAKER_01]: tiny drop of some type of non-ionic
surfactant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like a cocoa wet, just
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I stirred in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it does is it coats the seed with
that material, which allows the water to
[SPEAKER_01]: bond to it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I get better penetration and I
let the seed sit in that jar at least 24,
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 hours and every, you know, six,
seven hours I'll walk in with the pen and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just stir the container and let them
swirl around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are fully submerged.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just, they're floating at first
because they haven't imbibed the liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that, that surfactant bonds to the
pericarp, the skin of the seed and allows
[SPEAKER_01]: you to get water to actually connect on
like a molecular level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just swirl them around a
couple of times and I'll walk in once or
[SPEAKER_01]: twice during that whole 24, 30 hour
process and I'll give it a little spin
[SPEAKER_01]: with the pencil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time 30 hours have gone by,
you should see all of them at the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: if they've imbibed the liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's a couple of floaters,
you can take a look and realize that they
[SPEAKER_01]: are floaters where they're not going to
pick up any liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've been in there for 30 hours and
they're just still floating on the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can those, but it's typically you're
going to see, you know, 95% of the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: that you put in the container will hit the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take those seeds out and I pour it out
onto a paper towel so that I can then
[SPEAKER_01]: spread them out a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just have a pair of really nice
precision tweezers and I just pick up each
[SPEAKER_01]: seed and I place it into the media that
I'm going to use to do my actual true
[SPEAKER_01]: germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I've done in that jar is I've
imbibed liquid into the embryo and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: got it moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when I go into the media that I'm
going to use, I really like to use
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's like a screen mix,
which means that it's really fine,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's got a composite of material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a mix of cocoa, mix of pea,
little bit of some kind of pumice so that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very light and highly aerated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I like to do is I don't put a
hole in the dirt at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pre-wet the tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the tray has been wet and then I just
take the seed and I literally put it right
[SPEAKER_01]: on top of that soil, right in the middle
on each one of those little cell flats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once everything's set in place,
I have this ultra fine mister.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just run over the top and it beds them
right in, in like a 16th to a 32nd inch
[SPEAKER_01]: covering of the media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all we're trying to do is get it
to darken up so that the plant doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: prematurely desiccate before it opens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the plants grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't already entate the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't worry about putting it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bottom line is a plant phototropic and
gravitropic, which means the roots are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go down whether you like it or
not, and the shoots are going to go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so once we lay it on that,
that tray and we give it a light misting,
[SPEAKER_01]: it beds them at this perfect depth to
where you're not challenging the seed to
[SPEAKER_01]: have enough stored energy to emerge from
half inch three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen people bury seeds deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you, when you don't get the
germination, what I used to do is I used
[SPEAKER_01]: to take the pots and we would cut them in
half and open them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can see that the seed had
opened and had extended three eighths of
[SPEAKER_01]: an inch, but did not have any more energy
to go any further and subsequently died
[SPEAKER_01]: within that soil chamber.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you lay the seed as a delicate layer
on top and just wet it in and then sit it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and ideally I would have it with decent
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, the taproot has not popped
out yet, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, you're going to see the emergence
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see the seeds swollen and
you'll start to see a crack and you'll see
[SPEAKER_01]: the very beginning of that tap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I don't worry about all the
seed because when you're doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: seed trying to put each one in the hole
exactly as it is when the water hits it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to move a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main point is if that we crack it and
open it so that it doesn't have to fight
[SPEAKER_01]: to get out of the shell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can bury it into the media
shallow and then get the bottom end to be
[SPEAKER_01]: around 78 82 where the tray itself is
around 78 82 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things are going to jump.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as soon as I get my first true
leaf, so you'll coil the lead and it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: pop out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was your embryo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then then you get your first true
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once those first true leaves are there,
you're able to start treating it with a
[SPEAKER_01]: stronger nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we when we typically put the
plant into that pot, we don't really need
[SPEAKER_01]: any nutrients at that moment because they
should be stored within the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as soon as we see the plant make
its emergence, we'll see to quite a lead
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll see the first true leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as those first tree leaves come
in, that's when we fertilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be your sequence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once we fertilize it and soak
them down, now we start to be able to have
[SPEAKER_01]: everything present to build a nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't want to go into heavily
fertilized soil as your base soil just
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's a little aggressive for a
young seedling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so organically, this is your you can
do this organically, chemically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make a difference how you
deliver it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the fact that the plant wants to
be a moisture than it needs to have
[SPEAKER_01]: aeration and adequate temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you personally don't use like cubes
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go straight to soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rather go straight as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's let's define soil as soilless.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soil not dug from the ground out of the
earth, but something that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: manufactured.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I most definitely would prefer to go
into that than cubes, because the the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole thing was if you're especially if
you're doing a lot of them, the cost per
[SPEAKER_01]: oasis or the cost per rockwell is so
disproportionately high compared to the
[SPEAKER_01]: cost of regular media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are excellent for propagation
of clonal because the the the
[SPEAKER_01]: applicability of an inert media lets you
go anywhere with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of any direction, any kind of
cultivation system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I'm cracking seed, I'm looking
for something that's affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: These trays turn it so I can see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are nice, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are excellent for me for clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love those for cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I'm cracking seed, because I used
to do a lot of seed, I would I would
[SPEAKER_01]: always do it out of a screen mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I could buy something like what's a
good mix right now that you can buy
[SPEAKER_01]: commercially baby roots from Soil King.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Soil King out of Cloverdale has a big
roots mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a baby roots mix that kicks ass
for doing seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already been pre-screened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you don't have to screen it
yourself through a screen to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no clumpy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you just lay the tray,
soak it and you seed it, the cost per tray
[SPEAKER_01]: is is, you know, nickels, 20 cents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's cheap when you get right down
to how much it's costing you to fill the
[SPEAKER_01]: tray versus 10, 11 bucks for an oasis
sheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, depending on what what
quantity count where you're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the cost differences is the
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so seedlings do wonderful in Rockwell
and seedlings do wonderful in Oasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do phenomenal in those cubes
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, for the average home
individual, I'm like, buy a bag of seed
[SPEAKER_01]: mix and put it in your closet and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have enough seed mix to grow seed
for the next five years if you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: working small crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now get into the like B1 and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do you personally add anything to,
you know, the whole like root growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant shock and plant stress?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason being is that if you
really, you know, like in California legal
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, you're not allowed to use really
any hormones anymore for rooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't really use I don't think you
can use endopiteric acid or napalicetic
[SPEAKER_01]: acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are those were plant acids that we
utilize to help drive rooting in
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use them in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like Clon-X or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that kind of exactly in Clon-X
combination of both of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not allowed to use that anymore
in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not certified for cannabis
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are meant those are meant for
like ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can buy it at the store,
but it's not meant for food production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so cannabis is regulated as a food
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you use those to do clonal aids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you end up doing is you just end
up creating healthier plants and you
[SPEAKER_01]: strike less viable ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just call right out of the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so California, as you're going into
propagation, you have a little different
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy because you don't have the tools
to make things bite like you once did.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the seeds, you don't need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you take a look at any of these
like commercial rooting aids, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: basically a little bit of kelp to make it
look dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're adding some type of soy
isolate protein to it, which is extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient in getting the plant to move
aggressively.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bottom line is you can buy soy
isolate protein relatively cheap compared
[SPEAKER_01]: to paying huge money for it mixed into a
can with a little bit of kelp to make it
[SPEAKER_01]: look like it's some kind of special
concoction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at the labels on those
products, they're really they're they're
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrients in a organic matrix with
some form of soy isolate, something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to allow you to get high nitrogen
availability right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing with transplanting is that
if you're going to go from like a water
[SPEAKER_01]: system, which gives you incredible
rooting, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using water, you get root water roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go water roots into water systems,
they're unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go water roots into soil,
it takes a minute for the plant to bite
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, they do bite in and yeah,
they have great root balls on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a there's a transition where
the plant's having to form the structure
[SPEAKER_01]: of the root and the chemistry of the root
to work with the media that's on hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the fastest way to get any
transplant would be to utilize the system
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're going to use in the end
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's going to go soilless,
it can move through all soil assistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to go into the plug that
you just showed that composite rubber,
[SPEAKER_01]: some kind of organic material,
they wolf into a matrix that can go pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much into anything because it has
movability.
[SPEAKER_01]: The root cubes, they're good, too,
because ultimately the root is held inside
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, anything that's outside,
it's going to die off pretty much when you
[SPEAKER_01]: put it into the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be the new roots that come
out of it that make that biting
[SPEAKER_01]: connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're trying to do,
you know, an easy rooting transition,
[SPEAKER_01]: then what you're trying to make sure is
that you're looking downstream of where is
[SPEAKER_01]: the end plant going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just match the media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use and doesn't be the exact media,
but it has to be similar to the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: developing the system for the transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why usually your transplant mixes
are very simple and light and fluffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it can go into anything from
there because you're not having a large
[SPEAKER_01]: container roots that are going to have to
readapt and develop.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anyone that you respect who
you've had conversations with about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this like popping seeds to
transplanting where they have a totally
[SPEAKER_00]: they do something that like is different
than what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, not what I do,
but that's actually kind of interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: how you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I mean, I've been I've
been in prop for a really long time as a
[SPEAKER_01]: career.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I I had I had some commercial
education in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I functionally did it for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it let me experiment with a lot of
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I know is that I've met a river
of people who have little subtleties on
[SPEAKER_01]: how they go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people who do this really they do a
nice job where they use one gallon Ziploc
[SPEAKER_01]: bags as mini greenhouses and they lay a
rolled up paper towel in the bottom of it
[SPEAKER_01]: as the rooting matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they set the imbibe seed in a line all
the way across and they hang it up where
[SPEAKER_01]: it gets indirect light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the seedling grows straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, they when they when they
cut open the bag, they just with the
[SPEAKER_01]: parasitic scissor, chop the paper towel
and they have a little paper towel ball of
[SPEAKER_01]: roots and a stem and coiled lead and true
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, sometimes I laugh because the
seedlings look so damn good like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny, but they've got them all
pinned to a wall in a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each bag is labeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: But their success on that stuff was just
unreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really about what works for you
and your personal life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning like for me, because I did
commercial work and I had commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities, then I'd be able to utilize
racks, watering system and and assistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for a lot of people, if you just
cracking the seed, it has to be simple for
[SPEAKER_01]: you so that it doesn't get away from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because once you once you heat them up,
you kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you dry them out, you kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you keep them too moist and not enough
light, you'll you'll get some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: damping off.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using too much light,
they'll they'll scavenge themselves too
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they haven't formed a root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like all these little things of how you
screw up is really what you have to kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of, you know, take a look at yourself and
figure out how do you get around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I've seen people use heating
pads that you would use on your elbows to
[SPEAKER_01]: crack seeds, where you go in the go in the
seed room and there's a heating pad with a
[SPEAKER_01]: little three way piece on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's winter time, they hit high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's summertime, they hit low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've done unbelievable seed
germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I don't think there's any one
method of doing it best.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that the one that I use has
always worked for me well because it gives
[SPEAKER_01]: me a tray of seedlings in a material that
I can utilize in the things that I go work
[SPEAKER_01]: with next.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with with clones like I've never been a
fan of humidity domes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use humidity domes or are you I
feel like they make kind of wimpy plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they they serve a purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, ideally, like the best way I think
you can do propagation aside and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's just we'll take micro prop out of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll take laboratory prop up because
that's out of the range of most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, the best system is is spray tables
and greenhouses because spray tables allow
[SPEAKER_01]: you to be able to, you know, and you get
if you can put a fertigation solution in
[SPEAKER_01]: so that you get mild nutrients spraying on
the plants, keeping your moisture levels
[SPEAKER_01]: high the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's using some type of sensor to indicate
how much moisture you want present.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the climate changes, it changes how
that frequency occurs so that you're never
[SPEAKER_01]: going to over wet or under wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can utilize any type of tray
material you really want once you once you
[SPEAKER_01]: dial in the amount of water load.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like that system best for just pure
simplicity where you cut the tray and
[SPEAKER_01]: stick it on a table and walk away from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But humidity domes were always for
operations where you don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to treat that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in some systems, you know,
you'll you'll miss the whole room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll increase the moisture in a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me here in Humboldt County,
the problem with moisturize in a room is
[SPEAKER_01]: that when we get the wet season in the in
the half of the year, we create mold
[SPEAKER_01]: factories that are present in the rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to be able to control the
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the summertime, sprays are a lot
easier because you're going to suck that
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture up into the air and then you can
pull it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the wintertime, any kind of excess
water in the spaces that we did prop with
[SPEAKER_01]: just didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chains are over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I use prop trays and domes for
indoor operations because it allows you to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to control the environment a lot
more simply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not difficult to utilize if
you just go through the hardening process,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're using them just to keep the
moisture level constant so you can strike
[SPEAKER_01]: a root.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you strike the root, then you can
start to harden them off and then you pull
[SPEAKER_01]: the lids and then bam, now you're in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they work really well for controlled
environments where you don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to put that much water down as a
spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: The spray tables to me are best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and then micro propagation where,
you know, you're propagating at a density
[SPEAKER_01]: and a rate of success.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just you have to see it to believe
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plants coming off of that are the
are the everloving opposite of wimpy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something coming off a TC.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that is a Herculean little plant
because they're completely hormonally
[SPEAKER_01]: charged and they have no obstructions on
them for any kind of pathogen.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
