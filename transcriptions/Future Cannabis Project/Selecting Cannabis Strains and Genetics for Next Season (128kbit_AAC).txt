[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're talking about more of the
coveted, the top shelf right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, thousands of different
cultivars and strains and substrains and
[SPEAKER_01]: cross breads and back breads and all the
rest of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you determine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how do you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we know some trendy ones like
Gorilla Glue blew up and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubba 97 and blue skittles we were just
talking about, or even some of the more
[SPEAKER_01]: modern cushions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is there a way for you to kind of get
feedback from the open market to go,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, maybe I should do something that's a
bit of maybe a retro Acapulco Gold crossed
[SPEAKER_01]: with Northern Lights?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a company called Seed Junkie,
but there are seed junkies out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a whole phenomena of people that
are paying attention to the breeders that
[SPEAKER_00]: are coming out with the new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we're seeing trends,
you know, OGs for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it was everything with cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, like, Purple Punch came on the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm seeing all these things that are
crossed with Purple Punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's just always going to be an
evolving thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how do you know that's going to
hit or going to become a hit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it boils down to, well,
A, the quality of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, B, is marketing and
market outreach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, get someone that's well known to
hype it up and, you know, really covet
[SPEAKER_00]: that or win a cup with that stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's kind of another artistry and
beauty in growing cannabis is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: sky's the limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we're just getting into
breeding on my farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trying to do some selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, that is all that's a lot of
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take much space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really high volume production and low
square footage or small square footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's attractive in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always attractive to make
something new and exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think once we get all our operations
in place, that that's going to be the next
[SPEAKER_00]: fun thing is to focus on breeding and work
with other breeders that are and then
[SPEAKER_00]: using their their material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone like Kevin is like super into
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets out on that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it almost takes over the
passion from growing the plant to just
[SPEAKER_00]: being the breeding factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that hunt and seeing what
males are going to be that you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: select and teaming them up with the
females and, you know, just creating that
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's wizardry, artistry,
and a little bit of luck, I'd say,
[SPEAKER_00]: in all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get some of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we can bring the lab into the
equation, but I'm a little bit of a seed
[SPEAKER_01]: hunter and I'm looking for someone's like
I'm looking and I've I've heard it exists
[SPEAKER_01]: in Amsterdam that someone has a true pure
Acapulco gold, not some sort of cross
[SPEAKER_01]: bread or back bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an art.
[SPEAKER_01]: One concern I have is, you know,
something great comes along, but we're so
[SPEAKER_01]: busy trying to constantly innovate and
change it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, in the States,
it's kind of a race to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us that are purists are a little
bummed that it's this whole THC race to,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I've got a Chernobyl that's a 36
percent and a 38 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's overkill.
[SPEAKER_01]: My concern is if everyone's racing to the
next thing, what about some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: coveted strains we loved and grew up with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a like a true northern lights,
you know, which I know Jodri has.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know he's got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like, are we going to miss out on
some of those coveted too?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it really bothers me that
people pay so much attention to hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like whatever or potency levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I personally would never judge
any cannabis that I want to consume or
[SPEAKER_00]: checking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not just a percentage by the
percentage or whether it's a hybrid or
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when it's growing, it's very
obvious for most growers to tell that it
[SPEAKER_00]: has some sativa qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like sativas, but everything pretty
much at this point, unless you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: into some true land racing, everything's a
hybrid, whether it's sativa dominant or
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid or indica dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all such it's all cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at something that's like a
Skittles, which is always low.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have much bag appeal.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually tests around 14 percent,
but it tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a blue diamond, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a blue side of that equation
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a well-rounded and Jodri gets
into and I think it's the next phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what I love Mersin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a lemony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's certain turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that I love more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but it's funny you mention that
because, you know, I was back at the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis with Ricardo Bacca.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a whole documentary he is in
called Rolling Paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the producer every opportunity had he
had asked is he's like, are you high right
[SPEAKER_01]: now?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in asking someone if they're
high right now in this industry is very
[SPEAKER_01]: similar to asking someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you indica or sativa?
[SPEAKER_01]: I laugh when someone asks that because,
yeah, if I had to choose, I'm an indica
[SPEAKER_01]: indica dominant guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a nighttime medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an advocate on the medicinal side.
[SPEAKER_01]: My elements more so I deal with in the
evenings at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's funny when people are like indica
sativa or hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like really pretty much every I would
venture to guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what your I'd say 80% plus
out there hybrids right on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just crazy to think that
someone has a pure sativa or pure indica
[SPEAKER_01]: because your point land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's only if you can find
something that's truly out of Afghan or
[SPEAKER_01]: truly out of, you know, South Africa,
truly out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Mhm.
