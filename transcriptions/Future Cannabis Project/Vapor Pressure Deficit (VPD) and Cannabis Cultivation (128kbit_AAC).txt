[SPEAKER_02]: So vapor pressure deficit, it's the cat's
meow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So VPD is really important for a lot of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most importantly, VPD controls plant
evapotranspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So VPD is the vapor pressure deficit and
it is the difference between the vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure saturated conditions versus vapor
pressure at the room conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say you have a room that you're
controlling to 75 degrees and 50 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: relative humidity, there's a vapor
pressure associated with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that difference in vapor pressure
between saturation in the room conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: is what the plant sees when it's going to
transpire and move water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally, if you think about it,
it's literally the pressure that the air
[SPEAKER_00]: is putting on the plants to transpire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we have a high vapor pressure
deficit, that usually means that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty dry in the room and plants will
want to use more water to transpire.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have a lower vapor pressure
deficit and it's more humid in the room,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's less pressure on the plant to
transpire.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really key for both water and
nutrient delivery from the roots through
[SPEAKER_00]: the shoots and the leaves and going to the
flowers and the fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also very important for the plant to
be able to regulate its own temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: through evaporative cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the plant transpires, it's also
evaporatively cooling itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so VPD on the HVAC side of things,
when we're trying to size equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: also affects how well that equipment is
able to remove moisture and dehumidify the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we have a really high vapor
pressure deficit, what happens is that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have sort of this double whammy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants, they transpire more because
the air is dry and so they're putting more
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that high vapor pressure deficit is
also really hard for HVAC equipment to
[SPEAKER_00]: operate and remove the moisture that the
plants put into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have more moisture in the room
and it takes now more energy for the HVAC
[SPEAKER_00]: system to remove that moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could find a vapor pressure deficit
where the plants are going to be really
[SPEAKER_00]: happy and not use excessive water and the
HVAC equipment can operate efficiently,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we're going to have a win-win
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's that magic number?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the magic number in general for vapor
pressure deficit is one, 1.0 kilopascals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we use this as a general target
for a lot of crops like tomatoes and
[SPEAKER_00]: cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lettuce plants, because they're more
vegetative, we tend to like a smaller or a
[SPEAKER_00]: lower vapor pressure deficit, a little bit
more humid air.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cannabis plants, what's going on is
that all these growers are so afraid of
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, they're so afraid of mold that
they're driving the humidity down,
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing that vapor pressure deficit and
are inadvertently putting more pressure on
[SPEAKER_00]: their plants and more strain on their HVAC
equipment to remove that moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can convince growers that having
a VPD of 1 kilopascal like every other
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, then we're going to be better in
terms of plant health and HVAC health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so I understand, we do want plants to
transpire?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant transpiration is the movement of
water from the roots through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from its roots through its shoot and
its stems and its leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is what's responsible for moving
the water and the nutrients to the
[SPEAKER_00]: different parts of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every plant, the leaves have stomata on
the bottom of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those stomata are like little mouths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're responsible for sucking CO2 in
for photosynthesis, but then also
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing the oxygen from that
photosynthesis and for releasing that
[SPEAKER_00]: water vapor via transpiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is transpiration determined by like a
rate of transpiration?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is it measured?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the rate of transpiration is hard to
measure, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's probably one of the biggest
challenges we have as HVAC engineers is
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure out what that moisture
load is in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a grower, if you are already
actively growing, you can measure how much
[SPEAKER_00]: water is you're delivering to the plant
through irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how much water is being drained
away from, say, the pot or the growing
[SPEAKER_00]: media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever is left is really what's
going to get transpired by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant really only holds on to maybe a
couple percentages of the water that gets
[SPEAKER_00]: delivered to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you say, I deliver one gallon per
plant per day, well, right off the top,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can probably lop off 30% to 35% of that
water to drainage and then maybe 2% to 5%
[SPEAKER_00]: for what stays in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, 60% of that one gallon is
what's getting delivered to the room and
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have to remove via
dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk about VPD gone wrong when
you're above 1 and things you would see,
[SPEAKER_03]: the cause and effect or the effect of it
being above 1.0 and what you might see if
[SPEAKER_03]: it's way below 1.0?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so vapor pressure deficit,
if we don't manage it well, can have
[SPEAKER_00]: negative effects both abiotically and
biotically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is the abiotic is
things like having poor nutrient delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: and water delivery to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most simple case of that is having
a wilting plant, a wilting leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the vapor pressure deficit is really
high and it's really dry in the room and
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't have a well-watered crop,
then the plant is going to wilt because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not enough water to keep up with
that vapor pressure on the plant exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that, if the plant is
transpiring really quickly, what happens
[SPEAKER_00]: is that it can't pull calcium along with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you actually see, like in
lettuce plants or in leaves, you see leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: tip burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rim of a leaf will turn yellow
because of a calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: In tomatoes, we see it as blossom and rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, the bottom of a tomato fruit
will turn black because there's no calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: being delivered to that fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can happen both when you have a very
dry environment without enough water going
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plant and actually also a humid
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it's too humid and the vapor
pressure is too low, then there's not
[SPEAKER_00]: enough pressure on the plant to move water
and nutrients through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually see the same condition
when it's too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is biotic deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those are things like powdery
mildew and botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the VPD is really low and it's very
humid, sure, you have a risk of having
[SPEAKER_00]: molds that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what people also don't realize is that
when you have a really high vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: deficit, you're stressing the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like humans, when plants get
stressed, their immune system goes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they actually become more
susceptible to diseases when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: stressed out because of high vapor
pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are trying to create this
really dry environment so that we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get molds to set in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we're stressing the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the one little mold spore that's out
there is going to really dive into that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to get powdery mildew
because it can't fight against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this about education?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are growers aware of VPD?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they know about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, more and more growers know about
vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm definitely out there pounding
the pavement, speaking at way too many
[SPEAKER_00]: conferences, giving workshops,
doing all these things, trying to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: word out that vapor pressure deficit is so
critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the plant's health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am very encouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm even seeing posts on Instagram and
LinkedIn and Facebook where people are
[SPEAKER_00]: talking more about vapor pressure deficit
and understand what it is and why it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm very encouraged by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly we got to get the word out
more and educate people more so they
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the ramifications both for the
plant, but also for HVAC equipment sizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if we have to oversize a piece of
equipment two times of what, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: at a VPD of 1.5 and what we needed at a
healthy one, I mean, what are we doing to
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're saying that that's basically
not necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can save energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can save on costs for buying the
equipment, for operating the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we have a happy plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy plant, happy HVAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously cultivators are rightly
concerned about mold, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can lose their entire crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they find themselves in the middle,
you know, in this tough position.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the goal to create like a guide or
measurements that they can use to create
[SPEAKER_01]: the right environment ahead of time to
reduce VPD?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is that what the researchers or,
you know, what can they, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm asking, is the goal is to create the
right environment so that you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: too much VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really what it is, is finding that
sweet spot, finding that combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and relative humidity where we
hit a vapor pressure deficit that's around
[SPEAKER_00]: one kilopascal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a chart on our website and there's
a few other charts that are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: floating around there that say,
hey, look, you know, at 75 degrees and 50%
[SPEAKER_00]: relative humidity, it's 1.5 kilopascals.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to keep that same temperature
and raise the relative humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to creep up to 1.25
kilopascals, 1.1 kilopascals, 1
[SPEAKER_00]: kilopascal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a given temperature, you can find
the relative humidity that's going to hit
[SPEAKER_00]: the VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not create mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
Thank you.
Thank you.
