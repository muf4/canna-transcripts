[SPEAKER_01]: My name's AJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a second generation farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: My parents got into it and I naturally
took to doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think 12, 13, we'd get paid a little
money to dig holes and stuff like that in
[SPEAKER_01]: our kids and grew my first crop at 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a few plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and my buddy got a little spot on a
ridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when it started with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been growing ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things used to be a lot different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to grow up in the tops of trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of a technique that I
pioneered, at least in my area,
[SPEAKER_01]: and was somewhat legendary for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been building the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been in the same spot for the last 30,
actually 32 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been slowly but surely evolving
our farm into what it is now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have a couple acres of permitted
cannabis in the center of a 280 acre piece
[SPEAKER_01]: of property.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Humboldt County, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much close to the center of the
Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Southern Humboldt, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We started with a smaller property and we
were able to acquire property next to it
[SPEAKER_01]: to make it larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't start off on a 280 acre
parcel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started off on a 40 acre parcel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to buy the property next to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some more land came up for sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we got to expand a bit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's been the 288 for about 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been that size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're like 1200 feet elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get some cool river fog that comes
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not consistently all year, but certain
times the cool river fog comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Afternoon winds come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely, I mean, there's so
many microclimates up here that we're kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of on a southern, gentle southern slope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the air is kind of sliding down the
hill when it gets cool and it's pushing up
[SPEAKER_01]: the hill through the plants when it's
warm, getting hotter in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been working mostly with the SFVOG
and it loves it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too dense of a strain has trouble with
Prusitis as a challenge with rot at
[SPEAKER_01]: certain times because of the cooler
nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the OGs, sour diesel, really,
really do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We primarily grow in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a few pots around, but we mostly
grow in beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of our soil is about, we brought in
soil, mixed it in with the native soil
[SPEAKER_01]: about seven years ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we amend it, test it, see what it
needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have earthworms and beetles and lots of
the good beneficial stuff growing in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One part of the garden is we have some 400
gallon smart pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest are holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: For our long term, we have holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're about the same size.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're about three feet deep by six by
six.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have primarily beds that are tilled
into the ground with potting soil mixed in
[SPEAKER_01]: and then annual amendments to amend that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are eight foot wide beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at pictures of our farm
and see the terraced, they're kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: terraced on a gentle slope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those, yeah, that's how we primarily
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say 80% is in the beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do eight foot by 90.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight by 90.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amended in native mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't put a barrier underneath it
or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got, I mean, the soil, you know,
the spring when it's just like a dark,
[SPEAKER_01]: rich brown, you know, it's a pretty nice,
nice soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys plant a lot of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do a no till or do you till all
those cover crops back into the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: We till them back in because we get
started pretty early as soon as the
[SPEAKER_01]: weather's permitting for depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, they get tilled in.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few of the later ones, kind of got a
chance to completely finish out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just knock them down with the weed
eater and till them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're, you know, lush and a
little less mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just take the tiller right to them
and chop them up because they're all crisp
[SPEAKER_01]: and green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I mean, we still do,
but we have to amend a lot less.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you do that and then we get it
tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our nitrogen in that case is usually
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do light depths, mostly light depths,
but we do do some long-term.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farm that the bottom two thirds are
our light depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the top third is we have some
long-term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we don't have it right now,
but we grew a golden strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd definitely like to get a hold of
that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sour diesel's great on a good year.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the, really the traditional Indian
summers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get, it seemed like it was nine out
of 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: We usually get eight out of 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can count on a pretty good
Indian summer, but if you don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to be regretting it,
which was last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year wasn't fun for the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just put a cover crop in it during the off
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of Faba beans, but I can't
always find enough Faba beans to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So last summer down at Icai at the Mendo
Ag store, they had an organic,
[SPEAKER_01]: organic betch cover crop that we did last
year and that were pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had, it had Faba beans, bush beans,
I think some barley, a handful of
[SPEAKER_01]: different, different grasses, nitrogen
producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We plant also around, not in the beds,
but all around the beds on the outside,
[SPEAKER_01]: clover, nitrogen fixing clover.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's really, it takes a
while, but if you have, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: freshly graded places and things like
that, it really rebuilds the soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: takes nitrogen out of the atmosphere,
out of the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And puts it into the soil and it keeps
growing year after year, nurse it along
[SPEAKER_01]: and keep it expanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, and it's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like working, walking on a
carpet in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of white clover.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the rows in between everything in the
walkways, in any of the open area within
[SPEAKER_01]: the fence, I get bags of it and throw that
seed everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps, you know, honeybees love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps the dust down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it doesn't shoot up and,
you know, like a tall grass and then
[SPEAKER_01]: unleash a barrage of, of thorns or this,
you know, fox tails or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: things that become a real pain in the ass
and stick in your socks and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But below the soil, yeah, it's pulled
pulling, it's pulling nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_01]: releasing it into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll take ground, like the ground,
freshly graded ground, like ground behind
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes, you know, it takes some
years to do it, but it'll rebuild that
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and, and bring it back up to a good
soil that has, you know, top soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, yeah, it's a pretty awesome plant
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done some teas, but I was doing it
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of gave up on the tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now this year we're just starting,
use the, use the instruments to measure,
[SPEAKER_01]: to know what I'm actually working with,
know if I'm doing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I've actually got a live proper amount
of microbes ready to, ready to go,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if I'm just dumping a dead liquid out
on my, my stuff, that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: not knowing that that makes it pretty
tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't really afford to have heavy
pouring out a dud.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, material and then, and then some
pest or microbe is taking over while
[SPEAKER_01]: you're, while you're asleep with the
wheel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
