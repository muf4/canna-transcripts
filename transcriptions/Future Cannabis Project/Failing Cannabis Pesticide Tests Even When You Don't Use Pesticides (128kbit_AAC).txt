[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk more about the residual in
specific pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like some growers have been
surprised that they're the test results
[SPEAKER_00]: are coming back as having contamination
from pesticides when they weren't even
[SPEAKER_00]: using those pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk about some of those surprises and
why that's occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly when it comes to growers who get
surprised that their product was dirty,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of them are surprised that it's
dirty because they sprayed it early in its
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're surprised that it didn't go
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's typically not pesticides that you see
move downstream.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fungicides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fungicides reason being is that indoor
cultivation doesn't really generate UV,
[SPEAKER_01]: ultraviolet, and ultraviolet is what's
needed to break down some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: fungicides into a more inert form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you apply something like Eagle
20 Mycobutrinol to an indoor grow in any
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity, meaning your mom ops are always
indoor, all of these situations we found
[SPEAKER_01]: create a reserve of maybe up to five to
seven years to where the facility itself
[SPEAKER_01]: is contaminated, meaning that there's
particulate of Mycobutrinol present in the
[SPEAKER_01]: space and pieces of it that break off and
land on your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so rooms that were used prior that
haven't been used in years are coming up
[SPEAKER_01]: hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so any of these facilities that were
priorly used, they're registering hot
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's contamination that won't
break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: For most of the growers that are coming up
with problems now in concentrate form,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is really where you see it,
it's almost 68% of the issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mycobutrinol, and I would say probably at
least 41% of it's coming from the mothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you have is you have this
incredible quantity of nurseries that are
[SPEAKER_01]: using tools to give a stellar appearance,
but that product cannot be used in the
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we know as a nursery is that I
get orders all the time to fill clients
[SPEAKER_01]: who have bought products that have then
blown dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can even test the clone,
and a clone will not detect any levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't test the mom or test the
clone, it won't come up in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to literally take that product
and make it into a super concentrate and
[SPEAKER_01]: accentuate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll know if you can use it or
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes it really difficult because
whenever you receive any colonel stock,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to actually find out,
hey, how has the mom's been treated?
[SPEAKER_01]: And who honestly wants to tell you,
hey, they cheated on the job?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, or you're saying even if they
tested the clone and it turned out clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the producer would know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The producer would know.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, the bottom line is if the producer's
moving stock that's dirty, how did they
[SPEAKER_01]: get fooled?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're producing the material,
there's no way you didn't know what was
[SPEAKER_01]: the input material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for us, we're licensed through the
Department of Ag for spray, meaning that
[SPEAKER_01]: we have a spray license.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a degree in nursery practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like actual nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it does is it lets us have a
very, now we're running all organic spray
[SPEAKER_01]: methodologies, but every single thing we
use is documented and given to the Ag
[SPEAKER_01]: Department monthly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything we use, how much we use,
what spray grids, what intensities,
[SPEAKER_01]: what patterns, what we used it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, an entire program is created to
monitor all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way you're not aware of what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone says, well, a worker did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what worker is so inclined to kill
the business's money without direction
[SPEAKER_01]: from the leadership?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I know is that people who pick
up stock, and a way that a nursery could
[SPEAKER_01]: make the stake is they get clonal material
from someone to start the mother process.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a tough one because you basically
have to almost grow the plant that came
[SPEAKER_01]: out, flower some of it, blow it,
test it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a zero, you can run it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an extremely time consuming process.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why so much of the stock that I
sift in clonal form is really out of seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I sift clones, but I get them from
people like me that are organically based,
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning living soil, biological predation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this way what we know is that the
material used by me or anybody else like
[SPEAKER_01]: me is shareable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's coming from strangers,
I have no idea what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically I have to run it and then
blow some of it to see, blow me and turn
[SPEAKER_01]: it into a concentrate, to see is it clean
source.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I go from seed, then I can get
around that, but the public doesn't want
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want differentiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want very similar products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise Nike wouldn't be Nike.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be sneakers, but it's Nike.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people want Nike.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the market, you have to understand
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where seed becomes difficult
because seed lets us sift for progeny,
[SPEAKER_01]: pulls out phenotype, but it doesn't allow
us a stability yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for a lot of individuals,
you got to make sure you understand where
[SPEAKER_01]: you gather in the source stock from and
where you're producing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're inheriting old buildings
where they used previously, and if these
[SPEAKER_01]: buildings were used previously,
it gets into another problem is now you
[SPEAKER_01]: have this where broad and russet mites lie
because they used to be broad and russet
[SPEAKER_01]: mite that came from all the other
agricultural industries prior.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any nursery is going to have them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now you have an incredible
concentration of russet mite being applied
[SPEAKER_01]: to Humboldt, Trinity, Mendo, all four,
the species eradication of starthism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've used a mite control in Canada
for decades and now they're using it
[SPEAKER_01]: heavily in our area to control these
unnatural plants, what they call invasive
[SPEAKER_01]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is it'd be like if you
went and sprayed for invasive species in
[SPEAKER_01]: Napa and you shot out the lacewing or the
grape borer or whatever the nasty pathogen
[SPEAKER_01]: is for grape.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically what happened for us
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the russet mite became such a
massive issue because it holds dormant
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes out, it's unlike
anything anybody's seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one knew how to identify it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's microscopic in size,
you can't see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It moves too fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can't ID the damage or the
silico nodule egg layman, then you really
[SPEAKER_01]: can't pinpoint what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we found with russet mite is
really in vegetative form, the sulfur
[SPEAKER_01]: works fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either micronized sulfur is dry or
wettable sulfur sprayed wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it absolutely tears these things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as we can spray them out,
we can control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what we did for flower is where
you can't use sulfur is you get into
[SPEAKER_01]: biological predation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And biological predation is get ahold of
your bug dealer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you're going to do is you're
going to work out a strategy of what bugs
[SPEAKER_01]: to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to be combinations of
juveniles and adults so that juveniles can
[SPEAKER_01]: hatch over a 20, 30 day period and come
out sequentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the adults are already pre-starved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had russet mites at my farm this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they blew in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They must have blown over a mountain
because I don't have any farms around me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're wind born.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can move for miles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they landed on the bench.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw some pirate bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pirate bugs typically let you know you
have other bugs that are being eaten by
[SPEAKER_01]: the pirate bugs because they don't just
colonize.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's an example of a pirate bug?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're yellow with a little black dot on
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're just named little pirate bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just like if you have lady bugs
all over the place, odds are there must be
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you look at predators,
if you have a lot of wolves in your
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhood, you probably have some deer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a lot of beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably have trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going after something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so predators let us find prey easier
than we see prey because predators are
[SPEAKER_01]: always bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So predators let us see on bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see the thing we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can say, OK, that's a sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my farm guys located the pirates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the ID, found the russet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we did was an aggressive
biological attack on it where we went at
[SPEAKER_01]: three times the normal pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it was to add 1,000 sachets,
we went up to 3,000 sachets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it did was it allowed me this
incredible ability to actually outfight
[SPEAKER_01]: the infestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the infestation was increasing,
I was running at a much higher level of
[SPEAKER_01]: predation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So literally, I just blasted them right
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I might have only lost maybe 3% of the
total to russet damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would have lost 40%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking radical differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not talking huge money.
[SPEAKER_01]: A normal application of bugs for me would
be about $3,500.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cost me $10,000 to absolutely seal it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do I know from this lesson?
[SPEAKER_01]: That next year when I put the plants out,
we just lay out all the beneficial sachets
[SPEAKER_01]: with the crop the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way, the release is just
continuous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just know that russets will come
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we control the vegetative plants
with sulfur so that we're not having any
[SPEAKER_01]: issues, we get them into the garden,
organically boost them up so that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy, add the predation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we have a biological balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not the issue that people
thought it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is when you don't know how to
control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most people misdiagnose it terribly
because they see the browning of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pistils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they think that the plant is
prematurely flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't realize that it's just straight
dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because they're misdiagnosing it,
they don't have the ability to actively
[SPEAKER_01]: fight it.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time they really realize what they
have, basically it's like having stage
[SPEAKER_01]: four cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not much you can do at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's aggressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to catch it when it's stage
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to get the freckle when it's
misshapen, not when it's a giant tumor the
[SPEAKER_01]: size of a grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think people are familiar
enough with the real cultivation practices
[SPEAKER_01]: of this type of thing because we're all
learning, really, new predation,
[SPEAKER_01]: meaning what do we use, new pests,
new pathogens, what are the things we're
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting, and new tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can and can't we use?
[SPEAKER_01]: So new and new and new creates problems,
but it's workable.
It's workable.
It's workable.
