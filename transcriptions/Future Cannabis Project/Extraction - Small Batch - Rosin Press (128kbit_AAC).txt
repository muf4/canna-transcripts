[SPEAKER_03]: This is a Dr. Dabber switch, which is
about as nice as you're going to get as
[SPEAKER_03]: far as an e-nail rig.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's totally portable, cordless.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can tune in your temperature really
easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you see, it hits really smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's about to take a hit of our
grapefruit rosin, which was pressed from
[SPEAKER_00]: this grapefruit flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there it is on the nail.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100% solvent free.
[SPEAKER_02]: From that flower, which is grown where?
[SPEAKER_03]: Up north.
[SPEAKER_02]: Norcal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Norcal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you excited?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super duper excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hit this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's red.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as it turns green, it's ready to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it turns green?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they kind of dummy proof it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can choose as much as you want as
far as size of your inhale and combine
[SPEAKER_03]: that with your temperature and really
customize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry to blow it in your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it preserves the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it still going?
[SPEAKER_03]: It absolutely is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the bubbler is just killer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can't go wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're a fan of the Dr. Dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a fan of the Dr. Dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an innovation in dabbing technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like, you don't need the blowtorch.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to worry about even what
your temperature is.
[SPEAKER_03]: The previous method, which still has some
validity, is your blowtorch and your
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature gun so you know exactly where
you're getting your titanium nail at.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just a standard rig that we
converted into just your traditional rig,
[SPEAKER_03]: just three-stage percolator.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So talk to me about, as we think about
kind of, I guess the concentrate's market
[SPEAKER_02]: can be kind of split up into obviously
dabbing, but also oil for vape pens and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you guys seeing in the market,
and how did you settle on what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a big part of what we settled on is
just our own end user experience with
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is a bigger push for a response
to solvents being used, a response to BHO
[SPEAKER_03]: going with solvent-free.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I've been making that product for a
few years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I also had some insight in
recognizing that you could still get a
[SPEAKER_03]: good quality product without having to
utilize any sort of solvents.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're always going to have people
that are diehard BHO fans or solvent
[SPEAKER_03]: ethanol fans, and that's fine,
because you can still make good quality
[SPEAKER_03]: product with those methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ours is just really making it simple,
kind of going back to how it used to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is heat and pressure, and basically
hashish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And full spectrum, which is another thing
you see across the board with tinctures,
[SPEAKER_03]: topicals, Papa and Barkley.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're big on full spectrum for all of
the tinctures, and we definitely respect
[SPEAKER_03]: them as a brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so their extraction is all pressing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doing the same thing that we're
doing, as far as using just heat and
[SPEAKER_03]: pressure to extract their hash oil,
and then homogenizing that with their
[SPEAKER_03]: custom blend of oils for their various
products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then what's great about it is once
you've dialed in your hash product,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can find out what your cannabinoid
ratios are, and then just combine that
[SPEAKER_03]: with whatever carrier oil you're working
with, and you can really get a consistent
[SPEAKER_03]: product that's full spectrum, 100% quality
every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about, everybody thinks of rosin
presses as kind of like, you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: small batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you paint the vision of a
manufacturing facility that's doing it at
[SPEAKER_02]: scale?
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, in order to get the quality,
it needs to be at that scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really impossible to completely
upscale on the same way that you could
[SPEAKER_03]: with BHO or ethanol machines, just because
of the physics of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what it requires is a lot of labor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this product is born out of love.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to be involved in making
rosin, you're going to want to be
[SPEAKER_03]: committed to doing things, not necessarily
the easy way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of fine tuning,
a lot of back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each bag, just by looking at each bag that
we pack full of cannabis, each one's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit different, a little bit
thicker, a little bit longer, wider.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's amazing what you can pull out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that affects how quickly you're
going to press down, what pressure you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start with, end up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the things that two of you talk
about when you're sitting there pressing
[SPEAKER_02]: flour all day long?
[SPEAKER_02]: What did he bitch to you about recently,
and what did he bitch about to you
[SPEAKER_02]: recently, or was frustrated about or
excited about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the other day, he wanted a little
bit lighter color out of the rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to do some experimenting on the
temperature and also on the micron size of
[SPEAKER_00]: the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took a few hours, about half the
day, but I gave him the results that he
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was the answer?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you get it lighter?
[SPEAKER_00]: I used a smaller micron bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it reduces your yield, but it gives
you a little bit higher quality and
[SPEAKER_00]: lowered the temperature just a little bit,
which also can reduce the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's all in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a lot of experimenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each bag, you drop down five degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still doesn't give you the effect you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to pack another bag and try it
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're really paying attention to the
variables of temperature, pressure,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then micron size time, and then bag
geometry, which is how big is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's the pressure of your
machine, but where's the pressure at the
[SPEAKER_03]: bag?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that is directly related to your
bag geometry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once you dial in one, you just got to
have to keep pushing forward with
[SPEAKER_03]: answering some of the other variables.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's working as far as manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's doable.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working off of one press,
and we could definitely do a lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's the square inches or feet of
that press?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only a inch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it stands up yay tall.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: End of the table to about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the surface is like two feet by two
feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the actual heat plate is only about
12 inches by two and a half inches,
[SPEAKER_03]: three inches.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why you want that is,
so I've worked with larger plates as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you imagine a really large plate,
you can get a larger mass that you are
[SPEAKER_03]: pressing, but it's not going to press as
evenly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want that oil starting to be
extracted, you want it to get off those
[SPEAKER_03]: plates as quickly as possible and cooled
down as quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why it's not very exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So narrow plate, you could you get your
bag packed up right to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that squish is going to come out
and then you can even collect it onto a
[SPEAKER_03]: cold plate if you want something that's
been in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like getting back to the hair
straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are presses out there that are
our square shape.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pure pressure makes a great press.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love their press.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why I like them more than
anything was their attention to their
[SPEAKER_03]: plate sizes and really not focusing on
like more pressure means more yield
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's not necessarily true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's a sweet spot that you need to
find and you can actually get great yield,
[SPEAKER_03]: great and maintain quality without going
like super excessive pressure or super
[SPEAKER_03]: excessive heat because those are the two
typical ways you typically boost up yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even how fast the plate compresses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're with flour, you want a fast
compression when you're doing something
[SPEAKER_03]: like heath or a bubble hash, something
that's a little bit more dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to slow down that press.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could potentially make the bag explode
or cause it to unheat like on heat
[SPEAKER_03]: unevenly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's so there's a lot of factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once it's nice about it, though,
it's mechanical.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still mechanical process.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's easy to control your variables.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your runs are fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once you figure out for this
particular strain or this technique is
[SPEAKER_03]: dialed in, it's just and go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: A press is about 12 inches by two to three
inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you guys are doing this at scale,
like how many presses do you have in your
[SPEAKER_02]: or how many do you envision having in your
facility?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say probably like five or five to ten.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just really depending on room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, ultimately, that's what it really
boils down to and just going all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Twenty four seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Twenty four seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are like some when you guys are
talking to each other like innovations you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to see in presses?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like is there either stuff you're seeing,
stuff people are talking about,
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff you're on your wish list?
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that I'd like to see is
something that I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think peer pressure has got the
plate size down and the right amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: tonnage that they're using.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also appreciate a hand of hand
press.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be nice to see a good quality
combination of the two, especially when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're automated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when you're first learning to
press, there's nothing that replaces like
[SPEAKER_03]: that connection to feeling the bag and
really understanding physically what's
[SPEAKER_03]: going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that actually, as you get more versed
in the extraction, you can use that as a
[SPEAKER_03]: quick way to diagnose a remedy or do some
troubleshooting by just like, all right,
[SPEAKER_03]: what is actually going on physically at
the bag?
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems kind of silly, but it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, OK, you guys are all rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else just from a personal interest
level are you interested in promoting in
[SPEAKER_02]: like five minutes?
[SPEAKER_03]: I am definitely interested in tinctures.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that I really appreciate
about our rosin and our rosin line is we
[SPEAKER_03]: can also make, you know, instead of having
the edible where you don't really know
[SPEAKER_03]: what your dosing is, it's like having a
nice one milliliter dropper with it at a
[SPEAKER_03]: dose that I know where it's at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also know that that has come from
like a solvent-free, I mean, and it's full
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: That and I mean, those actually,
those are the two big things being rosin
[SPEAKER_03]: and tinctures, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: But are you saying tinctures that come
from rosin?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So taking rosin, that's really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's live resin based on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how do you do live resin?
[SPEAKER_03]: So live resin, I mean, that's basically
cryogenic technique where you are making
[SPEAKER_03]: sure that the the trichomes on the plant
are frozen right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you right at that time
before, just before harvest, where the
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes on the on your fresh plant are so
like just terpied, they smell so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, you you you cut,
you dry and you cure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't quite have that same
impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's because all those terpenes have
volatilized.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that what the the live resin processes
and like fresh frozen is they're taking
[SPEAKER_03]: care of taking that plant, trimming it and
then within hours, hopefully
[SPEAKER_03]: instantaneously getting it in into a
freezer that's flash frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that preserves all those
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use that same flower to make
rosin, BHO, any sort of extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to you're going to have a
much wider terpene profile to play with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, a different experience for
the product because of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is the mono terpenes that go first?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're small, smaller the molecular
weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like everything should or is
focused on kind of how do you keep as much
[SPEAKER_02]: of the essence of that plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: What innovations are you seeing there and
nothing losing none of the essence of what
[SPEAKER_02]: was in the flower the day it was
harvested?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think really fresh frozen is probably
the closest thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just doing what we're doing with with
rosin is trying is trying to create a
[SPEAKER_03]: product that is as close to the flower as
possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like if you smell, you know,
the flower that's been pressed or the
[SPEAKER_03]: rosin has been pressed from the flower,
they have the same terpene profile,
[SPEAKER_03]: the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so since a rosin press does use
heat, there's obviously something that's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what what do you what do you guys see?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what are the first terpenes to go off
the top of my head?
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't tell you, but I could tell you
they go start to come off around 170
[SPEAKER_03]: Celsius.
[SPEAKER_03]: And oh, man, it's not little lube.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the top of my head, I can't I can't
tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I but it trying to do low temp presses
is really what's what is going to capture
[SPEAKER_03]: and keep all of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Between 170 and this is in Celsius or
between 90 and 170 Celsius.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you're going to actually start to
get terpenes volatilizing much sooner than
[SPEAKER_03]: not at 170 Celsius, but like at 70
degrees, like even at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so trying to make sure that,
you know, you keep keep as much as you can
[SPEAKER_03]: without, you know, still getting a
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the balance because you still have
to have yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: You still have to have some you have to
get something you could you could use all
[SPEAKER_03]: pressure and very, very low temperature
and get, you know, capture the most
[SPEAKER_03]: terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're you're going to probably get a
tenth to 20th of what you should if you
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of bump up the temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And find that happy medium.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, well, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can also do mechanical
separations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been able to do like low temp
mechanical separations and get THCA.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually something I'm really
excited about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's it's really nice to be able to
get, again, THCA without having to use
[SPEAKER_03]: solvents.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a real straightforward process
with with rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just you're doing a mechanical
separation through really fine screens,
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple runs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're collecting your terpene that
are pouring off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you're collecting that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And your product is actually what's on the
inside, which would typically be your
[SPEAKER_03]: waste product.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the chip, the flower chip or the
key chip that you throw away or recycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: The actual product is THCA crystal.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been the last stuff we got tested
is like ninety nine six.
[SPEAKER_03]: All without all without solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any shy guy over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you tell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any parting words from the mad scientist?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually his apprentice.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a disciple of the master.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just learning the ropes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I'm on my way to really
learning the, you know, the chemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: behind the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what's something he's taught you
that's kind of like blown your mind or
[SPEAKER_02]: like that you've been like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Your brain hurt because it got such a
workout?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at first, I didn't believe him that
each bag would be different and each one
[SPEAKER_00]: would take, you know, you have to keep
your eyes on it to an extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to know how it responds and
how it likes to be treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really is an art, rosin pressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's taken my interest to a whole
nother level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really love every second of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
