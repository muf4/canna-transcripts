[SPEAKER_06]: This one looks fire though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It came out good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as GMO-y, but it's still there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's like the base is GMO for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has that garlicky... Man, that garlicky
butter.
[SPEAKER_06]: One guy described it as garlic shrimp
farts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so funny to hear what people describe
GMO as.
[SPEAKER_06]: I literally thought it was like mushroom,
onion, garlic.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really does smell like that soup.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a mushroom garlic soup.
[SPEAKER_01]: After the dispensary I used to work at,
someone thought it was super garlic
[SPEAKER_01]: mustard onion.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kept calling it that to the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, stop calling it that!
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't want to be a dick and be
like, it's not called that.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the GMO?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, GMO, we have a bunch of flavors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sunfire Farms, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't beat it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, thanks man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want the GMO or the strana?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd go with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strana rosin for the first one.
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta do the maker's choice.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't go against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too strong, but it's still good.
[SPEAKER_06]: That glass piece is very interesting,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, it definitely is an interesting
like pull.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you rip it hard?
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta go into it slow?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really have to rip it hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like super stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a little cold still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got some here for later.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to check out what he did to
the ground?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then open up, show them the hash
version.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, that's what version?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's the live rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full spectrum live rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here's the full melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the 90 to 159.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it says 150.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that into this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably go like 148.
[SPEAKER_04]: So talk about that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pipe?
[SPEAKER_06]: So flavorful coming right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good temp for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dope.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is okay, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love that bubble cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it better than the minaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strain it on an island with just one cap,
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, the cap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talk about the cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this cap made by Brick Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brick Glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a bubble cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are like on the spinner
cap wave, which I still love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have this, like the binary cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I just like this one because it
just kind of is a little more like
[SPEAKER_01]: restrictive and kind of gets, I feel like
it gets everything a little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can move your dab around and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more interactive for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more interactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both have their, they both have their
fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you use this cap, would it just sit on
top and that would just spin
[SPEAKER_06]: automatically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll just set it and it'll just like
hands free.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty easily too and quick.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This pipe, like it's pretty restricting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like if you had like a straight tube,
like it makes the bead go like way faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of like the bubble cap on this
guy, but ye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, this is where an e-nail would be very
handy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Having an e-nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to have them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got friends that have them for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they make some pretty cool ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, they do.
[SPEAKER_06]: That look like a, like an ice cream truck
is like the hub or something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very simple.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like they're all pretty,
pretty, they work pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you want them for a banger or like
a, that's like old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the highly educated tops.
[SPEAKER_06]: The highly educated tops?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the ones that are like, you have to
use the old carb caps for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the, like they're, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember the name, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of like pretty old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like meant for e-nails though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the coil goes around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a titanium nail kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some e-nails would have a hole in the
middle and shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some special bangers for the e-nails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that'd be an ideal setup.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have an e-nail set the exact temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you just rip it all day.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do a review of the
[SPEAKER_04]: the, uh, do you want to review it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I've never hit it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you're that's we're going to hit it
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think why I think what's cool is you,
you've used the other one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said you have the other one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to go in on one of these
Peter?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just give me one second.
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I give them some of the strawberry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is pretty much fresh press right
here, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the fresh press.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and that's like, you didn't even
allow it to cure either pretty much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like fresh pressed it, kept it very
cold, package it cold, put it back cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: Less than 30 seconds, Peter.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to grab a quick dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me when I'm at 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll put it here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where to put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably hold it when he's ripping
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're at 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's your sword.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your weapon of choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like so small.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like that's oil.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm impressed on that temp is being so
long.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually when I put mine in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially with the beat in there,
it like still holds a lot of heat as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Show them this thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you seen, have you seen this before?
No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's, it's four hookahs.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no hookah around.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh word.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought a $15 hookah on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Coles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a bunch of hash in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Coles.
[SPEAKER_06]: You put the hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I saw that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that what was on Instagram?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: See if it works.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't, you can't tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can't tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I got the black little
attachment on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you brought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I might've got some water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you get water on this,
it like sizzles when it's heating up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully it won't sizzle right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're hitting the puff go right now
and we're going to review the puff go
[SPEAKER_04]: plus.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are your first, uh, what are your
expectations of someone who's never hit
[SPEAKER_04]: that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you've already hit the, the,
the first edition of which one that's a
[SPEAKER_04]: plus, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this is the puff go plus.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it just hit the puff go pen.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is edition number two.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what are the things you noticed that
are different or right away?
[SPEAKER_06]: The, uh, the poker, I guess you want to
call it poker or the applier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, mini dabber.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was just, it was the,
just like a sphere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's just a straight, like point,
but now you have a little scooper to it
[SPEAKER_06]: and it's angled.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's nice to, you know, picking it up
for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the ceramic itself too is a lot deeper
and that's helpful because it was kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: a pain.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was good for one hit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bigger dab sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's he, what should he be scooping
up right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one would you like him to scoop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should try the GMO for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Read my mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now this is all set to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it work the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you could grab it out of,
out of there, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just take the jar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do some of the Sunfire farms and you
grew this in like light depth,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is all like grown and extracted by
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like a light depth living soil here
in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what, give me some description.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, are you up in the hills or are you
at elevation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we are actually more, a little,
a little more coastal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we are not too high in elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, kind of more just in the valley.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can smell that all day, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: GMO is one of my favorite smelling ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the stinkiest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like always prevalent.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like a fruity smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very attractive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it has settings.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that from the other pen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you hit it five times and it'll change
and that'll turn it on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: On for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was already on before I turned
it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So back on and then four times we'll go
like from white, which is the hottest till
[SPEAKER_04]: like, green to blue or red or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably blue.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe white's the least hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, bounce to blue.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_06]: Green.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think green is the lowest.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think white is the hottest.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would make sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's try one, two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue.
[SPEAKER_06]: White.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a bad push.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So blue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now there's a sesh to the other one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if you hit it like twice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, you do it twice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll burn for like 12 seconds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's just hit it twice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, first we'll put it in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And ideally it just falls off the,
uh, the scooper, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like melts off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to aim it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you can't be smoking with it straight
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm missing a piece here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, did you screw it down?
[SPEAKER_04]: You just screw it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you push and then the white part will
push up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, it did.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's another new feature.
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't push up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you got to put a little pressure on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So two times we're in sesh mode.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely able to taste it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think hitting it twice, second hit might
be better.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can double hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Double hit?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll double tap it and then just,
just rip it, you know, slowly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And long the whole time, but that was full
flavor in that first, in the first rip
[SPEAKER_06]: though, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like a heating up a rig and
hitting that, but definitely got the
[SPEAKER_06]: taste.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might see, might see more smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you'd get some more smoke coming
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't like a full job, but yeah,
it's pretty tasty for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely have the GMO Terp in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like some pens I just get like a
super burnt profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like better than I expected.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's still a little bit on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like pretty, you've got most of the
dab, I guess, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of it fell off.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if there's a third hit to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The suspense is building.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this thing amazing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a good little dab dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if you're just like chilling
out somewhere in need of discreet,
[SPEAKER_01]: discreteness, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: At the soccer field, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the sideline of the kids soccer game
while they're eating sliced oranges.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, bad calls.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, come on.
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta walk away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or the parents being asshole across the
way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the dude's drinking a beer next to
you, like screaming at the refs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think for a, that was like,
that wasn't even a fat dab or a small dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like kind of a medium dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you could put a little bigger one
in there maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll get, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause that wasn't a, that third hit got a
taste, but it wasn't, I could definitely
[SPEAKER_06]: taste like some burn to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wasn't like the hit you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you cue it after every dab?
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess if you're going to switch it up,
but if you're going to do a little more
[SPEAKER_06]: GMO.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm down.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'd like to continue smoking what
we're currently smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that GMO man is my very favorite.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I first watched the GMO too,
and it does dunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: It yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it yields like, I mean,
like people would like maybe want to like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, run it for like hydrocarbon too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me could probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually I'll do this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, yields better for solventless
than it does for like B2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydrocarbon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't yield as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I've ever like made it with
anything but water hash, but that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is definitely a bigger dab,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear it grows pretty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's actually a very bigger dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throw that one in there too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So talk about the growth, like as a,
now that's packed full.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wonder how it's going to handle that
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The growth of the GMO?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, but like in the living soil
and kind of like your way of growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like because you're close to the LA scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're close to the Santa Barbara
scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would say neither like LA is indoor
hydro a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: Santa Barbara is like, like even the,
like a lot of the big greenhouses are all
[SPEAKER_04]: like cocoa and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a pretty rare thing to
like see living soil cultivation down here
[SPEAKER_01]: and just like having that like
sustainable, like biodynamic regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: mindset.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like most people, yeah, exactly like
in LA are growing indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're growing not in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're not doing it with that
intention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, same with Santa Barbara,
like a lot of that cultivation up there,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you said, it's in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, it's not with like the mindset
to be doing good for the earth as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel pretty like just stoked to be
doing that around here and kind of trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to like spread that awareness and movement
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I just double click.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you feel pretty good about yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm stoked to be doing it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels much better to not be like
throwing away so many Rockwell cubes after
[SPEAKER_04]: every run and just like, when you smoke
people out in this market, are they like,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's pretty fucking like, yeah,
they do seem to notice a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, wow, that was very clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the high is very clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very smooth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like these are indoor smokers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're people who are like smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're used to like everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the stuff that they're finding
around here is indoor, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's hydroponic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is, they kind of notice that
difference when they see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is ready.
[SPEAKER_06]: I find my friends like noticing a huge
difference and they'd be like coughing and
[SPEAKER_06]: like, how's it going, man?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.
[SPEAKER_06]: This and that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tell them I have something like,
ah, I'm coughing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not really smoking right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what are you having to smoking on?
[SPEAKER_06]: They tell me what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I give them some of my stuff and like,
Oh dude, way more amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: They, they say they could taste it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The big difference, like it'd be more
cleaner in your house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was just my hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that implies you're sourcing from like
someone who grows like he does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I thought you said you were sourcing
indoor, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Indoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he cleans the organics, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know the full details there,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would imagine even more sourcing from
a guy like, and the way you're growing
[SPEAKER_06]: regenerative is even way better.
[SPEAKER_01]: The proof is definitely in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see that when you're washing,
like the quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is super clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's leaving no residue, you know,
I'm not sure if the heat, how was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was good, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a really tasty dab off of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that you, I didn't, I feel like I
might've heated it late though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just pressed it twice and then started
ripping it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what consistency, like you can smoke
this out of that, but like at what
[SPEAKER_04]: consistency do you think you can't really
use that anymore for hash?
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe the temple balls maybe, you know,
you're not going to smoke.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some lower melt, like a five, like a four
star melt might be a little hard to clean
[SPEAKER_01]: out of there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Put a big one in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this would be the third hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think there's enough for
another little ripper in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just hit it twice, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can pump it twice or you can just hold
it as long as you want to hit it for,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, hitting it twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cause twice is 12 seconds or
something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just eliminates you having to hold it
down.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I give this one a pass.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little better.
[SPEAKER_06]: It holds more, you know, cause the one
before it held less and I would take it
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: The cone part is bigger.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bucket, I guess is, this is a lot
bigger.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say double the size.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely just put a good sized dab in
there for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: See now, now there's some in there still.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and it's, oh, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll rip that again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's keep it in rotation, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, not bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it has a charging too, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: An easy charger.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that part.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's somewhere in there, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like standard, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: USB.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used it with my 510 thread.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It goes into this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you twist on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but my point is that's like a standard
thread, which is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like a proprietary, like if you
lose it, you got to, you can only buy
[SPEAKER_04]: ours.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you think you can use other chargers
with the pen if you do lose this?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_06]: That looks pretty standard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like with other e-cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, with other vape carts that you find
in every shop.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what would you want Puffco to improve
on with the peak?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you could give them some
constructive feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like they've done a really good
job, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe the only thing they could do
would be like include a quartz atomizer,
[SPEAKER_01]: like not a quartz atomizer, a quartz
bucket instead of just having the ceramic
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've dabbed off the quartz ones
and I definitely think they taste better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be sweet to have like a Puffco one
because not every quartz bucket like
[SPEAKER_01]: aftermarket like fits well.
[SPEAKER_01]: On these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So other than that, like everything's
pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had this for like almost 16 months
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you model it really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It matches the shirt now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, I was telling him, like I
haven't, I barely clean it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the atomizer gets pretty gunked up
and like I leave it in my hot car while
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, it's never, never failed me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just had to replace the little $39
atomizer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So loosely maintained.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Loosely maintained.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm pretty stoked on the, on the Puffco
for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like I'm taking it for every dab,
but I like, show me what you carry around
[SPEAKER_04]: in your bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, in here you have like the torch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything's on the table, but we got
like all the turps in this little like
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic jar, plastic Tupperware thing that
goes in the cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then yeah, I like you carry it
around and chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in case anyone wants like that fresh
press, you don't want that to butter out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the equivalent of someone
walking around with a six pack all day on
[SPEAKER_04]: ice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like their beer is cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like my dad's old cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like pretty, it's like from the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty sick playmate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, we just got a couple mats.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got all the caps and then we have the
Pelican case with the pipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the not a pipe maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, this thing's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fairly recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a fun, fun little
apparatus to, to dab out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Product placement.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you zoom in on her with the binary
cap?
[SPEAKER_01]: She, she goes nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a little sticky though, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to try that binary cap that has,
look at that function.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's, it's pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can try it whenever, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the puff go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good for on the go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes right in the side and that's about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I have those topicals for you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have topicals too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I like just started making them
like messing with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is like my first batch ever,
but like, I know a lot of people do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, don't mix these up
with the jobs.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first time I've ever done
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have confidence that you probably did a
pretty good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you keep these cool too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to, but like, yeah,
I keep them in a, you know, like not in
[SPEAKER_01]: the sun or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like something like my wife
would have or like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just beeswax and coconut oil with live
rosin, like full spectrum LA cookies,
[SPEAKER_01]: live rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's some like full spectrum
CBD as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a four to one ratio of rosin to
CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like teeth.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just rub it like on your face and
your.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wherever you want to have relief from or
have some pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kind of rubbed it on my shoulders.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really have much pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always want to try stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't ever have any aches and pains.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm like, it kind of makes you chilled
out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to have them so I can like use it
and be like, Oh my God, that does work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the other day I was like,
why don't I hurt right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to test this on myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I was like, I'll just put some
on my neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really hurt, but my neck did
feel like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's all go for a hike.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take the peak.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll take the peak with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get a nice rub down.
[SPEAKER_06]: That shows how little I work out right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is mine?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why don't we, do you want to walk us
through the line?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What you brought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why you're proud of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, we have this right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cream Day Mitt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's a mixed wash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two different phenos of Cream Day Mitt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those strains are from exotic
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then mixed with GMO, which is like a
staple in my garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: To be in everyone's garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if you make hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have some strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably my favorite strain in my
variety of cultivars that I grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you like it as flour, too?
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly don't really like smoking flour
that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because when I first started using
cannabis, I got right into concentrates
[SPEAKER_01]: right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the flour smoke is a little gnarly for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I still love smoking it from time to
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are young.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're dating yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll still be stoked on some soft
flour rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a little bong of sovereignty and
stuff to rip out of here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the same right now, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't smoke that much flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're smoking a lot of good hash,
it's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still good, but it's different,
though.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have my fair share of years of smoking
ripping flour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like just today, I tried to rip a fat bowl
like I used to.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got halfway through.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to stop and just cop it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_06]: But right before that, I took a huge dab.
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: My guy's like, oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'll smoke flour for the
beginning of the day, and then I'll go to
[SPEAKER_01]: take dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's like, damn, I can really
smoke the dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's even more smooth, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just recovering from smoking a spliff
with nicotine, those guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, damn.
[SPEAKER_06]: That spliff they roll.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've literally stopped copying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, so now imagine doing that,
and then imagine having to work two
[SPEAKER_04]: cameras to set all the cameras up to get
the people on the state.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I was in the audience, and you were
doing good.
[SPEAKER_06]: You had the mic to get questions and
everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was impressed.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a fun time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like once you get the solvent list,
you get the full flavor, and it's not that
[SPEAKER_06]: harsh, and it's kind of hard to go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can spoil yourself sometimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see plenty of guys that still like
Monopoly melts is one guy that I watch.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that would be like saying,
I can get my e-cigarette, so why would I
[SPEAKER_04]: ever smoke a cigar?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or cigarettes in general, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you got to eat, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they just shouldn't be compared.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be enjoyed as separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm saying, being a champion for flour,
I'm saying you guys give it another
[SPEAKER_04]: chance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's some great, honestly,
I've smoked- Because you know what I want
[SPEAKER_04]: to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, if you don't smoke the flour,
each of them save some flour for me,
[SPEAKER_04]: because I want to try it in flour form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the reason why I don't think I
really like flour is because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing flour around, I suppose,
but there's no true living soil
[SPEAKER_01]: consciously grown flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go up north.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rare time that I've seen that around
here, one of my buddies, Ogre Farms,
[SPEAKER_01]: they do an indoor living soil garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a while back, their Gorilla Glue
was some of the cleanest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like I was smoking a hash dab,
smoking the flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that quality is out there,
and I will happily smoke that all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that you mention that, it reminds me
of 710 Labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a buddy that bought some of their
stuff, and I tried their flour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some living soil?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their flour actually smelt the way it
should.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure, yeah, 710 Labs, proper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so really, they're doing living
soil?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, where are they growing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where?
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there, but what about, I assume you
got it in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they have a few dispensaries out
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: They drop off, this one was, I think they
dropped off at a safe port in Poradimi.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where my friend got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think their grow is out of
Oakland.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been to safe port.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been there too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've interviewed them, I've put them on
camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, you, Bud Tender, can you talk
coherently?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here's a camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: I start talking, walking around the shop,
and he's like, uh.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a clean spot they have there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in one of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I went to each, what is it,
port, Poradimi, patient H, the other one.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another main shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to be on the third floor.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that one was packed with people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to be all about that scene for a
while.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't had to go back.
[SPEAKER_06]: The dispensary scene.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even know there was a scene.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it was my scene.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember you from last week.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to make it a purpose to stop at any
dispensary close by.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to have a sales job all over
Southern California.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if there was one nearby, near one of
my calls, I'm like, I'm going to go with
[SPEAKER_06]: the different and see what's up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty cool to compare.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember going to WHTC and those studio
shitty stops that would get the select
[SPEAKER_01]: little hash drops in 2016 and be waiting
at 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there'd be a 10 person line of hash
smokers at the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were the good days, Prop 215 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just quickly, I can't remember how far
into the line up we got.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other question is, where are you
getting your genetics for each cultivar?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you continue down the line,
you're like, this is where I got it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an exotic genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Cream Day GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: The GMO, it's a clone only.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got that from Ogre Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was kind enough to let me grab that
from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other two, the Cookies and
Cream and the Cream GMO were grown from
[SPEAKER_01]: seed from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like two different phenos of Cream
Day mint in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you were breeding and basically so that
you bred yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't breed it because it's just like a
mixed wash.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did phenohunt them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just popped the seeds and found like my
two favorite phenos out of like the 12
[SPEAKER_01]: that were growing and washed only the two
and like just dried the others for flower
[SPEAKER_01]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Strawberry Banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was I got from a clone, the Live
Rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew from clone from Cloneville.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got like I kind of took a chance on this
clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't super familiar like how this
phenol washed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most strawberry bananas do great for
solventless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aim it this way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I grew a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to like the background shot
when you see the video.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like right off your shorts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll move it over here then.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blinded.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's an amazing cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a great one for hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super stoked on the turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very like strawberry dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's the Live Rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You taste it right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Melt is right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: First wash 90U to 159.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's like the 90 and 120 bag in
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like that Strawberry Banana is very
potent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of like the GMO.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just stands out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Melt, I prefer it way over the Rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Rosin is great, but like the Melt is
just, we'll have to press some dabs out of
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's those two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have Straight GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just some Live Rosin right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from my Light Dep.
[SPEAKER_01]: These others, two strains were actually
just full term from this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Full term meaning like in that back this
way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is from your Light Dep in the
hoops, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got two hoop houses that I did Light Dep
over the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I did some other just full term,
full season plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally forget what you said the
microclimate was like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty coastal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Coastal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like cool nights, like hot days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty, we had a pretty warm summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets pretty warm where I'm at actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the winter time, it's like a
drastic change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like warm days, cold nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not crazy humid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pretty dry, but it's definitely more
humid than like the San Fernando Valley
[SPEAKER_01]: and places like that, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is there stuff that you try to grow
there that you're like, this doesn't like
[SPEAKER_04]: this climate and other stuff where you're
like, this loves?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I've definitely selected it down to
four strains, but there's a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that I had to wean out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there was like this lemon cake that
didn't do very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But is that something that you know has
done really well somewhere else?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a lot of it's just like,
yeah, like I'll grow things that I maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like they take longer to veg or
they're a little harder to grow if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: worth it for hashing, because everything
I'm growing is for hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm growing for resin, not flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's okay to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like there's definitely strains that
are just like, completely like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, amiss.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to have those losses to like
find the gems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's hard to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you say that on the podcast?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you say you're growing in like raised
beds or pots?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, raised beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're just homemade raised beds with
wood, like four by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're three by 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have some four by eights as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like three in each or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put so there's actually three by six
beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's four of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're like next to each other,
making them 12 feet long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll either do two plants by like 10
plants per bed or I'll sometimes do three.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been kind of trying to do less
plants as of recently and just get them
[SPEAKER_01]: larger.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and so the soil you're putting into
these raised beds, where is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it local?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you building it up with stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm building soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are familiar with build a
soil dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have multiple recipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use like their number one recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use I didn't use their ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use like locally sourced ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I locally sourced my compost,
my peat moss.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you went by like what they're showing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I use their recipe and just sourced
all those ingredients locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like all the dragon earth fly
medicine group is like very influential in
[SPEAKER_01]: the garden too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I use they're huge on native soil
because that already has like the
[SPEAKER_01]: intelligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wherever you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anytime I'm building soil, I always
like to add some of my native soil in my
[SPEAKER_01]: yard and like help.
[SPEAKER_04]: At some point, you shouldn't need to buy
anything from them.
Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: The goal is to be like, no, I'm totally
self sustainable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I have that soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your training wheels come off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like it doesn't happen
overnight, but every step you take,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's just going to get better and
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like it's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: After each round.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's my first year of doing
like full no till full living where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, we're not buying any new soil or.
[SPEAKER_04]: And are you putting like worms and stuff
in the raised beds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we didn't add any worms, but we like do
methods to like attract worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's like an avocado method where
like you can cut up an avocado and lay it
[SPEAKER_01]: on the bed and it'll be like a breeding
ground and like an attraction for worms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can get into the raised bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll cause my raised bed like
connected to the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll call come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes like I have indoor moms that
are living soil and they're just
[SPEAKER_01]: containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those, I will have to add worms
separately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And are you doing like composting on site
or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a compost pile on site.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have like a hugel, a hugel culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're familiar with that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a little spot on the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like such a rich area.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You basically take like, you dig a hole,
you put like logs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And stuff in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you cover that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that stuff breaks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like think of how nutrient rich,
like if you walk through a forest and you
[SPEAKER_04]: like smell rotting log.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you're planting your plants
into.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're just like, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that stuff keeps breaking down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the name of it, but I've seen
like pictures of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like slowly breaks down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're doing that with a portion of
what you're growing, not all of what
[SPEAKER_04]: you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, I'm planning on, I keep saying
we, but it's just me.
[SPEAKER_01]: My team of two hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next for next year's season, I'm like
building hugels right now and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the time of year to like be
building soil and like be prep,
[SPEAKER_01]: preparing for everything to be breaking
down and getting ready for next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a couple of spots that I want to
like do some more new hugels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have the other spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty stoked on, on this coming
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it's like a ways away,
but it's coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so wait, so how many square feet?
[SPEAKER_01]: I only have between my two greenhouses,
it's only about 400 square feet of canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have another like 300 square feet of
like full term growing space, basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we're talking craft, you would fit
that definition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very small batch craft for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, what do you think of
the quality?
[SPEAKER_04]: Of this small batch craftsman?
[SPEAKER_05]: On point.
[SPEAKER_05]: On point.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: As one hash maker to another.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally on point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't let down any expectations today
at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dope.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have plenty of flavors to try.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I eased this over here a little closer.
[SPEAKER_06]: As you show it, I should be trying it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one are we on right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the strong Anna melts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the cream day GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the normal GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some normal straight GMO melt
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff's pretty special.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's some of the meltiest like
hash I feel like I've washed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like ice oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty hyped on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So aim that this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check that one out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of want to compare it to the GMO,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the melt and the rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it came from, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one, that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Want to open it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll hold them up together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's the other one you're about to
open?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, this, it's all melted in here now,
but this is the hash that makes the rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is your GMO rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And your GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is second press rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like top notch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually the fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first press is a little, little bit,
you know, wider.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a repress.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is second press.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second press.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's even more impressive.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, so you're talking about,
you have the bag, you have the hash in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You press it on the press.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's your first press.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you repress that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second press.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that's even more impressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like, I feel like a lot of.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like you do it with his hands tied
behind his back, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he's getting not the best material,
starter material.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, it's like a lot of guys don't do
the second press.
[SPEAKER_06]: They, they, they'll press it once and then
that bag's done.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it goes away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like hard times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I need to smoke.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got nothing left.
[SPEAKER_06]: I pull out a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're pressing a bunch of rosin,
you have 10 bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like we're pressing every little,
we'll like, I'll put like all the bags
[SPEAKER_01]: together at the end of my pressing session
and press it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, that'll just be what I'll dab
out of off of like the peak for a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of days or something, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's still of quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm not pressing like super hot and
I'm not pressing for a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is still some.
[SPEAKER_06]: Second press depends.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like I'm definitely getting the
majority out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's only two grams of second
press from like, you know, a hundred grams
[SPEAKER_01]: of first press.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you didn't go full crazy pressure on
it, you know, like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Halfway in, not too hot.
[SPEAKER_06]: The second press could be fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it is fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sun fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't bring your press, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's heavy, but like, no, I didn't bring
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't, I wasn't thinking about that,
but we have that guy there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel like trying to figure that
out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm super high as I'm sure you are too,
but you've used those before.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easy plug and play for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some flour actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have any like a bags?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think that comes with like all that
stuff right there, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me take a peek.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have some Dosey Doe flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dosey Doe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just plug it in and see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any hashish for press?
[SPEAKER_06]: See what happens here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me move aside some of this glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we, we can actually maybe take
that stuff off the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause then we just put the whole thing up
there, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Check this guy out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is it beveled like that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's a hat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put this stuff like over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So pretty much as heavy as the other one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got these two plugs back here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's what I figured.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have a lot of buttons or
anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have a lot of wires hanging on
the back here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got two, two wires basically that has
like your thermal couple in there and your
[SPEAKER_06]: heating elements, plates.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're not like kind of burning your
finger on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then there's, it came with that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see here.
160.
[SPEAKER_03]: That could be, here you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: 120.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if we can set the temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see for a flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think like, wait, so you have flour,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think cam for flour?
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually like in a low two hundreds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 210 maybe 220.
[SPEAKER_06]: 210.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember where he supplies flour
at dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was usually at 207 and like as high as
like 230 maybe.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you, you don't ever press flour?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to press a bunch.
[SPEAKER_06]: I started pressing flour.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you like doing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what don't you like about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that I don't like pressing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like, don't really like like
smoking flour as in that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Catch some lipids and waxes I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just also, it's like very time
consuming to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's like you have to press
prep so much flour and like pressing ashes
[SPEAKER_01]: is so much like more fun, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if flour kind of like butters
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flour rosin was such a big thing and it's,
it's such an, it's super awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an awesome like method.
[SPEAKER_04]: This seed is strategically placed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like flour rosin is like
shunned upon now in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really, but like, I don't know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like some people are like dicks
about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta pack it in tight and you have to
use good material.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to have the good starting
material and that's where people,
[SPEAKER_06]: they don't want to experiment with their
good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such as.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been some bomb flour rosin for
sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they have a little pre-press here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: 73 micron, 25 micron.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is stuff that my friend sent down
from Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I would say this is washable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we'll do the one, the two,
the 120 micron.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think Cameron?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then this thing said these guys do the
hugel beds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they're in Sonoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jody's here in LA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like half the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other flour too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and then this was the indoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is where I went today.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: How'd that go?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, he wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That says everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: No progress.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's the bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: No gloves, but do you, you heard a bottle
text style with the pressing?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like they, Nukesmasher is like,
what was the first rosin press that I got?
[SPEAKER_06]: A little Nukesmasher mini.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy has that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do very good tutorials and videos,
you know, for teaching, getting started.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they did this bottle text style for
this kind of situation where you're kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of doing smaller presses, you know?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the way they fold the bag,
they invert the corners.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they fill it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, once you prepack it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully this is how they have it worked
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It should slide in here.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they, they have a prepress like that
where it kind of works perfectly with
[SPEAKER_06]: their bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's see how this one works out.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this way, when it smashes down,
it's like a cylinder and it makes a good
[SPEAKER_06]: puck.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it has a nice tight surface area.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's like a method to folding it in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's see how this, I don't know how
this is going to work, but let's find out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Has anyone ever told you you should be a
hand model?
[SPEAKER_06]: I should probably cut my nails.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep your body out of the shot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the hands.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just these man hands.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me grab some flour.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have a scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: Usually like a, I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: See?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This cherry punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: This looks fuego.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think there's enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there's probably is enough to
press, but like it's probably a small
[SPEAKER_06]: press out of one of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see how this dosi dough goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some dosi.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little indoor dosi.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did this come off?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it just lays out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to use that guy as a tray.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll just go raw.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think these were all like 2.6.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although some of them are definitely not
smoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're saying this stuff you brought.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll press them.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could save.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could try pressing one of those if you
want to.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So where'd this come from?
[SPEAKER_06]: This came from the indoors of Ojai.
[SPEAKER_06]: Undisclosed location.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, this is super dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make some good rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: 3.8.
[SPEAKER_06]: 3.8 right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I compared to the one you use,
how would you describe this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like in terms of the press?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Functionality is very the same,
you know, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's pretty straightforward,
you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have the bottle jack press,
the plates up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like how he has the all-in-one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that thing like, can you do your own?
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's all manual.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all manual.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather have that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you kind of dial it in better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to learn kind of just how to like
manually work it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like this too because you feel it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can kind of feel it tightening up as
you press it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know when too much is,
you know, because you don't want to blow
[SPEAKER_06]: out.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Easily, quickly manual.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mine, I like having mine out of this area.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it was back here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can kind of stand right here,
get up in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, then there's the releases here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a quick turn and it drops it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you turn the right way, it must be
down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, when I was trying to figure it out,
I like unscrewed that completely and I was
[SPEAKER_04]: looking in there as I did it and this oil
started shooting out and I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: ah, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I quickly screwed it back in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're good here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should loosen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just not turned in the... It may be
because I completely unscrewed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be a little stripped,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I'm going to be able to get
it released back down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The press?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there like something wrong with it or
something?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't, can't loosen it no more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never used one of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are one of the OG ones, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that knob supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Release the press, release the plates
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause it should, you should be able to
loosen it.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I'm loosening it, but the nut,
the nuts coming off with it and it's not
[SPEAKER_06]: moving the threaded bolt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think it's like, if you had to,
if we took this off, we could probably
[SPEAKER_06]: loosen it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to come off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would just fall off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you just keep tightening,
you're just going to go in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just tightens up against the metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause we could tighten it more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that thing's supposed to be like,
you could pull it out or you lift it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should be able to just loosen it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like right now it's super, it's like
tight, but I should be able to crank.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not loosening the plates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I feel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause this, cause the bolt's not moving.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this won't do anything right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, this needs to.
[SPEAKER_01]: This won't go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we did press, it would just be able
to release it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we couldn't get it in there anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just press forever.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we had like a, see this is a.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, give me that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting how they have this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is it all crooked?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did all the oil leak out?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause this isn't moving.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what, when you, when you insured
it, you loosen this bolt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I wonder if I just get a something
to grab onto it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we could definitely tighten and
loosen it, but then we're going to ruin
[SPEAKER_06]: these threads.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to leave you with a little
cliff hanger until the next time we all
[SPEAKER_04]: get together.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going to review the rosin press
today because when I first got it and I
[SPEAKER_04]: was playing around with everything before
I even plugged it in, I basically
[SPEAKER_04]: unscrewed this thing until it popped out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I was peeking in here, I saw the
hydraulic fluid start squirting out and I
[SPEAKER_04]: freaked out and I quickly twisted it back,
the bolt back in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I had twisted it and I didn't realize
it until we were shooting and we finally
[SPEAKER_04]: turned the thing on that it was off
thread.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, when we're trying to twist this
thing, it wasn't grabbing the bolt to
[SPEAKER_04]: twist it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what this bolt is, is the release
valve so that when you press and once
[SPEAKER_04]: you're done pressing to release it,
you just twist it like a quarter turn
[SPEAKER_04]: counterclockwise and the plates come
apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will review it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very soon, but, uh, let me just quickly
show you that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I did to fix it was basically put
this thing on its back so that when I
[SPEAKER_04]: unscrewed the bolt, um, so the hydraulic
fluid would not come squirting out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so basically what I did was I
unscrewed the bolt and then I screwed it
[SPEAKER_04]: back in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, I guess, threaded or not off
thread.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever the word for that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I don't even need to plug this
in to show you, but since we're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: use it soon anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically as I, man, I'll wait this,
you would,
[SPEAKER_04]: of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wait, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now, take two.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now this is screwed all the way in
snugly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this we're on, you kind of stop it
right there for a couple of seconds and
[SPEAKER_04]: then you'd finish it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then now when you want to release the
plates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is back to normal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It perfectly working.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just screw that in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to do it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, we'll review it again shortly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on to the next episode, part two of
this extended two and a half hour
[SPEAKER_04]: conversation.
I'll see you then.
Bye-bye.
