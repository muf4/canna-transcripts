[SPEAKER_00]: Some news dropped about phylos bioscience
and for a number of years now they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting, they've been creating the
galaxy of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can talk a little bit about sort
of how they came out and what they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and what the news is this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So phylos originally, Mowgli, gets tied
into, I want to say, one of the museums of
[SPEAKER_01]: natural history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want to do mapping of cannabis
genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to start to be able to see this
picture in a more clear fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob Clark from Cannabis Botany,
a very famous cannabis, I want to say he's
[SPEAKER_01]: a scientist because he works in scientific
levels, but culturalist too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Rob Clark comes to me and says,
hey, we're about to create this galaxy to
[SPEAKER_01]: start laying out the outliers of cannabis
so we can start to see relationships
[SPEAKER_01]: between varietals and we can start to get
a better look at what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, cool, and we'll be able to
use the data down the road to help us
[SPEAKER_01]: understand breeding and help us understand
resistance and help us understand the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants at a better level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I agreed and I contributed material to
the galaxy that was directly from
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghanistan that someone brought me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew I had material that no one else
had in circulation so that it could start
[SPEAKER_01]: to lay out, I say, the fringes of the
galaxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I knew was that cannabis was
protected by the illegalities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I got to speak to people
decades ago, the reason why there was no
[SPEAKER_01]: competition for us was because the federal
illegality made it unfeasible for any
[SPEAKER_01]: major company to get involved because it
was too risky, just like it is now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until it's federally legal, a large
company could lose asset forfeiture of
[SPEAKER_01]: their investment in material and their
infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why none of these major players
are here yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they're buying into Canadian
companies because Canada has a system
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a little more stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have the same risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the American giants are buying Canadian
companies, Apria, Audemarboro.
[SPEAKER_01]: They buy into Kronos.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put like 1.8 billion into a Canadian
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives them now an ability to operate
and wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just saw another Canadian company,
Canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think they just hit up acreage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they're going to tie in,
I think, 3.5 billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to buy them as soon as it
goes federally legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that just tied in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point of that is that there was no
other companies coming in to do this type
[SPEAKER_01]: of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, there was this opportunity to
take a look at the plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went and met Philos's crew and met
Mowgli and Ralph, the COO, and met all the
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to assemble data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And down the road, that data would get
used in breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's clear what genomic companies do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't have any fear of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know they're not taking your
material and then replicating it through
[SPEAKER_01]: code.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not taking it into a gene gun and
spraying it onto a cucumber so they can
[SPEAKER_01]: then create your Sally's perp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's information that lets them see into
this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that what needed to happen,
and I think that they're going to do this
[SPEAKER_01]: soon, is to release the disclaimer that
you'll receive that says, none of your
[SPEAKER_01]: material is ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that I don't think that they saw
the blowback coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they realized people were
going to panic so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the panic is really more based
off of the minimalization of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivator today, where for 95% of us,
we're all being pressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't feel like we're valid because
we're not a multi-billion dollar company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have security.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're trying to figure out how to get
product into stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to figure out how to even get
a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people don't even have real licenses
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I lose my license for my farm
the end of this month.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that I'm going through the
annual because I'm talking to the CDFA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just getting a few little dates
straightened out for contractions and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bottom line is none of us have any
kind of real legal security.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have very little market
penetration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most people that do are getting buried
financially rather actually losing money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're terrified.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when someone says, we're taking
your material, and we're going to utilize
[SPEAKER_01]: this info, I think that people believe
that they're going to steal the tools that
[SPEAKER_01]: you use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't have that ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: That ability will be taken from you by
bigger companies who will do utility
[SPEAKER_01]: patents that will just cover broad swaths
of material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though utility patents can be
challenged in court, you happen to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: lawyer that you can go in and challenge it
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's very important to
understand because you have to get some
[SPEAKER_01]: form of movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Philos creates a company that looks
at the genome.
[SPEAKER_01]: They then create a service that you can
utilize as a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a cultivator, I can hire them to
start to look at my breeding lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from the information they've gathered
from looking at 4,000 or 5,000 different
[SPEAKER_01]: varietals, it gives them the ability to
understand what they're trying to look at
[SPEAKER_01]: when they're looking at your work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you can create lines that you can
patent, that you can license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are screaming about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're in corn or any other
company, and somebody says, I want to have
[SPEAKER_01]: a crop as a commodity as a commodity to be
a commodity to be a commodity for those
[SPEAKER_01]: people, then I think you should have some
kind of commoditized crop, which cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: is now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't understand that,
then you'll eventually be in a situation
[SPEAKER_01]: where nothing on your farm is yours to use
without paying someone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think that that's the world
we're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world we were in was really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all got to basically do what we chose.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're not in that world anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been completely changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really, it was gonna happen no
matter what, no matter what special bill
[SPEAKER_01]: was written for the little people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work like that in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: America doesn't write bills for little
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It writes bills for major companies that
consolidate and work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cultivators are very victimized by
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that when Philo says we're
gonna be doing this, everyone feels
[SPEAKER_01]: minimized.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna take your plant material,
they're gonna steal it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're gonna steal it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna use the information to give
them information.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically you have to work with them
for these projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they announce they're putting
together a massive facility, a lot of that
[SPEAKER_01]: is to do breeding work with breeding
partners that they're in relationships and
[SPEAKER_01]: partnerships with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see the problem with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just business.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the concern when they first came
out with seeking samples of plant material
[SPEAKER_00]: to sequence, I think it was back in 2014,
at the time cultivators were wary and have
[SPEAKER_00]: always been wary of biotech and that idea
that they could steal their heirloom
[SPEAKER_00]: varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Philo's at the time seemed adamant
that they would never be entering into the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's part of the concern
is they have now sequenced thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: varietals over 80 countries and breeders
and growers have paid to have these
[SPEAKER_00]: sequenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the announcement is that they
intend to partner with plant breeders and
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture nurseries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're claiming to have a more
in-depth genotyping method that they plan
[SPEAKER_00]: to use in these ventures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's called a SNP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about what that is?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a more accurate view.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is that there's many ways of
looking at the genome, and I'm not a
[SPEAKER_01]: geneticist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might know, I'm a cultivator who
looks at this from a very simple
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't claim to be a geneticist by any
means.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's utilizing scientific tools to
take a look at the chromosome and find out
[SPEAKER_01]: where on the plant is the markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are the indicators and the triggers
that make things occur?
[SPEAKER_01]: And by taking a look at tremendous numbers
of plants, it allows it to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you send your DNA into anybody,
it's data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you think that they want the data
so they can look at the data?
[SPEAKER_01]: But your heirloom varieties aren't being
stolen because they can't replicate it
[SPEAKER_01]: from the code.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it lets them take a look and
understand what to see and what makes
[SPEAKER_01]: things what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gives them a huge database tool to
utilize for projects, but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: stealing your shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm someone who's involved in breeding
projects with them where I pay them and I
[SPEAKER_01]: have them look at my material so that I
can then get information back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that I can then understand what I'm
looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have any fear of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew from the beginning that at some
point all this material would have to go
[SPEAKER_01]: into breeding because that's what
genome-based companies do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like 23andMe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's angry that they took the data
and used it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what did you think they were going
to do with the data?
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, the galaxy did two things
primarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got stuff into public domain,
which is what I wanted all these varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: that I had collected over the years to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that this way at least it allows there
to be a stamp-in time that says this
[SPEAKER_01]: variety was being used prior to you saying
you created it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Fineless can't take it either
because they didn't create it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just mapped it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to make sure that cultivators
who had some of these killer varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've been playing with for years had
at least some ability to keep cultivating
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Fineless was a great marketing tool to
show customers product and let them see
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships with things that allowed us
to take a look at the varieties and see
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until you have a million samples,
you're going to have missing data points.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're going to see into
relationships that don't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to see incomplete
pictures until the technology comes
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that as you go forward,
you'll see more and more tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bottom line is you either utilize
technology or you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think anyone that's in business
is there to do charity, well, then they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not a philanthropic group.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in business to do business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think people had to understand that
from the beginning that when you work with
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, they have an agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I spent time with the scientists,
I never felt in any way threatened by
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to do what they want to do,
which is map and then assist breeders in
[SPEAKER_01]: projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see what that's such a
traumatizing event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, 90% of the people that
are screaming about you taking my
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics, where did you get the damn
things from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who did you get it from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody gave it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I created it really from thin air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're really reusing someone's
stuff anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what material isn't available at
ReadySource?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing really that has the true
value that a patented line would hold for
[SPEAKER_01]: us in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that when I speak to grow
groups, I tell them all the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You all have to get together, combine your
resources, create a common line,
[SPEAKER_01]: something that works for you regionally,
that allows you to have something that all
[SPEAKER_01]: of you can cultivate for differentiation
that can't be touched by other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not about I have a magic clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about I have a reproducible line that
has some form of unique characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think people realize how many
patents are out there right now by these
[SPEAKER_01]: major groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people are like, they're going to
steal my material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you already lost half the stuff you
have because you don't realize it falls
[SPEAKER_01]: under a utility patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everybody's worried about somebody
mapping something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's already been taken,
but nobody's really looking at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, I've been looking at that for
a long time where I realized they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to come and take everything because that's
how it works in Ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're in Ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not in illegal drug dealing anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in Ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Ag, big companies do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, Phylos was a group of
scientists that when I spent time with
[SPEAKER_01]: them and I watched them in their personal
lives and I watch them how they behave,
[SPEAKER_01]: to me, they're reputable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've never not been reputable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had an issue with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not part of Phylos as a company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So me pushing their product and me pushing
using the Galaxy for the way I used it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it benefited most every single person who
used it because it allowed them to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what was connected to what.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gave them some good ideas about the
amount of hereditary traits that would
[SPEAKER_01]: move forward through homozygosity,
heterozygosity, how much was fixed and how
[SPEAKER_01]: much was variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allowed people to use the Galaxy as
a killer marketing tool because the public
[SPEAKER_01]: loves the damn thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you use the tools in front of you
at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, the people that I deal with at
the company, I think they're scientists,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think they're reputable scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never had an issue with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have an issue with them now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I think they were going to breed down
the road?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because that's what genetics
companies do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And did I think they were going to steal
anybody's data?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: But did having the data give them an idea
of what to look at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of the trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you explain more how you see them
using the data that they have and how it
[SPEAKER_00]: will perhaps change the game going
forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not just them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's medicinal genomics, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Kevin McKiernan.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a competitor company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And McKiernan is a genetic genius,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they've done the Jamaican lion
of some strain they've really gone into.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you take a look at a lot of
material, it lets you start to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bigger picture helps you understand a
smaller picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they have an idea of what things
look like and unique traits and qualities,
[SPEAKER_01]: when they look at your stuff, they can
say, hey, we've seen this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have to remember, there's no
book to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like micropropagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Micropropagation is very easy with a
laboratory and a scientist if there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most plants have recipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The formulation is to do the propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: With cannabis, there is no book to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where everybody struggles is
trying to create the proprietary formulas
[SPEAKER_01]: to replicate the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once that happens, it's simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, none of this is in play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, this is a race.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the race is I need to find a company
that can take information they have and
[SPEAKER_01]: then let me take the work that I'm doing
on my hill and have it studied so that I
[SPEAKER_01]: can actually try to create something
that's unique, differentiate enough so
[SPEAKER_01]: that I have an ability to hold it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a tool, a bigger picture tool
they can use to refine a smaller picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps to understand more about what's
happening with that big announcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it did seem like, on the surface,
a reversal from what they've been saying
[SPEAKER_00]: in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that when they said they're
not a breeding company, they're saying
[SPEAKER_01]: that we ourselves are not going to create
the plants and then sell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're working with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're working with people like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the process of this, they can get
plants and then I can release these plants
[SPEAKER_01]: to them to put through nurseries and move
into the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Phylos is not creating their own
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're helping you breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a breeding tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the calculator doesn't do the
math.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to do the math.
[SPEAKER_01]: The calculator just makes it easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I see science.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish it was different in the sense
that we could all just do what we did like
[SPEAKER_01]: we did prior, because it would be lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're not there anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're so far past that that people have a
hard time understanding that the scope of
[SPEAKER_01]: the competition that's coming in to take
over cannabis production globally is so
[SPEAKER_01]: big and so funded and so intelligent that
you are absolutely about to get stuck into
[SPEAKER_01]: a meat grinder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look if you look at like Steve
Hill, Reggie Godino from Steve Hill has
[SPEAKER_01]: been saying this for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that Steve Hill does genetic analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I respect Reggie in terms of he
definitely knows what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a Monsanto breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where most scientists go to
work is at big companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't go to school and spend a couple
hundred thousand dollars on an education
[SPEAKER_01]: to get a PhD so you can go work at the
corner store.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to where the money is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was basically, you're saying,
trained at Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't trained.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a PhD who worked at Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't get trained at Monsanto,
but he went to work for Monsanto because
[SPEAKER_01]: what does Monsanto do?
[SPEAKER_01]: They breed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he moved to working for Steve
Hill for a number of years now doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: similar program to what Filos is doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he can clearly tell you what they can
take and what they can't take,
[SPEAKER_01]: what they can use and what they can't use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's been probably one of the more
vocal proponents of you can use the
[SPEAKER_01]: services.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't steal your material.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that he didn't get the and I
respect Reggie because he's a brilliant
[SPEAKER_01]: guy, but he didn't get into the public the
way the galaxy did because the galaxy
[SPEAKER_01]: caught you visually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the galaxy created this incredible push
and it was a wonderful tool because it
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed the public to get caught up in it,
too, which has been crucial because you
[SPEAKER_01]: need marketing tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think also that Reggie, I recall,
was talking about patents being a reality,
[SPEAKER_00]: a future reality, whereas Filos was more
focused on this is how we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect you from having your material
patented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I felt like there were much different
perspectives coming out of each company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I talked to Filos, never once did
I, because I'm not paid by him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was my benefit of using it?
[SPEAKER_01]: My benefit was I needed the tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: I needed the tools to help me look into
the genome better than I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had this guy from NASA say, well,
it's not as accurate as it could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, then what company should
I use?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, well, there is none.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to do it privately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, that's lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means nobody can use the technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So therefore, it's worthless to the
grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything you can't use is worthless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that you can use at least have a
value because you use it at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never saw Filos as a malignant group
because their desire was to do this so
[SPEAKER_01]: they could get the information so down the
road they could be involved in breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: projects by helping growers breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seemed pretty clear to me the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm listening to this, and I'm like,
never once did I ever think that they
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't going to use the material.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just knew they couldn't use your
material and take your code and read
[SPEAKER_01]: produce your plant from a dead piece of
plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know they make special equipment in
life that can do all these incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the odds of a small biotech company
doing it are pretty small.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Syngenta level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think they're a $40 billion
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they come in, when Syngenta comes
in, which they will, you have a problem
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're going to sweep through
this thing with a broom.
