[SPEAKER_00]: We're at your facility here in Pahrump,
Nevada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't even really cracked the real
secrets or the, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, actually, maybe we have because
we're starting to talk about the compost
[SPEAKER_00]: and what makes the plants grow,
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we're about to step into that
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you guys good over here?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Greenhouse Project,
Future Greenhouse Project about to start
[SPEAKER_01]: up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can see it pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we've been talking, but we're
talking next year, three years out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've actually been planning this for
about two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really were going to hit a hard early
this year, but then the COVID thing hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we pumped the brakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that that hype is kind of settling
down, we're confident to start this
[SPEAKER_01]: project back up again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hoping to start getting things
ordered here in the next several weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, hopefully by next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like you guys already prepared
the slab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just pouring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And steel structure like the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that goes up quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's relatively quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think about a six month time period from
start to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by next summer, we should be,
if everything goes right, we should be
[SPEAKER_01]: having our first sun ground crop by late
next summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be nice.
Where do we want to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so this is basically,
this is the, where we're currently
[SPEAKER_01]: operating in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 12,000 square foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoor space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then over here to the right,
this is just our storage space.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where we just kind of store all of
our amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a little pad over here where we
do most of our compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not most, we do all of our composting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is your compost over here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we take a look?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any compost right now because
we just got through, well I have some
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors, but we're not composting right
now because of summertime, the summer
[SPEAKER_01]: heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So talk a little bit about your compost,
what you were talking about, the timing of
[SPEAKER_03]: it, when you do do it and what your
process is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over here, it looks like you have some
of your feed stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably some biochar, some alfalfa it
looks like, some straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what's in the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a couple totes of peat moss left
over from when we did that big soil mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have a couple totes or a
couple of soil bags of pumice from that
[SPEAKER_01]: same soil mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you're right, we have both
alfalfa and straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, just trying to store,
just storage at various amendments dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right, biochar is a black one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like honestly, you've got to have space
because when you need it, that's that
[SPEAKER_00]: bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a little mess out here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to clean up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got, it looks like trim,
which is being dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can be added to the compost as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so this is our official
composting area.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where we store all our dry
amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any of our canvas, leaf, stem,
we actually get a little bit of manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We store dry oak for our brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we basically store it all here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you see some of our pallets with
meshes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some of our compost fences or
cages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you, it looks like these are movable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a forklift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you utilize that in the composting
process, the turning, or is it just in for
[SPEAKER_00]: finish?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we don't really use a forklift for
them, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just use that to get them off the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just build our own pallets.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, this is our leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the leaves we've been storing
and drying all summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we're about to fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about to wrap the composting
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about to burn through all these.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much are we looking at?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is not much, is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what are we looking at?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the water leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little Swarovski pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I couldn't tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we had the paperwork that I pointed
to, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are you going to put it in the compost?
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to destroy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just drying out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is about to get all scooped up and
put in a bag like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at this, this is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we store everything dry, just like
Elaine teaches in her classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now this is just like the leaves and
the fall, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You collect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have them stored dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're prepped and waiting to be then
utilized in your compost when you're ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to build.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here, yeah, again, usually this
corner back here would be filled with oak
[SPEAKER_01]: or some type of brown material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside those trash bags, just unused
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of this stuff gets chopped and
dropped on our beds, but our beds can only
[SPEAKER_01]: take so much at once without smothering
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we have to take some of this
stuff out here and dry it out here and
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporate it in the composting process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, this is probably one of my
funner places of the whole facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially this time of year when it's
starting to cool off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can actually get going out here with
composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see me out here quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you are flipping your pillars,
is it more of a aggro style or is it more
[SPEAKER_02]: of like, here you go, fly over.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first couple of piles, I was more
crossfit in my methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely went a little hardcore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hurt my shoulder at one point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I blew out my fricking rotator cuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have your bandages on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I'm letting air out today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I actually have a style of
flipping it now inside out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really turns it nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to take your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed too that there's a down pressure
when you're going in so it doesn't just
[SPEAKER_00]: fall apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You come in and you push down,
not just lift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're really just trying to,
you're not making a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're literally just creating oxygen and
aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm real big on getting that outside in
and that inside out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always try to separate the pile when
I reflip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to work it all in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, this looks great and excellent work
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like some river rock and this is
probably for the new beds coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is access river rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: In all my beds inside I have, we throw
various piles of rock in the corners,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the middle of the beds just to create a
rock mulch environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The moisture consistency of the rock stays
the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't dry out as fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't get as wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you tend to see more worms and just
more biology right under the rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're diverse ecosystems within an
isolated island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within that living mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within that living mulch, you have the
little rock mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it just gives a different
environment for things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's not organic, it doesn't
actually contribute to pill bugs or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which we have, which I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had this for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a love-hate, but I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you just got to feed them enough or
they'll start eating other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much for sharing
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys are going to have to,
you guys got your IDs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we'll figure out the whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your process?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are going to put booties on and
then I'm going to go in here and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to hang out for me and I'm going to
get you guys some scrubs and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get you guys all scrubbed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can feel the air coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part of your HVAC, but we were
talking about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't actually use much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a very efficient system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see how we use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is its own unit in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything has to control the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't share air in any of our rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, this is just the office space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the big thing here is just to make sure
you have clean filters, obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: high-grade filters, and then purification.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have some type of UBC light in your
duct board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you're cleaning the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is basically the beginning of our
tour, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our open locker room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did an open locker room to try to
avoid theft and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an open locker room with clear lockers
really makes that hard to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: No pushback by anybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just dressing rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So open locker room with private dressing
rooms was the idea here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Employee break room down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some offices for my wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing too fancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we got our security booth right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have access.
[SPEAKER_03]: Food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very nice break room, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have pastries there for your
Saturday crew, which is really so nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually they take care of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some will bring them in and take care of
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's a security booth here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's all behind ballistic glass,
ballistic walls, access to all the
[SPEAKER_01]: cameras.
[SPEAKER_01]: All state requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's all legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over here is our sally port.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pretty much just saw our materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing really to see there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our trim room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go to this sink right here and we'll
wash up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just wash up right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So talk to you about your trimming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's hand-trimmed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, all hand-trimmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a nice, environmentally controlled
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not deteriorating our product as
we're trying to clean it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have trim days or are they busy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it like every day?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we typically run five days a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if we're backed up, we'll have an
excess of strain or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll offer overtime on the weekends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it looks like we had a crew take
us up on the offer this weekend so that
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole crew showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or at least a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a real quick turnover from
your processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: From pulling down the flour to in the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not pulling down the flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: But out of cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long before it's on the shelf?
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically for us, I would say roughly four
or five weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a 14-day dry period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we trim it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes about a week to trim it up before
it gets tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then a week for testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that puts us at about four weeks before
we can package it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the fifth week, it's packaged
and sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on strains, some strains we hold
back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some strains we try to put out in a hurry
because we know those curbs don't last as
[SPEAKER_01]: long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fruity stuff goes out first.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of the rule of thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruity goes first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that sweet tone is lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it gets that tartness,
which I kind of like sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little spicy sometimes,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing we had to recently do is we
actually expanded our trim room.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see that wall cut out,
that was actually a wall at one point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have another 4,000 square foot
beyond that wall that we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: expand into for more dry space with our
future greenhouse and our future indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: flower rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, we just do this little pop
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened was we changed our lights
out, got some new LEDs, new faux LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had almost a 50% to 100% increase
on some strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, we had to build a whole new
dry room and a whole more trim space just
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to handle the extra weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, weight in bud set or weight in
biomass growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall, bud set and just overall,
every part of the plants' volume went up,
[SPEAKER_01]: both our pre-roll material, our jarable
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we had, like I said, a 100%
increase on some strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Minimum 50% increase across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, so yeah, we did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have our little trial half station
over there that we're building out right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just got all our final little tools in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us about the next venture you guys
are working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you guys want to go check it out?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, goodbye real quick, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Jason, mind if I say goodbye real
quick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just a temporary little area.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't a hash lab that we're content
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to transition,
or at least use some of your produce,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And turn it into hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea is right now, we don't have a
very big volume to work with to launch a
hash lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a hash line.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're going to use the little bit
of volume we do have with is to do the R&D
[SPEAKER_01]: in preparation for our greenhouse project
and the rest of our indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when that time does come, now we have
some experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know how to make it the most efficient,
the best hash we can with what we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And scale up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And scale up from there.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what this is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went with the Bruteless hash washing
vessels.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the Sasquatch, Ross and Press,
the HarvestRite freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got all the cool tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got some big freezers in the Sallyport.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should be able to make some nice
stuff here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we got another dryer room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of this has been used yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all just installed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fresh toys, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you do the pre-rolls in here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a pre-roll day, and then that
type of stuff is done?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right now we just have a handful of
people trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually during the week, we have a
full staff out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have trimmers, pre-rollers,
packagers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have 20-plus people in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is like your production room for
that type of thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was just a weekend crew who wanted
the overtime kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically there's a lot more people in
here, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually there's a mass in every seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our new dryer room that we just
built out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've yet to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just to give you guys an idea of what
we've got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So completely all controlled through our
iPonics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our fan's not on there, but we have an
intake fan, an exhaust fan, through a
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon filter, ozone generator when
needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carbon filters in here to filter out any
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: AC unit, humidifier, dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can keep all those parameters that
we're aiming at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green lights help keep down the
degradation of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way when we put the plant in here,
it stays sleeping.
[SPEAKER_01]: 14 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our desired time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will clear out, is this for each
bay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically there's two dry rooms per
bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each one of these, I have two dry rooms
that each represent a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I fill one one week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fill one the next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third week, this one's empty
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this room looks like it's super easy
to reset or sterilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: To sterilize and break down is a huge part
of the design.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only real issue that we had that I
didn't like was where the placement of
[SPEAKER_01]: this fan filter is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason we had to do that,
the reasons upside down like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: is because the other side of this wall is
an AC unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to work around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the only pain in the butt in
this room that's going to be able to clean
[SPEAKER_01]: or change that filter up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, it's meant to just be
able to be sprayed down and washed down
[SPEAKER_01]: easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you got a green.
[SPEAKER_03]: Greens are cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: A green.
[SPEAKER_03]: So does the whole place close down by
five?
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically we run five days a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to run this place like a regular
business, get people their lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because of the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was just the... Yeah,
that's just the dry room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our flowering rooms, typically our
lights are off at five.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you guys are limited yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually one of my rooms is off at
four.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a little further in the cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we knock another hour off.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a light Eagle 20 Avid mix,
just to make sure we kill anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you guys could be bringing in just to
be safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, safety first.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a Dr. Bronner's and essential
oil from Build A Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just pretty much in the smell of
lemongrass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just spraying your legs just in case
you walked in with anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you guys usually have the same
shoes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just do a quick rinse right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're supposed to wash our hands again or
use the alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for your SOPs, it's enter every room,
wash your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually we'll skip the trim room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my growers will skip that and just come
right to here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we walked the trim room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to wash there and wash here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me about the little ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to our bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, these are just planted a couple
days ago at the Clone Dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're just kind of working through
their stress of getting into their new
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just one round.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually in preparation for one of
our, we have a slightly smaller room out
[SPEAKER_01]: of our three rotation rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is for one of our smaller rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about what's in the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are a transition from clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not growing out of a rock wall,
are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do unfortunately currently use,
that's one of the only limiting factors I
[SPEAKER_01]: have, or not limiting factors,
but one of the variables we have is that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're using riot router type plugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were using it, which is a peat moss
base with some type of adhesive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it still breaks down in the system,
not very fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not something I want to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It implies a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have some that I'm testing,
like literally just put into worm bins
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's so much life, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best thing I've seen that break them
down is the bird's nest mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you ever see the bird's nest
mushrooms, collect those little seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: put those in your beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love riot routers, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have those put into a living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what these are is basically when we
plant our beds, the little bit of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: that we take out of our beds to make room
for these, we take back and then those go
[SPEAKER_01]: back into the pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and we just rotate our holes every
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we never dig, we never pull the root
ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: We plant right, we dig right next to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we let the root ball break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the next cycle, that's what we take.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so these then is used to foster
the growth and then it allows you that
[SPEAKER_00]: transition back into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the same soil that's in our
beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is 20 second cycle living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is off the top of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a high concentration of a worm
castings in this, in this mix here,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is nice at this because these are
still shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they, that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is about it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, they're planted three days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is, we're literally in the heat of
the stress right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in about three days, they should start
coming back to normal and start showing
[SPEAKER_01]: some growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now they're just adjusting to their
new environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, that's totally,
I'm talking about when it transitions to
[SPEAKER_00]: the beds, because this ecosystem is so
similar to what they're going into because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just been removed for a short time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing the heat, the transition
stresses there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you'll always see some because
you're cutting off the root hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's, there's, there's other
variables that we've ran across.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like recently changed our lights up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we planted into rooms with that new
variable that we had to adjust to like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, too much light, too little light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's a whole new system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've had to adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still in that fine tuning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really like it though.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really fine tuning now.
[SPEAKER_01]: After, after five plus years, we just
changed the biggest input in the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: facility, the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we have to kind of refigure things
out again and kind of refine tune.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, yeah, we love in
every part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these beds here, from my
understanding, this is part of what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using for your cloning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us, tell us what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so we try to, we try to not,
or we try to grow as much of the inputs
[SPEAKER_01]: that we use as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So aloe is one of the things that we use
the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you guys know, it has high in salicylic
acid, good sap in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's, uh, it's just a good thing
to both feed the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's good for foliar feeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for the cloning process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so it's just a good plant to have
around super easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of the fact that it's good for the
people too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, as, as, as someone with fair
skin to get sunburn, I definitely had my
[SPEAKER_01]: fair share of aloe rubbed on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is happening with these beds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are plants going in here?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a mother bed that we just
cleared out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another cycle of mothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, basically this is kind of our,
our worm bin really, um, all of our excess
[SPEAKER_01]: organic material that our beds can't take
that we don't feel like taking outside,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, kind of gets thrown right here and the
worms just devour it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so this is kind of our, it's really
like our mother bed slash worm bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's hard to describe sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, because this is an ecosystem,
like this is a perpetuation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nourishment that is like, if you needed
something, well, where do you go get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in my garden, the whole garden
ecosystem, like you literally go into the
[SPEAKER_00]: trail and pull up your material for your
potting plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and that's what this allows you to do
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: What this is, one thing I've been doing
with this mother bed that's been,
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't really talked much about online
yet, but I've been seeing really good
[SPEAKER_01]: results with is when I'm done with a mom,
I'm pulling that root and I'm putting it
[SPEAKER_01]: in a tea brew, uh, immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm getting much, much shorter brew
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm working with active microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not dormant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the whole rhizosphere boom,
boom, right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not wasting these moms at all now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I've been doing that for the last,
I would say almost this last year really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I've been really enjoying that
because I'm really getting, I'm getting
[SPEAKER_01]: something out of this bed now as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also allows you to really, I do that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows me to see the,
the root growth, like especially in a
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till situation, I never dig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dig up the whole root system to see what
it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I can shift that out and go,
this is what I'm really working with
[SPEAKER_00]: underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's really kind of a cool
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can open your eyes to some of the
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Problems or successes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like where's your root depth going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw him look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from home.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a, uh, it's an African Boabab
tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Madagascar trees as the tree
of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, some of the oldest trees in the
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I had one, but it's a tropical tree
and it gets cold out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't want to plant it outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I bonsai'd it, um, several months ago,
uh, and brought it to here to GLP and it
[SPEAKER_01]: had blown up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows like a half an inch a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I actually broke a branch off at one
time and had a nurture it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrapped it up with some aloe,
um, re-healed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what does it mean when you bonsai it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, basically you can, you cut the root
and you stunt its growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You stifle its growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why is it still growing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you didn't kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I didn't kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's at GOP and it's getting the best
compost teas and the best extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's grown with this life,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't get as big as it would
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're holding it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, once a year, what I'll end up doing is
there's wires that are actually holding it
[SPEAKER_01]: down to that pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, once a year I'll cut those wires.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to up pot it, cut the roots and
then repot it in the same pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that how they get the bonsais to bend
with those wires?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's just manipulation over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real bonsaying is how you deal with
the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people only think of how the little
tree is shaped, but the real shaping goes
[SPEAKER_00]: below ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: As above is below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so you got, you got to up prune that
below.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like you would the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the bonsai is actually more
important as a root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, so this is our mom bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about to get freshly planted again
with a new run of moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about what we're seeing,
a different kind of aloe smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but what else is happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Life-wise in the bed and by life-wise,
we'll talk about the microbes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: worms and stuff, but also the green,
you know, the other than cannabis life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we use various companion plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're getting it breaking it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but for the most part, um,
the, the, the most two that we use,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, we use them for ground cover purposes
is just Dichondra.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then a chickweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a personal fan of chickweed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually helps with the peel bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I feel like, uh, so our beds that have
high concentration of chickweed,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, have the lowest population of peel
bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this right here is a Dichondra.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it serves a really good ground
cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we don't have to reseed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows back all on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen it go to flower,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it's a super low maintenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you gotta do in the beds, if it gets
out of hand, it's just got to chop and
[SPEAKER_01]: drop it before it gets too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the, the meal, uh, the meal,
uh, peel bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't have such an aggressive
root, like a mint, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it penetrates and spreads.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the root system on this?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you over seed it, it's a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's a big thing people have
problem with with Dichondra is they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: either over seed it or under manage it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or both the over seeded and under
manage it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it'll just have this jungle mess
of a, of a, of a covered companion plant
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but so if you don't over seed it and
you, and you maintain it and you keep it
[SPEAKER_01]: down, um, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hundred percent manageable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you don't, again, you don't have
to waste energy and time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Re-seeding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's just not popped back up on its
own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this over clover.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started the facility off with clover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, clover has its place in some places,
subalpine or not white Dutch or more
[SPEAKER_01]: crimson clover, um, than anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then, uh, it was a mix of some
other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red clover, crimson clover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, they, again, you gotta maintain
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the problem with the clover is
those high end, um, plants, those,
[SPEAKER_01]: those, those lugums is that they attract
path a lot of pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of, like thrips, uh, aphids,
uh, anything you can imagine that like
[SPEAKER_01]: high end, um, they're just, they're just a
breeding ground for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of became a problem after the
years of just kind of having to re deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, there's also plus sides,
certain things like the clover more than
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having the clover would keep things off
your cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, there's really some pros and
cons and ways to look at it, but we got
[SPEAKER_01]: rid of the clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your variables is where you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one works for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super low maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does its purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's adding exudates into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need nitrogen is an easy building
block to replace.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can always top dress with some alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, so it's not something I need to
grow on the beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's causing that much of a problem,
like what, like the alfalfa clover does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that conjure, what's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: This bed, um, this, this big, we didn't
start with this bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this bed is a little newer,
but it's, it's old potting soil dumped in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I want to say this was a two or three
years old, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but yeah, so chickweed and that
conjure are most, um, popular ones that we
[SPEAKER_01]: use, but we have other companion plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use different reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a lot of trap planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll plant specific plants just to
attract the pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use clover for a trap plant actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then, uh, another thing I do is,
uh, we plant a lot of, uh, banker plants
[SPEAKER_01]: like pepper plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so a lot of, uh, sweet peppers,
purple, sweet purple flash peppers,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see the various throughout the
rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what about your choice of, uh,
container is, uh, was that, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: why is this the grassroots?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love the guys over at grassroots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started off before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they were actually open though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my rooms, we actually have old geo
planters, um, the older style,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, fabric beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what do you like about the fabric?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, this is more breathable than they're
just, they're really good, easy,
[SPEAKER_01]: affordable setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, nowadays they make the no-till one,
which I kind of help inspire, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the, the less penetrable sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so you can actually sink the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I played a really big role in the
development of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so even though you don't see it here,
what you're going to see here,
[SPEAKER_01]: is old beds wrapped with Saran wrap that
basically, uh, inspired the next,
[SPEAKER_00]: next generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, what I like about grassroots is
they're, they're, they're an awesome team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, their product speaks for itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they beefed up their piping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so you don't have this flimsy leak
piping and fittings are breaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they went with the tan, so it's not
attracting heat, uh, especially when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in the outdoor environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll be able to maintain this
environment in this bed for as long as you
[SPEAKER_03]: want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're testing that theory out right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see how far we can push it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: 22 cycles, um, deep and, uh, and going
strong.
22.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We thought that would be like four years
or something, but it not, but it,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five is some change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, so I basically get four and some
change at four and a third cycles a year,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, at each room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have three rooms, so I get roughly 13,
13, um, harvests a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when, when some people hear that,
they say, oh, he's almost burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of his newts.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to have to flip, you know,
it's a five year cycle or soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying this is how far we've run,
but we're continuing to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going for, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, my newts is quite the opposite,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly, the only problem I have right
now at my soil is that it's too rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so now I can't top just anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just maybe a little bit of alfalfa for
the, to make up for the, for the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a weird bounce where the beautiful
worm activity in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be separated and moved around
and, you know, but in a bed it gets really
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated, super rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to like bump the carbon up
without it being a sink at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but anyways, so yeah, this is veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of where you get everything
big before loading into the rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you see some of our extra clones that
we didn't plant yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just backups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's our other little cloning area
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting burnt out right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And check out your T-bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, this looks like how you move it
around and then disperse.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a mess right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liquid is the difficult thing to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so having efficient and yet still not
killing the organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the liquid is really the transport
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, well, then you use a pump that
kills everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the heck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been doing, you know,
it makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have diaphragm pumps, so it's exactly
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kills less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we test the T both in the brew and out
of the hose to see the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you see a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might not see as big as strands of
fungi, but they're still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might get beat up a little bit,
but they're still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is just two little T brewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I turned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but the important part that he shared
was actually the diaphragm pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of it being a propeller impeller
that's spinning and chopping and forcing,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just doing this motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you, you're not shredding the life.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you just through a blender.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, these are some of our,
so one cool thing is, uh, when we designed
[SPEAKER_01]: this facility, uh, I was real big into
permaculture and capturing and storing
[SPEAKER_01]: energy and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we actually designed the whole,
every single room.
[SPEAKER_01]: This pipe right here, that recycle water,
that's the feed line off of all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidifiers from each room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it goes into a catch tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from that catch tank,
we put it through a UV light and through
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy sediment filtration.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no RR.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not wasting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes into the tank and in the
process it gets ultraviolet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, then from that tank, it gets pumped
out of that tank through an ultraviolet
[SPEAKER_01]: and heavy, heavy sediment filters,
carbon filtration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it gets put into our storage
tanks that feeds the rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we're basically catching at this
point, I would say up to like 67% of our
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only water that we're losing is
through our AC units, um, which we then
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually catch as well, uh, and do the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever tested before you
ultraviolet it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, never have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it'd be fun to look at though,
because you're actually pulling,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The moisture, the micro literally stuff in
the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be curious to see where it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more, it's more, it's not,
or is it off the machine?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not so much the air chemicals are the
air pollutants that we're worried about in
[SPEAKER_01]: the water, which we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but also the, the, the shit that's in
the pipes, algae and all that stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in the pipes, um, that we also
want to kill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's where a lot of people end up
with a sarium issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this, uh, these are light controllers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: This room was just planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants are a little small, little
stressed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy to be going into an LED room
and not have the purple purple for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, it was just planted,
uh, last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're about, uh, no, actually eight
days into planting in this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they just got through their stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually just starting to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're still cleaning this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So breaking it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to look out because we're
talking about where the rock placements
[SPEAKER_00]: and how these ecosystems are set up or if
we can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this, this room was just planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a 22nd cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, how many plants in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Depends on strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So light barrier on the exterior of the
door.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still, we still seal them, but this is
just foolproof.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, if one of these pops off or
something happens, we don't, we don't see
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole fucking room.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, welcome to our 30, our 22nd cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a, this is a part of your 22nd
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, this is our first room on our 22nd
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking great, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, this whole row right here is all black
triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in the middle, there's some potted
plants and some Thailand, uh, to our
[SPEAKER_01]: right, we have some great pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this isn't our, this isn't the winning
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually the phenotype that I
breed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's super grapey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I use it because it's the grape
that I want in the breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other phenotype we have is higher
testing, still grapey, not nearly as
[SPEAKER_01]: grapey as this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you're talking grapey,
are we talking like a grape bubble gum
[SPEAKER_00]: grapey or are we talking like grape candy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like a straight up grape candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the smell and the flavor,
um, they are, it translates very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, overall though, this one is my
favorite thing on the smoke just for
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm using it in the breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the other one isn't a sell better
because it has a higher testing in this
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, better this one is this is part of
shifting that conversation because we
[SPEAKER_00]: spoke some great flower last night,
but I'm, but it's about what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you say this one holds a note
that it cuts through that has value.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, until where the thing is too,
though, is that people don't value
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes as much as cannabinoids yet,
even though this one has a higher terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't test for flavonoids yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like this might have that, like,
I don't see the grape in the terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, the grape must be a flavonoid in my
opinion, because this terpene profile
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't differentiate between other
terpene profiles that don't have grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's all word of mouth at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't smell the product,
you can't test the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't, you know, anything the product
before you pay for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to see it on a piece of paper or
beautiful labeling or jars or yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's attractive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, this is fire angel.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is CBD strain right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, 50, I think a two to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's my sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're blowing up a real yellow
leaves in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, so this is actually one of the
great things of the living soil bed is
[SPEAKER_00]: that process makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the rolly pollies and
the pill bugs to eat that, it makes no
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's now a vector for bacteria and
fungi and other things to break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have the breakdown process or
it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why, that's why the
relationship with mealy bugs is it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: love hate, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to feed them, but you just got to feed
them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tom, if it's okay, I don't know how
you mess with your beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I usually am just hands in and
looking, but I'd like to roll the stone
[SPEAKER_00]: over just to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can take a video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a bigger one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to find one that usually is
active.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to use a small base one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find a big flat one, but this,
this is that importance of showing that
[SPEAKER_00]: life too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve, how do you water in here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's your watering system?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there, is it what your water,
your water?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a three rooms like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're all hand watered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I have two, two growers on
schedule, on schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The schedule changes throughout each one
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, we have a very, very strict
watering schedule that we follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, obviously depending on what the plants
are telling us as well as telling us,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, if you see this,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, no, that's a, it's a chipmunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a chipmunk or a rat that got in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been hunting, we've been hunting up
for six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: He loves, he loves our, uh, our predator
packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're predator packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're Swarovski mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a beneficial insect.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been hunting them for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you know what Elaine would say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw a bird in here and you have the
complete soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually, um, eats the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the, we'll come in here and see how
the, the, the, the guys on the sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, he mows it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we've actually done less cover crop
management since it's been in here though.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the weirdest of ways, I kind of want to
eventually get to the fact that you bring
[SPEAKER_00]: your rabbit to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put them in the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He mows, he poops because it's cold
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that would be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take your little support animal home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just another row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, basically just it's all happy
praying plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our Miss X right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This Miss X right here is a, one of our
highest testing, highest yielding strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, she's won all the awards for the best
sativa in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, she's a, even though she's expressing
more of a Indica phenol.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a, uh, half of her is ACDC CBD and
doesn't even show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so she's a weird one, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's when we say sativa, we're more
associating.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not, we're not, and that's the thing
about the old style.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back in the day, if you say Indica
sativa, and you, it depends who you ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you asked a grower, they're going to
talk about how tall or short or stout or
[SPEAKER_01]: how quick it finished or how long it
finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but nowadays if you ask somebody
Indica sativa, they're strictly asking you
[SPEAKER_01]: about the effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to make me sleep?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it going to make me up or down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so when I said sativa, I was more or
less referring to the, uh, the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why there's so much confusion on
the customer base because, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no time to explain,
but the effect is often confused by other
[SPEAKER_00]: like flavor profiles and, and what are you
looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just needing some love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I mean, that's pretty much,
oh, this is the other great pytheno right
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the winter grape pytheno,
technically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this is a mid thirties, um,
total cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it does have the great profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the grape just isn't as loud as the
other one, the number five.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the number, uh, I can't remember
what number this one was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was number nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, I think it was number nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no, number 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is number 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the other one was number five.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number 12 is a mid 30 percenter.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number five is a 20 percenter.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole is a stronger note.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, this is pretty much our rooms,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a 22nd cycle, three rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've done this at this point,
65 times now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so impressed with how you keep the
consistency of your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, it's so, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a, and multiple strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, multiple strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been, I mean, so this is a good
example of where this was last cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was left in place, just harvested
the next to it in the void.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the new plant goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see it in every single one
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's already, this one's already been
broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the natural progression.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already broken down and falling
apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but if you look, they're in every
single bed right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is how you can still maintain
the system while using pots to transfer in
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're, you're only disturbing it
as little as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are in pots that you transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, these, these were, this was our last
plant was last cycle was planted right
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the plant got cut down, harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when it was time to replant,
we went right next to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause what we didn't want to do was that's
where all the active biology was last
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle was right there in their visosphere,
right there in their root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we harvest that, we, we,
what we ended up doing is harvesting 90%
[SPEAKER_01]: of our worms and all the biology out of
the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So leave that in place, let that start the
next cycle off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then just move over, move over.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right next to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get the benefit of all that biology
anyway, don't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're tapping into it the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically we just shift grid every
single cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but I mean, they're, they're planted
and you transplanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not like you didn't, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we were in the room with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let me ask you one question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were all of these in this room
transplanted over at the same time or were
[SPEAKER_03]: different strains brought over at
different times?
[SPEAKER_01]: This room gets cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get harvested at different times,
but they all get planted the same day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're all at the same stage in their
development, but just expressing it
[SPEAKER_03]: differently.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then you design everything
specifically to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the ones, these are the sativas
that I'm rotating from room to room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to try to get 20 weeks out
of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, remember last night, these are the
plants that take longer, but his rooms are
[SPEAKER_00]: on a 10 week cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got to move these plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at these beauties.
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you tell it?
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are, this is an authentic,
original Thai seed out of Thai seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a land raised seed brought in doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a looks like some marigolds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or here.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love marigolds that deter pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually, we did a study on root
feeding nematodes and the marigolds create
[SPEAKER_01]: a biotoxin that appears to deter or kill
the root feeding nematode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did different control methods in
several different pots and we studied it
[SPEAKER_01]: over several cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of it, the marigolds had
the best results after three cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are multiple species.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is French.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but those Thailand's, I do believe
they are a wild variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it was bred.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think it was whatever is floating
around out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, they're exotic.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there was a selection that
was on getting that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are, no, I think the purple flash or
those might be the spicy Joe's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, those are the other New Mexico's
Joe Parker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we talk about this, this environment?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the same?
[SPEAKER_03]: How, what is the plans for, so what's the
question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what can, you know, it's a creature
that as long as he feeds it and loves it
[SPEAKER_00]: can grow forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're trying to prove is
that, Hey, done correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to hit a hundred cycles plus
out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really want to show that,
that that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has it been done yet?
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this is five,
this 20 cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say 20 is five years, 20 is five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a hundred cycles is longer than
most businesses, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: With the same consistency and maturity is
the expectation as a grower that the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis you grow in the a hundred cycle
environment will be the same as that that
[SPEAKER_03]: was grown in the 22nd.
[SPEAKER_01]: How will that have changed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically it's supposed to get better
with these cycles as that soil matures,
[SPEAKER_01]: as that soil gets broken down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked in the fungi ratio changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these funds, I take years to
literally stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well remember everything in this ecosystem
is all about, it has to be conducive for
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and the bacteria grow fastest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like literally it can take years for a
fungal spore to be like, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: this environment is healthy long enough
that I feel safe enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comfortable enough to now do my job
because it's part of that relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: with whoever's on this above and below
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 15, 20 years from now, you know,
what a crazy thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know anybody who's gone this far
with a living soil indoors, but we
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely want to push the envelope,
see how far we can take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's already paid for itself 10
times over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, there's no reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that because most people,
it's always the price tag, which is why
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't want to do new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is an initial price tag,
but it's actually not that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly in the fact that you've got to do
more than just fill a bed with bulk peat
[SPEAKER_00]: filler, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That costs more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after that, it's not the same
nutrition cycle because the life is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually utilizing what's in that pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's similar to the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a more upfront purchase when you're
getting into a soil system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be, but that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a one-time purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as the hands-on requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're out there making compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to commit to making a compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some aspects of it that require
work, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, it's more farming than playing
video games.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's definitely, it's not as
labor-intensive as people think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you really streamline it,
make it an efficient process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, again, I have three rooms like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run with two growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three of these rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every plant you see- Three rooms at
this scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: With two people.
[SPEAKER_01]: With two people and a harvester.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I guess three people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a different part of the cycle,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's two weeks out of the month I have a
harvester come in and harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, two people grow,
plant, clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see irrigation run everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: All hand-watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which for most people is like,
oh, you never get the consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you train your staff to not just
stand there and gossip and flood your bed?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're water ninjas, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have- Hey, while we're here,
are these your new lights?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, these are, in my opinion,
and I'll fight anybody who says otherwise,
[SPEAKER_01]: these are definitely the best lights on
the market, I feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the Fos A3I.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's their flagship light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most overbuilt, awesome piece of
grow equipment on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a 1,500 watt LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're spectrum controllable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a program where you can do a
sunrise, sunset.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just the trickiest lights on the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a really good job engineering
them and in thinking this light through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Example, if I get a diode out or a bar
out, I don't got chance to change the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole fixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in, they swap a bar out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just little things like that are just
super efficient for me as a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing I'm noticing is,
unlike some other brands, you really have
[SPEAKER_03]: to place them really specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have a grid to place them.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can direct the angles, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can direct the angle, but what's
really important is the beam angle that
[SPEAKER_01]: they went with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people go too wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the newer LED lights,
like I don't have to throw any brands
[SPEAKER_01]: under the bus, but a lot of the newer
leading LED companies, they use a really
[SPEAKER_01]: wide beam angle, which forces you to throw
the lights six inches to a foot above your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, which doesn't leave space for air
to move, which creates, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: less consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: With these lights, they have the power and
the beam angle to where you can set them
[SPEAKER_01]: and forget them, which is great for
commercial applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much space between the light
and the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's easily 10 feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really good for commercial
application because I don't have to chase
[SPEAKER_01]: the stretch now.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the beam angle, I'm not throwing
light on that wall over there unless I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I was wondering, because
people would say the side of the plant's
[SPEAKER_03]: not getting light, so that's why they're
reflecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I did with these lights is,
if you look, I put the outside bar on the
[SPEAKER_01]: row across from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forced it out, so I'm getting that to
penetrate and slide underneath the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting tons of penetration with
these lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that in your other plant
growth, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't have the cover crop or
understory penetrating as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very well done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your soil is going to outlive your... Your
beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that we're... Yeah,
because that's the reality of going,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, no, if you really do this,
that's temporary.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to understand, so far,
and that's going to be a testament,
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately, is that so far, our soil's
outrun, our lights are all our first
[SPEAKER_01]: original fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now, Tom, did you hear that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when we talk about return and
investment, we talk about costs and
[SPEAKER_00]: expenses, most people see it as,
when do I have to replace?
[SPEAKER_00]: What he just said is that what is actually
growing his plant has been consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: longer than the lights, because you've
changed those out, even the type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Staff, the consistency of the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that is the most important
point here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This may look like any grow room you've
seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: This looks way better.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is unlike almost any other grow room
that you will find, and that is really
[SPEAKER_03]: unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so true.
[SPEAKER_03]: At this scale, this is the only one you'll
find like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: In your mind, you continue to reap...
[SPEAKER_03]: like financial benefits from working with
this type of environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you become a successful farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I mean, we're highly successful
businessmen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really want to be able to take our
success and share with good products to
[SPEAKER_01]: the customers, with good jobs for our
employees, with a good business for the
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really want to fire on all cylinders.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, that's all great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a great product, so thank God you
have a great product out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, when you go apply,
you're like, wait a second, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to have to invest as much in
it because I'm working with this,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the big thing is people look at
how much can they get per pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the question I ask myself a lot is how
much am I putting in per pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what a lot of people that's a
question they don't ask themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that keeps us so
competitive is how little money we spend
[SPEAKER_01]: turning these rooms over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I come in, I clean this room,
I replant, I probably spend $50 in
[SPEAKER_01]: materials to restart this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: $100 in materials to restart this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you include compost,
if I hit a heavy compost, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that might compost, but I make it in
house, so technically it's free.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would cost about $500 a yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and even then you're looking at
hours versus days or weeks of labor also
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, it cost me a thousand bucks to
flip this room per cycle, not including
[SPEAKER_01]: the power bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so I mean, that's a huge cost
savings that keeps us competitive that we
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't do without the living soil
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that competitive is not just on the
market with other products, it's also with
[SPEAKER_00]: the customer base you're trying to
actually interact with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just having to cover your costs
and you've out-costed most of the people
[SPEAKER_00]: who would really appreciate your product,
just because you're being inefficient,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're penalizing the people who are so
grateful to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a fork down here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to have a picnic down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the fairies have the picnic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, the idea is to drive the
cost down, how much to put into the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: to drive the quality up and to drive the
yields up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so far we've done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our quality has always been top shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've actually just this last year broke
into those dream number yields that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: been striving for for the last five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the downside, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's got to be something.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, we're in a regulated market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, we could fail at any minute for
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: AC could go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always a risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always rainy days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have our issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not all smiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you guys able to tap into the local
power grid or you have generator backup?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a generator backup right now that
handles our security system, but that
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't run our lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are currently looking at a
generator that will run our HVAC and
[SPEAKER_01]: lights if needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a great question because
there have been growing blackouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But luckily our placement, we're in
between two power grids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually when one shuts down,
they transfer power from the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in actually one of the best
locations to have a grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we've we've only actually
know we had one for I think less than an
[SPEAKER_01]: hour blackout.
[SPEAKER_03]: How much do you pay for it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put the answer on the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, be respectful, Tom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It shouldn't be an embarrassing question,
but it's a really important one.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we have costs, you think of the costs
differently because it's part of what
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps it everything fed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go at that point, you're like,
actually, it's not a cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have to take care of my people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to a massive grow in eastern
Washington state where the energy is like
[SPEAKER_03]: two cents a kilowatt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they pay nothing because there's
that's where they produce like all the
[SPEAKER_03]: energy for the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're so lucky, but they're,
you know, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that often breeds inefficiency
because it's so cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, oh, don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reality is, is the one thing that
we have good here going for us,
[SPEAKER_01]: though, is that we don't pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just torched that the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought it in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I'm looking at the worms already.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that we don't have peak hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a private power company and
they don't do peak hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during the day, like in Vegas,
during the day, midday, you're paying more
[SPEAKER_01]: for power.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't do that out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That forces people in Vegas to make their
their crews work at night and all these
[SPEAKER_01]: ridiculous things to try to save pennies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of the road crews are out at
one o'clock in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's weird little things because
the infrastructure doesn't support what
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody has to do to get done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can let's pull that file.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just lift the pot over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these have just don't don't do it
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tom, why don't you get the camera just
close enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: And all we want to do is just the reality
that the soil in here is actually already
[SPEAKER_00]: so close to what's in here that the life
just transfers between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see worms literally hanging
out the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are different various mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see some springtails.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see some snails.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only pot flipping you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys want to talk?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should probably have a little
bit of conversation outside the rooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: too, just in case the fans become a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check this out, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check these lights out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to give you guys an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this little row right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring it back to the spectrum's restroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I want to, I can go autumn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really hit the heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're heavy red.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty cool light, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have this feature here where
you can just scheduling sunrise,
[SPEAKER_01]: sunset.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically the lights, they don't start
off at 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll start off at the minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll let the plant wake up before
they hit him with that PPFD on the tail
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, resting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're really, really nice system,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly recommend folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you guys know anybody who's
interested in lights, have him hit me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll hook him up with the team from Post
and get him dialed in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like that you're a combination of
technology and old school.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't go wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of our original things I was
trying to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of says all we're going for,
old growth forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, that's a different perspective,
right, of what a cannabis grow is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm going for, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our mission, you know, 100 cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions before we take off?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to have more, no?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't have any questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: My basic feeling is it's really it's
clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's organized so nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can see how you have complete
control over everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like humming along.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just asked myself, it's like it's
like you were saying, it's like you can't
[SPEAKER_03]: be everywhere at once.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because, you know, you do want to get
bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like it's so nice at this size.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's so nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I know what we do expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to miss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your expansion is a different type of
growth with the greenhouse part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are you going to put more bays like
this as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the 35,000 square foot building in
front, the goodwill that you guys saw,
[SPEAKER_01]: that will all be built out for more
indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have we'll have six more rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: The green light, goodwill.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do want to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we could talk about it in the other
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we were talking about to do relatively
smaller businesses right now in cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: have an advantage because they're not over
leveraged.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have too many things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, it's sort of like what's
wrong with running a small business in the
[SPEAKER_03]: scheme of things?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does everyone have to go here?
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe we can talk about that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got caught up in the rat race at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I wanted a hundred thousand
square foot We get through the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people, that's intimidating,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about finances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people, that's too intimidating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about, dude, I'm not a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just grow plant, you know, that's
intimidating.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you deal with going, but I'm still
going to try something that no one else is
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, when you're really just trying to
meet the medical needs of a community to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a different agenda where the
quality is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the focus and guess how much our
yield is versus no, no, we don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just got to push to get this number.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of personally, I was kind of
blessed with a fearless nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me it was challenge accepted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it kind of stayed in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, when you know what
you're doing, it's so right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard for anybody to tell you you're
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just something that you just
got to believe in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are literally the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The worm, the finance book, the
satisfaction of your employees,
[SPEAKER_00]: the efficiency of your flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you go to work, people like to
go to work versus a drudgery because of
[SPEAKER_00]: all the managed problems they have to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a living system that we just
walked in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you guys felt it,
but there's energy in these rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a living energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you walk into them, the air is
fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not stale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't smell like water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like air, like supposed to
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a good, clean, energetic
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I come here, I drink coffee in
the morning, don't get me wrong,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just walking through that door right
there wakes me up, gives me energy,
[SPEAKER_01]: makes me feel alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm thankful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that right there should give the
person who feels like crap some courage,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To try something a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That actually helps lift you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the plant reaching out to lift you up
because it's a nurturing environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can talk about this a little bit more
when it's quieter.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many arguments to transform
over to a living soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can say to someone,
and you should really, really nail this
[SPEAKER_03]: one down with people, you would have to
replace your system every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I don't understand why that
really would not resonate with someone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't understand why it would
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've heard, and I think this is why
we should talk about the house,
[SPEAKER_00]: is actually what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are actual reasons why.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to get to what, like someone
starting a business, they're doing the
[SPEAKER_03]: thing that should matter to them,
yeah, it costs.
Dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we'll make it epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it'll be epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I get those hand caught sharks in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to make the grotto.
[SPEAKER_00]: See?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how you'll end up changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be like, no, no, here's some,
here's some.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get some Jade from the California
coast, and we'll put it in there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some abalone shells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother of pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freaking vicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so grateful to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Campbell with Green Lab Productions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Campbell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really happy to hear it right now,
because today we went to his facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which total grow footage?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the facility's total grow space
currently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know you're expanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently we're operating at about 12,000
square foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the potential to grow out to about
another 40,000 plus greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20,000 foot greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next phase is a shark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next phase is a greenhouse, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really great to have been to a
facility that sees how the life translates
[SPEAKER_00]: through its process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not only part of the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of the cloning process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of the up potting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of the composting post growth
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of your R&D process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking about structure facility,
which by the way, the efficiency is
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm specifically talking about soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That life process is a complete cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, there's no misuse of
the resource in nurturing your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is lost either found in the plant
growth, yield, the accountant,
[SPEAKER_00]: your wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where that cycle of waste or misuse
starts kicking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, oh, I feel it in this
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I got all these messes to clean
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see one mess in the entire place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it clean shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a clean shop, but it's not an
un-messy shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mess is the projects that are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are half finished that you step over
that ruin the flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a shit you gotta clean up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was no messes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even the messy room was really because
you had to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so messy in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like three feet of adjustment on something
on wheels is not a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most places, there's a mess somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what is taking all the energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we definitely weren't a tight ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Early on, one of the things that we didn't
really have a lot of experience in was a
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no other cultivation facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we tried to model after was either
a restaurant and or hospital.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to keep it sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's who was inspecting our
facility was restaurant people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to keep in mind that people who
were coming in that were going to ride us
[SPEAKER_01]: a ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's their pattern?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was their pass?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were coming from restaurant,
the majority of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we were so uptight with our
clean walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean floors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day we clean our floors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every cycle we break our rooms down and
clean our room from top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our trim room gets broken down once a
month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our dry rooms get broken down every cycle
or every harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the whole place is just, we're really,
at the end of the day, every single
[SPEAKER_01]: position is a glorified janitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's what we gotta do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean by janitor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know you're not just meaning
toilet cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I just mean we clean our messes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't step over them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our job is to clean them up and to make
sure the place is looking sharp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that at any one point in time,
someone, a state official, could walk
[SPEAKER_01]: through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A patient could walk through it and feel
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: A state official could walk through it and
not be writing up tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: This wasn't a surprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have no doubt if I showed up next
week, whatever, at whatever time during
[SPEAKER_00]: legal business hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many tours a week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it would look exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do tours often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to minimize it.
And you've been here for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did he just do all this yesterday and just
show off?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see, but that's why it's done in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't leave it till tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it stacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not you guys that I'm always in
preparation for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's honestly the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have their regulations, their rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do something wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get fined.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to keep them happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come and make a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether I have to do it or not,
I'm going to listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do it because it shows that I
listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that is, part of the effect of
listening that you did for them,
[SPEAKER_00]: the understanding, is that, and that
second way back and forth allowed you,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I got there, to go, hold on,
different rule set, new state,
[SPEAKER_00]: different facility license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are our rules and structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I'm expecting of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No negatives, no weird lala, hey man,
can we just, this is the rules,
[SPEAKER_00]: the role, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if, very clear cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so having that knowledge, walking into
it, we didn't have one issue the whole day
[SPEAKER_00]: versus going on a tour and somebody doing
this and somebody doing that, messing
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, what did you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was supposed to do that yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the messes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rare to actually have somebody so
clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how you can best experience what
I've worked so hard at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we're on our 20 second cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So times three, we've done it 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on our 66th time now around the LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: 66 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we were looking at the bed,
it's over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over here, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're salsa dancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even that though, that wasn't a
technique that we learned until several
[SPEAKER_01]: cycles in that we noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did that cycle shift?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you, in working with these creatures,
these beds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You were like, oh, there's a better way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a more efficient way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we used to remove the root ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we did was over time,
what we learned was we're harvesting our
[SPEAKER_01]: worms when we do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only worms, but all the other
biology behind them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The entire reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the whole reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants actually work so hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything we've been building pretty
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the plants been building, I guess you
could say.
[SPEAKER_01]: The entire reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were really not doing a service to the
soil by doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were taking the most valuable part out
of it every time so that the soil wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: advancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were actually seeing less and less
worm population in our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then all we did was we just moved over
six inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you're going to have a higher
concentrations of your cocoons and egg
[SPEAKER_00]: casings, which proportionally,
everything is exponentially going the
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just shifted it all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: We created this great pattern style where
we just go north hole, left hole,
[SPEAKER_01]: or north hole, south hole between cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it allows the root ball to break
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows that biology to transfer to
other parts of the soil because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: time needed to spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we're not harvesting the
biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just taking the soil needed to plant
the next clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your clones transition and are
up-hotted, it's the same ecosystem on a
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a little bit of isolation,
a little bit of decrease of the diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: because of that smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is the transition,
there's always stressors you can add to
[SPEAKER_00]: the transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the soil microbe, rhizosphere
level, is as seamless as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the moisture content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see you taking that ecosystem and
then having to really drench it in good
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're going to saturate the whole
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just moving it from one group to
another.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tourist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, it's less shock to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's in a smaller pot, but it's the
same soil, so it's relatively same pH,
[SPEAKER_01]: same microbe, same biology across the
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worms literally in the clone pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already established fully mature
ecosystems on that trophic level.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got to make sure that the
environmental changes are the same so that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not coming from a humid veg to a dry
flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the operator side of things,
you got to make sure to make the proper
[SPEAKER_01]: adjustments right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as a day or two of example,
the end of flower, I'm running my rooms on
[SPEAKER_01]: the dry side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I go to plant a room, I want to be
on the humid side.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I forget to switch my humidity set
point and I plant into a dry room,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just create a humidity set point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge stress factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where the management is so
important in understanding how that one...
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I hear people, is it worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't see how, what's it worth?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go, wait, that five seconds to
turn around and do it because you know you
[SPEAKER_00]: should, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it worth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you just paid some guy $30,000 to
fix up the plumbing issue and this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you lost your entire crop because it
fled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, that's where the worth is so
that you're not actually paying the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the farmer keeps,
transitions from thriving because the real
[SPEAKER_00]: worth isn't thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: The survival mindset that we were talking
about versus this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Surviving versus thriving, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we lifted some of those rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We forgot to lift more of them though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but the nice part is we still did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the point was, is that when you lift
the rock,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how you, it's a window,
it's a portal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do it if you have plexiglass
and you just put plexiglass down and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you cover it with cardboard and then put
something over top of it so it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: move.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just turn that like the underside
of the rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'll see the worm channels and
the insect paths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really great for outdoor growers
to do that as like, what's going on under
[SPEAKER_00]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to put in a window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you remove that rock,
we did get the video of us lifting or just
[SPEAKER_00]: leaning over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally the bridge, what was the
bridge?
[SPEAKER_00]: The body of a worm coming through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the rock mulch has been a great idea,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just creates that, the more consistent
moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in between waters, if the soil does
tend to dry too much or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: the worms always have that home base to
run to, that moisture zone to run to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also creates these almost like little
windows where you're not getting that same
[SPEAKER_00]: green growth from your cover crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost like little snorkels because those
roof mats can get real thick.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the flowering room, the consistency
of coloring and everything was really
[SPEAKER_03]: something to behold.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it was really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pretty much, I mean, we rarely see
unhealthy plants in our facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just recently with these new lights
pushing the beds as hard as we can,
[SPEAKER_01]: now we've actually seen it to where we've
actually reached our limitations finally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before, lights were the biggest limiting
factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we couldn't even push our system hard
enough to ever see the limitations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're seeing, where's the
limitation?
[SPEAKER_01]: With the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was never able to reach that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and so how are you seeing the
limitation?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I can just see where... Or where
potentially your deficiency is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, well now I can start to see what the
deficiencies is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that it is a problem, but you can see
that because of this extra demand,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to see... I can start to see
the trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we're going from tending to mining,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is really fascinating because I
look at this and I go, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we talk all the time about the living
soil, how like paramount that is,
[SPEAKER_03]: but here's a technology that's made like a
huge positive difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the marriage of the two that,
you know, that is not negligible,
[SPEAKER_03]: the difference that these lights have
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound like it... I don't need
to know the price, but would you say it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a double what a high-end price light
already is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're talking about it's a more
cost, but that's fine because the benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: are...
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about folks right now,
the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, okay, if you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, now that we are, they're post
lights, LED, A3I is their mothership
[SPEAKER_01]: light, but they make several models of
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all extremely spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked with all of them, pretty much all
of them at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's a really good LED company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make really high-end LED fixtures
that are just super well built.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I like them is because in the
last five years, the trend that I've seen
[SPEAKER_01]: in the LED industry is that the biggest
hang-up for purchasers was the price
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what LED companies did was they solely
went to... Lower the price point.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tried to, yeah, tend to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So versus focusing on building the best
light, they just tried to build the
[SPEAKER_01]: cheapest light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they all tried to build a cheaper price
point light and they all ended up building
[SPEAKER_01]: cheaper lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So folks did not do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the first LED company we were
trying all these new lights out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That brought a light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, whoa, this isn't a tin foil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you look at it, you're like,
this thing is fully adjustable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking at it and you literally,
it's Allen wrench.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that whole thing just comes off and
snaps back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, this is a functional tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a multi-tool, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, I need it to be over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet it's not just a plastic snap
that's gonna eventually snap, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be well built.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the things that really
sold me on the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just the way they future built them,
they're extremely versatile from spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: to the ramp up, ramp down mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You totally played with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long until you found, you're like,
Hey, look, this is like sunrise and
[SPEAKER_00]: sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed the plants were stressed out
though, by doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the transition into those rooms and
when it's hard to increase the PPFD on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, I'm not just hitting them all at
once.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just seeing happier plants in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think this is almost shifting
the role of a bud tender, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like when you're walking that and
the person's watering and they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: going, you know, they're not a janitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the actual bud tenders,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual bud tenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole facility was hand watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we had water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't look like you guys were
running anything but water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only other thing, the only thing we
run primarily would just be our compost,
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts, teas, do the occasional protozoa
infusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I, can I talk about that for a second?
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for that is this is an
ecosystem that is populated, but that
[SPEAKER_00]: population has to come to something called
a quorum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a quorum is what takes place in like
the bioluminescent fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever seen that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside the fish that the fish can figure
out how to turn on with an enzyme and all
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time, trillions of these
independent organisms go, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And light, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really trippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing of like you eat some
food and then you're like instantaneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get like a film over your teeth,
the biofilm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a quorum, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like your compost teas brewing and then
all of a sudden, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the foam and the thick and the
crust, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one population hit its quorum and
then went apeshit and shifted the ecology,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why teas are so volatile in
comparison to an extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just adding more teammates into
that ecosystem because everything's eating
[SPEAKER_00]: each other and trying to create the most
nurtured balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a really cool thing to add
those extracts without having to add
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients to it because you're adding,
they're called amino sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why your N requirements change
because when your plant is pulling the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition out of the actual microbiology,
it's like eating a steak.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on that scale, the creature meat is
called an amino sugar, an amino sugar,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is all because of the carbon,
the photosynthesis sugars going into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the meat and your plant wants
to be a carnivore and eat these biology
[SPEAKER_00]: sugars instead of N.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even the N that's processed through
the air is through the biology of that
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria we were talking about on the
clovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're just adding more livestock
into the, into the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for us, like, but as far as the teas
and the extracts go, it's a process that
[SPEAKER_01]: we at times really don't even need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you look at it under the
microscope, all my players are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to some degree I have to use compost
because it's part of our waste management
[SPEAKER_01]: program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like at some points I'm just top
dressing just because I don't want to have
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 yards of compost building up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this state have a requirement that it
has to stay on site after it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: thermophilically processed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you sell it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've sold compost when I came to compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've given it away in small bits to
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these are all variables,
but if the law says it has to stay on
[SPEAKER_00]: site, which in some places it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to make a business model out
of it because maybe there is one day,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for the most part, I know damn well if
I make a cannabis compost and the state
[SPEAKER_01]: finds out that I'm making compost out of
cannabis, cannabis, and I'm making money
[SPEAKER_01]: off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want 40% of your compost money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I don't want to try to sell
anything right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is literally the absolute weight
waste stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want 40% of your waste stream too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't want to get 30% tax on
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want 40% of your poo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now we just put it all back in
the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that actually is part of, we were
talking earlier about it can get too rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where the biology gets almost
clayey, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it'll really thicken up because it's
missing that other scale because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: still in a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where the gopher would come
and take raw minerals from the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, dump it on the surface,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once up here, it takes organic
material, drives it down into the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it had a role and a purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do we.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they call it hugelkultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we do on our scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take the trees and put it into the
ground, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Biochar, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just working at different scales.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's definitely certain aspects
of the living soil system that we can't
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporate indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the macro features like ground
squirrels and rabbits.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, rodents aren't welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a rodent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and this is any business,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your model of the restaurant or the
hospital, they still got to deal with that
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, true that, true that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say, you got to know who you
call and what they use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're trying to get rid of
something, and they're leaving stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: around your place making messes,
and it has any form of decon, rat killer
[SPEAKER_00]: bait, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most often what happens is you
tell someone who has time, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: usually someone who doesn't have anything
better to do, to go deal with a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: At which point they go to the store and
say, hey, I need some help.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kills rats?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then someone who has less training
than any of them sells them something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get a contamination
violation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a whole process of going,
no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole facility runs on this
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to really try to take an organic
approach through and through as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you get a rodent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a bird, a pigeon.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certain times you got to eradicate
certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: BB gun is organic.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an acute amount of lead put into the
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if fully composted, it's just fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the dogs?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were actually our original security
crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but when we first opened up,
we actually lived across the street in the
[SPEAKER_01]: apartments for a little over a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would take the dogs to work,
and they'd run the property.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they ran the property for, I want to
say, really close to a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is that that's when we first
opened up, and everybody saw us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pictures were taken of them at the
front gate and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: With barbed wire?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a horrible image.
[SPEAKER_01]: With Rottweilers.
[SPEAKER_01]: With Rottweilers behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a big dude, kind of scared,
beat people up for a living, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: With my German Rottweilers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those dogs haven't been there in four
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people still think that they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a big teddy bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never get that side out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a primal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Till this day, people think they run that
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you want to go there with
invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's part of community,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You work with each other, and you welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have good boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a lot of dogs, which are good
boundaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're more of a liability as a security
guard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually think you giving a job to human
beings is good, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a very nice guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met two of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Team human.
[SPEAKER_00]: Team people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Team human.
[SPEAKER_00]: See?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: The security factor is always a big deal
at these facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also a deterrent to have a pile of
composting material outside the front
[SPEAKER_00]: door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really thought it was a lot of robbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's strange smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Barbed wire.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at a farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a goddamn cow sound over here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a beautiful community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess there's two ways to look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're surrounded by a lot of
traffic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're also surrounded by a lot of
cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're in some rural, out in the
boonies, out in the middle of nowhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be a lot longer for cops to
get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The radio goes a lot faster than our car.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being in a center town like that is
kind of a safer position to be in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a smaller town, so they'll react
faster, probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the weird things is they let us
do razor wire fencing out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do that in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an actual deterrent versus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've never had a random person walking on
our property in all the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have the whistling over there,
too?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but we have much better security
cameras that move and track and trace.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the surrounding businesses
appreciate?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a security that also has a
presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there was a shop next to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tattoo shop next to that is a shop
called Threads.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were robbed one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the dudes ran across our security
cameras.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cops came in and took our
surveillance camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were actually able to help with
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They use dispensary cameras a lot for
traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another service.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's happened for us once,
if not twice already, that they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: able to use our cameras to help.
Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got five minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys want to wrap it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to say thank you for the time
and sharing what all you guys are doing is
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to say that no matter what,
if Seal's intact, right, would happily
[SPEAKER_00]: share and partake in your flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total trusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'd give it to grandma type of
thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, trust.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone has a grandma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's got a grandma.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd give it to everyone's grandma.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm just waiting for this new
building, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's coming up next that you look
into?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for us right now, we've got two
things in motion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing some R&D, some small scale
hash, rosin, bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just playing with some different
techniques there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Non-voluntal production.
[SPEAKER_01]: All solventless.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be playing with some things
there, coming out with some different
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just going to lead up into our
greenhouse project, our sungrown line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be having a completely different
strain, a completely different line of
[SPEAKER_01]: GOP, still living with soil, still done
with our standards, just using the sun in
[SPEAKER_01]: a state of the art greenhouse versus
indoor building.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll be coming up hopefully next
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We postponed it this year because of
COVID, but we're hitting it hard again and
[SPEAKER_01]: hope to have it next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look forward to it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're well on the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's looking great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for your time,
and back to you, Peter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Ryan.
Thanks for having me.
