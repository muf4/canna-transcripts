[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite recent stories is,
I don't know if you guys know Cody Bass up
[SPEAKER_00]: in South Lake Tahoe who runs a dispensary
and recently got elected to his city
[SPEAKER_00]: council.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the kind of change when stuff
gets interesting is rather than just say,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I don't know, the politicians aren't
on our side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can be the politicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when the interesting change starts
to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can show up at the city council
meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can show up at the town halls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take the seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: on those advisory councils and that is how
we affect change is not by sitting around
[SPEAKER_00]: and complaining and watching what's
happening and having it be something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's happening to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a living evolutionary process that
we are part of and we can change it.
