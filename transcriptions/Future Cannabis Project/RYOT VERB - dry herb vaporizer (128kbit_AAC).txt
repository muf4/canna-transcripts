[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we're on like day 10 of
lockdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't taken a shower today or
yesterday or brushed my teeth yet today
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's about one in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to keep me happy and not going stir
crazy, some companies have been sending me
[SPEAKER_00]: some products to review.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have actually, so this is the very
first pipe I ever smoked out of when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: about, I don't know, nine or 10 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: The protopipe Richard Jurgensen sent us
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you, Richard, very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to play with this,
which I haven't smoked out of in a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also back in those days,
the baddie, the one hitter was big and
[SPEAKER_00]: riot sent me not one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's the wood one, but two baddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the more advanced one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, what I wanted to focus on
today was the dry herb vaporizer from
[SPEAKER_00]: riot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's turn this thing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the verb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's the fours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh D gave me some OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will, what's this going to light up
to?
[SPEAKER_00]: 190, 202.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get you ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's load you in there a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this thing is still heating up.
Four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put the top on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four.
[SPEAKER_00]: 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably hotter than I'd want to go,
but let's start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes with this poker.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the poker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ergonomic, lightweight, small,
not too small, not too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just bring it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go down to, how about like three?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go like 380.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different terpenes boil off a
different, or in cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: at different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little nicer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you could do is probably start
down at like 320 and work your way up with
[SPEAKER_00]: each hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're hitting different terpenes along
the way in cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is literally the first time I ever
hit this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, we'll come back and we'll go
through the dugouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Batty dugout, protopipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a canagar roller from Purple
Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will make a canagar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need some fresh leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was very cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing is telling me it is turning
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, we'll make some canagars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have some fun boys and girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, we'll be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
