[SPEAKER_01]: As you've had, you know, some of the
bigger companies start to think about
[SPEAKER_01]: where they want to be in a couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a long time it was how quickly can we
have licenses in 8, 10, 12, 15 markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the companies weren't
necessarily, you know, really thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about exactly where they wanted to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't the other way you think about
traditional retail location, location.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was much more can we get a license in
the state?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we represent to the investors that we
have licenses in, you know, four or five
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated states and four or five of the
states that are a little bit easier to
[SPEAKER_01]: secure license in?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's starting to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we definitely were watching guys
that just said, I want to plant as many
[SPEAKER_01]: flags on the ground as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're watching the same CEO say,
OK, we're already in X amount of states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we really want to identify,
you know, what are the best places to be
[SPEAKER_01]: within that state?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we want to, you know, be in some small
town with a small population just to say
[SPEAKER_01]: we're there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we really want to go after a marquee
location and say, you know, we're in
[SPEAKER_01]: downtown Los Angeles or we're in New York
City or we're in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the multi-state operators now
are really focused on finding the right
[SPEAKER_01]: asset because they realize it like a
non-producing asset.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives them some sort of exposure to say
we're in that state, but it doesn't really
[SPEAKER_01]: do all that much to their bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we're evolving away now from blue
sky and really going back towards
[SPEAKER_01]: fundamentals, it's just much more
important for these guys to have something
[SPEAKER_01]: that they can tell the investor class
like, yeah, we actually think that the
[SPEAKER_01]: trajectory here is going to be able to
allow us to grow into what our market cap
[SPEAKER_01]: is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are most operators getting back to
fundamentals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it seems like a lot are still
paying premiums and trying to get marquee
[SPEAKER_00]: assets at, I think, a Fifth Avenue
locations.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are definitely overpaying for
assets still.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're going to continue to
overpay for assets as long as they have
[SPEAKER_01]: investors that are willing to overpay for
their paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I look at the competition
for Deal Flow right now and there's only
[SPEAKER_01]: so many really marquee names out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you actually have a business
that's for sale, that's actually a really
[SPEAKER_01]: good business that you'd like to own,
there might be four or five suitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's especially true or was
especially true as these guys are going
[SPEAKER_01]: into the RTO process, which is the reverse
takeover process in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're trying to say, OK,
before we actually go out there and go on
[SPEAKER_01]: our road show and we try to raise $100
million, we want to make sure we've got as
[SPEAKER_01]: much to show the investor base as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it means that we raise around before
the RTO that we use specifically to deploy
[SPEAKER_01]: into buying a couple of assets,
those are the ones that are really hotly
[SPEAKER_01]: contested from a Deal Flow perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now these guys have, you know,
a different currency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked a little bit this last time
we spoke where it's a combination of using
[SPEAKER_01]: their paper and using cash as well to
secure a transaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, now they're being a bit more
careful about how they're structuring
[SPEAKER_01]: their deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, they're still overpaying for the
asset from the standpoint of what multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd attach to a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they also look at from the perspective
of, you know, if it's an oligopoly style
[SPEAKER_01]: state, meaning that there's only a certain
amount of licenses given out and those
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses have already been given out,
which means there's no more left to give,
[SPEAKER_01]: then they'd rather go into those states
and say, OK, if we can secure it now and
[SPEAKER_01]: hope that states can expand away from just
being a medicinal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's let's use Illinois as an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a good example that under
Rauner, the governor Rauner, the market
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't expand all that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then all of a sudden you had the
opioid bill that allowed the patient
[SPEAKER_01]: population to double.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now under J.B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pritzker coming into office, very likely
you're going to see adult use recreation
[SPEAKER_01]: happen in the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had the opportunity to buy a
license, let's call it in the last year
[SPEAKER_01]: with a small patient population,
you might have overpaid for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you didn't overpay for it for what the
market's going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You overpaid for it for what the market
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in those states like the New York's,
the Florida's, the Illinois's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's questionable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll know in four years whether or not
they overpaid for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They certainly overpaid for it by what the
revenue was of those companies today.
