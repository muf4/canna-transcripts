[SPEAKER_00]: The DNA stands for Dawn and Aaron.
[SPEAKER_00]: My business partner, Dawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's me, I'm Aaron.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really nice throw for it,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're two guys from California
that started this business 16 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been here at Spannabis for 15
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the 16 years we've been in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love coming to Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a big part of our business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the bigger shows in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're saying that if you make a
comparison between the countries and the
[SPEAKER_01]: different expos that you visit here,
how's the warmth?
[SPEAKER_01]: The people, it's really open to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we look forward to this expo the
most.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we could stop every other expo,
we would just do Spannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a really nice market, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what makes you different from all
these brands around?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because now you have a lot of competition
considering 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few seed companies that have
been really doing their breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of seed companies that
don't do any work and just buy seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: another seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you have any breeder that you can
say, I respect them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you, I respect Shanti Baba.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a friend of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arian from Greenhouse is a friend of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Franco is a friend of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We respect all the real seed companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could say there's too many to name that
I respect and I approve of their work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we're here standing here is
because me and my business partner love
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a part of our lives for many
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the past 16 years, we've just seen
everything grow, grow, grow, grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, business grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole plan has grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company has grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're living in a dream right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a rocket ride to who all else is
going up to space with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be some people who just
make seeds and then there's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: people that use their brand to elevate
their company a lot higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the customer or the public
requesting more about characteristics in
[SPEAKER_01]: your thought, of course?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the world is enjoying the fruitier
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still love the cushions from
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I say the fruitier varieties,
really tasty things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is what we've we've been
breeding for for the past 16 years is
[SPEAKER_00]: based on flavor, flavor, taste and aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Opening new horizons, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like experiences like it's other kind of
taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, in Ecuador, like I'm from
Ecuador.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why a strain like Tangy comes to
Ecuador and grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good in Ecuador, you'd be like,
wow, everybody in Ecuador would be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: holy shit, this really smells like a
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the high is very nice, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very up high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we for Don and I, it's about smell
and taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's everything is going to get you
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things will get you stone,
but it's all about the way it tastes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my in my honest opinion, taste is the
most important thing in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually share that because I always
choose by smell and imagine which one is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be taster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I personally prefer sweeter one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I prefer a sweet flavor like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so the smell, the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Play a role in how you feel when you smoke
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC has no real feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different terpenes make your high go up,
make your high go down, make you more
[SPEAKER_00]: active, make you more sleepy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different terpenes, different terpenes
profiles dictate how the high is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really about the smell and the
taste, the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we already know if we want a really
nice fruit, we should come to DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep making the change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enjoy the rest of 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next year.
Bye bye.
Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye bye.
Bye bye.
