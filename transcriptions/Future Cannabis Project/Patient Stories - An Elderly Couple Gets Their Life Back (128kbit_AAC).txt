[SPEAKER_01]: Montana was a unique opportunity because
their issuances of medical cards were so
[SPEAKER_01]: restrictive that the people who got cards
were truly sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no PTSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Montana was unique in its program in that
they were so highly restrictive that the
[SPEAKER_01]: patients who came to our door were all
truly, truly, truly, truly sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people coming to us with baskets
of drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am on these 24 pills every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I get off of them?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we helped so many people do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my favorite stories of all time
in our shop was we had this old couple who
[SPEAKER_01]: she came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, I, you know, have cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on these 26 drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a zombie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not living my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't lived my life for a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And her husband, old school farmer,
cowboy hat, his boots, came in with her
[SPEAKER_01]: every time she walked in that door,
sat down next to her, held her hand,
[SPEAKER_01]: never said a word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never said a word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just she did her thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got her off those pills.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, she was down to three.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day, I'm sitting in the office.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I notice this old man just kind of
wandering around, staying out of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I can tell he's waiting for
an opportunity to talk to somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, hey, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I help you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Comes over and sits down.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I want to tell you something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like when my wife and I came in here
at first, a year and a half ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you guys were bullies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hadn't had a conversation worth a
shit with my wife for over a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's been a zombie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I lost my wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like last night, we're sitting out on
the patio on the rocking chair,
[SPEAKER_01]: watching the sunset.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's talking to me like she used to
talk to me 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's smoking her pipe and totally
animated and engaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she walked back in the house and I sat
there in tears.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had my wife back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I came here today to tell you that
you're not bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I'm sitting there going,
wow, I didn't just help her.
[SPEAKER_01]: I helped the family.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the family is better off because
of what we did for her.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your agriculture practices,
what we're championing is the tip of the
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative ag spear that will influence
the whole industry in the next 10 to 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it'll be, it's something that needs
to happen because the draining of our
[SPEAKER_01]: water, the salting of our fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I suck because I'm a farmer
and I understand salts and it's easy and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's quick and it's an instant fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: From both sides, you know, that yes,
using them long-term contaminates our
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, but I'm down to a quarter of what a
normal farmer would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I mean, I'm still,
I'm using alfalfa pellets and it's another
[SPEAKER_01]: thing I'm using in my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'm creating a rich soil of
nutrient based solution.
