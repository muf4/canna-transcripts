[SPEAKER_00]: I had a coach, and he was in his 40s,
and he would be sparring and training with
[SPEAKER_00]: us for hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing that in your 40s?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, I smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I'm able to keep up with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not using as much energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell you what, he was one of the
best guys in the gym training and
[SPEAKER_00]: sparring, even in his 40s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he moved amazingly well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he could train for hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a few UFC fighters,
and I will definitely not say their names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are very vocal about their
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the guys do triathlons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were explaining to me,
they were saying, you know, when I get
[SPEAKER_00]: tired, I'll be in the middle, and I'll
start my run.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I take my pen out, and I just
hit the pen, and I'm gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just get focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was blowing my mind, because I
never used and trained.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did after I stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fighting, and I found huge benefits to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understood what they were saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I almost, in a weird way,
I almost feel like it's cheating in some
[SPEAKER_00]: ways, because I'm so not in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just in the moment, and I'm training,
and I'm creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost not fair when I'm training
with someone, because I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another reason why I wish I was
using a little bit more when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: fighting, because I never used and
trained.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that regard, I definitely found
benefits after I was done fighting when I
[SPEAKER_00]: retired.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of guys use, and are very
active, and are performing even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a performance enhancer in a lot
of ways.
