[SPEAKER_00]: And I see a situation that's unique in
business that you've never had any
[SPEAKER_00]: business ever driven without banks
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all you see is a trillion dollars of
tech capital that's sitting because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so much cash and tech that they
don't have to do with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody wants to play the weed game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I meet everybody and their brother
that's got, I got 300 million of my own

[SPEAKER_00]: I said, what the fuck did you make 300

[SPEAKER_00]: redwoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Redwoods, when they fall over,

[SPEAKER_00]: They're a hundred thousand years old
because a stump fell and fell and fell and
[SPEAKER_00]: fell and fell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on a genetic level, you're looking at
organisms that are a hundred thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't reproduce this kind of stuff.
