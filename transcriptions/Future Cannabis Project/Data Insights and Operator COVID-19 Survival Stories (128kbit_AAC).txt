[SPEAKER_02]: So Jocelyn, why don't you kick us off?
[SPEAKER_05]: Kick us off?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up virtual world?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Jocelyn.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am the director of strategy at Headset
and Headset is a cannabis data and
[SPEAKER_05]: analytics company.
[SPEAKER_05]: The past year for us in the cannabis
industry, we've had a lot of different
[SPEAKER_05]: crisis that have come up.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had the vape crisis happen in summer
through November, and now we're in COVID.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so for us, we analyze all the point of
sale data and adult use dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then we report on those trends.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have been incredibly busy over these
past few weeks in particular, trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: provide the industry a real time read of
what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so today I'm going to go over some of
the trends that we're seeing, and then I
[SPEAKER_05]: think we can just ask some questions to
you all based off those trends,
[SPEAKER_05]: because you really are on the front line.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think you can provide a lot of
perspective here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe a good way to start, I'm going to
share my screen and just go through some
[SPEAKER_05]: actual very exciting charts, but so you
can see what is really happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: I run our California strategy and
operations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what that means for me is that I work
across the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I spend my days primarily working with
retailers, brands, distributors,
[SPEAKER_05]: manufacturers, investors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as of recently, well, really the past
year, a lot of associations and our local
[SPEAKER_05]: and state policymakers, the data that I'm
going to be going through right now is all
[SPEAKER_05]: collected via our participating retailers
point of sale systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we do is we aggregate all of this
data.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got almost a thousand retailers
across all of the markets that Headset is
[SPEAKER_05]: reporting on, which in this case,
I'm just going to talk about what we're
[SPEAKER_05]: seeing here in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: Though we do, I'm peppering in some data
from other states.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's a lot we can learn from
Washington, Colorado, Nevada.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to give some insights into
what's happening there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we do is we aggregate all of this
skew level data and then we normalize it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we get rid of any privacy related
information.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use various methodologies to be able to
extrapolate the data out so that it's
[SPEAKER_05]: reflective of the entire state of
California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we compare all this data to our
tax numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We compare it to the state and then we
make sure it's got a good go ahead and
[SPEAKER_05]: then we're able to report on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to set kind of a baseline here of
what we saw in California or across all
[SPEAKER_05]: these markets in adult use sales in the
last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see here, California is a really
big market.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the biggest market in the world in
terms of cannabis sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, it is making up almost more
sales than all of these markets combined.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this just gives us the gravity of how
big the California market is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as I had mentioned that there is a lot
going on in cannabis in general.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we've seen in our first couple
years in the cannabis industry is that
[SPEAKER_05]: life is actually pretty predictable for
cannabis sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis is much like other consumer
packaged goods industries.
[SPEAKER_05]: So other retail stores, other beverage
stores, they all have very predictable
[SPEAKER_05]: trends, which makes it a lot easier for a
product producer or retailer to be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: predict demand accordingly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So generally what we've seen in cannabis
is that there's spikes during some
[SPEAKER_05]: particular months.
[SPEAKER_05]: We see spikes during the holiday season.
[SPEAKER_05]: So November, December, we see them again
during summer months.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, 4-20, 7-10, dab day now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we see here is we're looking at
in 2020, we can see that on the weekends,
[SPEAKER_05]: Fridays in particular are the biggest day
for cannabis sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we see these very, very predictable
trends.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then COVID happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what we see here is that things
start to go all over the place.
[SPEAKER_05]: There really aren't any predictable trends
at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: This actually, I really can't stress this
enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our data team can't stress this
enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is unlike anything we've ever seen in
terms of consumer purchasing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything that we knew is really being
flipped on its head at this point.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we see here in mid-March,
when we see all of these spikes start to
[SPEAKER_05]: go all over the place, this really is
looking at these four different states.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're seeing that as soon as a
shelter-in-place order was announced,
[SPEAKER_05]: we saw people basically go out,
rush, make all their purchases.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a few days later, we started to
see sales even out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually now we see in some states
that they're starting to decline a bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know yet, are people consuming
more or are they just stocking up out of
[SPEAKER_05]: fear?
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't want to make less trips.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm hoping all of you all can
provide some insight into today.
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's look a little bit closer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So at the month of March and mid-March in
particular, because this is really when
[SPEAKER_01]: everything started to be, trends really
started to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in the black, this spec sales line.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is what we would have expected
this time of year if COVID hadn't
[SPEAKER_05]: happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what we can see is that anything
above this line means that sales are more
[SPEAKER_05]: than we expected.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything below means that sales are under
standard warming.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to call out the green line,
which is Nevada.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we think about Nevada,
Nevada has had the hardest hit in terms of
[SPEAKER_05]: the state with their sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clark County, which is where Las Vegas is
based, makes up 80% of all cannabis sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can see that they've been hit the
hardest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tourism is extremely important to the
state of Nevada.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can see that their sales have
declined.
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw mid-March as shelter-in-place
orders went to effect in California,
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado, and Washington.
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw those sales all spike and exceed
what we normally would have expected this
[SPEAKER_05]: time of year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we see they start to go back to
normal levels just a few days later.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think I would like to just pause and
take a moment here and get everyone else's
[SPEAKER_05]: thoughts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, did you guys see some types of
similar trends in the spikes?
[SPEAKER_05]: And are things now evening out for you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or are there any outliers in your
businesses where it's just still
[SPEAKER_05]: continuing to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a quick comment about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anecdotally, about when California,
especially Los Angeles, was put in to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: at home, my retailers, the ones that I was
going visiting, told me that there were
[SPEAKER_00]: lines around the block.
[SPEAKER_00]: People weren't sure what was going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the sales were extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the shops weren't closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city or state wasn't sure if they were
going to keep them open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so after that, it wasn't a panic mode
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then about a week and a half ago,
again, this is all anecdotally,
[SPEAKER_00]: sales started to drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm referring to Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the shops I have been visiting are
mostly kind of in the San Fernando Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: But several have also had to lay people
off because of the drop in sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they've rebounded a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question is, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is there this difference in
business sort of up and down?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wondering whether it actually has
to do with cash in hand.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can speak to the Bay Area trend,
if you want me to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, Sabrina, could you also
provide?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think I've seen you at some of
the Berkley City Council meetings or
[SPEAKER_05]: perhaps some of the City Council meetings.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen you somewhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was also one of the interesting
things to me is just Berkley did that
[SPEAKER_05]: reversal for that, what, eight hour
period.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think it's such a beautiful
testament also to our industry and all the
[SPEAKER_05]: activists that are out there and really
voiced themselves and came forward and
[SPEAKER_05]: helped get this reverse.
[SPEAKER_05]: So could you also, as you're talking about
what you saw, could you also talk about
[SPEAKER_05]: that process and how the community was
able to come together and get this
[SPEAKER_05]: reversal to happen?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know Santa Clara is still facing
the same thing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of these other municipalities are
potentially looking at it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was really touch and go.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Alameda County and San Francisco were
the first two jurisdictions to put a
[SPEAKER_10]: shelter in place order in the entire
country.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that happened on March 13th.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, March 16th.
[SPEAKER_10]: March 13th, my birthday.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it happened on March 16th.
[SPEAKER_10]: And nobody had ever experienced this
before.
[SPEAKER_10]: In any capacity.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we were kind of, first thing was
reading the shelter in place order.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, what's an essential business?
[SPEAKER_10]: What isn't?
[SPEAKER_10]: Is cannabis considered an essential
business?
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a provision about medical
providers and service providers and
[SPEAKER_10]: different categories and subcategories of
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it says that this is to be interpreted
extremely broadly.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think the first city to go,
everybody determined that, okay,
[SPEAKER_10]: well, it's definitely medicinal,
medicinal.
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time, so many patients
haven't renewed their recommendations.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're still shopping medicinally.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just not technically in the
medicinal, qualified cannabis patient.
[SPEAKER_10]: So more referring to someone buying Nyquil
over the counter as opposed to a
[SPEAKER_10]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think San Francisco was the first city
to say that they were not, cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: dispensary did have to shut down.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were not considered an essential
business.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was when, and it was like they
had to shut down the next day.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that created this surge of people
coming out and wanting to stock up because
[SPEAKER_10]: people assumed that that was going to be
an order and everyone needed to get their
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: San Francisco Bay area has a long,
long storied history of activism and
[SPEAKER_10]: pushing reform for decades.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so this was, everybody saw as a huge
injustice and a sort of cruel and
[SPEAKER_10]: irrational move for the city and the
county of San Francisco to pursue.
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, they, so there was a big outcry
by patients and by industry members that
[SPEAKER_10]: finally got it back to the city.
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess the health director and all of
these sort of determinations are coming
[SPEAKER_10]: from the health department.
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically these emergency orders and
shelter in place orders, at least in
[SPEAKER_10]: Berkeley, I don't know specifically for
San Francisco, but I'm pretty sure they're
[SPEAKER_10]: similar.
[SPEAKER_10]: The city manager and the health department
are basically in control right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: And they get to determine all of these
things.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a sort of de facto government of
these municipalities.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so finally they got the, that order
reversed in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that was eight hours or a day,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was really quick.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was great.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so nobody else, so Alameda County did
not determine, nobody clarified if
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis was essential or not,
and if it needed to be closed or not.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so there were a lot of passive yeses
from representatives in the county and on
[SPEAKER_10]: the city level, but there was nothing in
writing anywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was very concerning, but if ever
there was a time people needed cannabis,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's now.
[SPEAKER_10]: It would just be so wrong to take away
this form of relief and this healthier
[SPEAKER_10]: alternative in such a anxiety scary time
that we felt that it was necessary to make
[SPEAKER_10]: sure that we were being compliant and that
everything was going to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I guess the state came down with
theirs and the state determined that
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis wasn't essential business.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was the first time it was
actually stated in writing that cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: was essential.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the city of Berkeley on the 25th sent
the four, five retailers that are open to
[SPEAKER_10]: only go to delivery only.
[SPEAKER_10]: And none of the retailers in Berkeley were
set up for delivery.
[SPEAKER_10]: We all are just storefront.
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically it was, they were gonna shut
down the cannabis accessibility in city of
[SPEAKER_10]: Berkeley, which was crazy and totally
unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a, we've had a history with the
health department in the city.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been a lot of back and forth and
it had only been a month since we'd come
[SPEAKER_10]: out of another fight of trying to pass
consumption lounges and make sure that
[SPEAKER_10]: they didn't ban flavored vape products and
that whole thing that seems like a year
[SPEAKER_10]: ago now.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that had only been a month before this
came out and this happened and they told
[SPEAKER_10]: us all to essentially shut down.
[SPEAKER_10]: So BPG was able to sort of gear up to get
like one or two cars going, but it was
[SPEAKER_10]: completely unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_10]: And all of the dispensaries, we kind of
ban it together.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of Bay Area and old cannabis
activists, we all got on calls and sort
[SPEAKER_10]: of, very well trained to activate and
react very quickly to any sort of policy
[SPEAKER_10]: impact that affect us and the industry and
our patients and our customers.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we just sort of, reorganized and
reactivated what we had done a month ago
[SPEAKER_10]: and had everybody calling the city manager
and call city council members and really
[SPEAKER_10]: demand an answer as to why cannabis,
which was declared as essential.
[SPEAKER_10]: And at that point, Alameda County,
San Francisco and the state of California,
[SPEAKER_10]: had all expressly stated that cannabis was
an essential business for medicinal and
[SPEAKER_10]: adult use.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so why we were subjected to these
stricter regulations as an essential
[SPEAKER_10]: business that following the exact same
mitigation and social distancing protocols
[SPEAKER_10]: as every other essential business.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do we have to have this excessive,
more extreme restrictions on who and how
[SPEAKER_10]: we can serve our community?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is such an important point of
like, and actually I think it would be
[SPEAKER_05]: really important for you to talk about
your role and Berkeley Patients Group for
[SPEAKER_05]: people who aren't aware because BPG is one
of the oldest, if I understand it,
[SPEAKER_05]: or the first in Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I go to a lot of these city council
meetings, you tend to see the same
[SPEAKER_05]: activists that show up and each community
or each municipality has its own culture
[SPEAKER_05]: that they're working within.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so one of the things I find really
interesting is one, that your role exists
[SPEAKER_05]: within BPG because there's so many
retailers that don't necessarily have a
[SPEAKER_05]: policy or an affairs person that's really
out and working with city council.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think it would be to the benefit
of the whole industry if more people were
[SPEAKER_05]: involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this is one of the reasons
that we often see policy not being lenient
[SPEAKER_05]: towards cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So could you also explain like your role
and why that's so important to a retailer
[SPEAKER_05]: in making sure that you have this warmness
from the city?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so I'm the chief public affairs
officer for Berkeley Patients Group and
[SPEAKER_10]: BPG is the oldest continuously operating
dispensary in the country.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was formed out of a group of cannabis
activists in the 90s, well cannabis HIV
[SPEAKER_10]: AIDS activists who were fighting to get
relief for HIV AIDS patients and wanted to
[SPEAKER_10]: make sure there was safe access to
cannabis because there wasn't any research
[SPEAKER_10]: or any other medications or relief for
those patients.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so BPG was born out of the spirit of
activism and community engagement and
[SPEAKER_10]: community organizing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that's always been the ethos of the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have worked with the city of
Berkeley over 20 years to help develop
[SPEAKER_10]: regulations and protocol and become
expressly allowed to operate.
[SPEAKER_10]: And having these relationships with the
city and the community are invaluable.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, for any business, but especially
for a highly regulated controversial
[SPEAKER_10]: business like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: And even more especially for a new
industry that is evolving and developing
[SPEAKER_10]: every day.
[SPEAKER_10]: And with all these new challenges that
everyone else is facing on top of all our
[SPEAKER_10]: unique cannabis challenges.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's so important, you have to stay on
top of regulatory changes, such as things
[SPEAKER_10]: like this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I'm constantly engaged with the
city, with the health department,
[SPEAKER_10]: with council members, I do have
relationships with them and I can
[SPEAKER_10]: communicate with them.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we don't always agree on everything,
but I think we all have the same intent,
[SPEAKER_10]: which is what's best for the community and
what's best for the city.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have different ideas sometimes as
to what that is, but we all want what's
[SPEAKER_10]: best.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a really good example that I can use
as to why it is so critical to have these
[SPEAKER_10]: relationships with your community and with
your local government.
[SPEAKER_10]: BPG had a couple of federal cases,
well two, during Melinda Hague,
[SPEAKER_10]: the US attorney in Northern California
came after Berkeley patients group a
[SPEAKER_10]: couple of years ago, tried to shut them
down.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the city of Berkeley and the community
actually organized and joined the case
[SPEAKER_10]: with BPG against the federal government to
stop the federal government from shutting
[SPEAKER_10]: down the city.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was because Berkeley patients
group is, I sort of call it a Berkeley
[SPEAKER_10]: institution.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is part of the community.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have all of these relationships with
nonprofits and all these support efforts
[SPEAKER_10]: that we do and fundraising drives and food
drives and toy drives and just become a
[SPEAKER_10]: valuable asset and not really just in,
obviously serving consumers and patients
[SPEAKER_10]: is a critical part of it, but as in any
business, corporate social responsibility
[SPEAKER_10]: and those relationships can really ensure
to the best of its ability that you are
[SPEAKER_10]: going to be secure and sustainable in the
place that you operate.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's really important, I think,
for public facing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's important for business
operators, definitely more so than other
[SPEAKER_10]: parts of the supply chain because we're so
public and whenever anything goes wrong,
[SPEAKER_10]: all of the strict rules on at least in
Berkeley for retailers than there are for
[SPEAKER_10]: anybody else.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so having, we also have this sort of
broader community of activists that have
[SPEAKER_10]: all been doing this for a really long time
and so we all help each other out and we
[SPEAKER_10]: knew like if Berkeley was gonna do this
and Berkeley goes this way, a lot of other
[SPEAKER_10]: people are gonna use that as an excuse to
move their city or their county in that
[SPEAKER_10]: direction too.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we sort of banded together with
people that don't necessarily have a stake
[SPEAKER_10]: in the city of Berkeley, but see that if
something happens in Berkeley,
[SPEAKER_10]: it could start a domino effect that would
be really bad because Alameda County in
[SPEAKER_10]: San Francisco and Berkeley declaring these
as essential, most likely set the path for
[SPEAKER_10]: all of these other states that later
issued shelter in place orders to declare
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis as essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for that and always
appreciative of all the hard work you guys
[SPEAKER_05]: are doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see your team at so vocal in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: The next thing that I thought was really
interesting that I wanted to look at was
[SPEAKER_05]: like any changes in consumer preference.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know from a data standpoint and
looking at all the adult use sales,
[SPEAKER_05]: we've seen the shift away from free rolls.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've seen negative declines in free
rolls.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we've seen this extreme growth or
when I say extreme, 28% growth over a 30
[SPEAKER_05]: day period in edibles and also beverages
have seen growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so Frank, I'm curious and to interrupt
your trim and sesh over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you guys seeing in terms of are
you seeing any shifts in demand?
[SPEAKER_05]: Has supply chain been affected for you all
in any degree?
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, can you talk first about one,
what you do and who you are and then what
[SPEAKER_05]: your consumer is and give us a lay of your
land?
[SPEAKER_11]: Sweet, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have the boss and owner,
my boss and the owner of Hela Dank,
[SPEAKER_11]: CEO Igor Einbeiner is also in house here.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm Frank LaFronta.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much for the introduction.
[SPEAKER_11]: The questions and thank you guys for
having me here or thank you ladies and
[SPEAKER_11]: guys, everybody for having us here.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a pleasure to be among such people in
the industry and all that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do like to refer to it as an
agricultural marketplace to maybe better
[SPEAKER_11]: this thing that we're all participating
in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_11]: Igor can answer your question more than I
can, honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we do a decent amount of sales in
pre-rolls specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a hash company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Igor, give us a breakdown of your business
first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who are you guys?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you do just so everyone knows?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're Hela Dank.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a hash company and we specifically
make hash from all living soil farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're like a smaller hash company,
I'd say.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're specifically focused on small farms,
craft farms and people who have
[SPEAKER_03]: sustainability in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our main products are hash, rosin,
and hash-infused pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, it's an interesting question for
us because hash-infused pre-rolls are
[SPEAKER_03]: probably our biggest seller out of all
different categories.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, we've definitely seen some
changes throughout this COVID situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't seen a full-on decline.
[SPEAKER_03]: In pre-rolls, just for us, but also we're
not a huge part of the pre-roll market
[SPEAKER_03]: yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're also a specialized part of the
pre-roll market where we only do infused.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not, I don't know if that might
separate us to some degree as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We noticed when it first hit, first day at
home order, we saw a spike in sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like that week, it was like a
bunch more sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like every week was changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had the trip week followed by a really
slow week, followed by a pretty normal
[SPEAKER_03]: week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as of recently, it has been a
little slower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, quite a bit slower, honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been like, I feel like last week was
like 60% decline.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think at all, is it people aren't
like sharing, you know, passing it around
[SPEAKER_05]: and they're not sharing and therefore,
you know, can that be attributing to less
[SPEAKER_05]: sales or do you have any thoughts on why?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I feel like that could definitely
could be part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: People maybe don't want to smoke a whole
dupe to their face.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Present company excluded.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have to smoke all the dubs to
make sure that they're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We smoke every single before it goes out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel like, yeah, some people could
be cautious, but then there's,
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like there's also people,
at least from our perspective,
[SPEAKER_03]: due to the weeks when we've had spikes in
sales or it's been higher than we would
[SPEAKER_03]: have expected.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the COVID being not a factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's kind of, you know,
there's still some users that are buying
[SPEAKER_03]: more, even of pre-rolls, especially like
there's, I mean, there's always going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be power users like us who will smoke,
you know, we're willing to smoke a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: hash dupe.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, we're also kind of behind the
scenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see the numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Normally we're out in the field doing
demos and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not doing anything like that right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're like less, less so exposed to the
consumer end.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, I could definitely be a
factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like that cleanliness and stuff and
just like people not wanting to share with
[SPEAKER_03]: anybody else, maybe they'd be focused
towards more single use products or
[SPEAKER_03]: products that you can easily divvy up into
a single servings for a single person.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shannon, what about from you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you, can you tell us about Space Gems?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wendy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wendy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Wendy, sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, I'm Wendy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the creator of Space Gem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
Awesome.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: This COVID thing, I've been experiencing
it since January, actually, because I had
[SPEAKER_07]: packaging coming in from China.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so on like January 20th, so I've been
going through with it ever since then.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seems like it hasn't stopped.
[SPEAKER_07]: But after we got our packaging in February
18th, actually, is when our packaging got
[SPEAKER_07]: delivered a month later.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of a sudden our sales were huge,
but that's just because we just came back
[SPEAKER_07]: on market again.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then like right at March 16th,
our sales were like we put the biggest
[SPEAKER_07]: batches we've ever put through testing and
like they were gone in four days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we could not even believe it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I could not catch up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, our struggles are organic sugar,
our like our ingredients.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's not awesome either.
[SPEAKER_07]: So assigned with all this going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, our the truck right before,
so our truck for 420 left on Tuesday,
[SPEAKER_07]: the truck before that was like a really
big truck also.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the truck before that, so three
trucks, our sales were not that great.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were pretty low.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the truck was not all the way full
either.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now all of a sudden, the truck is
full.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I feel like the stimulus check has
like boost things up and people have
[SPEAKER_07]: gotten money from unemployment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because a lot of people have, you know,
a lot of our customers are service based,
[SPEAKER_07]: so like restaurants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I feel like our sales are doing really
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Edibles, I feel like we can't keep in
stock still.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I didn't really say what kind of
company I have.
[SPEAKER_07]: Should I say that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, tell us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Space Jam.
[SPEAKER_07]: It started in 2016 in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we do a vegan organic gummy made with
ice water hatch.
[SPEAKER_07]: No distillate or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're completely different from almost
all edibles on the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're handmade vegan.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have like a little tin, pretty
special.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you open it, a little treasure.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have two THCs and one to one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the THCs are just flying.
[SPEAKER_07]: The CBDs are doing really well too.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the THCs are just flying off the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have like a little drink that
you can make drinks with, with ice water
[SPEAKER_07]: hatch also.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's doing really well too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Wendy, what's the connection?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I think we met at the UCBA um,
providers club.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so are y'all connected to trees as
well?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or what's the connection with Craig?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is that no connection there?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like my business partner.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's the best way to say it,
but they're talking trees and all of our
[SPEAKER_07]: ice water hatch and everything is from
talking trees.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he was.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was in the background before then he
had to move cause he had someone come into
[SPEAKER_07]: his office.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm at Satori right now, the
dispensary and this parking lot is just
[SPEAKER_07]: nonstop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like people are just coming nonstop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's like totally full.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you on a, are you on a mobile device
right now?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I freezing?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask if you could show us,
if you could walk out and show us the
[SPEAKER_02]: people outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I can.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a laptop with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where is the shop?
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to go outside and go look.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are we good now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can leave it.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not as busy as it was like five minutes
ago, but it's been nonstop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you see?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that was good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you not see?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we can see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're in McKinleyville.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that where the shop is?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're in McKinleyville.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our shop is in Eureka space gym and we're
right next to our dispensary and there's
[SPEAKER_07]: so many people there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're pulling into our parking lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I'm seeing a huge spike in sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that tour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shannon, can you tell us about Fiddler's
Greens and what you're seeing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us about you, what you do,
all about your company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give us the breakdown.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you guys hear me?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, my husband and I are co-founders of
Fiddler's Greens and Hightyde
[SPEAKER_09]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_09]: We transitioned from Prop 215 and we were
one of the early adopters, early Prop 64
[SPEAKER_09]: compliant companies.
[SPEAKER_09]: We do sun-grown cultivation and we make
tinctures and topicals.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm super excited about the group of
people on here because I think we do a
[SPEAKER_09]: little bit of business with everybody here
and I'm a big fan of Wendy's.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was actually going to be able to talk a
little bit about her products.
[SPEAKER_09]: We launched our distribution company about
a year and a half ago just because we were
[SPEAKER_09]: having a hard time finding a distributor
that could represent small craft heritage
[SPEAKER_09]: brands.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we launched to support the Fiddler's
Greens products and have recently been
[SPEAKER_09]: onboarding other small brands that have
the same sort of ethos we do in terms of
[SPEAKER_09]: sun-grown, environmentally conscious.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's a little bit about us.
[SPEAKER_09]: In terms of what we've been seeing that
mid-March timeframe, we started seeing the
[SPEAKER_09]: big spike.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think everybody was seeing with the
uncertainty about whether or not we were
[SPEAKER_09]: going to get shut down, how much we were
going to be shut down.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we had some pretty big orders going
out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, people were preparing for Hall of
Flowers and Coachella and a lot of those
[SPEAKER_09]: types of things.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've seen it level off a little bit the
last couple of weeks, but things are
[SPEAKER_09]: starting to pick up again.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's been really interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was fun to see those charts just
because I think it's pretty consistent
[SPEAKER_09]: across the industry in terms of what we're
all experiencing and nobody's really sure,
[SPEAKER_09]: are we staying home and smoking more?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we staying home and stocking up and
now we're going to see a drop off?
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, it's kind of hard to plan.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been ramping up production and
trying to be prepared.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of the Fiddler's Greens consumers are
medical patients.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got a lot of kids with epilepsy and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we're trying to make sure that
we've got product on hand and we're
[SPEAKER_09]: keeping our retailers stocked for those
folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk about what your husband's
currently doing that's not typical?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been working with partners to do
last mile fulfillment and there have been
[SPEAKER_09]: some changes on their side and we've been
looking to bring that on anyway and had
[SPEAKER_09]: hired a couple of folks that we wanted to
do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: But with the COVID and some of the safety
concerns, we felt better about having
[SPEAKER_09]: Cameron in the van doing the driving and
the deliveries.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was in the Marine Corps.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's been through hazardous material
training and so he's very experienced in
[SPEAKER_09]: the suiting up and all of the precautions
and so we've got him running the van.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was up in McKinleyville last week.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's in Palm Springs today.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was in LA yesterday.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're keeping him plenty busy right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: The last thing I guess before we close
out, could we each go down and talk about,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I know this is hard because we're all
so in COVID right now, but what are your
[SPEAKER_05]: thoughts on what does the cannabis
industry look like after COVID for your
[SPEAKER_05]: business in particular?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can start out with something that
I've been thinking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really curious to see the shifts in
delivery because I think this is going to
[SPEAKER_05]: be a whole new e-commerce world for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people are now moving into this
mindset just like we do with Amazon and
[SPEAKER_05]: Uber and etc.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're used to this on demand and so I'm
really curious to see kind of how things
[SPEAKER_05]: shift into delivery.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's from the business side and then
for me personally, I'm really interested
[SPEAKER_05]: after this post-COVID world.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one of the things that I'm
learning is that I'm seeing a lot more of
[SPEAKER_05]: our community kind of coming together out
of necessity because we had to fight some
[SPEAKER_05]: of these city policies and to make sure
that there wasn't this reversal of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis being a central language.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that we're going to continue to
see more collaboration among different
[SPEAKER_05]: sides of our industry and then taking on
some of these bigger challenges that we
[SPEAKER_05]: have like taxes within cannabis,
opening up banking, etc.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think for me, it's really from the
business side, looking at e-commerce and
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of how things are going to shift
there and from a personal side,
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think it's going to be more
collaboration amongst the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sabrina, maybe if we could start with you
and then go to Tom and work our way down.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's definitely hard to see what any
aspect of life is going to look like
[SPEAKER_10]: post-COVID.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm trying to start to visualize what the
slow return to the new normal is going to
[SPEAKER_10]: be.
[SPEAKER_10]: My first thoughts are sort of what's going
to happen in terms of in-store safety,
[SPEAKER_10]: sanitation, and social distancing protocol
that has been stepped up under these new
[SPEAKER_10]: orders.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's going to be some practices
that will probably remain for a while.
[SPEAKER_10]: If not permanently.
[SPEAKER_10]: All of this is obviously based on science
and our health experts and our doctors and
[SPEAKER_10]: what they tell us.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it sounds like this is going to
unroll in multiple phases, I can only see
[SPEAKER_10]: one or two phases forward, I think,
from what I know now.
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I think the protocols of
distributor to retail vendor relations and
[SPEAKER_10]: drop-off as well as face masks and temp
checks and things like that, I don't know
[SPEAKER_10]: if that's going to last forever.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know how close we're talking,
but as far into the future as I can see,
[SPEAKER_10]: which at this point is probably three to
six months, I have no idea what's going to
[SPEAKER_10]: happen after that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I also think that it's exposed a
[SPEAKER_10]: significant weakness and challenge and
limitations from our federal status as an
[SPEAKER_10]: illegal industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: And right now we're having all of these
challenges of not being able to access the
[SPEAKER_10]: federal relief packages that are being
given to all other businesses and
[SPEAKER_10]: especially for essential businesses.
[SPEAKER_10]: And these PVP program, which is the
payment protection program and the
[SPEAKER_10]: extended leave and all of these
requirements that have been put in place
[SPEAKER_10]: to support these mitigation and social
distancing protocols that the cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: industry, which is required to follow
these rules, may not get the commensurate
[SPEAKER_10]: financial relief that is attached to it or
purportedly attached to it for all
[SPEAKER_10]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is exposing a lot of
contradictions on the federal level.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we're hopefully going to see a
lot stronger, broader momentum on a
[SPEAKER_10]: federal level moving forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom, we didn't get anything from your
background and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom, our patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm the patient consumer on the
panel today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the industry since about
2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the founding editor of MG Magazine,
which is a B2B publication, covers the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not affiliated with them anymore,
but I've spent these years writing a
[SPEAKER_00]: numeral number of articles and interviews
interviewing people from CEOs of publicly
[SPEAKER_00]: traded companies to politicians,
Fiona Ma and others, to craft growers and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't agree with Sabrina more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that COVID has exposed the
challenges, strengths and weaknesses and
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly the challenges with the federal
government.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also an opportunity and also it
kind of puts things into perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think hopefully for many people that
some of the battles that they or things
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were imposing will not seem so
dire perhaps anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Los Angeles, they're opening up not
just delivery, but curbside, something
[SPEAKER_00]: people didn't want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want to do it anymore or
beforehand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things like being forced to use cash
all the time, which is not as safe a
[SPEAKER_00]: procedure as other forms of transactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a very much stronger
argument now that people would have a real
[SPEAKER_00]: hard time challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that retailers down here are
interested and are having those
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations with local politicians and
hopefully at the state level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm hoping that again after this,
that we'll see sort of a kindler,
[SPEAKER_00]: gentler retail experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm concerned about costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have questions about how manufacturers
are handling their the changes to their
[SPEAKER_00]: SOPs, which are so important in this
industry and so important in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiencies and being competitive and
they have to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume that the safety of workers
would mandate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the answers to all of that,
but those are the questions that are first
[SPEAKER_00]: and foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also cultural ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come out of our traditional culture
going way back and I don't want to lose
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a strong culture and
community, but those are the challenges
[SPEAKER_00]: that we face.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if we see new normals,
we don't want to see the destruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was already under threat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the things that I think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an optimist, but these are the
challenges that we face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wendy, what about you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going with this and then I have a
different question after, but we're going
[SPEAKER_02]: down the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're halfway there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wendy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I just learned a lot that we
might go to e-commerce.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to say that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I was just a little shy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was shocked at that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that we're learning how to deal
with this every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that the manufacturing and for us
personally, we have everyone six feet away
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's hard, but we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have shifts of people.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't have everyone at once.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't have team meetings anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to have broken up team meetings.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like it's great because I've been
in this scene since 2013 and have been
[SPEAKER_07]: pushing space gems since 2013.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have people who love our product,
but with curbside, I see a lot because
[SPEAKER_07]: people aren't seeing the product anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not seeing the display case.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just looking off an iPad and you
really have to push social media.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or anything that you can push.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just did care packages of a coloring
book to everyone with like sticker sheets
[SPEAKER_07]: and stuff just to tell people that we love
them and we put a crystal in them and we
[SPEAKER_07]: mailed off like over 300 of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just to people, I think that that's,
I think we're going to have to start doing
[SPEAKER_07]: more of that because we can't do
education.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't do demos.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what we were really focused on,
especially with the ice water hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a gummy market where there's a lot of
other people in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I really hope that every day we're
presented with challenges of like this
[SPEAKER_07]: summer, it's going to be hard to wear a
mask when cooking over a hot stove and hot
[SPEAKER_07]: boiling pot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that is, we all wear masks,
but that is something that is going to be
[SPEAKER_07]: hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we all are talking about how we're
going to go around that because summer
[SPEAKER_07]: does get hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't see this ending soon,
unfortunately, which I like to think all
[SPEAKER_07]: rainbows and unicorns, but they don't at
this very moment.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are going to have to strategize on
how to figure out how to stay on the
[SPEAKER_07]: shelf, how to make people still buy our
product, how to make people still know us
[SPEAKER_07]: by brand name because they're not seeing
us and it's all on an iPad or yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: or on the internet.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope that did that answer your
question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, I think it's such a good point
because we do have so many brands here in
[SPEAKER_05]: California.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in flower in particular,
there's, I don't know the latest number,
[SPEAKER_05]: but three to 400 unique brands in
California, legal, unique brands sold in
[SPEAKER_05]: shops.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is going to shift all of their
businesses into thinking, yes,
[SPEAKER_05]: how do we take this digitally in a product
that really does require that in person to
[SPEAKER_05]: really get the sense of that product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which makes it very hard because at a
federal level, we don't have advertising
[SPEAKER_05]: at scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: Facebook, Google, Instagram, all these
publishers as cannabis businesses,
[SPEAKER_05]: we can't go advertise them on that scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to get really creative with
how you're going to get customer
[SPEAKER_05]: acquisition and drive them into your
digital property to purchase that product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think everyone's really going to have
to adapt here quickly and learn from each
[SPEAKER_05]: other.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is perhaps another session that
someone, I think CMA actually,
[SPEAKER_05]: the cannabis market, marketing association
is doing some stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably a resource for you to
check out in terms of what is allowed in
[SPEAKER_05]: terms of different digital advertising to
be able to help your business with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I ask a follow up question about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the people here think now is a good or
a bad time to launch a new product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's a challenging time, but we also
have sort of everyone's attention because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm interested in people's opinion
about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me personally, I would think it would be a
little challenging because you can't see
[SPEAKER_07]: buyers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'd have to be like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: They want to be able to see the product.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like that name is really important.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's what people usually buy on
is the name and they want to be able to
[SPEAKER_07]: see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can't even smell flower anymore.
[SPEAKER_10]: We used to have demos all the time in the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that, yeah, that sort of person to
person contact where they can see the
[SPEAKER_10]: product and then smell the product and
talk to somebody taking that part away.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be challenging to figure out
how to replace that to bring on new
[SPEAKER_10]: brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't Candescent just launch a new,
not even like a value brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a value brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got skewered for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, this is another thing that we
might have to, that brands might have to
[SPEAKER_05]: adapt to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, you know, if we go into
recession, especially the premium brands
[SPEAKER_05]: thinking about how are you going to,
cause some of them were seeing them drive
[SPEAKER_05]: value brands.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we still don't know yet are
consumers willing to purchase these more
[SPEAKER_05]: premium brands or are they going to be
much more cost kind of conscious?
[SPEAKER_05]: Headset just did an analysis on this
actually yesterday and it's on our blog.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are still buying premium mates.
[SPEAKER_05]: There hasn't been any change there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that has been good for, for,
I think the industry though, definitely a
[SPEAKER_05]: shift into larger package size purchases.
[SPEAKER_05]: So ounces definitely have gone,
seen a lot of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the headset or anyone else have any
insights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Into demographics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard from a retailer last week that his
younger customers had fallen off,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But his older ones were continuing to
sustain the business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, actually we do have a lot of
information on customer demographics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to jump to another meeting,
but I will say this because you can find
[SPEAKER_05]: the answer to this question headset on the
website.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's this blue teal bar and this is our
team updates every single day in the
[SPEAKER_05]: markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are states that we're reporting on
all the real time updates that we're
[SPEAKER_05]: finding as it pertains to COVID.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's some interesting trends in
there for customer demographics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Women actually had much larger purchases
than men, probably because they didn't
[SPEAKER_05]: have items stocked up on hand generally.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're answering as many of those
questions as we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they're actually, Peter,
if there's any questions that you're
[SPEAKER_05]: getting, if people hit you up after this,
our team, is able to kind of look at all
[SPEAKER_05]: of this data and kind of report on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we just need more insight from the
community in terms of what do you need to
[SPEAKER_05]: know from this data and your businesses
that would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we would be happy to do that
investigation and report on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll let Jocelyn go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not done with the rest of you though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hang tight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: This was so fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye Jocelyn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, the one thing I want,
and you guys have done it in pieces,
[SPEAKER_02]: but kind of just going down the line,
[SPEAKER_02]: like give me just the stories of what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was Frank and Igor,
but like Sabrina, maybe starting with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you talked about fighting at the
local level, but like COVID hits and
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going, like, it's almost like the
siren sounds in the battleship and like
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody goes to their post and kind of
what were you guys talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: internally?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably on the front lines of SOPs
and understanding what the government,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, will and won't allow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like what was going on in real time for
you?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just for everybody kind of like
Frank, I had talked to you about it
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved these down, but like what's
changed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Frank, you guys always, you have a
history of, you know, I see Instagram
[SPEAKER_02]: posts of you guys going to visit all the
farms that you deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, you're obviously probably not
doing that and in taking trim and flour
[SPEAKER_02]: and showing up at the manufacturing
facility with, you know, or do you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: have to stagger shifts and then totally
off the distributors and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just Sabrina starts off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start with Sabrina, but just kind
of going down the line.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been quite a whirlwind.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's been a lot of pivoting and
adapting and shifting and interpreting,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, going from shelter in place.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we essential to, you know,
where in what capacity can we operate?
[SPEAKER_10]: And we want to be equal to every other
essential business and then fighting that
[SPEAKER_10]: fight.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, you know, there are certain
protocols for essential businesses that
[SPEAKER_10]: are public facing.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was an initial set of protocols.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the store had to adapt to those.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there were also, you know,
we had certain employees that had children
[SPEAKER_10]: that were no longer in school and did not
have childcare.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there was that whole situation.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the city and the county put out
new additional protocols, stricter
[SPEAKER_10]: protocols for public facing businesses.
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, the entire operations team had
to pivot again, and they put them out at,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, seven o'clock at night,
one night, and it was effective.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, midnight, like the next day.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so, you know, it's just been,
it almost reminded me of the, sorry,
[SPEAKER_10]: am I still there?
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: It almost reminded me of the, you know,
the first few months of 2018, honestly,
[SPEAKER_10]: and just everyone trying to figure out
what was going on, what we can do,
[SPEAKER_10]: what we can't do.
[SPEAKER_10]: How are we interpreting these rules
properly?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there's what the state says,
there's what the city says, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: just kind of pivoting.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there was also, you know,
making sure that everybody has the proper
[SPEAKER_10]: PPE and, you know, making sure that we can
source that, which has become increasingly
[SPEAKER_10]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now it's just sort of like,
kind of on, I feel like we're on edge
[SPEAKER_10]: because it's in terms of like SOPs.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, also, while I would include like
scaling up delivery, like I mentioned
[SPEAKER_10]: earlier, where basically none of the
dispensaries in the city were prepared to
[SPEAKER_10]: go to delivery only operations.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we were, we had one or two cars that
literally just started delivery like a day
[SPEAKER_10]: or two earlier.
[SPEAKER_10]: We kind of assumed something like this was
going to happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: We had already done the curbside.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and then there was also the BCC
getting approval from the Bureau of
[SPEAKER_10]: Cannabis Control to implement these new
protocols and invoking their emergency
[SPEAKER_10]: section in their regulations to allow us
to curbside, to put in plexiglass,
[SPEAKER_10]: to do all of these mitigations and those
distancing requirements that were all made
[SPEAKER_10]: to follow.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it's, yeah, it's just been a
constant scaling and shuffling and
[SPEAKER_10]: adapting and readapting to, you know,
this new environment.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, earlier, like I said,
it was very reminiscent of 2018 and the
[SPEAKER_10]: beginning of 2018.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I feel like this was more challenging
in a smaller, more compact period of time
[SPEAKER_10]: coupled with like a global pandemic.
[SPEAKER_10]: And sheltering in place and every other
aspect of our life being disrupted as
[SPEAKER_10]: opposed to 2018 where it was just our
businesses and how those operate was very
[SPEAKER_10]: disruptive and very stressful.
[SPEAKER_10]: But this is next level stressful.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's sort of where my experience and
our experience has been.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, obviously experiencing the same
trends that have been mentioned before,
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that the curbside is definitely
more active than the delivery.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a big debate about whether or not
delivery, I won't go into that,
[SPEAKER_10]: but yeah, it's just, I'm kind of on guard.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just waiting for another shoe to drop
and another rule from some level of
[SPEAKER_10]: government.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and then there's the federal,
you know, relief bills and cares and all
[SPEAKER_10]: of those things that have these,
like I had mentioned the labor
[SPEAKER_10]: requirements for employees and businesses
and leads.
[SPEAKER_10]: So also understanding how we fit into that
and where we can tap into relief and
[SPEAKER_10]: lobbying the state to see if we can access
relief there that we can't get from the
[SPEAKER_10]: federal government.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's always something with some level
of government and figuring out where we
[SPEAKER_10]: fit in, how to comply, what the right
interpretation is and the path forward.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we will persist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Frank and Igor, as we go down the
line, the conjoined twins, can you talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about kind of things that have changed in
the past month or so?
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of dealing, like looking
backwards down the supply chain and
[SPEAKER_02]: forwards up the supply chain and how you
kind of interact and deal with each part
[SPEAKER_02]: of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, you mentioned, you know,
visiting farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we're not, we're not, we're not
visiting any farms right now for safety
[SPEAKER_03]: reasons, but also it's just like not the
right time of the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent three months like borderline
living in home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like three to five days.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're still in our startup phase and we're
a really small team of just like five
[SPEAKER_03]: people at the office.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all live together as roommates in
addition to working together.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not really like exposing
ourselves to people outside, our problems
[SPEAKER_03]: into our office.
[SPEAKER_03]: The main things I've noticed have changed
is, yeah, we're not doing any demos.
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally have been out there doing a
lot of our own demos.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a brand ambassador as well,
but obviously we've cut all that off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're trying to focus more on digital
media.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are, we have been starting to,
you know, kind of target more delivery
[SPEAKER_03]: services and stuff like that when it comes
to sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: But things have been semi-normal for us,
I'd say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because we're way more like roasting
the manufacturing process than the sales,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we do sales as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as manufacturing, we're kind of
like, you know, we're all staying healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all trying to stay cleanly and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're also just, we're able to stay
safe because we're not constantly exposed
[SPEAKER_03]: to customers or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been minimizing the amount of
material going in or out unless it's
[SPEAKER_03]: something that needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've been practicing social
distancing and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just normal stuff that people,
you know, working in any business right
[SPEAKER_03]: now are experiencing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say though, there's, I feel like
there's a shift in mentality for people
[SPEAKER_03]: since people are, you know, more anxious,
more afraid and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's something that we're kind of
anticipating as we proceed in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is really kind of a big thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been making hash for 12 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been a cannabis nerd for
significantly longer than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But cannabis is kind of a thing that kind
of brings people together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it's like really been like a
communal thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are used to smoking with each other
and getting close.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like it brings people together.
[SPEAKER_03]: In America, I feel like there's been a bit
of like, even before this like COVID
[SPEAKER_03]: thing, I feel like there's definitely some
programming out there where everybody kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of wants to keep their distance.
[SPEAKER_03]: People aren't quite, you know,
we're not quite to level of like Italy
[SPEAKER_03]: where people are kissing each other three
times before they depart.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then also, you know, things like this
COVID hit Italy especially hard,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe partially due to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that cannabis has been like
kind of that force in America that's
[SPEAKER_03]: brought people together.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, I really hope that we can
overcome this in a way where we're not
[SPEAKER_03]: going to come out of it being like,
I don't want to touch anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to keep my distance from everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to smoke with anybody ever
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as far as like, as far as the
currency is concerned, I'm actually pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: concerned if we go to full e-commerce.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Money is a little bit dirtier thing,
but are we going to really give up all our
[SPEAKER_03]: freedoms to a level where all money is
tracked forever?
[SPEAKER_03]: Super big brother level if we are to go to
full e-commerce.
[SPEAKER_03]: So personally, I feel like, yeah,
I just, I feel like we should,
[SPEAKER_03]: we should definitely try to hold onto some
humanity through all of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like, you know, before we're like,
yes, you know, money is too dirty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's, let's get on the bandwagon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in general, what it's going to do
as far as just to the level that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to have on our financial system.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we go to full, full e-commerce.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, I'm more of a, you know, power to the
people type of person.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm, I'm not really going to,
I personally don't support that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I for an agenda.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like that's the, that's the thing
that, that they wanted beforehand before,
[SPEAKER_03]: before COVID hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been a regular currency before
COVID hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been trying to get us to,
you know, not connect, not connect with
[SPEAKER_03]: each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: On a personal level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just a reason that another
reason that's out there now that people
[SPEAKER_03]: have there and it's, it's stemmed in fear.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like everybody be safe and
everybody, you know, be cleanly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, once, once we get over this
thing, don't I, I, as a message that out
[SPEAKER_03]: to the people, I'd say, don't,
don't let it rule your life for the,
[SPEAKER_03]: for the rest of, for the rest of your
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we had the Spanish flu a hundred
years ago and before COVID hit,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, people weren't, weren't walking
around in masks because of what happened
[SPEAKER_03]: in 1918.
[SPEAKER_03]: So same thing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we need to come out of this as
humans still, and not as just some like
[SPEAKER_03]: fear mongering, like, like part of some
crazy fear machine.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to really fast, just address the
last question that you, that you guys
[SPEAKER_11]: asked about the, the, just like where you
see things after this and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like what, you know, I think that like
where we are at, where we're specifically
[SPEAKER_11]: doing is where we're working with
sustainable agriculture and regenerative
[SPEAKER_11]: farming practices and stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: So to see more of those farms come out of
this more, more people, more organic farms
[SPEAKER_11]: taking the next step and going to
regenerative and sustainable, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: that's like what I want to see out of this
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's like the only input I actually
had in this whole discussion and stuff,
[SPEAKER_11]: because basically it's like what I think
about all day.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this has been a major catalyst for
information to be spread.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's an opportunity for people to
either, you know, go the opposite way and
[SPEAKER_11]: surrender and actually depend on the
government hardcore or, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: go the opposite and be sustainable.
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like cannabis has taught a lot of
people, all the heroes that I have in this
[SPEAKER_11]: industry are people that came out here and
didn't know what was going to happen,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, or, or, you know, grew up here
and just really put their all and every
[SPEAKER_11]: bit of their effort into making a good
product.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then that's what they have their name
for.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it reminds me of all the crafts
and the goods that, you know, this,
[SPEAKER_11]: this United States used to be bad ass for,
for doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I feel like we have, we have an
opportunity here to seize, you know,
[SPEAKER_11]: the food industry will combine with the
cannabis industry when everything goes big
[SPEAKER_11]: and whatever.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know I'm a romantic optimist in
that, but that's my little piece of
[SPEAKER_11]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frank is not an advanced nutrients brand
ambassador.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shannon.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't exactly remember what the
question was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just kind of adding anything
to kind of your, like you had mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Cameron's down making
deliveries, which was out of the,
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the ordinary for you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what kind of some of the things that
have been going on recently related to
[SPEAKER_02]: COVID-19.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, because we're tested to such
high standards, I think for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_09]: it was a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like there was no shortage of gloves or
isopropyl alcohol in my facility.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, those were things that we
did already.
[SPEAKER_09]: The things I think we're struggling a
little bit with are more on the community
[SPEAKER_09]: side.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we're a small close knit group
too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like everybody hugs and says, I love you
at the end of the day when they're
[SPEAKER_09]: leaving.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, that's been a little weird.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, Cameron was up at Trinity County
picking up flowers at soul spirit last
[SPEAKER_09]: week.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's like, you know, I'm standing
eight, 10 feet away from them while we're
[SPEAKER_09]: like counting the inventory and wearing
gloves and masks.
[SPEAKER_09]: And normally we'd be sharing joints and
hugging and high fiving.
[SPEAKER_09]: So those kinds of things have been really
challenging.
[SPEAKER_09]: But in terms of, I don't know,
it's, it's been a really weird,
[SPEAKER_09]: strange world.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we're going to have to battle
to, to preserve the community side of it
[SPEAKER_09]: through this.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I'm a bit of an introvert,
but I really have been missing hugging and
[SPEAKER_09]: sharing a joint with my friends.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that's been really weird for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we've also, you know, like the
tinctures are great because you don't have
[SPEAKER_09]: to, if you're not looking to drop her,
like you can still medicate.
[SPEAKER_09]: Edibles are great.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're working with a company called Omura
and so Sonoma and they're single serving
[SPEAKER_09]: individual pre-packed whole flower vape
products.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, you know, I think some of those
innovative products we're going to be
[SPEAKER_09]: seeing a higher use of.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've seen sales go up on those.
[SPEAKER_09]: We also work with Herbal Buoyda who makes
a quiver, which is a personal lubricant.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've seen sales on that go up.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, it just, it's, it's a shift.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we just, we can't forget where we came
from.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't forget the human side of things,
but we've also got to be safe.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's weird.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a weird world, but you know,
Cameron's also been joking.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, never waste a good crisis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Sonoma County is a really good example
of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were one of the first counties to put
out a cannabis ordinance a couple of years
[SPEAKER_09]: ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they pulled back and,
you know, really hurt a lot of operators.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when the, the Corona stuff happened,
Sonoma County was the first one,
[SPEAKER_09]: one of the first ones to put out an
ordinance and they listed cannabis as an
[SPEAKER_09]: essential business, as agriculture and
medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have it back down from that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, we have to keep fighting.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to keep being loud and vocal and
pushing on our regulators.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if they're calling us an
essential business, give us access to
[SPEAKER_09]: banking.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't make us handle dirty cash.
[SPEAKER_09]: Give us access to the things that are
going to make us be sustainable
[SPEAKER_09]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop trying to tax us into oblivion.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now's the time to push and really,
you know, say we're here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like y'all said we're essential.
[SPEAKER_09]: Stop treating us like criminals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wendy, do you want to go after that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my God, Shannon did so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't even say it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like so awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess what's the question of like,
where do I see this going?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I, I think it's kind of like what,
what has been going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what, what was one of the last
conversations you and Craig had today,
[SPEAKER_02]: yesterday, last week about just dealing
with crazy shit that's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we just had it as I were on this,
I was telling Craig like all the stats
[SPEAKER_07]: that she provided and yeah, we,
I think both of us are a little bit in
[SPEAKER_07]: denial.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that that's okay to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, but we really see it's happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, we're using the mass where
everyone has the gloves.
[SPEAKER_07]: All of our places are six feet with like
just social distancing and everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I definitely see that we have to
figure out how to keep present and keep
[SPEAKER_07]: moving, especially both of our brands.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is great because we are a big
family.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that there's 80, 110 people that
work for Craig all together.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we all, there's a lot of, there's a lot
of us and you know how it's cool because
[SPEAKER_07]: we have distribution, retail,
manufacturing, the farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we get to see all the different things
and how we all, all of us managers are
[SPEAKER_07]: reacting.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great that we've only personally,
I only lost one person to all this team
[SPEAKER_07]: member and everyone else was adaptable and
flexible to change their schedule and
[SPEAKER_07]: everything like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know, right when this started,
I do have to say it was really high
[SPEAKER_07]: intensity.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like Frank said, high anxiety to keep
the team going.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we made it through.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I just really hope organic sugar
is like my biggest struggle.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't even say that enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I am like fighting and then we get
organic sugar from a different source and
[SPEAKER_07]: it's contaminated.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the lab calls me to tell me it's
contaminated.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, where we buy all of our supplies
is those places are open, but they're only
[SPEAKER_07]: open at a skeleton scale.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what keeps Space Jam great.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got to work with them and place bigger
orders and.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: A few ingredients they work with Oh,
just just my ingredients suppliers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, you know, well, and what Wendy's
saying is really important for people to
[SPEAKER_09]: understand is cannabis products are tested
at a standard that organic food products
[SPEAKER_09]: cannot pass.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as an edible guideline, the fact that
she can make a completely organic product
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's fine and she adds cannabis to it
and the cannabis is clean but the sugar
[SPEAKER_09]: causes her to fail, like that is absurd.
[SPEAKER_09]: So these are things we need to be fighting
right now while we've got people's
[SPEAKER_09]: attention and they're calling us essential
and trying to get some of these laws and
[SPEAKER_09]: regulations changed so that they're not so
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sugar, yeah I have to say I got the
lab called this morning about the sugar
[SPEAKER_07]: about yeah the sugar is not good on an R&D
and that is not good because the sugar I
[SPEAKER_07]: would usually get would be from Costco.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to say that I don't mind saying
that organic sugar from Costco and you
[SPEAKER_07]: know you could only buy one bag and they
will not let me buy anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: I send my whole team in just to get so we
just can keep moving.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, not good.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are the weird things going on right
now.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're out of paper towels and we went to
like five shops trying to get paper
[SPEAKER_09]: towels.
[SPEAKER_09]: We tried to order paper towels from Uline
but because we had never ordered paper
[SPEAKER_09]: towels from Uline they wouldn't send them
to us.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are the weird things that are gonna
break us right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, totally gloves too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gloves is a big thing too.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really hard to find gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at Frank showing off his gloves.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lysol, disinfectant, hand sanitizer,
yeah we're making our own but yeah gotta
[SPEAKER_07]: keep it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah and then I also like to say I have
like a whole staff member washing our
[SPEAKER_07]: doors and making sure we're doing all
these protocols of washing all the tables
[SPEAKER_07]: and washing the door handles and you know
making sure everyone's wearing a mask and
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah a whole COVID person non-stop just to
make sure they're six feet away.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, everyone's safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so I think cannabis has a long
history of meeting these challenges and
[SPEAKER_00]: especially coming you know people who come
out of the traditional industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This conversation has been really valuable
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I'm thinking is that I
think that the activists in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and lobbyists are gonna come out of this
feeling their oats because if anything the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry has proven itself during
this time and its value and its
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility and so there's there's many
strong arguments to be made for moving
[SPEAKER_00]: forward taking the foot off its neck and
I'm hopeful that legislators may start to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear that because of this event not in
spite of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well yeah I think over the last two years
we've proven we're really good at jumping
[SPEAKER_09]: through hoops and so it's one more thing
like it's not something that's devastating
[SPEAKER_09]: to us it's just one more hoop we're
jumping through.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah I agree it's it's you know we've
we've survived federal prohibition
[SPEAKER_10]: wildfires earthquakes you know this is
just a pandemic.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not just a pandemic but I'm saying
it's you know like 20 the transition in
[SPEAKER_10]: 2018 was like so extreme and and just
really this reminds me so much of that
[SPEAKER_10]: just in terms of like overnight protocol
changes and and and so many so such a
[SPEAKER_10]: widespread protocol changes that yeah I
think if any industry is gonna come out
[SPEAKER_10]: okay and is resilient and adaptable enough
to survive this it's gonna be the cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: industry just given everything we've been
through.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would agree with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm even hoping more that the that the
craft side of the industry also sees a
[SPEAKER_00]: resurgence you know as a as a consumer who
walks into retail shops and has forever
[SPEAKER_00]: the move towards you know just a CPG and
everything packaged has been a little
[SPEAKER_00]: depressing for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think real cannabis people want a lift
through their noses and they like that the
[SPEAKER_00]: touch of the field this is really
important and I'm hoping as a people as a
[SPEAKER_00]: nation you know as a world that we out of
this that we you know we realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been fucking things up we move more
towards more sustainable practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the rational reaction to what has
just happened and you know cannabis just
[SPEAKER_00]: works right into that especially the the
the craft side of the industry and so many
[SPEAKER_00]: people that we know and their voices can
continue to be heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's gonna be a challenge but I
that's what we want to do that's who we
[SPEAKER_00]: love talking to and getting those
practices.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're seeing some of that already I think
we've seen two or three of the multi-state
[SPEAKER_09]: operators announced that they're pulling
out of California in the last couple of
[SPEAKER_09]: weeks you know we're seeing the struggles
that med men are going through and what
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hoping is that the small operators on
this call and you know the small operators
[SPEAKER_09]: we work with that have been staying lean
focused on trying to get profitable we
[SPEAKER_09]: step in and we fill that gap.
[SPEAKER_09]: This was our industry this wasn't their
industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are the ones that can adapt yeah yeah
they they tried to change our industry to
[SPEAKER_10]: fit their idea of it and and yeah we're
we're used to this environment or more
[SPEAKER_09]: yeah we got 30 years of experience.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know I just want to say that I'm here
with a buyer at Satori and you know he's
[SPEAKER_07]: mentioning about how he's wiping down all
the boxes and then letting them sit for 24
[SPEAKER_07]: hours before he puts them into the system.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know I have to say that because we
wonder about that too as a consumer and
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff so yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I mean that's kind of like my home
protocol where packages land on the front
[SPEAKER_02]: step I leave them there for like 12 hours
then I put them in the yard and let them
[SPEAKER_02]: sit for you know it's like groceries come
in they go in one place but like nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: gets nothing gets nothing gets touched for
like 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm waiting for my ultraviolet light
sanitizer.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's actually a good idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very expensive they say.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's wrap on that but I appreciated
everyone this is the the first of
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully a recurring series and my whole
thing I mean my whole thing you're all
[SPEAKER_02]: small.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was within time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't want to have a contestant on
here or a med man on here or Cresco to
[SPEAKER_02]: tell us how things are going for Cresco.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a shit and I'd rather help
you guys out and get your voices heard and
[SPEAKER_02]: get this in front of the Lori Ajax's of
the world and the you know the consumers
[SPEAKER_02]: and have you know hopefully them be like I
want to check out those space gems.
Candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: With all due respect Berkeley patients
group is not small in my mind.
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess it's relative.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean we're certainly not Cresco or Med
Men.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess in terms of 20 years.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have a good yeah we we have a good
solid following that we've we spent
[SPEAKER_10]: decades building up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You still still small craft shop though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't mean I didn't mean in terms
of square footage but in terms of its
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose its meaning and the value it's
brought to this industry to people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well I love Space Jam by the way.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's an honor to be here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got some in my closet right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be safe.
