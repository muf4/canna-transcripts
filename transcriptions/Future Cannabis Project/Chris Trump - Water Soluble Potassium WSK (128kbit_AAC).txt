[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, connecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here he is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for joining.
Hey, Tina.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a beautiful day here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you had cold nights?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: My wife is a little disenfranchised with
our gardening this year because a typical
[SPEAKER_03]: farmer pushed that envelope.
[SPEAKER_03]: How soon can I get the plants in the
ground?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had so many starts that I was like,
I'm going to risk it with these.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got a late frost and things died.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she was bummed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we got lots of starts to go in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'll be fine.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you lose your pumpkins?
[SPEAKER_03]: My giant thousand pound pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost all but one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to have to reseed those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was kind of bummed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my first time ever messing with the
award-winning pumpkin seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Figured it'd be a fun thing if we had to
forklift a pumpkin out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have won.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it survived in spite of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Tina, if you give me just a second,
I'm going to get just a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: firewood to start the fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be right back.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who's going to Boise this summer,
man?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to get there and spend some time
together and inoculate our bodies with all
[SPEAKER_01]: the antivirals we're going to need for
changing our world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be covering how and why to use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I could start a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, potassium has an interesting place
in the plant world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I think sunflowers are so
cool is because think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're growing in the desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're hardy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come up before the frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're one of the first presenters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they thrive in any environment,
including drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the qualities of potassium is
that it boosts the metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the metabolism of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a protein synthesis kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It maintains the water balance in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the one thing that's present in the
stomata of the plant that opens up during
[SPEAKER_01]: the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does that action.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more the plant can open up and receive
what it needs to, the more vigorous that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is going to grow and the bigger it's
going to grow and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a drought tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pest or disease kind of a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't form any compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris, turn your volume down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like hearing it loud and clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on just a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll turn it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll listen to you on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and potassium deficiencies don't
really affect the root mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sort of affect above ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really is kind of a major component
when it comes to how the plant is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: do in a season, especially with drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado, we're seeing a lot of
extremes in weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sunflowers are always just so
resilient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been playing a lot with boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And potassium and boron work hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of the same processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a week-long can of Intensive that
Chris puts on in Boise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm telling you, I practiced can of,
well, I didn't practice can of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I was practicing can of for a
good year before I went to Chris's class.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is nothing like a hands-on class
to teach you what you need to know about
[SPEAKER_01]: so many of these little details that have
to be shown.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to taste it, smell it,
see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your body knows it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get to go home and practice
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your nose doesn't forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nose does not forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's so true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to ask a, no, I'm not going to
ask a Choe Slapable question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll ask it in a different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very curious about the biochar aspect
of the WSK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Chris, I've been extracting it,
using it as a mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not K&F.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the biochar is fascinating me
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using it a lot in my soil mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sort of was listening to Master Cho's
videos and put together soil mix that he
suggested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm in love with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've transplanted all my houseplants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're so happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're crazy happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that one's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm in love with the chart.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, now I feel like I want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So typical Hawaii fashion, born and raised
in Hawaii, or back and forth some to
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're slow motion.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the process is, you know,
everybody comes over for dinner and they
[SPEAKER_03]: get involved in the cooking process and
everything where it's like move to the
[SPEAKER_03]: mainland.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody's like, oh, if I invite you
over for dinner, when you walk in the
[SPEAKER_03]: door, we're sitting down to eat so
different culturally from.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I apologize.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for starting the fire now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the fire going.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to talk a little bit about what
you need to to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So today we're going to use a Dutch oven.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a simple tool for making small batch
biochar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just really, really useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in here, I have some pre pre charred
sunflower.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the head, the stock,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll go a little bit longer on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pre charred it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So take a very short time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Time to kind of finish up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll start some sesame stock,
you know, just to show kind of how to use
[SPEAKER_03]: that material as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is black sesame stock full of
potassium.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also use asparagus if you're
asparagus grower, especially if you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want to like take away from your produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't want to take your your
wonderful asparagus heads that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to take to market those big
photosynthesizing kind of vegetative heads
[SPEAKER_03]: that you let the asparagus grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So asparagus farming, you are letting some
of the asparagus kind of go to seed,
[SPEAKER_03]: go to flower so that it's
photosynthesizing and bringing energy down
[SPEAKER_03]: into that plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to harvest 100 percent
because you you'll lose long term,
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll lose production in that asparagus
patch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you let some of them go and get really
big.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those big heads full of seeds and and
leaves, et cetera, are perfect for making
[SPEAKER_03]: biochar, especially at the end of the
season.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they've done their job, they're
starting to harden off or dry out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taking all of those and making your WSK
with that is a great material.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sunflower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sunflower, asparagus, these concepts
aren't really isn't something I was taught
[SPEAKER_03]: by Master Trower learned in Korea.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is in line with the natural farming
concepts in that he said, you got to
[SPEAKER_03]: figure out what works.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how it works in Korea.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to figure out how it works in
mainland USA or in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what what I've done with that,
if you want a little bit of kind of the
[SPEAKER_03]: contents of potassium PPM, you can go over
to other videos frozen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you can see me, then we got we
got a live feed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not a lot of people grow sesame in in
the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not something super common.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because of that, we didn't have access
to this part of the ingredient list.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you go over to aquaponic growers,
I think it's a Facebook group or aquaponic
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis growers, maybe it's moderated by
Steve Dredd, Steve Reisner in their file
[SPEAKER_03]: section.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a document put out by Duke
University that has kind of the
[SPEAKER_03]: accumulator list of all kinds of plants
where you can get a feel for kind of the
[SPEAKER_03]: content of some of these plants that are
common to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe you don't have access to
sunflowers or, you know, asparagus or
[SPEAKER_03]: sesame.
[SPEAKER_03]: What other things are just crazy off the
chart in potassium where you can you can
[SPEAKER_03]: extract that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sunflower and asparagus is way up there
in the potassium levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can jump jump in there and learn
about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So great, great substitute for us in the
US because most people have sunflowers and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just a readily available thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, so first step is charring our
our material.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is mostly done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to throw it on and we'll let the
fire go to work on this finishing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the key to biochar is a limiting of
the oxygen you're allowing to come into
[SPEAKER_03]: your material.
[SPEAKER_03]: What that does is it causes a kind of
releasing or a discharge of the syngas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is kind of the nutrients,
if you will, or a lot of a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: other compounds in your material.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it leaves behind a lot of the mineral
and carbon structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to go ahead, leave the lid
on our Dutch oven, which allows a little
[SPEAKER_03]: gas to escape with pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it isn't allowing oxygen in to turn
this to ash.
[SPEAKER_03]: We won't get a white ash because of the
lack of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's key for the biochar process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just going to throw that right on
top of the fire, stick it in there and
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll let that heat up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to get a hot mitt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that that should be done in pretty
short order because it's already mostly
[SPEAKER_03]: done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll show you kind of chopping up
our sesame and loading it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the basic recipe for for this is I'm
going to throw my headphone on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me all right?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basic recipe is that we take this finished
biochar.
[SPEAKER_03]: We throw it in a sack here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to use this nut milk bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get these at your kind of local
natural grocer or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use a cloth bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cotton works great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you need a tea bag kind of for this
part.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you throw that in at about a one to
ten ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use a little bit more char if you
want, but don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do 50 percent char, 50 percent
water, because you will just waste.
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't all go into solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be wasting some of that char.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're better off using about a one to
ten.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with this, we don't use vinegar.
[SPEAKER_03]: We use water to extract and just that
sitting in water, there's enough pull from
[SPEAKER_03]: the water to get some of our potassium
into solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a water soluble potassium at the
end.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can agitate, you know, every couple of
days, you know, just give it a little just
[SPEAKER_03]: like you do if you're making your English
breakfast tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, take a take a little dipping of
the tea bag and the salts work way better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's it's it's it's true that lots of
people grow with with those those kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not I'm not I'm not an anti to
farming methods as much as I'm an advocate
[SPEAKER_03]: for ways that we can we can do it less
expensively and with great yields to
[SPEAKER_03]: affect the bottom line of the farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I can get the same yields and and as
good or better quality while spending a
[SPEAKER_03]: tenth as much, we're we're in a better
place financially.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in concert with the microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So subtle is better that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: One second.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get I'm going to fill up a
bucket of water and get myself a Coca
[SPEAKER_03]: Cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, Coca Cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want a Coca Cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking can't have up in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yo,
[SPEAKER_01]: I do salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: People people like to troll a little.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what the Internet's for.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have trolls on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not calling you a troll man.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I was.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have people throwing stones,
you know, what good is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get bored.
[SPEAKER_03]: We only like negative news anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watching that char go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have a egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those egg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, fancy when I used to have money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought toys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an egg barbecue pit that I put a
crock down in like that and build the fire
[SPEAKER_01]: up around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a charred rice hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Christ, we love him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, charring rice hole is amazing,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of silica in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we love negative news.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so much that it's got us locked in our
houses.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much we love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give the microbes a chance to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would you guys have for breakfast
this morning?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had granola and a banana, two bananas.
Actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't have coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I mean, OK, let's talk
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about viruses and pathogenic
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're mostly opportunistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nature abhors a void.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always wanting to be filled by life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nature is prone to life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what life is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when there's a void, when we've killed
off all the beneficial organisms,
[SPEAKER_01]: then the things that come in, are the are
the very pathogens that are going to hurt
[SPEAKER_01]: us, because that's the only thing that can
survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way to to work with that and also
in concert with our immune system is to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring in a biodiversity of organisms that
then sort of do the work of overpopulating
[SPEAKER_01]: and allowing for an environment where
there's a communication in a community
[SPEAKER_01]: that goes on within our systems and in our
plant systems and in our soil systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are in concert with one another and
thrive accordingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, microorganisms have everything
to do with helping us deal with pathogenic
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we should all get together in
Boise so that we can all hug each other
[SPEAKER_01]: and get our immune systems functioning and
learn about KNF from Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: When's your class, Chris?
[SPEAKER_03]: Class is, I think, the first or second
week of August.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can find it if you go to
naturalfarming.co and go up to the tabs
[SPEAKER_03]: and click classes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get a link to it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can come down.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a bunch of people that have been
doing this for years now that are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be returning, get to share their
experiences, and they end up being a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of your hands on teachers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so Tina, what's your experience
been?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you've been playing with this now.
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of results are you seeing as far
as changes in the garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I applied it for the first year in
my indoor grow, my cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only applied it to the cannabis and it
was instantly dramatic, especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene expression and just overall
quality of the medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in deriving the medicine,
like I do spederics or alchemy as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just having the final expression
through medicine is just mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But last year I applied it in my outdoor
garden and it just blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I walk out there and I lift up the areas
of wood chips and there's just massive
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of hypha and they're all at the
root of my garlic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're doing the job that we know
they're supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just out there doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because they're indigenous,
they've survived the winter and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: thriving the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day I go out there, it's mind
blowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, this is a Mexican Coke.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only Coke I love.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has very simple ingredients instead
of like a 20, 20 ingredient list.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a four or five ingredient list.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, Mexican Coke advertisement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get paid for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can break down metal with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cops carry it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's an accident, they carry it in
the back of their car.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're totally dissolved.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's a blood, it's gone dark,
but if there's blood on the street,
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll dissolve it with Coke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can completely decompose a slab
of meat in like 24 hours, drop it in a
[SPEAKER_03]: thing of Coke.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really good for your inside,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cleaning out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool, Tina, to see those kind of
around and communicating with your garlic
[SPEAKER_03]: balls.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, I don't know, it's kind of,
you know, as much as natural farming is a
[SPEAKER_03]: method, my favorite aspect or the thing
that I find that I want to most
[SPEAKER_03]: communicate is what we're trying to do is
continually understand nature a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Science is wonderful for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're actually pushing on trying to
understand as soon as possible in the
[SPEAKER_03]: scientific community, how microbes make
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Monsanto's number one R&D expenditure for
between 2017 or, I think, it was 2017-18.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just when I was researching it,
and I was talking to a guy, his whole lab
[SPEAKER_03]: in San Diego was rented for this research.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how do microbes make fertilizer is the
question they're asking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reality is microbes in community
is something we know very little about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even in the whole of the scientific
research community, we're just beginning
[SPEAKER_03]: to understand, yes, we can, we can pull
out one microbe and kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: turn it around.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it do?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll use the example of human
communities that a, you know, if you take
[SPEAKER_03]: a, if you're an alien and you take a
blacksmith's shop and you look at it in
[SPEAKER_03]: isolation, why does this guy keep making
tools?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, why does this guy keep playing
with iron?
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make sense until you look at
the farmer who's attaching that tool to
[SPEAKER_03]: the back of a horse or a tractor or,
you know, it doesn't make sense in
[SPEAKER_03]: isolation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have sometimes skewed or limited
views of what microbes are good for if we
[SPEAKER_03]: isolate them and don't understand that
they are a part of a community.
[SPEAKER_03]: This thing that they're producing might be
one step in a chain of steps to produce
[SPEAKER_03]: healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's really a fun journey and in
natural farming, getting stuff like this
[SPEAKER_03]: where I'm telling you to go look up the
accumulation of nutrients that plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: I am sitting in the heat zone of this
fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to switch sides.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already a warm day.
[SPEAKER_03]: They say smoke fall is duty, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But to, to, to look at, you know,
taking our natural environment and getting
[SPEAKER_03]: some of our necessary crop nutrients from
it, it's, it's such a cool thing and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and a kind of liberating thing for a
farmer who maybe had to go to the salt
[SPEAKER_03]: store, you know, where they're not getting
anything here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in quarantine and I'm producing all
the farm nutrients for our farm,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in our house with my kids and
it's drinkable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to, I want to talk about I want to
talk, I want to talk to you sometime about
[SPEAKER_01]: the faculty of the anaerobics too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's faculty of anaerobics.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been really interesting because like,
I have really clay soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the places where the stuff
I've been gathering that's doing best has
[SPEAKER_01]: been in the sort of wood chip areas that
I've been able to build.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to my clay soils,
it's been really a different kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: learning process that, that what's
actually eating the clays and making them
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant available are this whole same kind
of diversity, but deeper down in the soils
[SPEAKER_01]: of anaerobic communities that are,
that are very much in this kind of layered
[SPEAKER_01]: consortium of activity that just brings a
whole new level to this, this expanded
[SPEAKER_01]: awareness of nature that we learn by
practicing Korean natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're, they're cool in that,
you know, I, I'm actually going to jump on
[SPEAKER_03]: with some people at the Future Cannabis
Project later today.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I have three my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't, what time is it for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was two, but yeah,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys check in on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Future Cannabis Project.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you're going to be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure we'll talk a lot about that,
but the cool thing is they're,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of these anaerobes and in fact,
the date of anaerobes, they're,
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't do the same process with
breakdown.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like a fungi does in that they're,
they're processing things or breaking them
[SPEAKER_03]: down, but they're leaving behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This
[SPEAKER_03]: is going to be our WSK, water soluble
potassium.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to show how to make it in
the next few minutes here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're the, the anaerobes what's
neat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So say like, you know, we get into organic
and it's composting and you send away your
[SPEAKER_03]: compost for an NPK analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's, it's nothing in
comparison to a typical especially if you
[SPEAKER_03]: have a highly fungal compost, it's nothing
in comparison to a typical salt or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of that is that fungi actually bring
the nutrients into their body and create
[SPEAKER_03]: their, their body structure with those
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that to be able to see those nutrients
that they put into their body structure,
[SPEAKER_03]: you'd have to get out the million Kelvin
torture or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, you know, so it's tied up in our
typical analysts, analysis methods for
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas a lot of these anaerobes or
facultative anaerobes, you're going to,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're going to break things down,
but they leave kind of the nutrients
[SPEAKER_03]: intact.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to get a much better NPK
reading if you're fermenting with an
[SPEAKER_03]: anaerobe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're not making the structures
in the same way that the, these big
[SPEAKER_03]: aerobic microbes are.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what they leave behind is ready food
for the fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to show you something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You keep talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, the, the, the way that they can
work in tandem is, is pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to say one's good and the other's not
good is, you know, it depends what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing, what you're trying to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me, you know, farming trees,
I actually want a very low bacterial ratio
[SPEAKER_03]: to my fungal ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a thousand to one fungal to
bacterial.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we looking at?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is that swarm book, you know,
I'm just giving you all my secrets right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no secrets in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look at the little bugs eating this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the clay that I made out of the
factory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's like millipedes, like it's
literally crawling with bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well,
[SPEAKER_03]: and some of those bigger, um, you know,
things like worms and millipedes,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, part of what they eat is the microbes
themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you're producing all kinds of
microbes and getting that total quantity
[SPEAKER_03]: of, you know, mommy and daddy worm are
getting together and saying, Hey,
[SPEAKER_03]: the food source is infinite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's, uh, let's make lots of babies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, that whole engine, you know,
it's kind of think about like a giant
[SPEAKER_03]: diesel engines, you know, you gotta,
you gotta kind of charge the glow plug,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, to get that whole machine moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually you do, you want the whole
gambit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want the, um, the big, uh,
fungal life.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in nature, that doesn't happen
instantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not an instant thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try and kind of, we, we talk about and
kind of, especially people who live in the
[SPEAKER_03]: city, you know, and they can instantly,
you know, order anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, sometimes it's like, okay,
let's now step back and start to
[SPEAKER_03]: understand what is the speed of nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, how does, how does nature work?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, in, and what's the speed of
nature and, you know, people, people talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about these, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: moving towards that goal of, um,
you know, nice fungal profiles in
[SPEAKER_03]: comparison to our bacterial profiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're starting from scratch or
you're starting with depleted soil,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're starting with, you know,
solid clay, um, that takes a process.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I, I usually put it in the realm
of three years to really be at full,
[SPEAKER_03]: full cycle, um, with, with the whole
diversity of the microbial communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, and those anaerobes and
facultative anaerobes, they play a role in
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they really do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Pahi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where, where on the islands are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm guessing you're in the islands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, why Pahi?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm probably saying that wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad your, your, uh, your garden's
going well, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The smoke's now coming, coming this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's falling.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't get away from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's check our, um, let's check our,
uh, material, see if we got a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_03]: of char.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to be careful with,
um, with this, because if you're checking
[SPEAKER_03]: it and you have a bunch of syngas built up
in there, um, you don't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily open it right over the fire
and, uh, get all that ignited and it can
[SPEAKER_03]: totally ignite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and it'll rush out the sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll actually shoot out the sides.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see that here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll lean down.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you see, if you were watching from the
beginning, you can see how we have a
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty good change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, from what we started with,
I had a little bit leftover, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: material as far as, uh, Ooh, this is hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little leftover material as far as,
um, there was some little bit of green or
[SPEAKER_03]: plant structure, kind of that stuff left.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't quite to biochar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did pre do this so we'd be pretty close.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and wouldn't have to wait very long,
but now we have kind of like, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: glass, uh, you know, as far as,
uh, this is really, really close to finish
[SPEAKER_03]: biochar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's good enough, um, at this
point for what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am going to drop this in a bowl and,
uh, we will,
[SPEAKER_03]: we will go ahead and begin with our water
soluble potassium biochar process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll, I'll show you making up
some more.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were starting from the beginning
with, uh, with this here, let me go ahead
[SPEAKER_03]: and drop this down so you guys can see
what we're working on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe I'm going to move a little bit
away from our fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are we looking?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you see the Dutch oven?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we finished our biochar of our
material.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, in this case right now, this first
round we used, um, sunflower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, next round, what we're going to use is
black sesame stock, which we'll show you
[SPEAKER_03]: in a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a difference between the dark
sesame and the white sesame plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll look at that Duke university
accumulator list you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beautiful patina's on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
Ooh.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me drop it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch that fall apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you see that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is completely charred.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, at this point, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, if I drop that on the
ground, that'll just turn into a hundred
[SPEAKER_03]: pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's, it's not, it doesn't have those,
um, organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holding together, um, it's structure
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've kind of, we've charred those off and
we're left kind of with the plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, minerals, if you will,
um, not caught up in organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we want because that's
what's we're easily extracting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I gotta be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of heat in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I have it open and exposed to the
air, I'm going to start turning to ash,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I need to be careful with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to throw this in here to
cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll throw a lid over it or a cover,
um, so that I don't melt my, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: my bag with hot biochar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll make, we'll make a fresh,
fresh batch here, um, using the sesame
[SPEAKER_03]: stalks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll come back to my cooled
biochar and make some WSK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that the, the conductivity of
char helps with the, helps with this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular process?
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're, we're, we're so conductivity kind
of mineral.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, uh, I was just talking to
Steve Reisner over at Potent Ponics last
[SPEAKER_03]: night and he would take, uh, he,
you know, he's, he's demonstrating,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, a, uh, fileting of a fish and he'd
take that filet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, when he's done, he'd take a rag,
um, you know, freshly caught, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: tilapia or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'd take a rag soaked in a high saline
solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: He washed his hands with it and he'd lay
it on the filet in front of a big group
[SPEAKER_03]: of, uh, people he's demonstrating for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the filet would start to jump,
uh, this, you know, totally, totally
[SPEAKER_03]: boneless, skinless filet would start to
jump on the table and just freak everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just, uh, kind of that,
that natural reality of, uh, conductivity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and so, so I need to cover this,
um, or as it cools, I'll get some ash and
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to kind of avoid that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to go ahead and throw
something on this to cover it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I didn't think of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me see what I got.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try that experiment with a
fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want that Frankenstein.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so nerdy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did, I did share this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I shared this earlier, but I wanted
to, like, I just read just like 10 minutes
[SPEAKER_01]: before we came on a billion trillion
electrons can be stored and exchanged in a
[SPEAKER_01]: single gram of biochar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: A billion trillion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are not useful facts, useless facts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are important to understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how nature works.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what to do with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't either.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just means it's pretty active.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the fish dumping said it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to just drop this in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, I have my clippers to make sure it
all fits, but I think most of it's already
[SPEAKER_03]: the size.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, a friend at, at flavor kit on
Instagram gave me her black sesame stocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not grow these.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Labor kit at flavor kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's in the flavor kit.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's in the things that, uh, that grow
and, uh, talks about them on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you can make this with fresh green
material or dried material.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, fresh green material will just take a
little longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, if, if somebody asked me,
which is better, I would probably say
[SPEAKER_03]: drying your material is, is a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, if you can, you know, keep it nice
while you're drying it, you don't want it
[SPEAKER_03]: to degrade, you know, a rock or anything
like that while you're drying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as long as you can dry, um,
properly, you know, hanging something in a
[SPEAKER_03]: cool dark place is a good way to dry it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, if you, if you can't,
if you don't have good control for drying
[SPEAKER_03]: something and go ahead and use it fresh,
um, and that will work as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Chris.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm learning some, I'm learning something
about IG live right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, I guess we only have an,
I guess I only have an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one minute and 30 seconds
remaining.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, well, what we can do is we can,
we can pause right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, tell everybody you're going to restart
and start right back up if you'd like to.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, go ahead and drop it and I'll
follow you as soon as I see you go live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come back, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to show you how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
Bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess there's an hour to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you're coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to follow me soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good info, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we're learning so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so, this is what happens when we get
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we share information and we learn so
much more than we thought we knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You over guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means you're, you're, you're trusting
the process and you're here to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're here to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Hey, so, uh, in this world of,
of negative news and craziness,
[SPEAKER_03]: where are you finding your humor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Me or in general?
[SPEAKER_03]: In general, you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I feel like I was born for this
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I call it the great pause
because I feel like we've been given this
[SPEAKER_01]: time to like just re renegotiate our
relationship with our world and with each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also like an optimist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I just never stopped being hopeful
and I'm in love with life and I'm in love
[SPEAKER_01]: with nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dude, it's like just to see the
animals taken up being affected in such a
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me happy when the skies are blue
and you know, heck yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've gotten to stay home a little bit,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gotten to stay home some.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, my, my current, uh, comedy source is,
uh, an Instagram, uh, um, page called,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, neat dads at neat dads.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically a endless series of dad
jokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neat as in any AT like, like what dads
usually aren't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, or what dads think they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, oh, like neat dads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get you.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jumping in here with, uh, our material.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just filled it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you can pack it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can fill this to the brim and fill
every slot totally, or we can fill it
[SPEAKER_03]: loosely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's up to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, packing it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, in that you get the maximum kind of,
um, accomplished with your, with your fire
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, however you want to do it,
but pack it or loose, um, wet material or
[SPEAKER_03]: dry either way works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, how much you make doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's how you mix the ratio of water and,
um, your finished material that does
[SPEAKER_03]: matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to do that right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our biochar from sunflowers cooling,
and we're going to throw this on the fire
[SPEAKER_03]: just to show you, you know, step one.
[SPEAKER_03]: One to zero or step one to finished with,
um, making biochar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So bring this over, throw it on the fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might need to stoke my fire a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you need to stoke my fire?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a touch here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to grow sesame for the first
time this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why, why sesame?
[SPEAKER_03]: What, uh, what benefit or reason?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going to do for this reason?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, yeah, but also to eat cause I
just love sesame.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to just play with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also growing sweet potatoes to try to
work with the sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make IMOs using sweet potato.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we do that in Hawaii some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: We played, yeah, we played with sweet
potato.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, we put it through a wood
chipper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then dry it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was drying the whole potato over my
stove and, uh, I thought next time I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to, I'll see you chop it up fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chop it up fresh and then lay it out on a
screen, um, to dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not cooking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you totally can cook it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would, that would be maybe
even better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think it converts to sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally positive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, however, you know, uh, if you're
making a lot of material, that's a lot to
[SPEAKER_03]: cook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're usually making a hundred pound,
200 pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have the, you know, stuff when
cooking, you know, a slot for pigs or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever we can cook potatoes,
but you're still, um, it's a lot of work
[SPEAKER_03]: to cook that much material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see me just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, our biochar has cooled so I can
handle it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, this is how well can you see this?
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty shiny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so just, I mean, I could literally
crush this into powder with no effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's completely charred and black all the
way through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get this cool, shiny patina.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just a little bit of the,
kind of organic, um, uh, oils and,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, compounds left behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, yeah, really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, um, neat to have this, what was
solid kind of material just fall apart in
[SPEAKER_03]: your hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, uh, a really finished biochar is
ideal for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I have my, my teabag structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go ahead and, uh,
hopefully none of this is hot,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'll be adding water to it
immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, no, it's cooled pretty nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, otherwise I'd hurt my, um,
container here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to make a gallon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a 10th of a gallon by volume is
about what I want for charcoal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is about right.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of the target amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got about a softball here of material
in my bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi sister.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now what we're going to do,
I'm just making tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, clean, you know, cold water.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a little bit of chlorine,
I probably wouldn't even be that worried
[SPEAKER_03]: about it because we're not, um,
dealing with microbes here and chloramine
[SPEAKER_03]: actually, or chlorine actually occurs in
nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, helps to, to, um, actually make
available nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's an interesting thing in the
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put it in our, our water and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not good, but, uh, in general,
it's not an evil thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a part of, um, our soil naturally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I would probably want to avoid
chloramine, um, to negate chloramine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can add humic acid, but that's not
really helpful in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I am just going to go ahead and
pour in my water over my tea bag here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to cover this, um, just to keep
critters out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need to seal it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can, it's going to be a breathable lid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I want to keep, um, critters from
messing with my material.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now what I'm dealing with, let's see if
I can switch you up for light purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm dealing with is a container full
of water with a tea bag full of biochar,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, made with, um, sunflower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to let this sit for seven to
10 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then I pull off my tea bag and I
have my water soluble potassium.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on the shelf, uh, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you use it at a rate of one to a
thousand, um, when applying and you can
[SPEAKER_03]: add it into your maintenance solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, or, uh, you know, you can,
you can add it in even at a rate of one to
[SPEAKER_03]: 2000, um, in something like, uh,
you know, vegetative growth formula,
[SPEAKER_03]: which would be maintenance solution plus
fish amino acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can bring some of this in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it can be included in pretty much any
of your, um, applications as you need it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really easy to make, um, if you have
the tools and, um, definitely easy to use,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, as it's just, uh, sprayed on,
um, in foliar manner.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to set that on the shelf and
I come back to it, um, in about a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you have questions on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is it that same pretty
straightforward?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you going to keep it at one to a
thousand all the way through and flower?
[SPEAKER_03]: Generally in use, I'm going to keep it at
one to a thousand or one to 2000,
[SPEAKER_03]: meaning a lighter, even a lighter dilution
or a diluting it more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you just bringing it in somewhat
regularly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't need a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, um, easily taken up through the,
um, the leaf tissue itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crazy simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now my biochar is going and this
will probably take, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: dry material like this will probably take
a good 15, 20 minutes to fully,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, make biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're having people ask about other
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard of anyone using biochar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using banana peel or biochar and
banana peel for these, for the potassium?
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't and I don't know what the
potassium content of it by a banana peel
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I will take this opportunity to
discourage people as I, as much as I can
[SPEAKER_03]: from using bananas from the store to make
your FPJ, um, especially if they're full
[SPEAKER_03]: of pesticides, et cetera, from the
typical, um, banana creations in the world
[SPEAKER_03]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't go to the store and buy your
gnarly banana and use it on your favorite
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, you could try banana peels.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know offhand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't, I, the one, the reason I gave
you, um, asparagus and sunflower is it's
[SPEAKER_03]: at the absolute highest in the accumulator
category for potassium.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are, we're talking way higher
than, uh, things you typically think that
[SPEAKER_03]: have potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Alaska grows sunflowers in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody's asking if they can use bananas
in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Use organic bananas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, uh, if, if that's all you can get,
you know, ultimately you got to use what
[SPEAKER_03]: you can get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, so I'm not going to, you know,
throw stones at you doing the best you
[SPEAKER_03]: can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I can't speak to bananas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd have to go look it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were just some questions there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I almost feel like some people are
concerned with the fact that we're,
[SPEAKER_01]: we need to start utilizing our waste
stream if we can't stop eating bananas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then perhaps there's a use for the waste
stream of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I'm going to hear it on that
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if, if I had an option between
sunflower and asparagus at the end of its
[SPEAKER_01]: season or bananas, I would definitely go
with the sunflower, asparagus or sesame.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that we can, we can look it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That, that sheet we talked about on,
um, aquaponics grower, uh, aquaponic
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis growers, um, at the page on
Facebook and they have a, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: files, uh, section and you can find by
Duke university, uh, file on accumulators
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can look up something that you
have in your area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, uh, that's, that's potassium rich if
you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm growing up tobacco and tobacco
stem and I'm using a tobacco FPJ and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: using the vinegar after the FPJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really, I don't know what the
call, I don't know the compounds that make
[SPEAKER_01]: it such a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to correct myself real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tobacco, tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've totally, I just mixed up my things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tobacco is, um, is the potassium source
typically taught in three and natural
[SPEAKER_03]: farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm showing you sesame, which is a typical
straight phosphorus source.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, sesame is a phosphorus accumulator.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, um, uh, yeah, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah, so yeah, so tobacco stems would
be excellent as your potassium source.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, yeah, so far with Sesame,
um, for phosphorus, uh, so tobacco would
[SPEAKER_03]: be an excellent potassium source.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sesame for phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we would not knit then typically when
we use bones to make a phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_03]: we got to use a calcium phosphate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, with, with Sesame, we're, we're going
for a straight kind of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so you do it the same way,
char it and then soak it in water,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, for, for a phosphorus nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad we got there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, since people are joining and
maybe some new people have joined,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure everyone understands
that you're doing another presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This afternoon, uh, with the future
cannabis, the future cannabis project,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, is it YouTube or Facebook?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can check them out at the future
cannabis project.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think.com and, um, yeah,
it might, it'd be probably be an
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, as you know, some, some people,
um, they're, you know, question,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, the advocacy of, of green natural
farming and, um, you know, and I think
[SPEAKER_03]: that's healthy to have those kind of
discussions on, you know, what do you see
[SPEAKER_03]: in, in your, your attempts to,
you know, promote a regenerative,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, uh, agricultural society and,
um, and how do they differ?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that'll be some of what we get into
you over there today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all in, all in love and, uh,
yeah, should be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to, uh, walk around a little
bit and look at, uh, FPGA materials?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's now, it's a now thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a now time to be doing these FPGAs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what don't you want to use for an FPGA?
[SPEAKER_03]: We covered it a little before,
but you don't want to use, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: conventional produce that you're buying at
your typical store, even organic produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically bleach washed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, even if it is organic or they're able
to bleach wash it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so you don't have any of your
indigenous, um, microbes or the things
[SPEAKER_03]: that typically are found on that plant to
ferment itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so you'll typically get some weird,
um, growths and strength of blooms of
[SPEAKER_03]: green stuff as whatever's in the air is
trying to digest this forest and subject
[SPEAKER_03]: or item.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be losing, you might lose
connection as you're, as you're traveling
[SPEAKER_01]: outwardly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I jumped off of, uh, I jumped off of wifi.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was walking away from the wifi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you know, if, if you don't have a
plants, you know, indigenous microbes that
[SPEAKER_03]: live on that plant and grow with it,
um, you'll be, you'll be relying on
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever's in your air, whatever was on
the hand of the grocer or the 10 people
[SPEAKER_03]: that touched that banana before you,
those microbes are what you're going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: relying on to ferment your, um,
FPGA rather than if something still has
[SPEAKER_03]: its microbes present, it can ferment
itself, um, in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just discouraged from store bought,
even if you live in a city, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: short travel once a year, um, just outside
to find a place where some great,
[SPEAKER_03]: healthy weeds grow abundantly would be
great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, another thing not to use is poisonous
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you're going to be consuming this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's an example of a poisonous plant
growing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody know what this is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's clean and lace.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this, this is pretty toxic and
would make a terrible FPGA because I
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't want to be introducing those to
the veggies.
[SPEAKER_03]: My kids are going to eat and, um,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely don't want highly poisonous
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another, uh, thing you would be,
um, only have to learn once and you might
[SPEAKER_03]: not survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be to use like a poison oak or
poison ivy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd probably die.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, as, as that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, can I tell, can I tell a tobacco
story?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I do use tobacco FPGA, but I think I
am only going to use it in drench.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to use it as a foliar
because I decided to start eating some of
[SPEAKER_01]: my FPGAs on a demonstration to some,
uh, young horticulture students.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a minute amount of the tobacco
FPGA.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't affect me right away,
but I woke up the next morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I got up to walk out of bed,
I was walking in a different direction
[SPEAKER_01]: than where I was looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I literally had to focus somewhere else
to walk the straight line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a neurological effect that is quite
profound and lasts for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hemlock poison hemlock.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it might be synonymous with clean
hands lace, but it is hemlock.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always, I think call it clean hands
lace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so what are good things to use?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love comfrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's asking about comfrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comfrey is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Comfrey is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are dandelions.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just a side pasture.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't cultivate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'm in a new property.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dandelions are amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys, the leaves, the new growing
tips, all amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I have this other plant here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's prolific weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's not toxic is animals can eat
it readily.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have the identification,
but this stuff is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bees love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no, no bug pressure and, um,
it grows abundantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: The key is if something is growing
abundantly without care, um, it is so good
[SPEAKER_03]: at accumulating nutrients from your soil
in your area that it's going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrient rich.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you start using, um, you know,
things just because you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I know that tastes good, but it
struggles in your area or it's anemic that
[SPEAKER_03]: the nutrient density in that tissue is
going to be actually less than just some
[SPEAKER_03]: weed that you think nothing about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, fine, fine thing in your area
that are abundant and thriving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we have this big patch of dock,
which is an edible weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, uh, I'll be using.
[SPEAKER_03]: FBJ, um, and I mean dandelion dog and a
few other things to make FBJ actually
[SPEAKER_03]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question about the dandelions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at Dawn, the dandelion flowers are not
open.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you think that there's a different
mechanism at work when it comes to like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, the undifferentiated stuff that
you're trying to harvest hormones and
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymes as a different in a flower that's
not opening it at Dawn or do we harvest it
[SPEAKER_01]: at a different time?
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, um, always at Dawn and it'll be,
um, they're, they're accumulating
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients and, and processes and
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: They accumulated through photosynthesis
the day before and they're not,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, they're not working hard to regulate
their temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they, they, you know, at the end of the
day, we're tired, uh, plants the same way
[SPEAKER_03]: at the end of the day, they're tired from
photosynthesis and that big engine they're
[SPEAKER_03]: running and then regulating their
temperature early in the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've taken all this rest time to kind
of process all their nutrients and store
[SPEAKER_03]: them, um, for into their growing tips for
new growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, uh, I have one in Hawaii,
but this is my new toy for Boise.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been missing my cement makers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll be making my FBJ in this tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of FBJ.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll only make it once.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just encourage people,
you know, you don't have to make new stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, make it once for a year and
you're, you're done making stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, as fun as it is to make this stuff,
it's not really the point of natural
[SPEAKER_03]: farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: The point is, um, productive, um,
crops with a low amount of, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: effort as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I had an experience, how close to
harvesting plants should you be making the
[SPEAKER_01]: FBJ?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I, last year I did, I would go out
and harvest as much as I can and then
[SPEAKER_01]: spend part of the day processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year I'm gathering smaller amounts
and processing it almost immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a difference in quality when you
do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, I mean, ideally you do want to
process it ASAP.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, having stuff like a cement
mixer and some other things they use to
[SPEAKER_03]: process quickly, um, can be huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can get a big batch done first thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, as best you can,
if it takes you a few hours to chop
[SPEAKER_03]: everything, um, but you got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you still have, you know, those
nutrients aren't flowing back down or,
[SPEAKER_03]: or leaving those root tips, you still have
them there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so we're, we're kind of hopeful
that that's, um, we're not losing a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: lot in the processing time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a data driven answer on that
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's, let's do a quick peek and see how
charred we are so far on this,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, material.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just put this on what?
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to burn my bench here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're, we're a good way on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to put that on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right away, just by taking that off
because of the heat, I started ashing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've lost some of my material by
checking that, um, because of the heat,
[SPEAKER_03]: as soon as I exposed it to oxygen,
right away in the center, you might not
[SPEAKER_03]: have been able to see it, but,
um, ash started forming and, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: I started losing material quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, um, it's a, it's a really
important balance between oxygen,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, in this process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to make sure that lid stays on
nicely, um, so that the, um, material
[SPEAKER_03]: cooks outside of an oxygen rich
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a different quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: Quality and biocharts depending on your
region?
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quality of processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how long can FPGA be stored typically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and I know it depends on how you
handle it and how you make it initially,
[SPEAKER_01]: but is there a decline in quality over
time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I, I typically tell people to,
to make it, um, for, for six months
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's absolutely safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, however, if somebody's storing their,
um, material in, you know, in the sun,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, in a hot environment or don't have a
good cover on it, you can cause FPGA to
[SPEAKER_03]: deteriorate just from poor storage
technique.
[SPEAKER_03]: So finding a concrete floor in a cool,
dark room, um, your, your FPGA will last
[SPEAKER_03]: for a good year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I've, I have some that you know,
it just was processed properly and,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, stored nicely and, um, it's good five
years later.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, some, sometimes, um, stored
improperly or maybe too much moisture or
[SPEAKER_03]: too little moisture, um, FPGA can
accumulate moisture and then go off,
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of start getting, uh, towards
alcohols and vinegars or too little
[SPEAKER_03]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: FPGA can start to evaporate or lose
moisture and get very much like a,
[SPEAKER_03]: a syrup or even not syrup, more like a
taffy, you know, where it just,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's so thick and you'd have to re-add,
um, uh, water to even, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it comes out like a, like a goo.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hold it and slowly drip it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just a running out of water in
a dry environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it kind of depends on the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Hawaii, um, it would be typical that
things would accumulate moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Idaho, it's typical that things,
um, run out of moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So same thing with IMO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm spritzing my IMO2 in Idaho to keep it
from overly drying out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to do that with your IMOs too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to let them dry out either.
[SPEAKER_01]: IMO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you spray WCA and W calcium phos
until two weeks before chalk?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying that you should,
but could you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything microbial is a no.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I assume you're talking about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, what I have, um, experienced,
um, in, in interacting with just great
[SPEAKER_03]: growers, um, is the kind of absorption
qualities that some of your, your,
[SPEAKER_03]: your plant has.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, so what you want to be aware of
is anything that could affect flavor,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially if you're, you're going down to
an isolate or some sort of, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: after market processing or after chop
processing, um, if the flavor of the
[SPEAKER_03]: vinegar or the flavor of the kind of
calcium phosphate were to affect your
[SPEAKER_03]: quality, that would be a huge no-no.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, um, you need to be careful,
um, spraying on the leaves right before
[SPEAKER_03]: you're harvesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and even in the, in the flowering
process that you don't negatively affect
[SPEAKER_03]: the flavor, however, a lot of these
nutrients can, um, be taken up in the root
[SPEAKER_03]: zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can take the same principle,
the same application rate and put it in
[SPEAKER_03]: your watering system, um, so that you're
getting this, this feed, but not putting
[SPEAKER_03]: it directly on those, those nodules of
oils and all, um, flavor that will absorb
[SPEAKER_03]: it and potentially affect the flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it going through the root system and
going up to the plant will have a
[SPEAKER_03]: drastically different effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It won't, it won't have such a,
um, kind of lasting flavor effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Caution to you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually do foliar up until about five
weeks into flower and then I go to drench.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I handle it personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And other, other growers only do foliar in
vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once they get into flower,
they only do drench.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and other growers I've talked to,
you know, don't think it affects labor at
[SPEAKER_03]: all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I am not, I have to beg ignorance on
that all because I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't tested it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And side by sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just briefly mention the importance
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how we going to grow as a community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, question about fermented seawater.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fermented seawater is already diluted when
you made it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, yeah, you, you can go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: So seawater is diluted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a one to 30 seawater,
a one to 700 LAB and a one to maybe 300
[SPEAKER_03]: FBJ.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, that those are already diluted
quantities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can apply it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also cut it 50% or more if you
want it to kind of spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you for, I thank you for your
time, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for taking, you're so generous
with your time and your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pleasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cool to talk with you on all this and
all the work you've done to kind of put
[SPEAKER_03]: this into practice and share it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just, yeah, he's got a class coming up
in August, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's nothing like a hands on,
make sure you're tuning into, he's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be speaking again at two with the
YouTube cannabis project on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want more of Chris, make sure
you, you join that and anything else we
[SPEAKER_01]: should add.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we just call it good?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that, I think that was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we got to talk about all kinds of
good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went ahead and pulled my sesame
stalks off the fire, but I'll leave them
[SPEAKER_03]: closed to cool so that I don't get ashing,
um, as it, uh, finishes, but we'll get,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, get a bit more charcoal.
[SPEAKER_03]: charcoal being made as it just sits in
this super hot pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I don't want to lift it before it
cools unless I could cool it quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, because I'm not going to add this
to water right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to leave it in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this, you see that beautiful kind
of patina color that's happening in the
[SPEAKER_03]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, you know, kind of our,
our nutrient, our mineral in there,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, diffusing into our water column.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Darkened over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll continue to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And seven days on that, just like every
other application.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven to 10, you know, um, yeah,
you don't want to pull it crazy early,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if you go a day or two over,
it's not the end of the world,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you don't want to leave it in there
for a month.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get some really weird things
happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but just stuff growing and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to talk to you, Tina.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep up the good work and, uh,
yeah, cool to see how you continue to play
[SPEAKER_03]: with all of this and, and enjoy the
journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a fun community to be a part
of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just great to have you at the
helm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's you're a brilliant teacher and I
just, you know, I learn a lot from you
[SPEAKER_01]: every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, until next time then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
