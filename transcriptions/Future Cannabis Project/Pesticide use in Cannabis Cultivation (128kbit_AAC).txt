[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I'm up and down all these
mountains, all these ridges like daily,
[SPEAKER_02]: picking up truckloads of trim,
throwing it in the back of my truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: From guys that like don't spray.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They just don't, they're like,
we don't spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, you know, we had some neem oil in the
base form of veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: We moved to trifecta, you know what I'm
saying, or we moved to venerate or we
[SPEAKER_02]: moved to big time exterminator.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all the clean, you know,
all the clean pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't, or we have garlic clove oil or
whatever it is that they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden you have people
that are saying, oh no, you're just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're 500 pounds, you should give it just
a test of dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these guys are like, no, I swear to
God.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then, and then you're like,
oh shit, but I bought my clone from Kyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it, and it even goes further than that
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause so many times whenever a person
that's sourcing tram it to make it into
[SPEAKER_01]: extract, they themselves with their dirty
machine or what are getting the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so they'll like, you know,
you know, run them, run a, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this material from this organic farmer
who's never sprayed or who, who may have,
[SPEAKER_01]: if anything, got a dirty clone,
but it wouldn't show up in really that
[SPEAKER_01]: substantial amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was grown full term outdoor,
the UV broke down the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, by that time you go,
you wouldn't really see it in big amounts
[SPEAKER_01]: where most people are seeing big amounts
of pesticides come through is because they
[SPEAKER_01]: have dirty extractors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, cause whether you're doing closed
loop, like like hard carbon, butane
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction, or you're recycling and
recirculating solvents, whether you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing like CO2 extraction where you have
this closed loop machine or distillation
[SPEAKER_01]: to further purify.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the place where the highest amount
of cross contamination pesticides is
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so, you know, organic good farmers
are almost getting pulled into you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this dirty process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's like, by the time somebody
that's making extract sources,
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of trim and then concentrates it,
they don't know if the pesticide that's in
[SPEAKER_01]: there is from the farmer or from the dudes
that they ran right before and they didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: clean their machine out or they didn't
change the gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's where that urine system would
come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, but have it applied
to like drift of culture to you,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, you know,
like how practices drifted, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and how clones drifted, not just,
cause not all of us have broadcast ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've never seen a crop duster on
my mountain, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but well, I've known it's just,
I would be shocked if like my neighbor
[SPEAKER_02]: hired a crop duster to come through and do
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not going to get that type of
drift, you know, which speaks volumes,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Appalachian aspects about what what's
happening to and how certain green belt
[SPEAKER_01]: green revolution, like areas of California
that have been so beat up and oversprayed
[SPEAKER_01]: are almost going to not necessarily be the
most beneficial places to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I go into moving into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially now that the flower market
is dying, the, you know, the oil market is
[SPEAKER_02]: emerging.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we need to have a unified parts
per billion, parts per trillion,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever the testing is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: The URIC is what's the acronym?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So URIC, U-R-E-C, it was, it was an
acronym created by the national organic
[SPEAKER_01]: program to account for the fact that we
live in a toxic environment and certain
[SPEAKER_01]: areas, there's drift and, and that's
unavoidable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's unavoidable residual
environmental contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a, and it's an exemption
basically that the national organic
[SPEAKER_01]: program allows organic certified crops to
still pass into the marketplace as
[SPEAKER_01]: organic, as long as, as less than 5% of
the EPA allowed level of pesticide for
[SPEAKER_01]: that same crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though this is organic and you
can't use pesticides because of drift,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, say for something like
myclobutanol or Eagle 20, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: commonly approved for grapes and berries,
you know, if you're organic certified,
[SPEAKER_01]: great berry farmer, you know, and you
know, there's the very real reality that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's a drift happens and it can,
you know, if one, if your neighboring
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer sprays and there's wind and carries
over to your farm, you still have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to do, be able to work and do what
you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so to your point, I think it's
such a big one, you know, cause,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause, you know, from testing standpoint,
we, you know, there's never, there's never
[SPEAKER_01]: been any States that put in any,
you know, proposed limits for these
[SPEAKER_01]: different pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we just, when we started
testing, you know, back in 2010,
[SPEAKER_01]: we knew that, you know, there's these
specific compounds people were using and
[SPEAKER_01]: they needed to be tested for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not testing for these
specific pesticides and miticides and
[SPEAKER_01]: fungicides, then you're kind of not
really, you know, offering much to
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody that you'd selling pesticide
testing to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so then all of a sudden Oregon
came in and took the list, expanded the
[SPEAKER_01]: list, and then they created proposed
limits that will disqualify somebody if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's above this certain limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Oregon's limits, we thought were the
strictest had that had ever come about all
[SPEAKER_01]: of a sudden caliphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: California in that emergency bill that was
just passed where they, they put out
[SPEAKER_01]: proposed limits and they went basically 20
times stricter in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Oregon, where Michael Beaton,
all Eagle 20 is regulated at 0.2 PPM,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is 200 part per billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: California went to regulate it to 10 part
per billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 0.01.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about 20 time more sensitive amount,
you know, so, so just to clarify here,
[SPEAKER_00]: did Oregon sort of look at general
agricultural best practices and can you
[SPEAKER_00]: just sort of touch on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Oregon, the way they,
they, they looked at all the compounds on
[SPEAKER_01]: the list, you know, they looked at their,
you know, they did a lot of research into
[SPEAKER_01]: the toxicology data of the different
pesticides and compounds and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: how they interact with aquatic life and,
you know, all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they, they rated them on these
levels of like most concerning to least
[SPEAKER_01]: concerning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, they kind of,
they, they, they arbitrarily created the
[SPEAKER_01]: limit, the action limits more based on the
labs up in Oregon ability to pick up at
[SPEAKER_01]: those certain amounts more than,
you know, anything else is really
[SPEAKER_01]: substantial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so California kind of went way in
the other direction and went stricter than
[SPEAKER_01]: you could have ever gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's very problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like from our perspective,
a lot of the regulations around
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiology, I think they nailed it on
because they didn't regulate or they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they took off things like aerobic bacteria
and yeast and mold levels from being
[SPEAKER_01]: disqualifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they more focused on the pathogenic,
bad, harmful microbes like certain
[SPEAKER_01]: aspergillus that produce micro toxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we think they did really good with like
certain other testing regulations,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with pesticides, they went way too
far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anything, we're trying to lobby to
have the state recognize that there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: happy medium, you know, where you,
you know, if you create a zero tolerance
[SPEAKER_01]: policy, which essentially did having each
pesticide regulated at 10 to 20 per per
[SPEAKER_01]: billion, which is such small, I mean,
residue amount, you know, all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to make it almost impossible
to grow herb in certain geographic areas
[SPEAKER_01]: where there's a lot of high ag you know,
because, you know, if they don't account
[SPEAKER_01]: for and allow for this drift reality,
you know, by, by, by almost elevating the
[SPEAKER_01]: limits of from 10 part per billion to
maybe 50, 80 part per billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, then what they're going to
do is they're going to create too strict
[SPEAKER_01]: of a system.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to put too many farmers,
you know, essentially out of business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, you know, I would,
I would argue though, to say that we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have that drift issue where we've been
farming for decades and that the drift
[SPEAKER_02]: issue is happening in areas where they
probably shouldn't be growing anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: You shouldn't be growing anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, so if they lose out,
like I'm not going to, I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: shed a tear.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, honestly, cause I'm, I'm very,
the pesticide topic is where I have most
[SPEAKER_01]: passion and, and, you know, cause before
we opened up the SC labs, I worked with
[SPEAKER_01]: them, the hydroponic industry,
and I, I did a lot of kind of consulting
[SPEAKER_01]: ongoing consulting around integrated pest
management and how to properly get rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: and prevent pests and pathology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, people always you know,
whatever are busy, don't do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't follow the protocols.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have other people taking care of
their plants, you know, and then they get
[SPEAKER_01]: in an infestive moment where they have
this huge outbreak of bugs or huge
[SPEAKER_01]: outbreak of like powdery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it puts them into this
unscrupulous, you know, space where
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll spray or what have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't really have a whole lot of,
you know, I mean, I think, I think in this
[SPEAKER_01]: new brave new world of cannabis,
I think it's only the most organic,
[SPEAKER_01]: fully intentionally farming kind of folks
that are going to really make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's like, if you haven't,
if you haven't gotten hit by broad mites,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you haven't gotten like, I mean,
the, the, the time where people can get
[SPEAKER_01]: away with spring systemics is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's like, if you're, you're in a
certain area where there's drift,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're almost even like, you know,
I think, I think I'm like stoked that
[SPEAKER_02]: that's happening, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That we're, you know, that we're getting
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really setting a benchmark for
quality and for standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, yeah, some, some,
and somewhat unobtainable, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: by, you know, by in some regions,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: In our region, like I'm saying,
you know, if it, well, we do have an
[SPEAKER_02]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us where you're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm growing in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the issues that I have in
Mendocino now though is, is those
[SPEAKER_02]: systemics being sprayed on moms,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's, that's the main cause or
people thinking that they can spray
[SPEAKER_02]: systemics and veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't throw it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't do it in flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, Nope, your shit's dirty,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's, that's really where we
get into this place.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, we're seeing this,
we're not seeing, and we're seeing stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: go from one lab to another, to another and
testing positive and testing negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've been, yeah, I've been on such a
roller coaster ride on my phone in the
[SPEAKER_02]: last like three days with stuff that's
getting batch tested and like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it didn't pass here, but it passed
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wait, hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody kicked this back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wait, no, wait, they're going to put it
through over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, so the Kansas is like a
pinball going between all these different
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got a guy with a transit van
basically sitting on like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: one-on-one traffic, you know, in 580
getting shit between Oakland's and Rosa,
[SPEAKER_02]: like all these Sonoma, you know,
getting all these things like to different
[SPEAKER_02]: places that are saying, Oh no,
we'll take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's nothing, there's no,
there's no, there's no unification.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like in those standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, and I think that's going
to be also one of the greatest things
[SPEAKER_01]: about regulation because you know,
if, if there's going to be a robust
[SPEAKER_01]: process of regulating how cannabis is
grown and how it's processed and produced,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there almost has to be,
and California learned this and Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: learned this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to almost hold the labs to a
higher level of accountability than even
[SPEAKER_01]: the producers and processors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so what California did and what
Oregon did is they required in order for
[SPEAKER_01]: lab to even operate or to have their
services offered available to the
[SPEAKER_01]: community and the public, they have to
have gone through full ISO accreditation,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just on their lab, but on every
individual test they offer to the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then further, they have to go through
routine quarterly proficiency testing
[SPEAKER_01]: where the state gives you a spiked,
you know, solution with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: different pesticides in it or a bunch of
different terpenes or cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to be able to pick up in this
blank, you know, in this, in this
[SPEAKER_01]: completely unknown mixture, you have to be
able to pick out at the levels that the
[SPEAKER_01]: states can be requiring to show that you
can even do that level of testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that, that's the prerequisite that
labs are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I think, you know, your
frustration, I think is one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: frustrations in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, how do you know who's correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, you send your samples
to all these different labs and all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different labs have the results,
but it's like, the lab testing is a really
[SPEAKER_01]: complex thing because it's like,
is, you know, how old is the mass
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrometer being used to test or pick up
pesticides?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, if it's 10 years old,
it might be picking it up at 10 part per
[SPEAKER_01]: million, you know, as opposed to some of
the newer instrumentation that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it picks up at, you know,
two to two part per billion level,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and, and, and then, you know,
it's, and then I think, I think it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a, the way that you can figure it out
is, you know, as, as a client of lab
[SPEAKER_01]: services, you know, it's like,
you can do a bunch of blind testing on
[SPEAKER_01]: lab, you know, cause if you, you know,
I think you're setting yourself up for
[SPEAKER_01]: failure almost by testing with a bunch of
different labs and expecting the results
[SPEAKER_01]: to ever kind of really come online.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you can do a bunch of testing
internally with each lab, sending,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the same samples labeled many
different things tested, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: over a period of few weeks, you know,
you can start to see where and how often
[SPEAKER_01]: the lab hits the bullseye, you know,
and I, and I think it's a really important
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, you know, in this lead up to
regulation while, you know, people are
[SPEAKER_01]: choosing which lab works and what lab is
consistent and repeatable and precise,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cause unfortunately at this
moment, there's not a lab, not a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: labs that are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, so I think that's a good,
you know, a big problem that's going to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, majorly get alleviated with
regulation because, you know, labs are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be held to an account that
they've never had to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: most labs in the United States haven't had
to be held to that level of
[SPEAKER_01]: accountability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I think it'll help to make
apples to apples comparison among the
[SPEAKER_01]: labs, you know, but, but then the other
thing kind of was going to mention about
[SPEAKER_01]: just the pesticide thing and the
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the really interesting thing is
about pesticide residues, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause I used to work within the hydroponic
industry and there's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of common misinformation about,
you know, how long certain pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: residues would last residual in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, and a lot of really
good, you know, even, even, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to do the right thing type farmers,
you know, have in some way or another in
[SPEAKER_01]: the past, you know, kind of fallen victim
to getting an infestation in some way and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and we have resorted to using
systemic pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, I, I would wonder if you
ever have, you might not have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shows how that shows on the level
you're on, but, but what's really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting is, you know, there's always
been this con and misconception that
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide residues like Eagle 20 or
fluoramide or avid, you know, last like 30
[SPEAKER_01]: to 60 days and then they're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, just to kind of expand on
the complexity of the conversation,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, one of the biggest things that
breaks down pesticide residues,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether they're organic pesticide residues
or these systemic kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dow, Syngenta Bayer type pesticides,
you know, is the UV spectrum from the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like the UVA, BNC spectrum from
sungrown cannabis, from the exposure of
[SPEAKER_01]: sun to your plants is, is one of the most
major things that breaks down and
[SPEAKER_01]: determines how quick a residue breaks
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so, you know, whenever people are
talking about how long these pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: residues stick around in mom plants and in
clones that people are cutting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it, in so many ways it becomes,
it comes from people growing mothers
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor, you know, cause whenever you have
a mother plant that's indoor under high
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure sodium or metal halide lighting,
you know, most of the lighting up to this
[SPEAKER_01]: point that's indoor lighting is,
is void.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and absent of UVA, B or C,
you know, some of the newer indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: technology lighting like plasma lighting,
well, it's starting to bring in certain UV
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum, certain LEDs now are bringing in
certain UV spectrum, but largely most
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor, um, grown cannabis, um,
or lighting exposed to kind of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: growing indoor is, is lacking UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so therefore, you know, what we see at
the lab is, you know, it's incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: extended, uh, pesticide residues basically
on mothers, you know, ranging anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: from six months to a year after,
um, you know, is originally used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's getting a lot of people
in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there, there are sourcing phones from
these, you know, mother treated or these,
[SPEAKER_01]: these treated mothers that are grown
under, you know, indoor lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and so, so the residues that
might, uh, the residue that might kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: be broken down rapidly outdoor,
you know, kind of, if anything just stays
[SPEAKER_01]: that much longer indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and it's also, like I said,
you know, saying earlier, it's not just
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the farmer's practices, it's the
farmer's purchases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the farmer purchasing,
you know, plants or seeds start to like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, I need to do this run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what ends up happening is,
you know, we ended up having to get full
[SPEAKER_02]: batch testing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause let's say you have a greenhouse
filled with 250 plants and 50 of it came
[SPEAKER_02]: from your farm and 200 came from various
farms around the county or around the
[SPEAKER_02]: ridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, you have,
you're susceptible to whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the trim room, it all goes in the
trim rooms, all getting trimmed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all getting thrown in garbage bags,
all getting, you know, and sent down in
[SPEAKER_02]: one small, you know, one batch testing
positive for my butanol might contaminate
[SPEAKER_02]: your entire arm and kick your whole farm
out, you know, of a sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're like, so, you know, that's,
that's where our biggest issue is right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, how do we educate the
farmers?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, into separating the trim out
from each batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we, you know, you know,
if you're not sure that that clone is
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticide free, you know, like,
can we get the, can we get the tissue?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can even test the, like before you
commit also so much into growing those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants out, you know, like when you test
the leaf of a clone or what have you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's when you'll see pesticide
concentrations at the highest point.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be also if they've been treated,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's, I mean, what you're
describing though is in so many ways,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think regulation on cannabis,
particularly around pesticides,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, no crop has ever been regulated
as cannabis is about to be on pesticides
[SPEAKER_01]: as strict limits as pesticides and water
and water and everything, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's, it's so fascinating because,
you know, I really feel like it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: reinforce, you know, these, this,
you know, kind of slow food movement
[SPEAKER_01]: ideals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were talking about earlier of
like, you know, source control and
[SPEAKER_01]: identification of, you know, I mean,
knowing, knowing your farm, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: having the connection to where your clones
are coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having the connection to where you're
sourcing your compost, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, it's, you can no longer be
detached from these things, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: or just have faith that it's all going to
be good because, you know, it's organic,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cause and, and, you know,
even on the pesticide thing, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think regulations are really going to be
breeding and raising up such a new caliber
[SPEAKER_01]: and quality of farmer, you know,
that's, that is so precise on,
[SPEAKER_01]: on, you know, growing this medicine to the
perfect, perfect, you know, perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: ability of it self and, you know,
and, and I would wonder, have you,
[SPEAKER_01]: have you guys heard of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first, one of the first negative
things that's happened with cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated States.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called cannabis hyper emesis
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this really else is coming our way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh dude, it's really weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, well, it's, but it's,
it's a thing that's happening from
[SPEAKER_01]: improper organic farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so basically cannabis hyper emesis is
this it's so certain patients that will
[SPEAKER_01]: inhale or utilize cannabis will all of a
sudden have to go to the hospital from
[SPEAKER_01]: this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That they're calling like the cyclical
vomiting syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll just like throw up and they
can't stop throwing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the only things that can,
that can chill the, the, the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the reaction or whatever's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when they go to the hospital is like,
if they get, if they go into a hot shower
[SPEAKER_01]: or get exposed to hot water, you know,
that typically will mellow out some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these, the things that are happening from
this condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's really fascinating is all of
the specific, you know, kind of side
[SPEAKER_01]: effects that are happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: From, you know, from this, this condition
that people are attributing to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's this unknown in all these
States, identically mirror what's known in
[SPEAKER_01]: India as neem oil poisoning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so, so, so as a doctrine as a
doctrine is a concentrate off of neem oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's like a, it's an isolated
compound from neem oil that has some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the more insecticidal properties and it's
armory listed organic material review
[SPEAKER_01]: Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's labeled as, you know,
you're that you're able to spray it up to
[SPEAKER_01]: day of harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and we're not talking about a
leafy green here, you know, it's like you
[SPEAKER_01]: spray as a doctrine, like in the form of
as a saw or as a max, you can't use as a
[SPEAKER_01]: troll anymore because it just got pulled
off the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it was an organic listed,
it had like these four unlabeled
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides in it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a troll just got pulled off in
Oregon because it had like all these
[SPEAKER_01]: pyrethroids and like some other pesticides
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so there's organic chrysanthemum
pyrethroids, but then there's all these
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic pyrethroids also.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but you know, but then there was a
chemical called pylon in there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but anyway, you know, they're just,
I think that just kind of shows the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's great that pyganic is a
chrysanthemum extracted pyrethrin organic
[SPEAKER_01]: listed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's good, but you know,
it's like, you can use that at a time
[SPEAKER_01]: where it shows up still, you know,
but, but I think, you know, the big thing
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking about with neem oil is like,
you know, this new caliber farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, cause not only are you not
allowed to use the conventional systemic
[SPEAKER_01]: sprays that big farm has used,
big ag has used.
[SPEAKER_01]: To grow monocrop agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are no longer allowed to use those
because they're so regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might even see them if your neighbor
sprayed them.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so then you, as a farmer are only
able to use like these organic approaches
[SPEAKER_01]: towards keeping away pests and pathology,
which is just this whole body of awareness
[SPEAKER_01]: and integrated pest management that,
you know, I think is really what defines,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you know, everything you were
talking about the regenerative farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like looking to nature for a more
efficient design and creating and
[SPEAKER_01]: perfecting like the environment you give
it so that you can naturally keep it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's really what's going to
define the new farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also that you, you know, it's even
organic products.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use them properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You spray neem oil on the plants before
harvest, you know, you might actually do
[SPEAKER_01]: harm, you know, and, and, and this
cannabis hyper emesis things, no joke,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from an organic pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as we say neem and veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, neem and veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, but like I said,
there's so much of what it is that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing as regenerative farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a duty to, to, to create these
standards along the lines of regenerative
[SPEAKER_02]: farming practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there are all of these things
that are just seemingly unfair coming down
[SPEAKER_02]: from these regulated, you know,
regulatory agencies and these regulatory
[SPEAKER_02]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've never grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, it's kind of like this
mentality is like, Oh, they want to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them grow, but they have to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, Ooh, you know, the farmers
are running into these situations where we
[SPEAKER_02]: can't do everything it is that they're
asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you have to be realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we have to lobby the
regulators and, you know, the legislators
[SPEAKER_01]: to kind of do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I mean, you know, very much
detrimental on the entire community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give me some specifics of proposed
legislation that you're looking at and
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that's totally unfair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what, what are some of the specifics
that you disagree with and what would you
[SPEAKER_02]: like it to say instead as far as what I
see as a, as a weed hustler, you know what
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's had to shift from flower sales to
trim sales that it really sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's what the, what the guy on the other
side of me is able to do to go to
[SPEAKER_02]: different labs, to go to different things,
take all of my product, run all of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: offer me $15 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it tests positive or, you know,
it's like, it's, it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all they have to do is show me a test
result.
[SPEAKER_02]: God knows where that test result came
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can have the same test result for the
same dude that tested positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: And just ship it off to everyone else and
just, you know, cut, copy and paste
[SPEAKER_02]: negative test results.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know where farmers were like,
uh, damn a shit tested positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: What am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the regulations that I see in what
Alex was talking about earlier of being so
[SPEAKER_02]: stringent, being possibly 10 parts per
billion on, on, on, on residuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's, it's not just drift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, we're talking about being
cultural drift, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's like cultural drift syndrome
where, you know, just something happened,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether or not it's a little bit of PM,
whether or not, you know, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticide, whatever it is, like to be
regulated at that degree with,
[SPEAKER_02]: with very room, little room for,
I mean, if I take my stuff to go to a,
[SPEAKER_02]: to a refinement process, I'd lose half my
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half my crop, not half my crop,
but half of that sale will go down and
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll have to refine all of everything,
all the residuals out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I went from saying, Oh,
I'm going to make $10,000 off this loaded
[SPEAKER_02]: trim to $5,000 off this loaded trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and I've got to split that two ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, and that's going to be
split two ways on the other end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone's getting like 1200 bucks and
all because one lab tested positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the issues that I'm seeing
personally as a, as a distributor and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, and then I'll put a plug in for,
you know, for Appalachians of origin and a
[SPEAKER_02]: plug for Appalachians of origin is,
you know, we are going to strive to have
[SPEAKER_02]: our own sets of standards to raise the
bar, head over heels above where the hand
[SPEAKER_02]: over hand above where the state is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have to have local hubs and
processing facilities run by local
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have high standards in place to clean
their machines out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're run by cooperatives because
we're seeing what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to have testing labs within our
communities, whether or not that's SE
[SPEAKER_02]: coming up and setting up shop and these
hubs and processing facilities as a
[SPEAKER_02]: partnership agreement to some of these
larger collectives or cooperatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea is that we have to have our,
we have to have the manufacturing and
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction industry more accountable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the testing, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the responsibility to the farmers
for getting back fair pricing to the end
[SPEAKER_02]: of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't grow trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: So finding, but if I'm not growing flour
and I'm selling trim and it's always
[SPEAKER_02]: coming back positive or something,
I'm not making money either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's, that's been the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No big time, you know, and, and you know,
and when it, in so many ways too,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the most frequent conversation I
have like with people that we work with,
[SPEAKER_01]: within this testing community,
you know, so largely is around the
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide topic, you know, and,
and it's really fascinating because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a lot of, a lot of my mentors
and, you know, the giants whose shoulders
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm standing on, who I learned from,
you know, people like Tim Blake up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino County, you know, so many people
I know up in the Emerald triangle,
[SPEAKER_01]: like that have been doing this
generationally with their families,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, almost have this existential
fear that, you know, with regulations,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, this can come this big ag model
that's going to come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smash the price of herb and so many people
are going to lose in livelihoods,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but, but, you know, truly in so
many ways, like I, you know, in some like
[SPEAKER_01]: romantic perspective, you know,
I see, I see the regulations on cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: or, or, you know, I mean, I think that we
have to get URIC recognized, this
[SPEAKER_01]: unavoidable residual, the limits have to
get a little bit raised, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, but, but in general, I think the
pesticide regulations as strict as they
[SPEAKER_01]: are, they're going to most benefit the
small, medium scale ablation kind of mom
[SPEAKER_01]: and pop farmer who's been doing this
forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, it's like, if you've done
this for 20 years and you've gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: smashed by broad mites and you have seen
thrift infestation to its worst and aphids
[SPEAKER_01]: and all these things and, you know,
and, and you're able to understand how to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow in your micro climate region without
being reliant on systemic, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: fungicides to keep away powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have this almost built in level of
insulation, you know, that I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be your biggest benefit in the
regulated market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like as the shifts over and this,
there's this transition to where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, only clean weed will eventually
be allowed into dispensaries and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and, and, you know, the whole thing
starts shifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I think there's an incredible
crisis of scarcity of clean material in
[SPEAKER_01]: the market right now, whereas there's an
abundance of dirty weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I, you know, California,
you know, the amount of weed that's grown
[SPEAKER_01]: here, you know, 80, 90% of it I'd say is
going out of state and probably will for a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time, you know, even though there's a
comprehensive regulated model,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's going to stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is, is like, I think those,
those that participate in the regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: space, you know, I think all the big
money, like Johnny come lately folks that
[SPEAKER_01]: are just coming in with all this VC money
thinking there with all the projections
[SPEAKER_01]: and their illusions of grand or about how
much they're going to crush it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think are going to be the first crushed
because it's like, if you don't have this
[SPEAKER_01]: humble reverence for the plant and then
being a steward and a servant of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and like have learned the lessons to do it
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, cause, cause the, the time where
you could get away with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: identifying you had broad mites,
you know, three weeks into flower and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're facing potential entire crop loss
where some farmers back in the day would
[SPEAKER_01]: bomb their room with a, with a nuclear
option, you know, it's some pesticide like
[SPEAKER_01]: for bid or, you know, these different
Bayer chemicals or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the time where that could have
actually gotten away with is gone.
Okay.
