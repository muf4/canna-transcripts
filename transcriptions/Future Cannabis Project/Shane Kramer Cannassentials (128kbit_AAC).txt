[SPEAKER_02]: Can you kind of talk about your greenhouse
and what sets it apart?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why you find it interesting and how you
got there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I had quite a bit of experience
in indoor farming for quite a few years
[SPEAKER_00]: and just kind of came from that world and
then actually transitioned into a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the word for the big long X or Z
word for processing corn?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so you're doing vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 13 years ago we got our farm that is
more farmland and in Eugene and so started
[SPEAKER_00]: growing market veggies and a little bit of
wholesale and did that for quite a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years while kind of transitioning the
indoor cannabis getting more into more
[SPEAKER_00]: deep organic practices indoors and using
you know getting into plant-based
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility and so getting away from all the
animal products, getting away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacquanos and the bone meals and the blood
meals and using more plant-based
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What was each one of those animal-based
things doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what were you using bacquano for and
then what was a substitute that worked?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in your quick cycle of kind of more the
you know indoor continuous production you
[SPEAKER_00]: only have the two months you know really a
flower and trying to get the soil organic
[SPEAKER_00]: in an or you know drill organic soil try
to get that to release the nutrients to
[SPEAKER_00]: have those nutrients soluble to the plant
get chelated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a tough thing unless you have a lot
of microbes so conventional farming uses a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of soluble foods that are already
broken down and so you know from the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemically derived where it's in sulfate
form ready to go into the plant or to the
[SPEAKER_00]: some people make organic bottled foods
that are animal products that they
[SPEAKER_00]: basically isolate you know but basically
they're trying to make them soluble so it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes right into the plant and just so you
really get that boom so you get that that
[SPEAKER_00]: nice growth you know quickly and that's in
that in that two month so replacing
[SPEAKER_00]: basically those heavy-duty foods that were
quick acting with with plant ferments that
[SPEAKER_00]: was really a big thing plant and fruit
ferments so basically fermenting plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material which which pretty much comes all
from our farm so we're just gathering and
[SPEAKER_00]: even a lot of weeds a lot of things that
have deep roots even like thistles that
[SPEAKER_00]: you think are a really bad weed they are
bringing up all these minerals from the
[SPEAKER_00]: subsoil and they're making basically a
fertilizer that's beyond a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: other fertilizers even if you're using
like an alfalfa meal or sling if that
[SPEAKER_00]: field that the alfalfa meal fertilizer
came from was devoid of minerals you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not you're not getting as many minerals
whereas if you're using weeds that are you
[SPEAKER_00]: know nutrient accumulators you're really
getting all these weeds the reason they're
[SPEAKER_00]: sending that taproot in down to the ground
is to bring up minerals and regenerate the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil so so using plant ferments and fruit
ferments to really supplement that that
[SPEAKER_00]: extra boost and then just plant material
and kelp meal rock dust seeds and really
[SPEAKER_00]: so yeah seeds really replace a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: it's up in the air that my only thing
[SPEAKER_00]: so you know people use a lot of seed meals
so seed meals are really plants basically
[SPEAKER_00]: have plants everything plant needs you
know so you have this balanced form of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition it's just getting that to go
uptake into the plant in the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: time you want and if you have a really
living soil it's it's a lot easier but
[SPEAKER_00]: starting out when I did transition from
the indoor it was trying to get these
[SPEAKER_00]: containers to have that have the fertility
to make those really like indoor quality
[SPEAKER_00]: buds you know really have that full
quality in that amount of time and and so
[SPEAKER_00]: transitioning to more like ferments and
and ways of solubilizing those those
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients out of the out of the organic
matter so is that what the fermentation
[SPEAKER_00]: process does so all the microbes that are
in the soil that are in our gut that are
[SPEAKER_00]: in a cow's gut you know animals are all
the same type of microbes like the
[SPEAKER_00]: probiotics we take or the same probiotics
that they sell you for your soil and the
[SPEAKER_00]: same that are in a cow's gut and the cow
is basically having this fermentation
[SPEAKER_00]: process happening in their stomach when
you're making a ferment you're taking all
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff that the cow would eat or the
horse would eat and you're fermenting it
[SPEAKER_00]: in water and those same microbes are
breaking everything down and basically
[SPEAKER_00]: chelating those nutrients making them
chelating is just making those molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller and smaller so that they're
basically be uptaken by the plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes are chelating they're just
breaking down to a smaller smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: particle and so that all happens in your
ferment and instead of like when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using animal manure you're getting what
the animal didn't use the animals using
[SPEAKER_00]: the calcium magnesium a lot of the
micronutrients and you're getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: macronutrients and so I mean you can use
it's useful a bit but it's a lot of time
[SPEAKER_00]: this over fertilizes a lot of people in
this intercept for years it's been over
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizing especially without soil
testing so we're really into soil testing
[SPEAKER_00]: now as well to know what's there to make
sure that we're not missing anything and
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure we have it all our base you
know base covered and and not overdoing
[SPEAKER_00]: anything because the balance of the soil
is really important if you overdo
[SPEAKER_00]: macronutrients especially the
micronutrients get locked out and so and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really the micronutrients are
really the plant really depends on them to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the secondary metabolites which are
all the terpenes the cannabinoids the
[SPEAKER_02]: flavonoids the seed meal is it literally
taking seeds from plants that are native
[SPEAKER_00]: to your area ideally we're using a lot of
actually food seeds like flax,
[SPEAKER_00]: amaranth, chia, buckwheat and then the
cover crop seeds too but a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: like the flax, amaranth, chia they're
really oily really super nutritious you
[SPEAKER_00]: know for us they're like they're super
nutrient dense foods so I like to use
[SPEAKER_00]: those where I toss them in there some of
them get broken down and eaten by the
[SPEAKER_00]: worms some of them sprout into cover crops
which our cycle of what we're doing now is
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of planting top dress that cover
crops come up and then we mulch them in
[SPEAKER_00]: really about three weeks like three weeks
cycles of letting them sprout and then
[SPEAKER_00]: mulching them back in so currently
fast-forward is where we are with the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse is we brought that I brought
that indoor that that was when so this all
[SPEAKER_02]: this thinking was when you were indoor and
you wanted to do kind of like a living
[SPEAKER_00]: soil indoor transition and it was still
though in big containers and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: before the the current full regulated you
know in the medical days but once rec
[SPEAKER_00]: happened and we built our farm we wanted
to really build it out with what we feel
[SPEAKER_00]: is like the best of both worlds which is
to get the quality that you need the
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor environment and to get that really
good taste and what we really want is that
[SPEAKER_00]: deep organic soil culture and so our
greenhouse has beds that go down into the
[SPEAKER_00]: native soil but are raised up to two feet
out of it and it with our custom mix and
[SPEAKER_00]: and so that custom blends really nutrient
dense like nutrient dense we do use a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of fish bone meal to build our
soils initially and I really like it I
[SPEAKER_00]: find it adds to everything and like just
like the fish used to swim up the from the
[SPEAKER_00]: ocean they'd swim up the rivers and bring
all their nutrients back that fish bone
[SPEAKER_00]: from the ocean has a lot of minerals and
there's a lot of really things that I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: brings in but that's that's the only
animal products we're using besides that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're you know building all that with
different either plant meals kelp rock
[SPEAKER_00]: dust seeds bran and then even so that's
where with the seeds using high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds I find you know is a step up from
using like like a like a cotton seed meal
[SPEAKER_00]: or something which a lot of people are
using for agriculture they take out all
[SPEAKER_00]: the oils from that concede meal where when
you're using just the whole seeds you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting all the oils and everything and
but then even with your plants when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using plants to fertilize if you're using
herbs that have terpenes in them already
[SPEAKER_00]: all these elements that made those
molecules are in there and you're then
[SPEAKER_00]: translating into your soil and you're just
packing more of the elements you want that
[SPEAKER_00]: are gonna translate into what you really
want so I try to use like as many herbs
[SPEAKER_02]: and really fragrant you know more of that
thought about it I have not yet and I
[SPEAKER_00]: totally someone has thought that told me
like you know you should use plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: are high in the same terpene to like and
then I mean I'm sure it would be a benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: all our practices our numbers have gone
complete I'm in terpenes cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: everything so we've seen a general you
know really amazing just with seeing that
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the analytics showing it so yeah
but I haven't gotten that yeah so we're
[SPEAKER_00]: offering right now two thousand we were
five thousand and we lost three thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: square feet in a snowstorm last year so we
like I mean serious fart like we're all of
[SPEAKER_00]: a sudden two feet of snow it was like
really free for our area and just three
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand square foot greenhouse just and
so it was a pretty big it's pretty big
[SPEAKER_00]: Austin and we're rebuilding right now so
we back up to five thousand our license is
[SPEAKER_00]: five thousand of lighted greenhouse space
and then we can do up to a half acre
[SPEAKER_00]: outside but we are doing ten thousand
square feet outside and then all these
[SPEAKER_02]: inputs you're growing on the same farm
yeah we're going we have the veggie we
[SPEAKER_00]: have about 20 acres total and so we're
growing a lot of the inputs we do bring in
[SPEAKER_00]: some seeds and you know a few little
things like the kelp and the rock dust so
[SPEAKER_00]: we're bringing a little bits of things but
really with them so our current situation
[SPEAKER_00]: with the greenhouse and the beds the
fertility is there we do soil tests and I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean it's basically everything's there
we're adding like little bits of things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are a little low and then really what
we're doing it's really worm beds I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: when you pull it apart there's just full
worms what we're doing is really just
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding that top of the soil letting the
worms have a lot have their healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and some stuff to eat to
really just break down what's in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: more and make it available because all
that stuff is in the soil but it needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: be made available to the plants and so
really that's what we're focusing on now
[SPEAKER_00]: is really just these top dresses that have
the seeds popping up and just make that
[SPEAKER_00]: worm activity happen to really just make
that stuff that's in the soil available
[SPEAKER_00]: and then just giving a little bit I still
give a little bit of some plant ferments
[SPEAKER_00]: and fruit ferments at certain times it's a
lot of its green natural farming stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of them are just to stimulate
certain different like flowering with a
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit ferment and then we use like a
water-soluble calcium that we make out of
[SPEAKER_00]: egg shell and vinegar and we do that in
transition when we transplant and in
[SPEAKER_00]: transitions times and then sprouted seed
teas I do which is another technique where
[SPEAKER_00]: sprouts have a lot of enzymes in them and
so I'll use a corn sprouted seed tea going
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower for the first two weeks about
once a week and that has cytokine in it
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the shoot hormone and so it makes
your you know buzz just stack really in
[SPEAKER_00]: that first two weeks and then after that
we'll go to barley seed sprout and barley
[SPEAKER_00]: has a lot of phosphatase because in the in
the spring it has to be 60 65 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: really for the soil to for the plants
uptake phosphorus but barley is usually
[SPEAKER_00]: growing before then and it's it's colder
so they make their own phosphatase enzyme
[SPEAKER_00]: to help themselves uptake in that cold
temperatures so we're basically sprouting
[SPEAKER_00]: that barley and then making a tea of it
and taking that phosphatase and that
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphatase helps our plants absorb
phosphorus which is what makes buds you
[SPEAKER_00]: know what makes the nice buds and so
really that's what we're kind of using
[SPEAKER_00]: some techniques to make our our indoor
quality where we're in the indoor market
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and we're really getting up and
the price for it able to kind of grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit less in a little more focused
way and kind of really and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: really big demand for it so that's the the
balance we really we are using some
[SPEAKER_00]: resources that are more than a lot of the
I mean a weight way more than a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun growing especially and stuff but but
our a lot most of our fertility resources
[SPEAKER_00]: are coming from our land you know our our
beds go down in the native soil it really
[SPEAKER_00]: is this deep organic culture we have the
Sun involved you know in the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: but we also do have the lights and the
climate control so what kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: supplemental light we have supplemental
lighting like double-ended yeah we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have LED LED the price was just so
restrictive and prohibitive that it's hard
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a hard one to judge and also they
don't give any heat which we actually when
[SPEAKER_00]: we use the lights is in the winter and and
we like the heat and so in the summer we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really hardly use in summer it's an
amazingly where you don't use the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're getting an indoor quality
product for you know almost like two of
[SPEAKER_00]: the seasons and then for like two of the
harvests we're using more lights and and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know depending some days are more
sunnier we've got a meter that turns
[SPEAKER_00]: lights on and off so you know as efficient
as we can be dialed in we have sensors and
[SPEAKER_00]: meters for everything that that that only
turns it on if it needs it and but you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it we are using some resources to
basically get the quality products are
[SPEAKER_02]: people using climate batteries like do you
like what are some concepts you're using
[SPEAKER_02]: to kind of manage the heat like in the
summer yeah it's hot so yeah the summer
[SPEAKER_00]: gets hot and also the other problem is
that it's dry and so the dryness the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves get impacted by that you want to
keep the vapor pressure deficit up when it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets hotter you want to keep the humidity
higher and that basically keeps the the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves healthy in this and the
transpiration happening correctly if it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets it gets too hot and dry the plants
close up their stomata and they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: functioning correctly and if it gets too
wet and cold the plants open up and they
[SPEAKER_00]: just try to water just comes out of them
and then water sits on the leaves and it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets mold so the vapor pressure deficits
really especially when it's hot and dry
[SPEAKER_00]: and so we have like a wet wall where the
air comes through through water and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: in our veg we actually have an earth
battery where we kick all the air from we
[SPEAKER_00]: excavated underneath it when we were
building it yeah we kick the air yeah we
[SPEAKER_00]: kick the air in and we we take air from we
basically ran types next to each other and
[SPEAKER_00]: one comes from in the greenhouse and the
other ones bring outside air past that
[SPEAKER_00]: warm air and bring it in so the air is
tempered when it comes in it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit warmer that one so we in our area we
have a really high water table and so for
[SPEAKER_00]: that one we only went about three feet and
so we've been the water and so it's a it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of new there's some people doing a
different greenhouse companies doing it we
[SPEAKER_00]: were kind of going off over there and it
is almost new in itself so we didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: it definitely worked but I think ideally
it would be nice to go deeper to get you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the more constant temperature but
definitely the air coming in is tempered
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of that heat gets translated into
the ground and so that yeah it's like an
[SPEAKER_00]: earth battery so we did that for our veg
for our big greenhouse and actually our
[SPEAKER_00]: new greenhouse we're trying to figure out
some way of bringing in air from we're
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking like an underground like where
it's some kind of trench so that air just
[SPEAKER_00]: can be coming from because really that's
what we need to do is we need to take that
[SPEAKER_00]: that coolness from the ground and the heat
we don't get too hot like as California
[SPEAKER_00]: but we definitely do have days when it's
90 and really the biggest part is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of flower that's when the quality gets
ruined if it's hot at the end of flower it
[SPEAKER_00]: really just makes it you know the first
month you know you can have nice hot you
[SPEAKER_00]: can hum it make it humid and just really
get them to rage but it really is that end
[SPEAKER_00]: of flower that that that'll ruin the
quality so and then also the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower just the the humidity thing is
really the demon of demonifiers so that
[SPEAKER_00]: when the lights do go off they can just
get rid of that initial load and it really
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a pretty crucial part to is getting
rid of that humidity so I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's who it people are coming like
definitely the the technology is really
[SPEAKER_00]: advancing for all this stuff to the
engineering where I think that the it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna come leaps and bounds you know the
efficiencies and there's like serious
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses which are like in Colorado
serious they're super efficient really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting if you want to look up and
it's just it's going that way where
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can make an indoor product in
a way more efficient sustainable way and
[SPEAKER_00]: get a premium for it you know we're really
it's it's translating the the cost of
[SPEAKER_00]: goods translating to what we're getting
and the demand really makes the business
[SPEAKER_00]: part of it really easy like we're not you
know there's no it's taken out that part
[SPEAKER_00]: of of the struggle of the sales and
everything you know so it's what's the
[SPEAKER_02]: specific differentiator of those
greenhouses what are they called so as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as the oh serious CRS so so the company
there's a company yeah yeah and and the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole back of it is a insulated panels so
the whole back and it's it's almost like a
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like a warehouse almost that that has
one side that's that's your greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's acrylic so that it gets more UV but
then they're doing the earth batteries so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like a full closed system and it's
just really built with efficiency of
[SPEAKER_00]: making a closed system kind of a closed
system efficiency built in it instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: like old school greenhouse where it's just
air coming in one side going out the other
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really the traditional greenhouse
is just bring air in bend it out and where
[SPEAKER_00]: this one is like a closed more and and the
with the back you don't lose as much heat
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the back and just the other way
it's built just for efficiency really so
[SPEAKER_02]: but very pricey what what's one like when
you get back what's kind of one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: first like experiments you're gonna like
something you're gonna be playing with
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's in the greenhouse
infrastructure the soil the compost tea
[SPEAKER_00]: we're getting a lot more into wood chips
and really using them so you know peat
[SPEAKER_00]: moss is usually your if you're just
potting material peat moss is that fluff
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's really what the people use
coconut as well it's not not as good and
[SPEAKER_00]: really that soil component you can replace
with wood chips that are fungally like
[SPEAKER_00]: broken down but usually takes about like
two to three years and try to work on
[SPEAKER_00]: getting that to happen a little sooner
with inoculating with fungus and really
[SPEAKER_02]: use pulling branches from the property
yeah we have a lot we have a little wood
[SPEAKER_00]: lot and so a lot of alder that needs to be
thinned out anyway and it's to thin it out
[SPEAKER_00]: to make the the furs grow a little better
and you know they definitely there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little room to take some out so using that
and just turning that into into soil
[SPEAKER_00]: basically for our our potting because our
beds are there they're you know no till we
[SPEAKER_00]: just leave the beds we're just planting in
them but but all our starts in our
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative we we need soil and so we have
been getting a soil mix that we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: custom blend but I kind of want to get
away from bringing in that the outside you
[SPEAKER_00]: know a little bit of peat moss really does
work amazingly but but what I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing from some experimentation and
hearing from some other anecdotal is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it really can replace the wood chips can
replace peat moss fungally broken down
[SPEAKER_00]: wood chips and so yeah that'll be a big
part other experiments we're getting a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more perennial plantings around the farm
just creating that long-term it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: hard not to just get caught up in the
day-to-day just growing the weed but just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of that whole systems thing so really
just bring in the more permaculture and we
[SPEAKER_00]: do a lot because most of the the ferments
we use a lot of you know our own our base
[SPEAKER_00]: all our own plants and herbs but we also
do IPM integrated like pest management of
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays and stuff with herbal teas and so
we do like a heavy herbal tea of different
[SPEAKER_00]: things but Jerusalem artichoke is one
thing but then time and oregano and mince
[SPEAKER_00]: and rosemary on the property and we will
make a heavy tea of that and then we make
[SPEAKER_00]: a wedding agent which is a castile soap
and we use that as our as our pest as our
[SPEAKER_00]: pest you and Wendy are the JWA so it's all
JDAM methods that we're basically gleaning
[SPEAKER_00]: from we use some Korean natural farming
some JDAM some biodynamic really just
[SPEAKER_00]: taking whatever we can glean from from
these different methods for you know where
[SPEAKER_02]: we need to fill in those and the whole jet
is it JDAM it's basically addressing what
[SPEAKER_02]: was the issue that kind of KNF doesn't
quite address that JDAM it's a big scale
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more for like so master Cho who
started KNF he saw that all the old
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers were using like using their kimchi
juice and using these ferments to help
[SPEAKER_00]: their food production as well as making
ferments of all their crop waste and using
[SPEAKER_00]: that as fertilizer because Korea was
island so they're not bringing in stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: you know a lot of agriculture like 50
years based on on raw on your fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: being an input you know usually a waste
material input that they put into into
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer for something else Korea they
didn't have that so they really had to
[SPEAKER_00]: like close the loop and and then the
ferments as well we're just part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture and and you know feeding the
soil those microbes to break all the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients down which is the same thing for
us the probiotic with them the microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: are like our probiotics they're what's
breaking down our nutrients and being
[SPEAKER_00]: available there it's breaking down the
nutrients in the soil making them
[SPEAKER_00]: available and so so the more of those
microbes the more you can you know
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculate with that the more breakdown
you're getting and so a lot of theirs is
[SPEAKER_00]: for like small scale and really the Korean
natural farming I think too for like
[SPEAKER_00]: quality giving that little boost to make
that that what conventional agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: does to make it that marketable fruit you
know marketable really nice fruit is like
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to get without giving it all that
little boost and so I think that Korean
[SPEAKER_00]: natural farming is really that extra to
give that marketable that that really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: and then but it uses different sugars and
some outside materials to make these
[SPEAKER_00]: ferments which a lot of them are stable
though so they're easy but but they do
[SPEAKER_00]: have a cost involved where it's a damn so
master Cho's son learned from master Cho
[SPEAKER_00]: and then went to university went to
chemistry and biology and everything and
[SPEAKER_02]: then farmed for 15 years so this would be
like Bruce Lee to if man right like he
[SPEAKER_02]: learned from some guy and then he's like
let me yeah yeah and then also with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more of science like he's been like
testing and he does you know nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: tests on all these things so a little more
of a science background you know it's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely it's like KNF 2.0 it will it's
but it's it's scaled more for not his
[SPEAKER_00]: whole thing is that organic farmers and
this is like food farmers can survive can
[SPEAKER_00]: thrive if they don't have to buy all their
inputs if you're buying inputs and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like fertilizer and pesticides and
everything that are organic but still
[SPEAKER_00]: you're buying them and you're bringing
them in there's your you're losing your
[SPEAKER_00]: you know you're spending too much money
you're basically costs are too high so
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting is if you would make everything
with with inexpensive you know organic
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs you're basically gonna be making
money and or and inputs that work and so
[SPEAKER_00]: so he came up with all these different
methods a lot of them just ferments or
[SPEAKER_00]: waste to ferment and examples that that
and a lot of it's just your your crop
[SPEAKER_00]: waste if you're growing strawberries you
take all your strawberry waste and you
[SPEAKER_00]: ferment it and the next year you use it on
your crop but he also has a microbe
[SPEAKER_00]: solution that uses mashed potatoes and
forest like the leaf mold I go to like
[SPEAKER_00]: nice healthy forest and where it's like
fungal and stuff you take that leaf mold
[SPEAKER_00]: and then nice place in the field and take
that and take all those that's your like
[SPEAKER_00]: your microbial inoculation and you use the
potatoes mashed potatoes and sea salt and
[SPEAKER_00]: you make a you take the starch out of the
potatoes and the sea salt into the water
[SPEAKER_00]: and then add that microbe inoculation and
it sits for about three days it starts to
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble and just like the the roots of the
plants are feeding microbes so what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in what's happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: so in the soil naturally the plants are
photosynthesizing right and 40% up to 40%
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes like you could say to more or
less of the sugars are going down into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and feeding the microbes so that's
the natural process the natural process is
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbes get fed by the root exudates
that come out of the plant and and so
[SPEAKER_00]: basically when I make the microbe solution
you're using that potato which is a root
[SPEAKER_00]: to feed as the sugar the microbes and the
sea salts the minerals and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: basically growing those microbes and
proliferating them and then we're feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: that to the soil and so that's our
microbial inoculation that's another JDAM
[SPEAKER_00]: method the herbal solution he has a sulfur
spray that is a pretty amazing so I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more of for like a commercial
agriculture kind of scene where Korean
[SPEAKER_00]: natural farming seems like it's more for
really the high quality it's really that's
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what makes like quality it's all
these little extras like super for the
[SPEAKER_00]: headies and JDAMs more like the utility
that's what I find it's like yeah it's for
[SPEAKER_00]: the Korean natural farming really helps
the quality and and the JDAM really helps
[SPEAKER_00]: with the bulk stuff that you can just do
for a lot cheaper and so yeah it's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: in a nutshell so just quickly one cultivar
that you're growing that maybe doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have market appeal but that you love so
it's an interesting one and we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: Durban chocolate that not the most bag
appeal and it's about 16% THC and but it
[SPEAKER_00]: really it gets like three to four plus
percent terpenes and just amazing terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: and and we actually we entered in the
cultivation classic up in Oregon and it
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't really have too much enter I didn't
think it would win at all and it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: took first place against all the indoor
which showed it was I mean it's super high
[SPEAKER_00]: terpy really nice smoking really lively
strain that basically won against all
[SPEAKER_00]: these I mean really new thing you know all
these new designer and like and all indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: but it kind of really shows yeah we've
seen a lot that some of these really they
[SPEAKER_00]: have strains that aren't heavy-duty that
don't seem as much just when the smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out it's really it's what's in that
smoke and what's in that flannel so yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: really that's an interesting one I'd say
though we are we're selecting for
[SPEAKER_00]: marketability so most of the things I mean
we're we're definitely it's a hard day
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah it's a little bit hard we're
definitely have to somewhat steer towards
[SPEAKER_00]: what the market wants which is a strong
you know but we really when we phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all for what it's most like we want
an oily resinous smoke you know we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll basically it could grow great it
could look great it smell great but how
[SPEAKER_00]: does it actually translate into smoke and
we found through our phenotyping that some
[SPEAKER_00]: yes some strains it could be the same 10
seeds and a few of them will smoke amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: and be oily or maybe one of them and and
some of them will and you know majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: them will just be like leafy and just not
not have a nice smoke to them and even if
[SPEAKER_00]: they look beautiful they and over it's
it's pretty amazing it's it's kind of some
[SPEAKER_00]: strange definitely so that's what we're
look we're really in the flower market I
[SPEAKER_00]: find that's our niche I find that that's
gonna be the niche because only so many
[SPEAKER_00]: people want to grow a good flower only so
many people know how to grow a good flower
[SPEAKER_00]: want to put the love and energy into it
it's a very hands-on thing and and so I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel there's always gonna be that market
it's gonna be that fine wine are you gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: do flower like solventless hash I feel
like we have we do make some and our
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor production it goes to extraction
which some of its been co2 now some of its
[SPEAKER_00]: solventless but uh but that's mostly we
don't really have enough waste or a
[SPEAKER_00]: leftover like trim material to make too
much product just because our we have
[SPEAKER_00]: small batches we do so much small batches
of different flavors and so so yeah that's
[SPEAKER_00]: our can essentials that's our brand right
there yeah I it's it's so my whole journey
[SPEAKER_00]: to came over a lot I had a lot of new I'd
like digestive problems and I was really
[SPEAKER_00]: into the food I guess I got into veganism
early and it was a lot because the animal
[SPEAKER_00]: thing but through my veganism I got really
unhealthy because I wasn't eating right
[SPEAKER_00]: and I a lot of digestive problems and and
fast forward I tried to grow some weed it
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't really grow I was like I need to
take botany I dropped out of high school I
[SPEAKER_00]: saw the community college was botany I
went and I took botany and and just
[SPEAKER_00]: learned all about how actually everything
works that you know how our our DNA is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually putting together proteins to
build everything and you need those raw
[SPEAKER_00]: materials to make all that happen and and
just translating that into like the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like oh I'm not feeding these plants
and the plants are growing and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: realized well I'm not feeding myself
enough and really like growing cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: has shown me with with growing them and
seeing how you can make them super healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: you can take a plant that's totally sick
and bring it back by feeding it and even
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the field to a vegetables and I
really like to you know it's really taught
[SPEAKER_00]: me about feeding myself and being healthy
and that's what I kind of like to get out
[SPEAKER_00]: to I like to have the platform of the herb
where it's like people like wow that herbs
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing you say well it's grown with all
these things all these nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient-dense things that translates into
it and this is how the soil works as
[SPEAKER_00]: everything works and this is the same as
our bodies our bodies have the same kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of system little microbiome going on in us
and we need all these base materials to
[SPEAKER_00]: make us so you can teach them through how
impressed they are with the flower that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what I feel it's I mean I could all day
long be like I got kale I got kale but
[SPEAKER_00]: people most people don't care but the
flower I can get in front especially I
[SPEAKER_00]: love going to like dispensaries and
talking to the bud tenders and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: because I I have a little bit of a
platform I have a little bit of a you know
[SPEAKER_00]: a minute of their time because I have
their attention and and that's what I like
[SPEAKER_00]: follow the flower exactly and then I can
really like download stuff that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: really like wow and then able to you know
put out even more because there is we do
[SPEAKER_00]: have the you know they're talking to
people and they're sharing information so
[SPEAKER_00]: we have this kind of a really cool
information sharing community thing
[SPEAKER_00]: happening with the cannabis that's really
and it's a lot of conscious it's mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are a little bit more trying
to think a little different and conscious
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of what we need you know
what I mean hopefully we need to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that aren't thinking to get on our
train too but I really feel it is this
[SPEAKER_00]: this this movement and and seeing it in my
you know short lifetime and experience
[SPEAKER_00]: with it is from 20 years ago it being
completely you know legal and not really
[SPEAKER_00]: it was all over but now it's just so
normalized and everybody you know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean like my mom smoking weed my grandma
you know it's like the kids grandma
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody it's like you know it's such a
and it's not stigmatized it's so really
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah it's pretty amazing to see that it
there's no reason it shouldn't have been
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway but I don't know it's just kind of
amazing to see what really is and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know I think we definitely use it as a as
a platform to spread more better things
[SPEAKER_00]: you know not just the cannabis that's my
whole thing that's how I pull it all for a
[SPEAKER_02]: full circle so perfect I appreciate it you
you you you you you you you you you you
you you
