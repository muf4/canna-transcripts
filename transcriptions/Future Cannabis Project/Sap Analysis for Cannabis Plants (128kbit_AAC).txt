[SPEAKER_04]: Nick, I wanted to have you do a SAP
analysis, just like monologue.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're essentially just looking
at what's ending up inside of the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking at what the mineral
nutrient, you know, micro metal
[SPEAKER_04]: composition of cytosol and cytoplasm
inside of the plant actually is,
[SPEAKER_04]: which gives us another window into what's
going on as we try to balance our microbes
[SPEAKER_04]: and as we balance our minerals in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's ending up in the plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so with the leaf extract analysis is
actually with the lab that I use,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is Apical here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: They, you know, they're looking at old and
new leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is concentrating in the old leaves
and what is making, what nutrients are
[SPEAKER_04]: making their way to the new leaves?
[SPEAKER_04]: And sort of, you know, what's going into
that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Along with that, what are the surpluses of
nutrients in the plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there storage of calcium in an old leaf
that can make its way to a new leaf?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there an excess of chloride that's
locked up in the old leaf and not actually
[SPEAKER_04]: making its way efficiently to the new
leaf?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, if you have, you know,
a thousand parts per million of chloride
[SPEAKER_04]: in an old leaf and the new leaf has only
taken maybe 180 of that, that plant is
[SPEAKER_04]: telling you that it is trying to shed
chloride because there's too much of it in
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really it's just giving us another
window into what's going on with plant
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrition, which ties into plant health,
the ties into what's going on with the
[SPEAKER_04]: protein, what's going to be going on with
flowering as we move through that cycle,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, as we are talking about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on a cannabis show here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, what the susceptibility to
pests and disease is really going to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's taught me some interesting
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've worked, mostly I've worked in soil
that is less than ideal in terms of the
[SPEAKER_04]: mineral profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I see a lot of high sodium in
cannabis and that's a whole other story
[SPEAKER_04]: why that happens, but it's common.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I expected to see very, very high
sodium inside of the plant as a result,
[SPEAKER_04]: because, you know, it's a single charge
and it's not very tightly bonded.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it moves around readily.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you can flush it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think that the plant would just
take it up very efficiently, but that's
[SPEAKER_04]: not what I see.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't actually end up inside of the
plant in most places, in most cases,
[SPEAKER_04]: at toxic levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's the biology that's
actually doing that, that or the plant is
[SPEAKER_04]: actually what they would call sodium
exclusive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it actually takes up the chloride
side of the sodium chloride instead of the
[SPEAKER_04]: sodium.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it is sodium exclusive, that is a very
energy expensive process.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just because it's not ending up in the
plant, it doesn't mean that it isn't
[SPEAKER_04]: sucking energy and, you know, nutrition
and enzymes and everything else from the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant to enable, for the plant to enable
itself to actually exclude that sodium.
[SPEAKER_04]: So along with being able to see what the
profile is in the plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we can also make some of these other
correlations with what cannabis actually
[SPEAKER_04]: prefers.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, you know, K gets up in there,
no problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't find myself having to really
supplement with K at all, as long as
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a decent amount in the soil,
because it moves so readily.
[SPEAKER_04]: The lab that I work with is the numbers
that we see there are a lot higher than
[SPEAKER_04]: what you're gonna see on a normal tissue
test, because they're able to extract the
[SPEAKER_04]: sap, the cytosol and the cytoplasm from
the leaf without crushing and extracting
[SPEAKER_04]: any of the vascular tissue in that leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know exactly what this process is,
but the leaf looks the same after they
[SPEAKER_04]: pull the fluid out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you see parts per million up into,
you know, with K sometimes seven,
[SPEAKER_04]: 8,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen 12,000 in a plant that was
looking fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we also learn about,
you know, what certain strains are
[SPEAKER_04]: actually, you know, taking up and
concentrating inside of their sap versus
[SPEAKER_04]: other strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just, it's another dimension.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason we're so interested in this
is because, you know, we want to know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, what nutrient cycling looks like
from the plant's perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: But secondly, we don't, we want to be
spraying integrated pest management,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, pesticides, insecticides,
these kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to tackle the nutrition.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to get to the root of the cause.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to, you know, even if you do call
it a band-aid to apply a foliar
[SPEAKER_04]: application of a targeted mineral that's
been identified as deficient through
[SPEAKER_04]: testing, that's what we do, because it's a
lot better than being on a program where
[SPEAKER_04]: you're just constantly, you know,
you're on a spray routine where it's three
[SPEAKER_04]: different insecticides, you know,
every two weeks or whatever, regardless of
[SPEAKER_04]: if they are organic or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other thing is, you know,
what are those sprays doing to the,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the mineral composition inside
of the plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's been interesting too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's been plenty of cases where
we've been doing that kind of testing and
[SPEAKER_04]: there have been sprays occurring.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is essentially clouding some of
the results.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we go back to the
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look and see what's actually making up
that spray and what are some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: inactive ingredients in that spray.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can make some further
conclusions about maybe why we're seeing
[SPEAKER_04]: what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But being able to see the difference
between the old and the new leaf lets us
[SPEAKER_04]: be ahead of deficiencies by, you know,
maybe a week, maybe two.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really hard to say, but you know,
it's been valuable.
[SPEAKER_04]: For us, we've learned a lot from it for
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll continue to use it into the
future to make some targeted applications
[SPEAKER_04]: to try to bolster plant nutrition instead
of falling back on insecticides,
[SPEAKER_04]: fungicides, those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if they are organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much have you done on like,
have you done much of that on indoor sap
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis on indoor?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have.
Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just wondering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause sometimes it feels like those
systems are driven a little harder with
[SPEAKER_00]: the lights and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I've really seen things all over
the map.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen indoor gardens with functioning
biology that have parts per million of
[SPEAKER_04]: soluble salts, upward of 2000 parts per
million, you know, which is not something
[SPEAKER_04]: that you would expect to see with a,
you know, a fairly well-functioning food
[SPEAKER_04]: web.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is why we look at all this data,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to learn about this stuff in
mandatory.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to manage it as best we can.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're trying to avoid, you know,
the kill it mentality.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to make it healthier instead
of killing off whatever it is that's
[SPEAKER_04]: attacking that plant, because that's not
the real issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: The real issue is there's some kind of a
deficiency with the physiology of that
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And usually, you know, how does it do with
the nutrition?
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously the biology or, you know,
microbes or what are enzymatically
[SPEAKER_04]: catalyzing that nutrition in the root zone
to be uptaken by the plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think when you get into genetics and
all that kind of stuff, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: wild genetic or a newer hybrid,
regardless of what the crop is,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to see differences there as
well in terms of how the plant can fend
[SPEAKER_04]: for itself in a biological soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what kinds of transport proteins
has that plant actually been bred to
[SPEAKER_04]: produce?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, is it going to be able to hold
that calcium in in the way that it needs
[SPEAKER_04]: to?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, of course, there are new anomalies
that have come about from using SAP
[SPEAKER_04]: analysis, but we invite them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's what we're all about.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're, you know, we're trying to find
answers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to identify the root cause of
a lot of these physiological issues that
[SPEAKER_04]: we see, regardless of what the crop is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not have to reach for that pesticide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate how seriously Nick is
taking his sustainability.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, part of maintaining the
regenerative movement is having farms that
[SPEAKER_02]: are a shining example of financial success
and, you know, having their products move
[SPEAKER_02]: in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm not saying that the only way to
ensure success is by doing a lot of data
[SPEAKER_02]: points.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I feel that that's one of
the things that the organic sector really
[SPEAKER_02]: needs more of.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need more measurement of something to
guide these farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: To know when it's going wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one of the really heavy aspects
of our job is we get people that call us
[SPEAKER_02]: at the end of the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we get a lot of last chance,
you know, farmer on the suicide watch type
[SPEAKER_02]: phone calls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're really in tune to,
you know, some of the problems with
[SPEAKER_02]: popular trends and and and the inability
to measure those in an effective way that
[SPEAKER_02]: leads to a successful outcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and and.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's tough sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tough when some of the loudest voices
are constantly speaking against scientific
[SPEAKER_02]: quantification of the process,
which can ensure your success.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just like I would like to see more
organic farms adopt reasonable levels of
[SPEAKER_02]: quantification of their process,
at least in the beginning, to help you
[SPEAKER_02]: determine where you're going and where
you're at and possibly what some
[SPEAKER_02]: roadblocks might be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ahead, you know, it seems like any organic
farmer that's done this more than several
[SPEAKER_02]: years has a story of one year where
everything went terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the more we do mineral
analysis, the more we do biological
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis, the easier it is to see those
indicators coming so that we can redirect
[SPEAKER_02]: around a major obstacle that will take
another farm out, because the number of
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroponic farms is still increasing every
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The number of people that believe Rockwell
is still the strategy for cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: still the way they're getting funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and one of the ways that organic
commercial facilities can maintain their
[SPEAKER_02]: funding is by meeting, meeting the
business world with a reasonable level of
[SPEAKER_02]: quantification to show why you do things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see a lot of farms don't get supported
or don't get chosen because the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivators don't appropriately quantify
how you're going to protect the investment
[SPEAKER_02]: or how you're going to protect this
operation in general, whether it's mom and
[SPEAKER_02]: pop investment, or you get some loan or
whatever, you might be partnering with
[SPEAKER_02]: some big business.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nonetheless, some quantification of
the process needs to be done in order to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a different level of validity in the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there just needs to be a little
bit more accountability of process,
[SPEAKER_02]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: The small farmers don't get a little bit
more data driven in some cases,
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to work smarter, not harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And understanding the aspect of all these
bugs and things, you know, yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying the pesticides is what
agriculture wants to do, but also
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding the nutrition of the plant
and so that it can resist these bugs
[SPEAKER_01]: altogether and going back to, you know,
everybody looking at strains specific or
[SPEAKER_01]: these certain strains or, you know,
turf profiles attract more bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a lot of times what we're seeing
is this the plants take up nutrients and
[SPEAKER_01]: process things differently by different
strain, which in turn, if we're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: all these same or different strains in one
greenhouse or one grow room or one field,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to operate it all the same,
same drip feed and food, we're definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: going to see inconsistencies and outbreaks
and certain things that are consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: with, you know, plant health, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with Scott and Nick.
[SPEAKER_03]: The quantification is huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it gives you, even if it's not the
whole answer, it gives you points on the
[SPEAKER_03]: board where you're like, all of a sudden,
you kind of brush up against it,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're like, Oh, right, this is going
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it helps give a fuller picture of the
laws of nature, how we're partnering with
[SPEAKER_03]: nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Nick, I'm wondering, are you gonna
produce a PDF or something?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of publication on on your findings
with with all your the SAP analysis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then one more one more thing before
you because because we'll maybe we'll all
[SPEAKER_03]: like twist your arm on that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think what you're doing with a the
connection of the the analysis of the
[SPEAKER_03]: microbial population in conjunction with
the nutrient analysis in the SAP is so
[SPEAKER_03]: vital.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much of the kind of agricultural data
we have, you know, on nutrient uptake,
[SPEAKER_03]: on what nutrients you need based on soil,
nutrient deficiencies was created in these
[SPEAKER_03]: scenarios where they would never actually
looked at in the 10 farms they did,
[SPEAKER_03]: which farm had microbial life present,
which was totally torched dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that that lack of accounting for the
variable, I think, has really hurt our
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding of how nutrients are taken
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think looking at, you know,
mere merit marrying the the SAP analysis
[SPEAKER_03]: with the microbial life profile and the
soil that they're growing in, I think is
[SPEAKER_03]: vital for us to actually understand the
the ways plant take up plants take up
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrient and the deficiencies that show up
going forward, because we don't live in a
[SPEAKER_03]: vacuum.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I propose this idea to others,
you know, including Elaine, just as
[SPEAKER_04]: another, again, tool, but also just like
piece of data to look at all these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't, you know, it sort of fell on
deaf ears at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that doesn't mean that it won't come
around with respect to publishing
[SPEAKER_04]: something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably need to get a little more
serious about the importance of that right
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even doing this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't do much of this at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm mostly, you know, working with farmers
trying to solve their problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not right now, but, you know, usually on
site with farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's that's where I want to be for
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do see that there is a need for this
kind of data.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would encourage everybody to check
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some different labs across the
nation to not all of them will take
[SPEAKER_04]: samples from Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: From cannabis, apical ag here in Oregon
will take some samples, but he won't take
[SPEAKER_04]: them through the mail.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's that's been really tough because
people can't send it in from other states.
[SPEAKER_04]: They basically got to drop it off in
person.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, you know, I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I try to take in some of those samples as
a courier for some of those clients of
[SPEAKER_04]: mine that are having bigger problems,
for sure, and try to prioritize that kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if we call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've sort of I've tried to cross that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said no on him, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: This this may change sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not that he's anti or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just concerned about taking that
stuff through the mail, because I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: think that, yeah, he's just trying to play
it safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we certainly see correlations to the
things that we read in the academic
[SPEAKER_04]: publications with respect to pests and
disease and the profiles inside of the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant, whether it be a deficiency,
malnutrition, if you will, or an excess of
[SPEAKER_04]: something like nitrate, which is,
I think, just a really common one that
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody points to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the situations in which we see
pests and disease pop up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we've been able to deal with a
lot of different pests just from a
[SPEAKER_04]: biological standpoint.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, you guys talked about
cannabis aphid recently on one of these
[SPEAKER_04]: episodes, and that's a new one that
everybody's dealing with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, you know, it's a it's a beast
for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rates of reproduction for that thing
are are pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I feel like we've really
got a handle on that one specifically
[SPEAKER_04]: through a couple of different modes of
action.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, this has helped immensely
with looking at the composition of what's
[SPEAKER_04]: inside of the plant and trying to respond
to that with by not applying anything
[SPEAKER_04]: that's already in excess or in surplus,
but trying to get some of what's deficient
[SPEAKER_04]: into that plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in some cases, like with the chloride
that I brought up, we're learning stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: about, you know, carbon in the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked about having biology in the soil
and not hindering the uptake of some of
[SPEAKER_04]: the sodium, but having carbon in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seems to mitigate some of the uptake and
regulation of the uptake of chloride,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really common one.
[SPEAKER_04]: K, sodium not so much, but the chloride
side of that molecule that comes in the
[SPEAKER_04]: table salt, if you will.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one makes it up in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's just we're learning a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot left to learn for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that I have big enough data
sets right now to really put forth a PDF,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we will.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will eventually.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we're starting to work into
some other crops now with this SAP
[SPEAKER_04]: analysis or leaf extract analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm excited for what we're going to
find with respect to wine grapes,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is something we're going to be
moving into here in the next couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: weeks and through this season.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what kind of a benefit can we
have for that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Type of a crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: So David is really the person who runs who
owns and runs Apical Ag that could really
[SPEAKER_04]: elucidate more of what's going on behind
the scenes and these findings that he's
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of gathered over five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's finally been long enough that,
you know, he's got some pretty significant
[SPEAKER_04]: data sets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would say he's going to be the one
that's going to be putting forth,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, PDFs or maybe something in pre
print.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe he'll work with a PhD on something
in that and they'll get something into the
[SPEAKER_04]: archive for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're just starting to talk about
trying to work the microbial data into
[SPEAKER_04]: that as well, because I think it's
important, you know, we need to paint as
[SPEAKER_04]: big a picture as we can.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, he's done some work with
Elaine in the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so he's on board for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's a small business as well,
just like me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's always flying by the seat of his
pants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So getting publications out there,
that kind of thing, doing these kinds of
[SPEAKER_04]: appearances.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, who knows, maybe he would even be
interested in being on the show and just
[SPEAKER_04]: talking more about, you know, what he's
learned in the course of five years with
[SPEAKER_04]: working with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can check out some of the videos of
his on YouTube, his Apical Ag channel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that really helps put things
into perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first started working with him,
he didn't really have general levels for
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, but now he's doing it.
And he's been doing it for a while now.
And he's been doing it for a while now,
but he's been doing it for a while now,
and he's been doing it for a while now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's the way he does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which has been really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can kind of see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Originally, what it was, was we were
basically looking at the concentrations of
[SPEAKER_04]: any given mineral or nutrient,
the gradient, if you will, between the old
[SPEAKER_04]: and the new leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, if something was 300% in
the old leaf, then it was in the new leaf,
[SPEAKER_04]: like I mentioned before, I mean,
that's a toxicity.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant doesn't want that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's there, you know, it's being
uptake in any way, and it's causing some
[SPEAKER_04]: major problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he, yeah, he's really the guy to sort
of talk to about, you know, what he's
[SPEAKER_04]: learned.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's taught me a whole bunch with
respect to how to acknowledge or to
[SPEAKER_04]: respond, you know, what are the action
items that come from seeing that something
[SPEAKER_04]: is, you know, deficient at surplus or
actually at levels that are toxic for the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that has sent me down a whole other
rabbit hole, if you will, of trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: learn plant physiology, from the
standpoint of, you know, what's going on
[SPEAKER_04]: inside of the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what are these mechanisms inside of
the plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what are the transport proteins?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the different organs?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's, you know, what level of diffusion
or active transport is involved with this
[SPEAKER_04]: one?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, okay, yeah, going back to what Eric
said, there's going to be variation from
[SPEAKER_04]: crop to crop and from strain to strain,
if you will, from, you know, between
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics and in terms of what the nutrient
use efficiency is going to be for this
[SPEAKER_04]: strain or that crop versus another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's a great tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you're in Oregon or growing
something other than cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: send David a sample and just start to look
over that and see what you can learn about
[SPEAKER_04]: your own crop, because those targeted
applications are really what it's all
[SPEAKER_04]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want to apply anything that's,
you know, that we don't need to be
[SPEAKER_04]: applying.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just want to sort of fill in the gaps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, it's a bandaid for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with cannabis, it's been a very
valuable tool, because of what we talked
[SPEAKER_04]: about before being in these very unnatural
environments where we don't have a season
[SPEAKER_04]: of rest, a season to gather energy in the
soil, in some cases, like in these
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse settings, it's just go,
go, go, you know, clients that are 2030
[SPEAKER_04]: rounds in on soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, you know, three, four crops a
year, that's that can be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, we slowly gather this data
and look at all these points.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we respond and we go with what works
and we go with what moves the needle in
[SPEAKER_04]: terms of the data and the direction that
we're trying to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's been immensely helpful where,
you know, I have cannabis clients as well
[SPEAKER_04]: that are right in native soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's more like clockwork in terms of
this regenerative process that we're all
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can inoculate in the fall, we can get
some of those minerals down in the fall,
[SPEAKER_04]: we use cover crop, we inoculate that cover
crop seed with the microbes we want to
[SPEAKER_04]: proliferate in that soil over the,
you know, fall and winter and early
[SPEAKER_04]: spring, and barely have to use inputs
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, grow a great cannabis crop
right in native soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the Appalachians of origin thing
that we were talking about via email the
[SPEAKER_04]: other day a little bit, that's going to
proliferate you know, the number of
[SPEAKER_04]: operations that are willing to plant
cannabis in the native soil, which is what
[SPEAKER_04]: they should be doing if they can,
that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this stuff goes a little more by the
book when you when you're working with
[SPEAKER_04]: nature, and it's a little bit more complex
when you're in an indoor setting or a four
[SPEAKER_04]: season greenhouse setting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've even sent clients to Eric,
because, you know, he's really the guy
[SPEAKER_04]: that's talking to in terms of what the
environment and what the appliances and
[SPEAKER_04]: the levels of this and that and the
atmosphere really need to look like and
[SPEAKER_04]: how do you smooth out this seasonal shift.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think he talks about the
summer and the winter mode and greenhouses
[SPEAKER_04]: and most people aren't, they aren't ready
for it when winter hits and then,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you see a drastic drop in
production and new problems arise and all
[SPEAKER_04]: kinds of stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, it's more complex and we
need all kinds of people and experts to
[SPEAKER_04]: really help on that front, you know,
if we're going to continue to do this
[SPEAKER_04]: thing year round in those types of
environments.
[SPEAKER_04]: Music .
[SPEAKER_04]: .
