[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have this great idea about I want
to be an entrepreneur and start a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's a scientific company,
which requires expensive analytical
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment and things like a laboratory,
fume hood, safety shower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's definitely a capital need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to find someone that's
either a high net worth individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a business plan together,
started talking to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of professional funders,
angel investors, or investment bankers
[SPEAKER_00]: were like, that sounds like a great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in 2009, their risk appetite or
willingness to enter into this space was
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely very different than what we
hear about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still today, a lot of people are still
hesitant, but are quite curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really took a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a number of months with the idea
and the plan in place and understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: how you could get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first plan I wrote required a
significant amount of money and the
[SPEAKER_00]: millions of dollars to go ahead and do it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all I could raise was $150,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as every good entrepreneur will have to
do, you have to figure out how to make do
[SPEAKER_00]: with what you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be determined and persistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that's my opportunity, I'm going to
make the most of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll rework my plan and figure out how to
bootstrap from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the biggest blessing in disguise I
ever got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't outspend ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went very carefully, slowly,
methodically.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bought one HPLC and got our equipment
in the right building, a very well suited
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started working really hard from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And didn't understand that when we
started, other labs would start with quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a different model in terms of what
equipment they were using, what types of
[SPEAKER_00]: costs they would charge for their testing,
that the market wasn't quite ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't sure what that really meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really have to try and
continuously invent yourself and reinvent
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself to adapt to the conditions and
the marketplace that's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't understand initially how much
education would need to be given and how
[SPEAKER_00]: time consuming and challenging that really
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our first choice of analytical equipment
was an HPLC, a liquid chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone else was using gas
chromatographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people thought that's the only way you
can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I want to do something
different?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you do something different,
you get more information, but that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually ends up being somewhat confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't test for just THC, but THC
acid, which is what the plant makes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm making, wait a minute, I thought we
were talking about THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're mentioning another cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you say, I have to heat it to form
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden you start to lose people's
willingness to try and test or understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what's really going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a long period of time for people
to even accept that it has to be a liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: chromatograph to get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the stuff that all of us had
thought about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my scientific friends and I bantered
back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you want to choose this equipment
over the other ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: The other ones are cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the assessment at the end was this is
the only tool that can look at all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: broad base of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every type of product that I'm going to
use, this is the one I need to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was half the capital that we raised
was going towards this decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the biggest decision we could
imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other decision of not paying yourself
was a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's typically what most entrepreneurs
have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years worth of no salary or working very
hard out of the garage, they often call
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard work, dedication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many days were up till two in the morning,
three in the morning to try and get the
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid turnaround times we had promised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Driving around to collect samples to make
sure they were scientifically valid and
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And was just fortunate to convince a very
nice and kind friend of a friend
[SPEAKER_00]: individual to take that risk on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we were going to do whatever it took
to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to do it all right,
completely legitimately, above board and
[SPEAKER_00]: really be standing pillars of scientific
excellence and professionalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that took a number of months to
convince that individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it wasn't for a wonderful Christmas
gift my father gave me at the end of that
[SPEAKER_00]: year, I probably wouldn't have had the
funds to survive until that individual
[SPEAKER_00]: made his decision and said, okay,
I'll hand over my significant funds to get
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys started.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fortunately, we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: To every entrepreneur out there,
just keep trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let anyone tell you no.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you believe in yourself and what you're
doing and you know it's right,
[SPEAKER_00]: that determination is what's going to take
you through the really long days,
[SPEAKER_00]: the hard pieces of effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is never a get rich quick type idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a labor of love and a lot of hard
work that will get you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not this, you know, oh, I have an
idea and tomorrow all of a sudden it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: big success.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot more complicated than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think many entrepreneurs don't
understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see this is really good and I can
have a lot of benefits from that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they kind of miss the part that's all
the hard work towards getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this realm with cannabis,
it's exceptionally difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, I like a challenge myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: No greater challenge of being an
entrepreneur than this one because you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got an extra layer of legal complexity,
other things that might cause barriers to
[SPEAKER_00]: entry for others, and you need competitive
advantage if you can figure it all out
[SPEAKER_00]: before others can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being at the utmost responsible level
though and operating transparently,
[SPEAKER_00]: operating to be a very professional and
respected member of the community and
[SPEAKER_00]: society in general, and doing things that
are not, you know, looked at as favorable
[SPEAKER_00]: by everyone causes unique challenges too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely difficult to deal with
everyone in that fashion, but that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: only way that we wanted to operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It raises unique challenges that you
didn't quite think about in your business
[SPEAKER_00]: plan, but it's a testament of,
well, that's what I'm having to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what we're going to go figure
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say every entrepreneur just
keep trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best thing.
