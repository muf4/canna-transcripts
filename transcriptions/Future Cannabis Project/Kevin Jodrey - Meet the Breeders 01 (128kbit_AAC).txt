[SPEAKER_00]: These people that I respect prior to the
change in regulation, and my whole desire
[SPEAKER_00]: for that interview series was to propel
people forward so that they could survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really nice to interview the same
people again that are still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're different directions,
different skill sets, different desires,
[SPEAKER_00]: but all of them, you know, to me,
premium breeders, people that I've used to
[SPEAKER_00]: steer people into success with their
material, and people that I've used to
[SPEAKER_00]: steer my own self into success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to let them basically
just chop up, I think we only got one mic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we'll do is we'll just let them
introduce each one by one what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, and then we'll start getting into
some, what are you doing right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because all of you involved in interesting
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an excellent story to listen to
because these people are just the same as
[SPEAKER_00]: you, where they're individuals that are
fighting their way through the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way that it's going to really
work is if you're using the material,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it into play, and then they're
able to then keep creating stuff that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can put into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really have a true symbiotic
relationship as cultivator, breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kevin here has been a troubadour of our
culture and the region, and has probably
[SPEAKER_01]: had just about as far of a reach as
anybody in sort of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: singing the, you know, really just like
telling the story the way it needs to get
[SPEAKER_01]: told.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially with, you know, sun-grown
cannabis and organic regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you, Kevin, so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my name is Nat Pennington.
[SPEAKER_01]: I founded Humboldt Seed Company in early
2000s, and I started breeding cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt County in 1999 when my daughter
was born, who's here with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just incredibly honored to be up
here with the illustrious Freeborn
[SPEAKER_01]: Selections and Mean Gene, and of course
Jason from EQ Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the vague introduction here.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Jackson.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go by Mean Gene, Freeborn Selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been breeding stuff since the
90s, keeping stuff since the mid 90s since
[SPEAKER_02]: I was pretty much a kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just looking through things and trying
to make better plants for, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: originally just me and my buddies so we
could have something a little better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And trying to improve and keep stuff
around and not lose the stuff that's cool
[SPEAKER_02]: that we want to be able to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, thanks to Kev and these
guys for doing this, kind of shining a
[SPEAKER_02]: light on, you know, the positive aspect of
what can be done and not just dumping a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of garbage into the earth to try to
make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah, thanks everybody for coming
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my name is Jason Mathis, and I started
Equilibrium Genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to thank Kev.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, Mean Gene and Matt,
you know, for coming out here and being on
[SPEAKER_03]: the panel with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so everybody hear me in the back?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really great to have opportunities
like this to bring the community together.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on right now in California is
breaking my heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a long road for me coming from
the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm originally from Northern Virginia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been really involved in drug
policy activism.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I worked a really long time for a
number of organizations to help pass laws
[SPEAKER_03]: across the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I finally get to legalization in
California, and now I see what a monster
[SPEAKER_03]: it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just breaking my heart seeing
what's happening to our community.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to stress that everybody
just stay vigilant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to improve these laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've seen a lot, you know,
happen in the past year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't know if anybody was going to
show up today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to see this many faces in the
room who are still doing this,
[SPEAKER_03]: it just, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when, what is a good mic?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pass this one to you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to take this one right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we had the first Regen event in
Vancouver, it blew my mind at who was
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I realized that this had grown in
this organic way of people who wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually continue cannabis culture and
agricultural integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I saw the, the people that were
at the event and I, I knew the speakers
[SPEAKER_00]: were all solid because I look through them
and I've met a bunch of them, but I met
[SPEAKER_00]: the people in the room and I couldn't
believe the level of commitment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, Whoa, we're definitely going
to be all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have to fight, but there is
a lot of people that are about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have this one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, this isn't my event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just putting on some of this
presentation today, but I didn't organize
[SPEAKER_00]: this event.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't create the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a helper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just grateful to be part of it,
but it blew my mind when we had to go find
[SPEAKER_00]: another venue because it was too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that's not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from Jason's point of view,
someone who came from the South where you
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely regulated and he, and he comes
out to California and gets involved in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and then sees the changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for him to say, Whoa, I didn't expect
to see anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, you know, you see a
building it's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, we're going to jump around
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some time, you know, and,
and I want to get into some information
[SPEAKER_00]: about, you know, what do you use the base
material you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first thing I wanted to hit in
that, cause I haven't had a chance to chat
[SPEAKER_00]: with them is Nat did something interesting
where he did a giant mega pheno hunt and
[SPEAKER_00]: he, he tied a bunch of people into it so
that he could actually get the number of
[SPEAKER_00]: participants required to look at material
in all these different circumstances and
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's used that orange phytonics box.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that he would be able to do a lot of
the metrics himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we never got a chance to chat about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if it got covered enough
really, because I don't know if anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: hunted a population that big here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you, you might, you know,
that's, you're like a, I come from a
[SPEAKER_00]: family of whalers, historic whalers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's always a joke that we're
out whaling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's whaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking for that white whale and I
definitely went crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I should name a strain Moby Dick or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Kev.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess sort of the impetus for that
was just, this is practice of phenotype
[SPEAKER_01]: hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that I know,
you know, all of us have really probably
[SPEAKER_01]: done in our lives, whether it was like in
an organized, an intentional way or
[SPEAKER_01]: whether we, you know, bred our own seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how many people in here are
breeders?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how many people have either,
even accidentally, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mean, it's something that
I think can be done collaboratively and
[SPEAKER_01]: can sort of feed back into what we kind of
need in our community where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't have access to quite as ample
flat ag land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe we don't, you know, maybe our
county makes it harder than it really
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be to have permits and get
licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think one of the strategies can
just be to, to use our innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so doing that in a collaborative way
with a bunch of people seemed like it
[SPEAKER_01]: might be, you know, a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started that last, or 2017 in
the fall, we kind of came up with the idea
[SPEAKER_01]: and ended up, I think around like 15
different farms or groups tied into it and
[SPEAKER_01]: went around and had a few big events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the process involved taking a lot of
cuttings before flower and keeping them
[SPEAKER_01]: alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, a lot of labeling from the
field to the, to the clone room,
[SPEAKER_01]: making sure that that didn't get messed
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was quite an effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And definitely some of the folks in this
room were, were on that team and they know
[SPEAKER_01]: how hard it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think Daniel took three or 400 of
them himself, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, just kind of coming together
like that in a group effort and trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: really improve genetic lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have a group of friends at Davis
that I ended up getting close with doing
[SPEAKER_01]: like salmon genomics research and,
you know, they're really very brilliant
[SPEAKER_01]: geneticists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of a question that I had said was
like, well, what, what are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go out and find markers and do all
this fancy marker assisted breeding and
[SPEAKER_01]: all this stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they kind of said, you know what,
you guys kind of already are doing what
[SPEAKER_01]: you really should be doing, which is just
like hunting through populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, cannabis is like this exciting,
really brand new thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even though we're all facing down
the barrel of corporate America coming
[SPEAKER_01]: with its free markets and commodity
pricing, I think, you know, there is still
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of exciting things to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said the, no matter what the
Syngenta's and the Monsanto's,
[SPEAKER_01]: no matter how heavy they come in with
biotech and, and the capabilities of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, mass sequencing and all that
stuff, it really takes a human who knows
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant really well to be able to even,
you know, inform any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're still years away and they still
have to learn about this plant that we all
[SPEAKER_01]: know so well because we've worked with it
for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, when all hope is lost,
I think sometimes it's, you can just
[SPEAKER_01]: remember that like we're a powerful,
you know, we're a powerful contingent if
[SPEAKER_01]: we're a collaborative contingent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want what he's on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So phenotype hunting, I mean, I think,
you know, Gene, you want to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype hunting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was going to ask you, we can go
into the piece, but there was some stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that all three you're doing that are
interesting, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wanted to give a chance for you
to talk about the megapheno hunt and the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that I don't think anybody really
understood the scope of what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm somebody who likes to hunt populations
and I'm like, ooh, you are hunting a big
[SPEAKER_00]: population and you had a lot of people
helping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a lot of people involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a logistical nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to use some modern equipment that
was portable to allow you to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: afford to do it because, holy Christ,
having a lab test that much stuff would
[SPEAKER_00]: have bankrupted you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so then all of a sudden you
become a competent field lab operator
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're having to make sure that
the tests are actually standardized so
[SPEAKER_00]: they make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that was just something I
thought was awesome and I just didn't see
[SPEAKER_00]: enough coverage of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Gene, and for the sake of transparency
too, I do business with all these guys
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning that my store carries their
products, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this isn't a sales pitch for them,
but you got to say that otherwise
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's trying to push something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, I'm just trying to push
what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point is that Gene released his
own line of pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the first time I seen me and
Gene come out as a pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was always typically all genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question was are you having to
change your lines to work with your new
[SPEAKER_00]: direction in flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you able to use the existing tools?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you noticing from a breeder's
point of view?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that all of you are excellent
cultivators too because I smoked all your.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you having to do to shape and
shift into that new realm of product
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity that you're doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the trip about that was basically
that I myself, I roll a joint in my hand,
[SPEAKER_02]: I hold the weed, I break it in my hand,
I roll it up and I smoke it right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like to roll my joints and then
smoke them later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So myself, I'm not a pre-roll guy,
but the weird thing is that at
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries, people either want to buy a
little bud or they want to buy a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's mostly what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, my buddy was just like,
hey, we got your flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to put them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, can we stick your name on
it and say, oh, this is these flavors,
[SPEAKER_02]: so that there's basic brand recognition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's so important right now for
people to be able to look at something and
[SPEAKER_02]: go, OK, I've heard of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People want things on their shelves that
have some recognition to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the stuff that we all regard as
being hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, OK, there's different forms of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a big part of it is really just brand
recognition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And any time you're selling something,
you want people to be able to look and go,
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I would buy that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pre-roll thing is funny to me because
I was like, yeah, you can put it on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't call them pre-rolls though.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to call them joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole pre-roll thing is funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've made jokes about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked about that for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how to make a pre-roll?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how to roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the trip about it is with the whole
thing, it's like, OK, now you got the
[SPEAKER_02]: weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's got to get tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they want you to test the pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has to be rolled up before the
testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes you forever to get the testing
back and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like, in general, for me,
I'm like, OK, well, you're already looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at it being, to me, it's degraded.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because people are going to be buying
pre-rolls, I'm like, well, a pre-roll is a
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the weed was good that went into it,
it's going to be one of the better
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just a trip because of the way
the market is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I would like to be able to say,
OK, here, this is weed in a jar,
[SPEAKER_02]: on the stick, hardly trimmed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can really look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see where those outer leaves super
healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to look at it like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: People always look at my weed I carry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, you didn't trim it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yeah, I didn't trim it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the features.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see how far the resin grows out on
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone gives me weed and the big
leaves are removed, then I'm happy with
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I pull off those leaves, I'm seeing
it completely untouched.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not going to work on the
market, unfortunately, because people look
[SPEAKER_02]: at stuff in a jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want it just like what people call
poodle cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want it cut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh, half the hairs are cut off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just weird, because with the new
thing, everything has to be changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to touch back on what he was talking
about with the value of people who are
[SPEAKER_02]: real weed people in the new paradigm of
how everything is, I came to the
[SPEAKER_02]: realization, talking to a buddy of mine,
if you really know something, and you
[SPEAKER_02]: really have experience, and you've really
done stuff, you have an advantage over
[SPEAKER_02]: these people who just have really deep
pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really disappointed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand the reality that people see,
OK, here's this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to bring this to the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, they have deep pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have this knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what people are going to start to
understand, and I mean, I'll just tell all
[SPEAKER_02]: you right now so you can maybe hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before you have to learn for yourself,
those people basically, you're disposable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So information only goes as far as
information goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as they have your information,
or they have whatever they're getting from
[SPEAKER_02]: you, they're going to throw you away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't matter what kind of contract
you have or any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If these people have that deep of pockets,
eventually, they're going to shit on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just a point that I wanted to
bring up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That if you have something, and you've got
these big investors, or whoever they are,
[SPEAKER_02]: these big corporate dudes, and they're
like, we've got to have this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they want to, oh, we're going to give
you all this money and do all this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't give it to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch them fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then help people who you know are
actually trying to make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'll have this huge advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is that we're all down a
little bit right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's messed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you see an opportunity,
you go, well, I better not, everything's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I better jump on the opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's almost like an analogy would be
like, all right, well, we've almost fished
[SPEAKER_02]: out all the salmon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I should just go fish a shitload before
they're gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we've almost cut down all the old
growth redwood.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I better cut down my old growth redwood
before it's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people are taking this really
priceless valuable stuff, and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: giving it to the man, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're just getting fucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then these dudes are coming up with
these killer ways of operating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in a lot of cases, they can't really
understand it anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: They still need the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've just been seeing with a lot of
people, they're like, oh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, we need you for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need you for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: People get these jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets a little bit further in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they go, ah, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the old Eddie Murphy,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what do you say we kick Clarence out
of the band and steal all his good ideas
[SPEAKER_02]: with the Beatles?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Fifth Beetle is like, oh, OK,
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just kick you out and take all your
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of what's happening with
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what he was talking about with
like, OK, you have these things of value.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have something of value and
people are basically trying to take it
[SPEAKER_02]: from you, it's a bummer because a lot of
people have really helped the assholes to
[SPEAKER_02]: get further.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're not really going to wind
up getting anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if they need to take, I mean,
everybody here who's been doing stuff for
[SPEAKER_02]: a long time remembers when you first tried
to grow really good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you first tried to dry it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you first tried to have everything
come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you saw your buddy's weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you went, man, his weed's always
better than mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how these guys would have to
deal for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they're getting people basically
like us to come in and tell them how to do
[SPEAKER_02]: everything right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're basically going to get your
ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to throw you away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as much as you can, these things are so
cool because right now, I know anybody who
[SPEAKER_02]: wants to come to something like this isn't
a bunch of assholes, essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: All you guys are looking at a different
aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, that's where it should be
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that should almost be locked off from
everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you want everyone to get the
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, it's like you got to
keep it out of the wrong hands a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit too because it's getting watered down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see it fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've just been hearing so many horror
stories from buddies who are like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, they put me on.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to use my genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to do all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then pretty soon, they're like,
damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I showed up at the meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, I'm out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they got all my ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're the ones with the deep
pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't have lawyers that can battle
their lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, that was something that he
said.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just the new thing is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: What brought that to mind was talking
about being able to market, being able to
[SPEAKER_02]: leverage things, trying to basically find
the people to help out who you know are
[SPEAKER_02]: like-minded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't just look for the golden goose
and try to jump on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can keep your things small.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still just grow some weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still just sell a little and not
chase after this idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be two worlds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's the one world that's going
on that everybody's overly ambitious going
[SPEAKER_02]: for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's the world that basically
all you guys are in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just really don't even get caught
up thinking that any of that has any value
[SPEAKER_02]: really for any of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is that people think that if
you don't get it solved right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to solve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you didn't get here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took you a whole life to get here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might as well just keep marching
forward and be intelligent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, people try to access stuff for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm good at picking up sneaky shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like to play with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But new people are coming to pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they send people to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is they have a very directed
questioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can pick it up because it's not
organically derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's scripted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you get that, now you can
trounce those guys too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be careful with who you endorse.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a good reputation for what you
do, be careful because they can take it
[SPEAKER_00]: from you and then it's no longer yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you've worked for this
whole time really is a level of integrity
[SPEAKER_00]: and trust to where nobody's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, you're pretty
reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that is called goodwill
in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And goodwill is very, very valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that are coming in need the
goodwill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can then make their marketing
occur and get trust and buy-in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you get left is basically
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't mean you can't work with
individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like in my case, if I do anything
contractual, I have my own lawyers write
[SPEAKER_00]: the contracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pay for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have my own lawyers come with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though people go, no, no,
we don't need a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, yeah, I always need a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go to court, I bring an attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know they're going to talk a
language that I really don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always equate it to bring in Mike
Tyson to a bar fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That if you had to get into a bar fight
and you went with Mike Tyson, he would
[SPEAKER_00]: say, I got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really good at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me handle this part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you now just keep an eye on my back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of how I see the stuff
that we're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, every time you have to put the
money out to cover the attorney to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: deal, it's your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're cash driving us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really why we always bring back
to that common that the people around you
[SPEAKER_00]: are the ones that you got here with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're the ones that you're going to
have to team up with and share resources
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, it's not a bad thing to
put the farm down for a season and not
[SPEAKER_00]: farm it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't afford to make that product
sell, it'd be better to let it sit for a
[SPEAKER_00]: season and go get a job working with your
other friends on their farm and then pick
[SPEAKER_00]: up the operation again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I let my own farm sit last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way it worked with permitting was they
wanted to put me off until August on a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, no, why would I want a plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a plant in August.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, it's better that I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won't pay the excise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't have to pay the taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just have to make sure I work
harder on my other stuff because I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get the income that I had hoped
to get from the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also realized that there was no
guarantee on the income either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you start playing this game of
desperation, you put yourself in a
[SPEAKER_00]: situation you can't get out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you take a look at your whole life,
every major screw up you made,
[SPEAKER_00]: you made out of desperation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it took away good judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is some important stuff to
really understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason's been a busy boy, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're somebody that I follow the drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if anybody drives more
than him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally, when I met him, his car looked
like he had put it together with duct
[SPEAKER_00]: tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, bro, I'm doing a lot of
driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I see him in a new car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, bro, I'm doing a lot of
driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's getting his product out into the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a really good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an interesting product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what have you been doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Kev.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've been busy, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And still investor free, still broke,
still just in the struggle, like all of
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really good listening to you guys
talk because the sharks are out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was everything you guys were
saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's everything that I've been going
through for the past couple years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just feeling desperate, feeling like
you want to go talk to these people that
[SPEAKER_03]: say that they got solutions for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they really don't at the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just want to hear you talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just want to put the tape on record
and let you just go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so OK, so we captured that.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, now let's go tempt the next guy
and try to get what he's got.
[SPEAKER_03]: And none of those things ever amounted to
anything other than me spinning my wheels
[SPEAKER_03]: in front of a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And would have been better off just going
and getting a job working for somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: else if that was what I was going to keep
doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exactly what you said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you get a contract even that's solid
as can be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they can still switch things up a
month or two down the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got your cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got your seeds or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got all your plan and how you do
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then now they got some other dude they
hired for $12 an hour to go and do
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that you were doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not going to happen if you're
self-employed doing it for you,
[SPEAKER_03]: with your friends, with people that you
have real relationships with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: still struggling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still driving the miles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully for many more years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I came here to California almost penniless
with a few hundred bucks in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lived in a bathroom for seven months.
[SPEAKER_03]: In East Oakland.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I still go back to there sometimes
where it's like I'm doing all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was all right then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm all right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all about feeling inside you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And getting desperate is kind of like you
have this vision of like, oh, I could be
[SPEAKER_03]: with this big group doing all these fancy
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or it's very unlikely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you try to see what kind of
compromises you can make to achieve that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like a lot of that is just
smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the folks that are out there doing
this can probably, they're going to make
[SPEAKER_03]: it really tough in the next few years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear people talking about that they're
going to be selling below cost in the
[SPEAKER_03]: future.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be big groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys already know all their names.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're out there to crush.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to have to have something
unique and special and highlight the
[SPEAKER_03]: people aspect of this more than anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the community is why I'm part of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I wanted to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I want to make the seeds for
future generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: For other people past when I'm dead and
gone are going to be going and growing
[SPEAKER_03]: these strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't feel like if I've released a seed,
and you guys see on the shelf,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can do whatever you want with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can breed with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can share it with your friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to take any offense to
anybody working with my work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's what I'm doing with other
people's work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't invent cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't create any of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just making my own crosses trying to
provide to the other people in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just try to stay humble and keep
doing the work that makes me feel good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's serving the community and being a
part of the community and feeling like I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: part of a family that makes me want to get
up in the morning and go do things.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I came all the way out here to
see all you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And back to what I was saying before about
what's going on with the cannabis laws
[SPEAKER_03]: where nobody that I knew in the game two
years ago was even allowed to participate
[SPEAKER_03]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know that that's not what I was
working for when I was working for the
[SPEAKER_03]: Students for Sensible Drug Policy and Drug
Policy Alliance and these other big groups
[SPEAKER_03]: that I've definitely put in a lot of
volunteer hours for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like there's still a lot to be
desired in California cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're supposed to be ground zero for the
best cannabis in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see the community that carried the
water for so many years through the scary
[SPEAKER_03]: times being shut out of this thing where
other folks are jumping in that didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: They never had dirt under their
fingernails.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, I don't know the answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But something tells me it comes through
community and us getting together and
[SPEAKER_03]: strengthen numbers and making sure that we
get active at the local level and at the
[SPEAKER_03]: state level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be hard to follow you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was curious is you're all working
on interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know some of the work you're doing,
all three of you, but you're always
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly refining and switching process.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's something you're excited about this
year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's for the market or not,
but what's something you're into yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're working with you'd like to see
people access in any form?
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh, so many things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to say on what Jason had
brought up and what me and Jean brought
[SPEAKER_01]: up, Beth, did you speak this weekend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Beth Schechter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Open Cannabis Project looks to
protect the cultivar, the strains that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're all known and loved for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully combinations of all of them
so that we can all keep doing the work
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've been doing, breeding and
cultivating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a nonprofit organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's definitely going to be some
big bad wolves come in to get genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You hide them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't come to an event like this and say,
here, have a few of this and a few of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because maybe there's somebody in the room
or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we just got to kind of support an
organization like that is really the best
[SPEAKER_01]: way that we can keep cannabis open source
and keep the genetics of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: accessible to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the Syngentes and the Monsantos
would like to just tie up all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, there's this phenomena
that's unusual where something has been
[SPEAKER_01]: under prohibition since in all of modern
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been basically illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any innovation that has happened has
not been documented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because just like at Humboldt C Company,
we'd keep frickin' notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the breeding season, and then burn
them in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it was like, I'm not trying to
keep notes around about how many goddamn
[SPEAKER_01]: plants I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: A charge enhancement back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: A charge enhancement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were in the game, I caught an extra
couple years on a case I had to fight
[SPEAKER_00]: because I had spreadsheets comparing
operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gave me a criminal mastermind
charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all laughed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, if I was so smart,
I wouldn't get fucking caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nonetheless, the enhancement was
really punishing because I was using tools
[SPEAKER_00]: to document work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was impossible to keep this much data
when you're running this many operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had my hand in a lot of cookie jaws
way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those folks that look to capitalize
so much could easily come in and try to
[SPEAKER_01]: say that they've created something that's
new when really Mean Gene's been breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: it for 20 goddamn years and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good organization to support.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate what Beth's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as some exciting stuff that we're
doing, I think really that big phenotype
[SPEAKER_01]: hunt effort was exciting for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what else is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to release the product this
year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be dropping the sort of selected
cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Daniel's farm, we picked one that
we're calling Magic Melon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one just really smells like
melons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of gassy, fuel finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel really just happy to be able to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Work in cannabis and share the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got an email the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked at the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it was kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It said burpee in the email.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I replied to the email and did some
fishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, it was burpee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they big bad wolf or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I didn't follow the corporate
ladder all the way up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the kind of stuff that's
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we got to keep charging forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So exciting things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just breeding more and more all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're doing some genotyping and
putting it in the public space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a way that you can, once you do
that, if you don't patent it in a year,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it becomes public domain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what I would call defensive
IP versus offensive IP, which is getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: patent and sending out cease and desist
letters to everybody in the room who
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't pay you a fee for growing it or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there's, I'm not saying
I'm completely opposed to patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think definitely that it's a
slippery slope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of things out there that
should just be public domain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if I could just take a snapshot of
the whole cannabis space right now and
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that that could continue to be
the way it is and people could continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow the plant, I think that would be a
good thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it costs a lot of money to genotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not the only solution,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other ways to go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I'm excited about the weeping
tears.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to doom and gloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, though, we're all in the
real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone in the room is in the real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it is the struggle,
because that's so much the reality of what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're having to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to make sure, though,
is that the things that you see and that
[SPEAKER_00]: interest you because you guys are the
painters that create the ink that we use
[SPEAKER_00]: to do our work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you broke out the melon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the thing was, you say,
hey, no, what we found was something that
[SPEAKER_00]: was unbelievably melony with the beautiful
fuel back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think it would be attractive and it
would be valuable for the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm seeking from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the part about us all struggling is as
real as it can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to make light of it,
because otherwise you go home and cry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tissue paper is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about you, Big Gene?
[SPEAKER_00]: What you messing around with?
[SPEAKER_00]: What direction do you go with your lines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you work some lines that you've
had for a long time, but you switch the
[SPEAKER_00]: direction on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of neat, because it lets you
swing a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, what I'd really like to do
is I'll do those fresh hybrids and then
[SPEAKER_02]: try to go through and seed a lot of plants
every time I do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you can go in all these different
directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you make that fresh hybrid,
if stuff is fairly consistent you start
[SPEAKER_02]: with, then it's pretty predictable to know
what you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when you make that F2,
you get all the weirdness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you get all the weirdness,
then that's where you can make one thing
[SPEAKER_02]: into a million things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with some of them, I've tried to take
them different directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some of them is just a real clear
direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this year, I'm really trying to work
on the root beer stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cool, because it's a trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: With doing seeds, there's a whole lot of
seeds that are really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all are really valid in the space
as far as going OK, we need to have all
[SPEAKER_02]: these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really a trip, because when you
go to actually sell a lot of weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: it kind of has to look a certain way.
[SPEAKER_02]: There has to be something about it where
it's like, OK, that's shiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: People really like a little color to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to at least have a silver look,
if not dark or purple or blue or red or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regular green bud better be really tasty
and really stinky to be able to compete.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the root beer is a cool one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the way it smokes, the way it
grows, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this year, I'm trying to do like a back
cross to that clone twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the original mail I started with was
almost the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was already pretty consistent right
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then going back to it a couple times
made it really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what I'm going to try to do with
that is I'll probably go back one more
[SPEAKER_02]: time to the root beer clone to make it so
that it's really root beer seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it has got more and more frequent
when you back cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everything does that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's too inconsistent, it throws too
much weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it comes through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it dominates in the crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think what I'm going to do while
it's still just a little more open at the
[SPEAKER_02]: two back crosses, I'm probably going to do
a bunch of out crosses of it this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then do the same thing with the cherry
limeade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason being that when you get,
like if you go to get clones from
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody, you know how it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you have to, everything's cool
to have some like, OK, I'm going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: some of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when people like want units and weight
of something, you have to be able to have
[SPEAKER_02]: something that people look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if they don't know the name,
it's recognizably what they is in their
[SPEAKER_02]: paradigm of what's the dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the best weed might look like
shoelaces and be all messed up and look
[SPEAKER_02]: like Dr. Greenspoon or something,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you when you really want
something that you can have in your bag to
[SPEAKER_02]: people go, OK, you just want that instant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, there it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those are things that do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You open the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I'm trying to do that because when
you, you know, you want to have plants
[SPEAKER_02]: that grow well for you as a farmer and
then you need a product that's really
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the whole thing I was talking
about with like with brand recognitions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people go, oh, it's hype,
it's hype, it's hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, hype, hype doesn't last.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I remember when cookies came out,
it was like, that's hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, maybe it's not as good as
it's not as strong as headband or cam or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever is your thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're you know, it's like if if it
was just hype, it wouldn't be here 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years after I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the crosses are still that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you really get into it,
you go, OK, this is cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but the reason why it's valuable to
grow it is because, you know, when you
[SPEAKER_02]: finish it, you can sell it like if you're
a tomato farmer, you know, most people are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to wind up like, OK, this one has
shelf life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to grow these Roma's.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to grow these really cool heirloom
rainbow tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you go in the store, there's only
a little bit of those over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got this whole tier of these Roma's
over here, what our beef steaks or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to grow those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need things to fit in people's
paradigm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to put out some stuff that's
really like people go, oh, it's the hype
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's just it's another gelato cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this or it's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a trip because if you don't have
something that people on a knee jerk
[SPEAKER_02]: reaction will look at and go, that's the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what everybody wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then do you really want to have three
hundred and fifty pounds of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to you want to have a quarter
pound for your head or whatever to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, maybe you got somebody who
wants this or that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I'm just trying to really
make sure that like the stuff that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: putting out is stuff that when you're done
with it, it's what people come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like this last stuff I released was
like I had that pina, the pina a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: times a CBD plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's super hardy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's structures grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does will not get p.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like so easy and such a great,
you know, you could probably dry farm it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have seen my buddy leave the pina
cross cherries that I made in some three
[SPEAKER_02]: gallon pots, basically in a in a desert,
in a in a greenhouse that wasn't being
[SPEAKER_02]: grown in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like a hundred and thirty degree
desert in there every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plants he watered them when they
were starts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They never grew, but then they budded and
they finished and there was this killer
[SPEAKER_02]: weed in there that we basically found
going to his house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, that's got value,
too, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but it's we that when people,
you know, originally I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: People only want Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have a little bit of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People would show up and they'd be like,
no, we want more of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, you know, something trying
trying to put stuff out that's actually
[SPEAKER_02]: like can really be practical for people
that are farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the sky cover Kush, like that's
Nikona's favorite weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like got the knee jerk.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells gassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as a grower, too, it's really
performing, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just the focus of like the stuff
that I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: In general is to be like that,
like I love the lime and the lime is
[SPEAKER_02]: great, but the lime is a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little more leafy when you grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so I'm trying to work it into a
little bit more different stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like cross it back with an OG,
keeps the nose, gets a little meat on the
[SPEAKER_02]: bones.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the lime pop Kush is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get the huge plants if you're growing
big plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been working on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I made like I took like the
cherry lime made F5 and I put it on
[SPEAKER_02]: gelato, sherb, you know, things that
you're like, oh, that's a stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, yeah, but that's what
people want in their bag to buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you you got to have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of the stuff I've been I've
been trying to work on more stuff that's
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the same time, I'm always
doing my regular stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for me that I, you know,
that I vibe with even more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I, you know, you can't help but but
also vibe with something that you look at
[SPEAKER_02]: it and you go, whoa, well, that's
incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I went to the ego clash in Hoplan
down there and I saw all the stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody go, I walked up and they go,
which one, which one, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: would you say would be good out of there?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I missed the part where you smoke and
all that and I just looked in the case and
[SPEAKER_02]: I was all that number 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks like that's that's fire right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is, but it looks
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got that good old school gany frosted
up look.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they announced the winner and
they're like, oh, the number 14 gelato 41
[SPEAKER_02]: or something, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, you can't really argue with
you can't just just high cookie strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it's like you can't argue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, I learned that from a guy
that was in fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've not historically been known as
someone who's been fashionable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I asked people who are fashionable
about, you know, fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, you can't argue with trends
that people do because what you're saying
[SPEAKER_00]: is that you're not intelligent enough to
recognize that they made the choice to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens is you cut yourself
right out of the trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the same with what
you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants at the bottom line is if if 41
cut wasn't hot, then why is it moving at a
[SPEAKER_00]: rate that's supernatural?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't mean you need to jump on
it, but you need to understand why the
[SPEAKER_00]: why.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I learned from someone is to there's
two things in life, those that know how
[SPEAKER_00]: and those that know why and those that
know how work for those that know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for us, it's the why that's what's
important for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, we end up just being how how do
we make it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to understand why are we
making it and what is that direction?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see all these modern cultivars that
are red hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are my personal preference,
but I don't deny the fact that it moves at
[SPEAKER_00]: an unbelievable velocity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do objective testing where I
take I take things that I think are hot
[SPEAKER_00]: and I give them to people who are in
markets that are unbelievably picky and
[SPEAKER_00]: they have money, which means they have
access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I let them run them to find out
compared to each other which one has the
[SPEAKER_00]: velocity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it lets me really understand of
these elites, which one really is the
[SPEAKER_00]: attraction and why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also lets me understand which ones
didn't I think had the attraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, whoa, the market still likes that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so much of it is that that that visual
appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've been trained to choose those
things because that's what we've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: last 30 years in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always tell people some of the
strongest part of a smoke that looked like
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a piece of cabbage run over by a
tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got me so high that I had to drive
around the island three times because I
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't figure out how to get off the
highway on the on ramp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was I was on Hawaii and I got so lit
that I couldn't really get off the
[SPEAKER_00]: freeway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just said, screw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just drive it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at some point I'll come down and I'll
be able to figure out how do you get off
[SPEAKER_00]: the freeway?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I wasn't laughing at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, whoa, I am scorched.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I could get my hands on that again,
I'd love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing was, you know, I challenge
you to sell it because it looked like it
[SPEAKER_00]: was some cabbage run over by a tractor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why that's why it's like,
you know, like, oh, yeah, gelato,
[SPEAKER_02]: just gelato cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, I made a gelato cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a Sherb cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the male I started with, though,
is F5.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those generations to get to to get to
F3 took a while out of the twos.
[SPEAKER_02]: To get to the four took a while out of the
threes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like I just went one,
two, three, four, five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom, man, gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even that is a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, going along the way to go,
OK, cool, we got rid of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got rid of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think you probably grew some of
the early cherry generations that I had to
[SPEAKER_02]: have all the weird Urkel recesses in it
that pop out with a little duck foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're tiny and they won't grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the weed is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get both.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so now like I have cherry lime f
sixes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you grow those, they're all big,
fast vegging plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all have the same bud structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all have the super high five percent
terpenes at SC 18, 22 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're real consistent, all the same,
doesn't mold, doesn't break, doesn't care
[SPEAKER_02]: if it's windy, you know, and then take
that like what I used to make that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that was outcrossed to these,
you know, height, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then, you know, with that,
then you at least know you've got some
[SPEAKER_02]: predictability there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the same time, you have
marketability so that you're bringing
[SPEAKER_02]: because you've got to there's only so many
enthusiasts and all of us enthusiasts can
[SPEAKER_02]: go ahead and go, OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is this really rare weed thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like this is this trippy like
it's out there like like Caleb right now
[SPEAKER_02]: is working with that Australian bastard
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are like, why would you want
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, if you really like plants,
you want that because it's not the other
[SPEAKER_02]: one you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're not going to go, OK,
I'm going to switch over my hoops to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are going to go, once it's trimmed
in the bag, it probably isn't even
[SPEAKER_02]: different because the leaves are cut off
and the leaves are what's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has valuable things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to have it in your arsenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked right at it and went,
if I can get a plant that's like a bomb
[SPEAKER_02]: ass Afghani to grow with this size leaves,
you're going to have yields that are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to crush everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you can get a fat bud on
something that veg is faster than that
[SPEAKER_02]: with a tiny little leaf, it's just going
to get sun right to the bud the whole way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to have these huge buds
like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But instead of being on the end with these
big fat leaves that block everything out,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to have them six feet long.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where you get the cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those things are valuable for
breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you buy a pack of seeds, you're like,
dude, I want to grow this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe I want to find a clone,
or I just want to grow these and just have
[SPEAKER_02]: good bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to make sure that my seed,
you plant a row of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to be able to plant a row of it and
have 10 or 20 of them in hundreds or 300s
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever, and look at them and go,
OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad I grew that in my garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I try to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I try to put out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with the new stuff, too, I'm trying to
make sure it's always the cutting edge
[SPEAKER_02]: terps and something that fits into the
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-marketed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to make it smart business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I was saying about to loop
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's cool about the root beer is it
almost looks like a cookies, or it looks
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's because it has black aphi in it
way back in it in Hindu.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it has the headband, the LA Kush,
like Mandel had back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it makes it like this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an ultra potent thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're used to smoking cookies and you
smoke this, you're like, OK, this is super
[SPEAKER_02]: satisfying smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It breaks up a little better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got just really killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are ones that are going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maintaining those cool, all that neat
stuff, and then being able to go,
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, here's what we need to be competitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we do have to be super
competitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all you really need is a plant that is
that special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people will go, oh, OK, I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great for everyone to share
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great for everyone to share,
especially these bulk gene pools.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have your own clone,
and everyone's like, oh, you can't get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you don't want to give that clone
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because maybe you want to have something
that you're like, no, I know how to do
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might talk to someone's grandma.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, sorry, you can't have my
cookie recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because I want to have this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to win the contest at the whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or whatever it's for.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely, everyone's got to share.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a huge edge to being able to
go, OK, I have this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm the only one with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something for everyone to think
about, that find that plant where you
[SPEAKER_02]: might not be able to sell SFV.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, oh, I was getting $3,000 for
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's SFV.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now people want to give me $600.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's crashed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you go to talk to somebody,
and they're like, dude, I have this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no matter what, everybody,
my buddy's got this Vermont Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like pre-sour diesel diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's how it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just straight, super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then underneath, it's just like clove.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's super, super bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just calls it diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anybody who looks at that,
and they tell you, oh, sorry, this is good
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm only going to give you $1,000 for
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, cool, where's the next guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because one out of three people who smell
this shit are going to say, dude,
[SPEAKER_02]: what do you want?
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have that, I can sell that to people
for whatever I want to ask for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just because people don't all
have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If everyone has it, people see a bad
version of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now all of a sudden, it's whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's definitely a value in that of
looking for your own thing, having it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and being able to run with something
that's got a little edge on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I'm always doing,
trying to make stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene, that's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I look around this room,
I think the reality is that so many of us,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you think of it's a race or whatever,
a racetrack, so many of us are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: lapping the whole industry that it's easy
to look like you're behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're really all just so far ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what Gene was saying is sometimes
you've got to give them what they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you do a few gelato crosses or make
sure everything is a certain THC level for
[SPEAKER_01]: the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But never, ever give up on those cultivars
that mean everything to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back eight, nine years ago, people would
give me such a hard time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be like, why do you have seeds that
make purple cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody hates purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like, oh, it's because it's
deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your weed's purple because it's deficient
in whatever, something.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd tell me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be like, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the trends, and I guess the whole
lapping thing, like we're always one lap
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it can look like we're kind
of behind the pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, we're just ahead of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody knows it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's where Gene's talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a lot of killer stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've worked some interesting directions
since I've met you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like that you've been really putting
together some interesting combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the number of people that bring me
material that you've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some in my job right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone said, man, I got some killer
equilibrium working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I laugh because each one of those
samples was radically different than the
[SPEAKER_00]: other because the lines were different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like that when I see people have
separation in what they're doing and your
[SPEAKER_00]: desires to go these different trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you've been putting some cool
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this year I'm going to try to dig
deeper into I've got so many seeds and so
[SPEAKER_03]: many things I've collected over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like that branching out in a whole
new direction, just like kind of out
[SPEAKER_03]: sideways somewhere where maybe it's
something that's been sitting on the shelf
[SPEAKER_03]: that I've been meaning to get to forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I haven't decided anything I'm going
to work with yet this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a few contenders.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Malawi lines did really well over the
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been a lot of people coming back
saying the African orange was something
[SPEAKER_03]: that was really mold resistant for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen some of the flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody brought me some of the flowers
today from Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was just probably one of the most
citrusy versions of African orange I've
[SPEAKER_03]: ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's certainly a direction I want to
go in is things that do well on the coast
[SPEAKER_03]: because I was in Santa Cruz for so many
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's hard to grow almost anything in a
lot of the areas around that county.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's actually where I first saw some
Mean Genes work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I had a friend out there that we
kind of shared a little patch one year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess he had gotten some seeds from
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we grew the root beer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we grew the PK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was some of your cherry limes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like Urkel lime.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the Urkel lime was insane,
especially in light of what you were
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about with the bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were just these bulbous buds that
just looked amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And probably the cherry lime out of
everything was the favorite at the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: the year, just getting to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the root beers were a little later.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when they filled in, they were just so
turpy and enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And last year, your Humboldt dream was my
buddy's biggest plants in the garden last
[SPEAKER_03]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a picture of him just in the
Anderson Valley with this plant that's
[SPEAKER_03]: just gigantic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's like, oh, I'm doing this one every
year now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys, kudos to you guys for putting
out the quality work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, yeah, this year I'm going to
probably pull out some of the other Malawi
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I've seen a lot of buzz around the
chocolate Malawi, which is one that I
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't been working with as much in the
past.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so maybe pull that one out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's probably one at the top of
the list.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the chocolate hash berry to the
heirloom Malawi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the glue line is one I've been working
for a little while, is trying to find a
[SPEAKER_03]: reliable glue back cross and find a male
out of that that I can hit to things and
[SPEAKER_03]: get that chocolatey, gassy aroma and taste
out of the hybrids that come through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe we're going to pull out some
crazy land races and try to work with some
[SPEAKER_03]: wild stuff and try to see what else we
could put out there that is going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about setting yourself apart in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, like you were saying,
maybe you find a cut that you don't want
[SPEAKER_03]: to share with people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would love to hear that somebody
found something out of my work that really
[SPEAKER_03]: worked well for them and they wanted to
keep around for years and years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe it helped keep them afloat in
tough times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so certainly we're going to keep
working for mold resistance, which is even
[SPEAKER_03]: more of an issue nowadays with the testing
requirements.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the other projects might
include maybe some of the other Malawis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've kind of got a rough sketch,
but we have haven't nailed anything down
[SPEAKER_03]: yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think get back with the team and see
what everybody else wants to do too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe go back and look at,
because I try to catalog everything,
[SPEAKER_03]: all the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody that gave me seeds today,
we traded.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go and try to catalog and
keep a list of everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you do that long enough and you're
going to have a nice collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope everybody starts getting into more
of their own pheno hunts and finding
[SPEAKER_03]: things that do well in your local
situation, which whatever property that
[SPEAKER_03]: you might have might be even totally
different from your neighbor's parcel,
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're on the other side of the
ridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe the people down the road are a
little closer to a valley and they get
[SPEAKER_03]: more wind.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's great to be here and see all the
different success stories from different
[SPEAKER_03]: strains, because that definitely has a big
effect on my personal decisions of what
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go and breed with,
is when I go and talk to the community or
[SPEAKER_03]: I go to the Emerald Cup or see somebody
out in town or something and they say,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, well, you're sour orange or your
granddaddy orange or maybe one of these or
[SPEAKER_03]: Dream Queen glue or this or that did
really well for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love hearing everybody's stories of what
they've done with my genetics and what
[SPEAKER_03]: they really liked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like I've got folks that rave about
these two guys' genetics that they've
[SPEAKER_03]: tried in previous years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just keep the stories coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what I like is that it's rare
that most people, and nowadays what I
[SPEAKER_00]: learned, the internet is where you talk
shit so you can get recognition,
[SPEAKER_00]: because otherwise you don't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unless you're flapping your mouth,
throwing rocks at someone else,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not even a real person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're sitting here hanging out and
you're talking about your experiences with
[SPEAKER_00]: Gene's work back in the day and Nat's work
with your boy's stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys got questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've got some basic info that I
want to talk about out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they want to cover some stuff
themselves, if they have something they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to throw, they welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But otherwise, man, let's get the audience
to ask some questions, because it's rare
[SPEAKER_00]: you get these guys on a table at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, right, boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: What traits do you look for in male plants
specifically?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you hear him?
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, what traits do you look for
specifically in male plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're seeking a good breeder?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm a big fan of the stem rub.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really love terpens and all the
different possibilities that there are in
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that has served me
well forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll probably never put down that tool
no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did some testing of males this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of a cool trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then certainly structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're trying to breed for
homozygosity or uniformity, then you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to look for one that has a similar
structure to if you're trying to make an
[SPEAKER_01]: inbred line, for example, or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Gene, you want to do some of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually just touching the plant
and seeing really what smells you get from
[SPEAKER_02]: the stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different ones are different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody's nose works different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like me, I can pick an OG male hella
easy because it smells like dill pickles
[SPEAKER_02]: to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it smells like dill pickles,
that one has it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't mean that it'll necessarily
carry it, depending on what you're pulling
[SPEAKER_02]: it from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you already have seeds where you
know that all the females do smell like
[SPEAKER_02]: OG, and then you get a male out of there
that, you know, like if I was going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding something with OG, for example,
I'd be like, OK, what does it need
[SPEAKER_02]: improvement on?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want a little bit of an improved
structure so it's a little more sturdy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want improved resistance to powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I was breeding OGs, I'd probably
want to like stick them in a room and get
[SPEAKER_02]: them really humid for a little while,
maybe let them droop a couple of times
[SPEAKER_02]: before they're really flower and heavy so
that I can kind of trigger their stress
[SPEAKER_02]: response so that they'll get attacked on
purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can kind of go, OK, there's the one
that's resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because otherwise, if you treat them,
you know, if they have perfect conditions
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're breeding for something that's
triggered by bad conditions, you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no way to select for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to kind of put pressures on
things to see different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you want to know if the branches
are strong, you're going to have to snap
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have to be like,
all right, weak, weak branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: You break some, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like some plants grow with like,
actually, sometimes it'll almost look like
[SPEAKER_02]: a bubble at the junction of the branch in
the main stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll actually be like, there's these
ones where they'll never break right at
[SPEAKER_02]: the junction.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll actually bend and kind of break
over right up from it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those ones tend to be a lot more
sturdy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found those in most stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, you know, little things like
that are cool to look for.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, yeah, the stem rub is
basically if you, I really like to,
[SPEAKER_02]: if I can grow something, if I have enough
seeds, if I don't have enough,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll grow them and I'll just use all the
males and all the females and do an open
[SPEAKER_02]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know I have a bunch more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then out of my favorite females,
then I'll try some of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I do the, when I grow them out
the first time, I'll try to figure out
[SPEAKER_02]: which plants, you have to observe a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you look, okay, these plants,
I can notice these things about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when they finish as female
plants, then you kind of see trends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you go, okay, well, the every female
that looked like this or that had the stem
[SPEAKER_02]: rub, they wound up being like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can get a correlation there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you know, okay, so like,
if you're, if you're looking for a good OG
[SPEAKER_02]: male and you go, this one smells like OG,
it's like, it turns out, no, they're
[SPEAKER_02]: really good OG clones to me that I have,
they smell like pickles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want the male that smells like
pickles.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it smells like OG, when it's done,
it might not smell like OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it already smells like OG on the stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's kind of like learning the
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I like to learn them before I try
to really do any selective breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes it easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the thing about looking for
male traits is there's overall ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want one that's a pest magnet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want one that's a fungus magnet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want one that has really weak
snappy structure or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if maybe if they're super hard,
hard to clone or they have really weak
[SPEAKER_02]: roots, there's some basic things that you
can look for just overall and go,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not the best plant for these
reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of times with selecting males,
you actually want to find the one that
[SPEAKER_02]: carries what you like about the females.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that takes observation and figuring out
where it is and different, different genes
[SPEAKER_02]: basically travel in groups in breeding to
where you might try to get rid of
[SPEAKER_02]: something and discover that every time you
get rid of that, you get rid of the other
[SPEAKER_02]: thing you wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe you go, oh, I always want maybe
somebody's already made some already bred
[SPEAKER_02]: something that you're starting with,
where you go, the one that I like to
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke, I can grow as many as I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ones I really like, they always
have kind of flimsy branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might be stuck with that unless you
want to make a new hybrid and then
[SPEAKER_02]: incorporate strength.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in your new hybrid, you can get new
stuff happening, you know, but it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: for for male selecting to me is really
looking at finding which male is the one
[SPEAKER_02]: that really does what I want in that type,
and then using those kinds of males.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really takes like studying the way
that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can pick them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course, use your, you know,
use your general things where you go,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, anything crappy, we don't want to
use that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of the ones that we like, you know,
you then you want to figure out what's
[SPEAKER_02]: like the actual it's almost like seeing a
face and recognizing a face or recognizing
[SPEAKER_02]: a voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, there's that plant,
I know that plant, it always does this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to find those correlations and
those groups of traits that all travel
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like someone was asking me about the
pina's that I sold this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're purple stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all purple stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all have the same smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the trip was that the purple stem
travels with this particular group of
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that it's really easy to breed it to
have the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just look for the ones with the
purple stems, and then you smell the
[SPEAKER_02]: stock, there might be a couple of them
that are a little off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go, no, but this one has the most of
that smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's purple stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put them together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really fast I was able to go,
okay, this is that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that was that that those that male
might have been the sturdiest and the
[SPEAKER_02]: stinkiest and the fastest growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you hate that smell, don't pick the
purple stem one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get a different one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to learn the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you select your males,
then you can have success a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also just go, I really like this
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And use that male because you're likely to
get plants that look like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that might have been what you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, wow, this thing has a luster
and a vigor to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, well, you're at least going
to get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can find out later if you get
those other traits that are important to
[SPEAKER_02]: you too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can always try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can always throw it and see if it
sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you want to ideally learn what you're
working with first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was talking about the weirdos
in the cherry limeade.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't mind having really little
weird plants, you might be able to make
[SPEAKER_02]: really cool stuff with that because the
weeds always kill her.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant's not that good though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I did is I looked and looked until
I got males that had the same smell and
[SPEAKER_02]: the same resinous leaves and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I went, okay, so this is like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more rare in this form.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this has the traits I like in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this thing grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't have a weird look to it
that freaks people out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then, you know, you wind up going with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's how I select males personally
is by learning what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're like, okay, if you were
breeding dogs, you know, you'd be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, you're not going to breed
Rottweilers and go, I like this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't have Rottweiler markings.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a good Rottweiler.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after a while, people would be
like, this ain't a Rottweiler,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't pick the right one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a sport.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't the right thing to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to know what a Rottweiler looks
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to know how tall is the shoulder?
[SPEAKER_02]: How tall is the hips?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the sway in the back?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long is the tail on a puppy?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do the ears lay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do their teeth sit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Howard, what's the line in the front?
[SPEAKER_02]: All that stuff to learn to go,
okay, now I'm breeding dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you really want to breed stuff,
you really have to know the description of
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're shooting for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how you pick the males.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not to say you might have had a
killer dog that was like a Rottweiler that
[SPEAKER_02]: was all black or all tan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, I like that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to be going to new place
and you have to have focus for doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can just randomly select a male
because you like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's going to be more difficult to
lock down the exact things you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to learn your genetics to pick
them, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we as the community do on a
political level to protect the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: do the breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when Beth was up yesterday,
it was one of the better presentations
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen in a minute because it gave you
a protection toolbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that and I know Jerry Whiting
and Jerry's a savvy smart guy from the
[SPEAKER_00]: tech era.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he has like the largest
collection of Black Panther memorabilia
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what his family was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has this concepts of protecting
things and preserving culture in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different way than most people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because he was successful in tech,
it also gave him a different view of how
[SPEAKER_00]: these things operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the stuff that we took a
look at yesterday was the abilities to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get yourself contractual
protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think with community protection,
and support is really just trying not to
[SPEAKER_00]: screw each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, fundamentally, man, choose not
to burn the guy you're doing business
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seemed to work for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to me, it's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, in my
perspective from someone who traffics
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, what I want to be able to see is
and what I've always done is I've always
[SPEAKER_00]: given credit to the people whose cultivars
I use or material I use or information I
[SPEAKER_00]: use because what happens then is you
promote, just like Jason was promoting Nat
[SPEAKER_00]: and Gene saying, hey man, I ran your
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was killing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends run your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a courtesy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't have to say it, but he wanted to
say, hey, you know, you guys are some guys
[SPEAKER_00]: that I respect and I appreciate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does, it adds a level of
legitimacy that you can't add yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had this discussion with someone today
about the internet saying, the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: guys tell you this is how you promote
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, nobody really gives a shit
about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just banter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crap coming out their mouth
perpetually and you just turn it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want is you want other people to
validate what you're doing in an honest
[SPEAKER_00]: way because that resonates in a way that
you know is true because they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting paid for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not a shill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's part of it is
that, you know, you recognize other
[SPEAKER_00]: people's farms and you commend the product
when it's legitimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have an ability to move
your product, but you know someone who
[SPEAKER_00]: could move product, you push that product
and you make sure that person gets credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the breeders, you know,
don't pirate their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you had a funny one because
Gene's a meme king, but he was talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about how they would rename in these
varietals so they could just get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was this whole meme about how
the breeder was diminished, minimized and
[SPEAKER_00]: wiped out so that we can name anything we
wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's such a true statement because
you're so desirous of your own success
[SPEAKER_00]: that you forgot how you got there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think when it comes to what the
breeder is that if you can keep them alive
[SPEAKER_00]: in the conversation all the time,
in a courteous sense where this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: material I got from Jason.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I used.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to buy more, you can go to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got questions, you can go to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You become in this incredible referral
network.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the thing that protects
you from shit in life most is money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your own money makes you pretty safe
because you can afford infrastructure,
[SPEAKER_00]: tools, connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what we've been deprived
of right now is liquidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have to kind of pull up our
skills until we can rebuild our liquidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: but hopefully this bout of poverty teaches
us how to behave a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligently in a communal form so that
when we do re-rise up again as a craft
[SPEAKER_00]: culture, you're able to actually take the
education that we just got about how you
[SPEAKER_00]: better stick together or you're going to
die and then use it to create the models
[SPEAKER_00]: of protection so that you end up having
individuals that can do the work so that
[SPEAKER_00]: all you have to do is do your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people would rather just grow
and farm than have to spend all their free
[SPEAKER_00]: time breeding too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, that's my opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be honest with whose work
you're pirating and make sure you kick
[SPEAKER_00]: back credit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd agree with that, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you guys have had it happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had it happen where groups get a hold
of your work and they rename it as their
[SPEAKER_03]: own and they don't give credit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like the history and the story
is a big part of why things are appealing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I always try to be as forthcoming
and factual with all the information that
[SPEAKER_03]: we put out there about what we're working
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's companies out there that are
just getting rid of the names altogether
[SPEAKER_03]: where all the history of hundreds of years
of people carrying this plant's just wiped
[SPEAKER_03]: away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's just a whole new way of
categorizing things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know really how I feel about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like people being inventive and being
unique, but I'm also very connected to the
[SPEAKER_03]: history.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's something that might not sit
so well about just totally renaming
[SPEAKER_03]: people's stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe if you come up with a name for a
specific pheno, that could be okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: but still it's the whatever pheno of this
strain from this person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And still be honest about where it came
from and you can still name your phenos.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as protecting your genetics,
I think the open cannabis project or
[SPEAKER_03]: somehow documenting the genes as open
source, that's the only really other
[SPEAKER_03]: alternative to trying to patent your stuff
and keep other people from having it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want other people to grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't want people to grow it and
then take it from me and say, I can't grow
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's literally something that could
be going on right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a number of cannabis patents
that have already been issued that are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be problematic in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure there's going to be
challenges to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think one of them is any one-to-one
that doesn't have mercy in it is
[SPEAKER_03]: technically under patent right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some very broad cannabis patents
out there right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure there's going to be more down
the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: And documenting your genetics through
groups like the open cannabis project are
[SPEAKER_03]: a way to combat that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to speak to that real quick,
the chemo type data is very important too,
[SPEAKER_04]: because that's going to fight against the
broad spectrum utility patents.
[SPEAKER_04]: The genetic data is totally important for
a lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's harder to translate that
information to the patent office.
[SPEAKER_04]: So more chemo type data and getting
donations for that will be really useful
[SPEAKER_04]: to have prior argument for any overly
reaching patent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anybody that didn't hear that,
he was saying chemo type data is as or
[SPEAKER_03]: possibly more important than the genetic
testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that can be hopefully a discussion all
unto its own.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to delve deeper into that and
how we can protect the community's work as
[SPEAKER_03]: a whole.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing I wanted to touch on is when you
talk about you're saying you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: go try and sell your product, people
assume self-interest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they always take whatever you say
with a grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they overhear it from their friend
that says, no, no, his stuff's dope.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I like this type.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to take that in maybe a
little more deeper.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm trying to say is support your
community and the other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you see something that you like,
let people know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully others are going to return
the favor to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, I feel, how we build the
community together and help each other
[SPEAKER_03]: survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely I think people take it into
account a little more when they hear it
[SPEAKER_03]: through somebody else or through the
grapevine or I heard that this.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how hype builds is people overhear
from somebody somewhere else that,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, there is something that's
genuine to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's reasons behind why those things
got built up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't all just be pure advertising.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's got to be some human element to
why something becomes successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, just support your neighbor.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they're doing good, let people know
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that from all of us that came
from the era where you didn't rat on
[SPEAKER_00]: people, which seems to be a foreign
thought nowadays, ratting out on people,
[SPEAKER_00]: screwing people over isn't ratting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when he's saying make sure you
support, make sure you also call out
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you see are wrong because
they're screwing him, they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: screw you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time they get to you,
there might not be anybody to protect you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of it is if you're seeing
unscrupulous stuff, you don't have to get
[SPEAKER_00]: out and broadcast it on the general world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can tell your friends,
man, I get asked all the time about would
[SPEAKER_00]: you do business with this person?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try not to screw anybody in a way
that would cause problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, if I know that you have a
history of piking people, I always just
[SPEAKER_00]: say the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be cautious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that means is that I can't give
you a recommendation and that you should
[SPEAKER_00]: do your homework.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have to go too deep into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just says that I can't vouch for
you, but I'm not going to throw a rock at
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's throwing a rock at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important because someone said,
would you work with that distributor?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say, I would be cautious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they realize that there's some
reason because I'm not in a business
[SPEAKER_00]: against them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, why am I having trepidation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because I saw something or heard
something and I'm just like, look,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't need to get screwed either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to go and shish kebab
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if people are doing good work,
make sure you let people know and if
[SPEAKER_00]: people are doing stuff that are unethical
in a way that's going to really cause
[SPEAKER_00]: problems, they're not going to hold back
against you either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people hold back because they're
afraid of ramification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, it was they're afraid
they're going to lose all their teeth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now that that's not one of the
tools, and I don't really think it should
[SPEAKER_00]: be a tool, but it was a very effective
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be able to use financial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And financial is to protect each other and
make sure that the people that are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this work aren't getting beat to death and
that they're still around for you to
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize as a resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you you have to preserve as many of
these resources as possible because
[SPEAKER_00]: without it, you end up having a shrunken
population of partners to do stuff in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, like what I've done my whole
career, I've needed the people around me
[SPEAKER_00]: because I only can do so much myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my success was really built off all
these relationships I made with other
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the course of time, we did better
than we did worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't anybody screw you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yes, I believe so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what you could do is if you did a
licensing agreement with the breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could also bring material that you
have and do collaborative projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: That material would then be able to be
jointly promoted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be able to have stock that was
unique to you because all the material
[SPEAKER_00]: from the cross would be held.
[SPEAKER_00]: The two of you could figure out what was
the cultivar you wanted to release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into the public as production material,
not as a cultivar unless you're building a
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're building a nursery, then you
say, hey, Nat, I want to work with you on
[SPEAKER_00]: a project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to take some of the stuff
you're doing, put it with something I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's find a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it into the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's both be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did the shit work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now both of you can do combined
breeding and you can do licensing that
[SPEAKER_00]: allows you to be able to use your
respective IP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can then find individuals
that you can license the clone to because
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the problems is overproduction of
varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you end up out-competing the
success because you got too much of the
[SPEAKER_00]: same material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's crucial, but I think a
lot of us just need more legal help with
[SPEAKER_00]: that where we need to have more people
like Beth come in and attorneys that were
[SPEAKER_00]: present.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great to have an attorney present
yesterday because he could kind of say,
[SPEAKER_00]: listen, this is how we see this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're able to get a better idea
because I don't think any of us,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least 95% of us have been involved
in patent protection of genomic material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm someone who messes around with it
all the time, but that's not what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have lawyers that I work with
because I don't have time to go to law
[SPEAKER_00]: school and I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my thing, but I need them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think licensing is cool because
really, a license is just a contract
[SPEAKER_01]: between you and your associate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly, it's not as binding as
something like a patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's more voluntary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do encourage folks to do that kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at Gene's pre-roll line.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a way, that's good for everybody
because that pre-roll person might not
[SPEAKER_01]: have had quite such a namesake or
following.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's good for their pre-rolls and
it's cool for Gene because he gets credit,
[SPEAKER_01]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just one more thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep hearing everybody, we're all a
little scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all know that these big powers that
have deep, deep pockets are coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you might sort of react to it and do
something that you might not otherwise do,
[SPEAKER_01]: get ready to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get rid of all your purple strains or
something dumb like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just remember that when booze became
legal, there wasn't a Jim Beam or there
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't Budweiser or Coors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those kind of evolved out of their being
quick and simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Successes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then in the mid-90s, all of a sudden,
there was this thing that came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like microbeer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never thought in a million years
that there'd still be breweries opening in
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt County that are thriving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just the same with wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it takes a while for that to kind of
mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't go into the gap station down
over at Pier C or whatever and stick your
[SPEAKER_01]: nose up at the new microbeers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you do at the... Maybe you do or maybe
you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the Coors, I like PBR.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that stuff hasn't had a chance to
really like the PBRs and the Coors and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Budweiser's of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one knows that that's who they are yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's gonna take at least probably
like another year, maybe two before that
[SPEAKER_01]: really develops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what I'm really confident about
is that the regenerative and the small and
[SPEAKER_01]: the real craft actually then starts to
have its days in the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pun intended.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the same with strains
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, God, remember how freaking long it
was just impossible to... You just had to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow OG and then you grew a bunch of this
really cool, awesome stuff for your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you just always kind of had to grow
OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's gonna change too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just remember that we are
pioneers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what me and Gene said about
like, well, I'm not ignoring the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: the market's saying one thing,
but I'm also not giving up on where my
[SPEAKER_01]: freaking roots are and where my
convictions lie and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna wrap this up because we got a
little thing going on and we're burning
[SPEAKER_00]: through some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanna say thank you so much for
taking the time to ask good questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanna thank you guys for taking the
time out of your lives to show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And answer the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, man, it's been a pleasure
to work with you for as long as I've known
[SPEAKER_00]: all three of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my goal is to all of you get gray like
me and we still in the same business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
