[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Wong, I wanted to say it was a
pleasure hearing your talk today.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very informative.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Paul Santos and I work for a private
diagnostic lab called Waypoint Analytical
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're located in Anaheim, California.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very interesting to hear you list a
lot of the diseases that you were talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about because we've been offering this
service for quite some time too ever since
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis became legal in California and we
were seeing many of the diseases that you
[SPEAKER_03]: were speaking about in your presentation
so it was kind of nice to kind of get that
[SPEAKER_03]: confirmation that both of us as
pathologists were seeing the same issues
[SPEAKER_03]: that are facing many of the growers of
this crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of the issues that we see most
often were repeated in your presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know things like fusarium causing both
crown rot, root rot, stem rot,
[SPEAKER_03]: pythium root rot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not dealing so much with the hemp
production side of the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of ours is medicinal or recreational
so we don't get to see a lot of the field
[SPEAKER_03]: grown things that you were mentioning you
know with the seed related issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the clients that we service
they're obtaining their plant material
[SPEAKER_03]: from propagation houses or they're doing
their own clonal cuttings and rooting
[SPEAKER_03]: their own material so we do see a lot of
that fusarium that you're talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: that can get transmitted you know from
infected mother stock so I thought that
[SPEAKER_03]: was very important issue that you brought
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that's true so I work for state of
Nevada Department of Agriculture so as a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant pathologist I deal with everything
not just industrial hemp and also
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana plants so for some reason during
last two years there's a lot of problem
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with industrial hemp and the
cannabis production in the Nevada so we
[SPEAKER_00]: have a chance to look at those issues we
take a lot of sample we accept sample so
[SPEAKER_00]: we do analysis we do the diagnostic and
also we do the DNA barcode to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: what kind of pathogen in there so we can
figure out what's wrong with all those
[SPEAKER_00]: issues so we do find a lot of diseases
which is why I'm excited to present in the
[SPEAKER_00]: in the conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I agree totally with you because I
think you know one of the one of the one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the benefits of your legalization of
marijuana or the greater extent of a
[SPEAKER_03]: growing hemp as a as an industrial crop is
that now we're being able to open that
[SPEAKER_03]: industry up to the much needed science
because there's a there's a big gap in our
[SPEAKER_03]: in our in the knowledge that we have with
respect to the diseases that impact both
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana and the hemp crops so it's kind
of exciting we kind of feel like maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: we're on the cutting edge right at the
frontier trying to find new things and
[SPEAKER_03]: discovering new things that impact this
crop and the growers that try to cultivate
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I feel the same way because every
time we look at the cannabis or in either
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial hemp or medical marijuana
plants there's nobody has done very much
[SPEAKER_00]: work on that so anything finding from that
type of crop it could be new disease or
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of new conditions so the growers
need the information to to resolve the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem so but unfortunately not very many
people really work on that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: I contact say they have research for they
have a technical advantage but they just
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to work on that for example
like I talk about virus there's something
[SPEAKER_00]: infected by some kind of virus but we
cannot figure out what it is so they need
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of research to figure out so
hopefully in the future people can work on
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I know it makes me wish that maybe I
was a more of a virologist and not so much
[SPEAKER_03]: of a mycologist you know I don't know what
your expertise was or what you specialize
[SPEAKER_03]: in when you were in graduate school but I
do see like a lot of a lot of clients ask
[SPEAKER_03]: questions about viruses and I honestly
have to tell that you know aside from
[SPEAKER_03]: hearing maybe you know hemp mosaic I don't
know much else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh right yeah but by training myself as a
nematologist also plant pathologist and
[SPEAKER_00]: also molecular biologist so actually I got
three different expertise in there but in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant pathologist I was more focused
on the soil borer fungus or nematodes and
[SPEAKER_00]: the virus also plant viruses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you mentioned nematodes I did have one
question that I didn't get to ask you
[SPEAKER_03]: during your presentation and maybe I don't
know if I heard right or not but was it
[SPEAKER_03]: it's mostly the lesion nematode is the one
of the primary problem on on on hemp or
[SPEAKER_03]: we're not real sure yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I point out the lesion
nematodes which is called a pre-titanicus
[SPEAKER_00]: is because we found this from the from the
potato field from the from some fields
[SPEAKER_00]: because I talk about the root rot the
reason why root rot is so devastating is
[SPEAKER_00]: just because could be some kind of
nematodes take some role and to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants more susceptible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an excellent point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I address the nematodes in
the disease complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be very interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be interesting to see what you find
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah but we're still work on that so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah I think there's one grower from
New Mexico he asked about did you find the
[SPEAKER_00]: verticillium verticillium wilt since we
found for cereal wilt some other diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: he's got some kind of problem with
verticillium which is a big issue for some
[SPEAKER_00]: crop like purple mint it's a huge problem
but so far I haven't found any from the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis yet so I still pay attention to
it because every time the sample came in
[SPEAKER_00]: they kind of wilted or some kind of a
disease going on I always check for
[SPEAKER_00]: verticillium to make sure there's anything
in there sure sure yeah I'd have to say in
[SPEAKER_03]: the samples that we've received we've
never seen verticillium either but you
[SPEAKER_03]: know it's something that's always on your
radar for sure yeah yeah that's that's
[SPEAKER_00]: that's good too don't have any
verticillium no nobody wants it nobody
[SPEAKER_03]: wish there is one disease though that I
didn't see mentioned on your on your
[SPEAKER_03]: survey that you've been conducting and one
that we begin we've been seeing of late
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's a thalabiopsis causing a root
rot but also invading the crown at the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom of the of the plant too I don't
know maybe if you've come across that or
[SPEAKER_00]: not no no I haven't across there yes yeah
I would be very curious to know what
[SPEAKER_03]: species it is because it's difficult and
it's much slower growing than thalabiopsis
[SPEAKER_03]: bacicola so maybe that's something if we
had an isolate that if we sent it to you
[SPEAKER_03]: would you be interested in maybe
determining what species it is well we
[SPEAKER_00]: probably can do a bar coding so figure out
what it is so if you got a chance you can
[SPEAKER_00]: send me some image or describe what kind
of disease look like yeah and they send me
[SPEAKER_00]: some sample or maybe an isolate yeah yeah
culture plates we can figure out what
[SPEAKER_03]: species it is yeah that'd be that'd be
cool yeah right and then I don't have time
[SPEAKER_03]: to write stuff up and I don't have
facility for doing inoculations for
[SPEAKER_03]: coxpositates then maybe that's something
on your end and you could get a
[SPEAKER_00]: publication out of it oh yeah we can
cooperate so kind of figure out what's
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong with the crop yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not very much information on the
cannabis crop diseases so there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: a grower in the US they're gonna grow a
lot of hemp and also medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in the facility they need
information on how to manage those
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases so they don't have those
information and they don't know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage it so that's big issue and people
can do some work to figure out what's
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong with it that's great they can help
them to produce healthy cannabis crop well
[SPEAKER_03]: I would ask you one question because both
you and I we kind of agree that you know
[SPEAKER_03]: we do cannabis but it's kind of on the
side yeah it's on the side it's true there
[SPEAKER_03]: are a lot of other plants and crops that
we both deal with right but you know what
[SPEAKER_03]: do you think is maybe one of the most
challenging things that faces the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industry when we start talking about
management of diseases what would you
[SPEAKER_03]: think would be the most challenging thing
to growers I think the most challenge is
[SPEAKER_00]: how the grower can get healthy plants
because I talked to one of attendee she
[SPEAKER_00]: said is any program that really can
provide healthy stock healthy plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: they can start from the very beginning
that plants what they have is healthy so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's big challenge so I said no nobody
really really do this kind of thing so
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe in the future there's a direction to
do that
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah tissue culture or they generate
disease free stock plants or germ plasma
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever they call that so you just get a
very clean disease free clean stock to
[SPEAKER_00]: start with cannabis growing business right
so that's probably the best way that's
[SPEAKER_00]: called prevention so and also the
challenge is that there's no chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: product like pesticide or fungicide not
labeled for cannabis so they cannot use it
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis crop so they have to use some
alternative product and they may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: very effective depends on what kind of
condition the treat so that's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: challenge for them too and so they're
almost forced to be organic growers by
[SPEAKER_00]: default right technically it is it's not
that it's impossible but it's it's much
[SPEAKER_01]: more challenging yeah right challenge
[SPEAKER_03]: well in order to do virus testing you need
to have specialized equipment there are
[SPEAKER_03]: some ELISA based kits that are on
available on the market but the biggest
[SPEAKER_03]: problem is that we don't have a firm
understanding of what viruses are have
[SPEAKER_03]: been described on cannabis in the first
place right would you agree yeah that's
[SPEAKER_00]: true so even though we can test the virus
but we don't know what kind of virus to
[SPEAKER_00]: test for so you have to know what species
you want to test for that specific virus
[SPEAKER_00]: so a lot of time we just don't know what
to test for so that's that's kind of big
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge so but there's a way to do that
and they call the next generation
[SPEAKER_00]: sequences so that way you can you don't
need to know the target but you can detect
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it's inside the plants based on
RNA so you can test this specific virus
[SPEAKER_00]: even a novel new virus in the plants so
that's technology in there but just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of cost too much money time to do that so
we don't know what type of virus affect
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis crop and it's still question
mark
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that the diseases are regional
I mean there are some commonalities but
[SPEAKER_03]: for example you know in California and I
would imagine here in Nevada it's probably
[SPEAKER_03]: the same where it tends to be more arid
you know we're gonna see one subset of
[SPEAKER_03]: diseases are gonna be more common to our
area whereas if you're a grower say like
[SPEAKER_03]: in Kentucky maybe there may be foliar
diseases that we were never gonna see just
[SPEAKER_03]: because we don't have the rainfall that
that's right that's right because in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different region like say in the Midwest
or in the back and east they may be good
[SPEAKER_00]: high humidity they got some other diseases
which we don't see very much in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Western like especially in Nevada it's
pretty dry arid condition so may not see
[SPEAKER_00]: very often like say powder mildew you may
see very much in some other part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States but not in Nevada farmland
so that's that's something that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental environment dependent
[SPEAKER_00]: well as I present in this morning I said
the prevention is a key so try to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction any type of a disease agent
into your facility so that's best way to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent disease and also try to monitor
your facility make sure you keep track on
[SPEAKER_00]: that once you see the disease you have to
take action right away as soon as possible
[SPEAKER_00]: before they spread or overwhelming in the
facility so that's my takeaway message for
[SPEAKER_03]: those growers I think that's an excellent
point you know that that prevention
[SPEAKER_03]: through good sanitation that has to be the
foundation of any program especially in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis where your options for control
once a disease outbreak has occurred are
[SPEAKER_03]: so limited I agree told you know
wholeheartedly with that yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: well me personally when I think back to to
my my days as a graduate student you know
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the number one risk of
growing something that's a monoculture and
[SPEAKER_03]: is you know genetically uniform like when
you're using clonal stock the problem is
[SPEAKER_03]: that if you do get a path that this
introduction then and they're all
[SPEAKER_03]: susceptible then the risk for for spread
and for a greater loss in yield is
[SPEAKER_03]: significantly higher than if you had a
diverse cropping system although I'm not
[SPEAKER_03]: sure I would argue that that that crops
that are planted outdoors are any less of
[SPEAKER_03]: a monoculture than those planted indoors
even though there may be other things
[SPEAKER_03]: around that environment where these where
these cannabis crops are being grown
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoors I mean they could potentially be
sources of pathogen inoculum we just we
[SPEAKER_00]: just don't simply know yet well for sure
the monoculture is really make the disease
[SPEAKER_00]: to occur more easily than the multiple
species so the cannabis production indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's actually really favorable for
some type of diseases for sure so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's a really big issue for
monoculture especially for disease you
