[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we've seen the true medical
market in cannabis be decimated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked with parents that were already
spending $1,200 a month for their child
[SPEAKER_00]: who has epilepsy, and now it's over $3,000
or $3,600 a month when they can find it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not the same as it was before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have lost the medical market,
and that's why I got into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis saved my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had epilepsy for years, and I haven't
had a seizure in four years now because of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I forget that at times, like,
this is why you got into this industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: is to help patients and to work with
doctors in bringing down stigma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a huge part of what we're
still fighting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stigma is going down, but at what cost?
