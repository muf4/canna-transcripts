[SPEAKER_06]: Smoking in piedra and stone is the best.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is traditionally how they smoke
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really how they smoke it traditionally is
like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well it's also when you're sharing it so
everyone's not nipping it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's actually the right way to do it
if you're sharing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have wipes?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have them actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how people have been smoking hash
forever in Nepal, in Morocco, in Lebanon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine is the quiz.
[SPEAKER_06]: This though, the chillum.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact I don't smoke anything from stone.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's made from stone.
[SPEAKER_06]: The traditional ones are all stone.
[SPEAKER_06]: I smoke this one on a regular myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I basically buy one every two days and
just throw it when it looks dirty.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the problem with these ones is it
looks like you're smoking other stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes you look a little bit dirty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even now I'm taking it out and putting it
back away.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm ashamed of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah I am ashamed of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with this stuff though with the
torch.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once it gets dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just put my dirty one away because it
looks sketchy.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why the Puffco peak is so nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes you look less dodgy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am medium production.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like what you posted this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was some rosin I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: The little jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh that was a repost though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a repost, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still, it looked good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Traditionally you do it like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then cup it and then you just come out of
there.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me light it for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole crucial thing with the chillum
is once you get it charried.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me get it charried for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you get this perfect you charry some
of it and then it just burns and you pass
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a normal lighter will work better.
[SPEAKER_06]: It charries nice on a bong too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anytime you can charry some hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a little tiny cup bong up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I got was good though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny because I tried doing that to
my hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: After making a bubble, smash it and try to
smoke it like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't taste the same as if I were to
dab it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make rosin out of it and dab it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy what that little heating
pressure can do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been doing this for almost 20 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Selling it for 20 plus and making it for
probably 15 solid.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still a mystery.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's always an artisanal aspect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any professional hash person whether it's
Frenchy or anyone else will tell you the
[SPEAKER_06]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's artisanal.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the beauty.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the challenges because from a
commercial perspective it's very hard to
[SPEAKER_06]: scale.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all about small batches.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas with butane and distillate you're
just making these machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the thing I find interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frenchy talks about he wants to find the
best and then once there's no longer the
[SPEAKER_00]: best source material he's like I tap out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have 50 Frenchies like you guys
and Nasha and you know now cookies and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of like at some point the best
resin heads or trichome heads are not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you create like a tier two product
almost like the Grand Cru and then the the
[SPEAKER_00]: like the ultra premium that's more
expensive and then.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well I mean personally my approach has
always been a little bit more less
[SPEAKER_06]: philosophical and more numbers based more
of a business especially in the 64 market.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know we've built this thing out in the
last two years from the advent of 2016 and
[SPEAKER_06]: we were very much keen on getting the
price point to an affordable level.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love Frenchy to bits but charging 60
dollars retail for a gram of good hash
[SPEAKER_06]: that's 65 percent total cannabinoid in my
opinion is a little bit high.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our whole our whole philosophy at
CaliHash and Nasha's also they've just
[SPEAKER_06]: recently lowered their prices is to really
try to find a price point and a quality
[SPEAKER_06]: point that not only resembles the
traditional hash that everybody loves but
[SPEAKER_06]: is also you know under thirty five
dollars.
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets more affordable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Affordable yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the rosin guys are doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And our and our approach from the
beginning was to start off with that in
[SPEAKER_06]: mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: But by all means we have in the in the
pipeline you know a fresh frozen line that
[SPEAKER_06]: will be our premium line.
[SPEAKER_06]: And essentially it comes back it comes
down to total cannabinoid percentages.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now with cured material it's basically
impossible in my experience and opinion to
[SPEAKER_06]: get anything above 70 72 percent total
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're getting 70 doing great
because the average is probably for a cold
[SPEAKER_06]: water hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah for a cold water hash that's not live
resin that's cured.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like fresh live.
[SPEAKER_03]: No it's just a whole different product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different it's a different product
because a different part of the curing
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you get a different end result.
[SPEAKER_06]: To get this what is considered you know
the most closest representation to
[SPEAKER_06]: traditional hash and what we're smoking on
today.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to use the cured product.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have to use it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do make live product but it comes
out so different.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that stuff you run lighter in color.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much lighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's closer to a blonde.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you know how traditional hash you'll
have three different three main different
[SPEAKER_03]: types.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll have a blonde, you'll have a red
and you'll have a black.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all that really is is different points
of when the trichome is in development.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all that really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It speaks to the level of oxidization.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole other hash world though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the original hash world I guess
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: First generation.
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's be clear we're not exactly doing
hash like they did at traditionally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Traditionally it was a dry sift product.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's going back to cannabinoid
percentages none of that would go higher
[SPEAKER_06]: than 35 40 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we're.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just quickly you grew up in Spain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when did you first have ice water hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Until I went to Amsterdam in my late
teens.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I smoked ice later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ballpark what year.
[SPEAKER_06]: 1999.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before that it was all dry sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: All dry sift.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah generally I mean not generally
exclusively at that time from Morocco you
[SPEAKER_06]: were only getting very high end pressed
dry sift.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's more of the traditional.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how they've made it forever in
Morocco.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're also more likely to have foreign
object get into a dry sift than you are
[SPEAKER_03]: with the cold water.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of foreign objects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the question I asked the other
night was is there still a market for dry
[SPEAKER_00]: sift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like is there some appreciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like do you absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean he can speak to it as well because
we operate in.
[SPEAKER_06]: We operated extensively in the traditional
space.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I say that I'm referring to the
two one five medical space so not the
[SPEAKER_06]: recreational since you know post 2016
space.
[SPEAKER_06]: So working in that space I got to learn
that there still is a lot of demand for
[SPEAKER_06]: these products like a very specific
replication of what people had before is
[SPEAKER_06]: always wanted.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now it's not your average young
American no way.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's your imported Saudi or your older
hippie you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a certain demographic without a
doubt.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not as big.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean and again this is all niche niche
level products.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean we work with BDS analytics and
really the cold water press is
[SPEAKER_06]: representing one point two one point three
percent of the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean it is small.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is it trending like exponential.
[SPEAKER_06]: We would like to believe so.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean and not only that our mission
in Cali hash is to do that and to educate
[SPEAKER_06]: and to bring it back to the masses.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean the reality of cold water extract
and its most you know stepping back from
[SPEAKER_06]: all this and its most philosophical sense
and it's like what makes it different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is it better.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of the other extractions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I say that I'm referring to
butane hexane propane ethanol rosin even.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all using high pressure or high
heat or a combination of both.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you're doing that you actually
change the size and the shape of the
[SPEAKER_06]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we know this because in our lab we
produce all of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We produce distillate and a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll take all these different
products like CO2 extraction and
[SPEAKER_06]: distillate and we'll put it under the
microscope and we look and the molecules
[SPEAKER_06]: are very different.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're very long and they're jagged and
they they essentially change completely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you take a cold water hash product any
cold water hash product from bottom to
[SPEAKER_06]: bottom from top to bottom and including
dry sift products.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what you have when you look under a
microscope is a bunch of really smiling
[SPEAKER_06]: trichomes that just look like they were on
the plant but just collected together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy heads.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know and that's where I always go
back to in my entire career my entire you
[SPEAKER_06]: know involvement in this industry is based
on that fact that you know the best
[SPEAKER_06]: extract that represents the original
profile of the original plant is cold
[SPEAKER_06]: water extract.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know you're getting rid of the
chlorophyll and you're retaining some of
[SPEAKER_06]: the plant material.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in my hippiness I still believe some
of those phytoplanktons and those little
[SPEAKER_06]: things in the plant material I believe
they're still they're still important you
[SPEAKER_06]: know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah I mean and going back to the
original question we are developing
[SPEAKER_06]: premium lines and rosin lines because of
course we want to access those markets
[SPEAKER_06]: because there are the younger demographic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your average you know 20 to 30 year old in
America today is dabbing exclusively.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well so within ice water I almost want to
call you a traditional list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like your product is absolutely temple
balls basically not rosin jam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what what's your kind of.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was two part because of course I'm
passionate about this product because of
[SPEAKER_06]: my involvement in my life and my
childhood.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we get the quasar going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all let's talk about what our
first thoughts on the quasar.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I love the look of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah I mean I've seen it in videos but
seen it in person just really brings it to
[SPEAKER_06]: life.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then mostly I mean it's just the
manufacturing of it is really impeccable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Spot on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inside the glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah we've already placed the hash in
there and this is lava cake which is a
[SPEAKER_06]: derivative of wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is this hash here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually what you're supposed to do with
the coal is you're supposed to heat it
[SPEAKER_03]: away from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really have anything for that
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: No tongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Studios half built.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a long time since I smoked
hookah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to do it a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little hype back in my 2008.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well I used to never smoke the quasar
before but I've smoked a bunch of times
[SPEAKER_06]: especially when I was younger in Spain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I smoked hash mixed in with the actual
hookah tobacco.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah we tried that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean it lasts for four hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean yeah as long as you enjoy
tobacco it is killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always a good one in the party scene.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you put levels of hash in it so
it's like different times you have like
[SPEAKER_06]: really big hits.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be kind of cool to be sitting
around.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well that was some of the things we did in
high school when we were kids.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know we'd hang out at my house in the
roof and we'd just sash all night long and
[SPEAKER_06]: smoke the hookah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that's kind of what I want to get
going in here is like having a hookah out
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time where it's like it's so
communal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me one of the big things is
there are people who appreciate hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you introduce it to your average
person who's like how the fuck am I
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I supposed to do with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the challenge of my entire
marketing team.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah and part of it's the way you go about
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: No he can answer very well because Joe's
in charge of our PAD team and part of the
[SPEAKER_06]: answer is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is PAD team?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a carryover from the traditional
medical market.
[SPEAKER_06]: It stands for patient appreciation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now they call them different things but
demos.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean you almost need like a
guerrilla marketing ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Frenchy Canole every event he has his
hookah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has like the octopus arms going into
everyone's mouth and he's like that's
[SPEAKER_00]: Frenchy heaven right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh and he's done great things for Hash in
America.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean I don't know if I.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also a specific demographic to use it
with a hookah too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah Frenchy's done amazing things and
yeah I commend him for his not only his
[SPEAKER_06]: teaching because that's what he primarily
does is his classes and I love that you
[SPEAKER_06]: know sharing the knowledge and not only by
sharing the knowledge you get these
[SPEAKER_06]: passionate little pools of people and
little networks of people that are I mean
[SPEAKER_06]: those are more and more people into the
hash products in America I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I barely smoke flour nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm still recovering from Monday
night at the History of Roz and I know you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys like Spaniards right you have the
role of spliffs right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I'm still recovering from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I used to just peer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You had a few spliffs.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Spaniard was in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was all stressed out because the
venue like tobacco is like they're like.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't tell you the times I go to parties
and like if you light a cigarette they'll
[SPEAKER_07]: literally ask you to leave but if you
light a joint 20 people come to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't always like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: No it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is awesome.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it the coal that's not we have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this the coal we bought Joe.
[SPEAKER_03]: No no that's the.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it kind of fits the quasar nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably a cool picture with the
little sparks the flames.
[SPEAKER_02]: What.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally this is hopefully this rug is not
like super flammable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily we got glass below it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you moved from Spain to like what was
your journey like Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I grew up in Spain.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was born in New York originally.
[SPEAKER_06]: I moved very young to Spain because that's
where my father's from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where in Spain.
[SPEAKER_06]: We started in Madrid.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: My family is originally from the south of
Spain though from Jerez.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have like a long heritage there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But but yeah I moved there when I was
quite young in the 90s went to you know
[SPEAKER_06]: middle school and high school there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then at the end of high school because
I was a native English speaker and I
[SPEAKER_06]: wanted to get better at English and learn
in English.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I moved to London and I spent 10
years in London.
[SPEAKER_06]: I studied in London for five and a half
years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did a philosophy degree and a couple of
other courses and then I worked for three
[SPEAKER_06]: three or four years there to end the
production thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also I was in financial services
for two years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to be a broker right out of the
university and I was it was just not for
[SPEAKER_06]: me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean I was good at it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just wasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey you tried it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just insipid.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was no like creativity involved and
I'm a creative person.
[SPEAKER_02]: So were you always dabbling in hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean I can admit it now but during that
time I was importing hash from Spain and
[SPEAKER_00]: selling it on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in London in London.
[SPEAKER_06]: So talk about before 2001 and before 9 11
and after that it got trickier.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was all Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like where where was it coming from
Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: My contacts from Madrid.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all growing up in Madrid.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ended up becoming very close to my my
dealers and they were all Moroccan.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know I am proud to call some of
them my good friends today and one in
[SPEAKER_06]: particular Gussie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out to Gussie.
[SPEAKER_06]: He he was the one he would he was our main
supplier.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah I mean these guys were bringing
in you know vast amounts.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was always in 200 gram bars.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a kilo was five bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the current market for the
Moroccan hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just done or no.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean in Europe it's still there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Spain it's you know it's getting a lot
of competition now because Spain is
[SPEAKER_06]: liberalizing and people are allowed to
grow personal amounts and that allows
[SPEAKER_06]: other people to grow more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so in let's say the Barcelona are they
coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you call them in bars collectives.
[SPEAKER_06]: They call them still because they're
members.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're member member club.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spain is more like it's more like
California circa 2000.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to try and compare it to
something and it was before 2007 when we
[SPEAKER_06]: got everything more sorted out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so if you hit kind of any club in
Barcelona in the hash space and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: in the flower space too like what what
what's trending up and down like Moroccan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like is California weed in the in the
Spanish.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And not weed but genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now the Moroccan growers and I know
some of these people they've all
[SPEAKER_06]: transferred.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've stopped growing their original
strains and the original genetics and
[SPEAKER_06]: they're now all growing things that you
and I would know very well.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know if you go to Morocco now you go
to the Rift Mountains.
[SPEAKER_06]: Walkers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Skittles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh gee.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean cookies.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean they really are getting lemon kush.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're getting stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're getting California genetics and
they're getting a lot of Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_06]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know but grown in Spain.
[SPEAKER_06]: No no no this is all grown in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Moroccan.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the Moroccan industry in Morocco is
now shifting from dry sift to making
[SPEAKER_06]: proper bubble hash with ice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was another conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The new age is kind of it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have to compete.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their market has always been Europe and
it's a big market for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean all of Amsterdam's hash comes from
Morocco and they've been the dominant the
[SPEAKER_06]: dominant supplier for you know at least 70
80 years now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So and there's still a market though for
the traditional Moroccan hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah I mean I know for a fact right now
you can buy in London off the street an
[SPEAKER_06]: eighth of hash Moroccan hash your normal
average hash for 20 pounds.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's actually cheap much cheaper than
it is here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know the illegal market is so
established in Europe that the hash is
[SPEAKER_06]: literally in every city and those
distribution channels are so devalued.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know I had to admit Europe is you
know it's a little bit old school compared
[SPEAKER_06]: to over here as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know people there's still a lot half
of all of Spain's economy is under the
[SPEAKER_06]: table.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can say the same for Greece and Italy
and those are the California.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are the entry points for in our
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: But those are the entry points for for all
the products.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah I mean to answer your question
things are changing.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're having to compete much more with
locally produced source material from
[SPEAKER_06]: Spain but there's still a vast market for
Morocco and they're having to compete.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well what's interesting to me is you also
said that so Morocco you think
[SPEAKER_00]: traditionally like their land race
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're now like woohoo like California
genetics like let's.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is almost kind of sad in a way.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the very affluent people that
were in that industry in Morocco they
[SPEAKER_06]: would send their children for school
because they had money to Spain and some
[SPEAKER_06]: of the people I went to school with
happened to be the children of some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: people growing this product in the Rift
mountains.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Morocco.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I actually have gone there I've seen
all this shit and I mean and I and I am in
[SPEAKER_06]: contact with some of these people to this
day.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm fully aware and they are they're
getting genetics from from us here and
[SPEAKER_06]: they're getting genetics from Amsterdam
and they're understanding the new market
[SPEAKER_06]: and they're consulting with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why I can't remember was Morocco or
Lebanon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do was talking about how they like
they grow in the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they're also using salts like
salt based fertilizers which kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: destroys the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so instead of having that living soil
it's not probiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost unrecoverable.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just the uphill.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you test your average Moroccan hash
you'll find every contaminant and they
[SPEAKER_06]: have.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean recently they did a study and they
tested I don't know how many street level
[SPEAKER_06]: hash from Madrid.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eighty something percent came back
positive for feces.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think over 80 percent came positives for
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the way they smuggle it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how they get the feces and then the
way they grow it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how they get the pesticides.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean it's extremely dirty.
[SPEAKER_06]: Extremely bad for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Luckily you're smoking it so you're
combusting some of the badness away.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're going to make edibles out of
that stuff you probably will get very
[SPEAKER_06]: sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean when we were kids we didn't
actually make edibles but if we had we
[SPEAKER_06]: probably would have gotten very sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the way they smuggle it is they
make little beotas.
[SPEAKER_06]: We call them beotas in Spain these little
eggs and they swallow them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they later then they excrete them
later.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know they stink.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean even once you take all the plastic
off and I remember as a kid we were in the
[SPEAKER_06]: plazas.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'd smell it and you'd be like is it
good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'd say how shitty does this smell.
[SPEAKER_07]: And literally I'm not kidding it smelled.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean it is that bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know luckily things are changing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Luckily legalization brings a whole new
environment of transparency where we can
[SPEAKER_06]: know what the hell is in the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean right here you can look at this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know all of this is tested for 500
different contaminants.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know you have your total profile of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have herbicides heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean even me now I have a hard time
smoking anything that's not tested because
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so scared because I realize how much
bad things we were consuming.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean the vape epidemic right now is a
perfect example of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you guys have your own cultivation.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we use we're exclusively sourcing all
of our biomass from three different major
[SPEAKER_06]: producers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonder Bread.
[SPEAKER_06]: Project Cannabis which is I don't know if
you know them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're also triple seven.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a bunch of brands with Project
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's their retail name.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then and then yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Headwaters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Wonder Bread is indoor in the valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is everything indoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's indoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had bad luck because I'm actually a
proponent of fresh outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I'm going.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: My issue is and I make some of my best
material in the north to this day and with
[SPEAKER_00]: that exact material meaning like up in the
Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those boys do good up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean I've been working exclusively with
a guy who's in his 50s and he is I mean
[SPEAKER_06]: talk about a hash master.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he could even you know eclipse our
friend Frenchie in terms of volume.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean I know for a fact he's produced you
know he's cultivating his own.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's growing his own.
[SPEAKER_06]: No no.
[SPEAKER_06]: He went to school there.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has access to the market in general.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway I was segueing but point is yeah
you get a completely different product
[SPEAKER_06]: when you're using an outdoor as opposed to
yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you do really good stuff comes from
really good outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been told specifically like light
depth because you get more containment of
[SPEAKER_02]: the environment more control but you still
use that sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have I haven't had any outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually I do have some in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Power's not on yet though.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have evacuations out down there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully it's OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of people has power today.
[SPEAKER_06]: North as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of a lot of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So dramatic.
[SPEAKER_06]: This time of year sucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the fires man.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah I heard the sun is on fire right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a proponent of sun grown.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now again when you're making some of the
other stuff like when you're trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: make non-traditional hats when you're
trying to make you know your rosin grade
[SPEAKER_06]: or your premium grade I like to use
indoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: I prefer it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now why we're using indoor in the south is
because that is the most accessible
[SPEAKER_06]: product.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's and it's usually cleaner.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know we're having some we had some
problems with some of the source material
[SPEAKER_06]: coming from some of these new gardens
because a lot of these new gardens in
[SPEAKER_06]: Santa Barbara and you know in the
greenhouses the greenhouses there
[SPEAKER_06]: retrofitted old farms.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah we were in a cut flower I was in
Carpinteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of dirt coming from
Carpinteria where you know when people are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cut flowers like pesticides or
just everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because flowers you don't eat them.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So anything that was involved with flowers
you're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't even go near there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would take 20 years to get the heavy
metals out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for me it was the pesticides at first
but now it's the heavy metals that have
[SPEAKER_06]: really come in.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know because we're finding that when
you're concentrating and if you even have
[SPEAKER_06]: a little bit of heavy metals in the source
material when you're concentrating you're
[SPEAKER_06]: concentrating the heavy metals as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean and especially in California
California is by far the strictest
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis test in the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not even.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to be clear let's make this a point.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean we are testing every single unit.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not like other states where they can
just test bulk units.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know we literally have to hand in
pallets of packaged stuff and then they
[SPEAKER_06]: take and they use an algorithm to pick
from the from the whole you know we'll
[SPEAKER_06]: give them two thousand at a time and
they'll have an algorithm to pick you know
[SPEAKER_06]: it's number 112 200 to make sure it's an
appropriate representation of the
[SPEAKER_06]: population and they'll test 15 individual
units to make sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean anything that fails gets
immediately confiscated by the BCC and
[SPEAKER_06]: it's destroyed and you have to pay for it
to be destroyed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean we learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's partly why we've now we were
trying to reduce those sort of issues and
[SPEAKER_06]: working exclusively with with with lice
not just licensed always licensed but with
[SPEAKER_06]: more reputable biomass producers more
established.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we don't use much.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know if you compare us to you know say
distillate manufacturing like I said in
[SPEAKER_06]: the beginning we're an artisanal process.
[SPEAKER_06]: We use small batches and that's how we
like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The control factors.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we're you know right now at our
current demand you know we need anywhere
[SPEAKER_06]: from 300 to 600 pounds a month which it's
with you I'm sure no is absolutely
[SPEAKER_06]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean I have some biomass sources that
won't take my call unless I'm asking for
[SPEAKER_06]: thousands a week.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know we're looking for very fresh
material we're willing to pay a premium
[SPEAKER_06]: over the general market but you know it
has to specifically be you know a trichome
[SPEAKER_06]: dries out basically within 30 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have we want it cured but we don't
want it to dry it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like that middle point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have after it's cured to a certain
point do you have them freeze it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've learned over the years that freezing
is not the best thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've heard of freezer burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So freezer burn is another way of saying
that things are drying out.
[SPEAKER_06]: It dries out as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what happens when you go below zero and
if you keep going more and more below zero
[SPEAKER_06]: is you actually crystallize each trichome
because the liquid in it that's left
[SPEAKER_06]: that's the important part the oil it
crystallizes and uncrystallizes and during
[SPEAKER_06]: that process it loses more and more of its
liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like if you have a water
bottle in the freezer that's full it will
[SPEAKER_02]: expand over flow so the trichome kind of
like bust open.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of ruined huh.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah so all of our freezers we keep them
at just above freezing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the ideal temperature is 34.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you keep everything at 34 and your
trichomes are happy little babies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't even have to like if I do have a
freezer that I have to use because maybe
[SPEAKER_06]: you're doing it long term or something and
I can't have it as long as I have a
freezer that I can use.
So that's one of the biggest advantages.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just have to make sure you're freezing
without any air just nitrogen and you know
[SPEAKER_06]: doing things like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah in my experience freezing is
actually detrimental.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other people would disagree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most of the guys on the stage
freeze right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like for me like I'm not like like
I said I have a few things different from
[SPEAKER_06]: your average guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'll give you another example.
[SPEAKER_06]: Phil from the other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Phil is who I've worked with.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a proponent of using wash bags within
the washers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I for me like mixing around like a
cube.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like for me I've experienced with those
extensively and I've found that they are
[SPEAKER_06]: really really bad you know and they really
destroy my product.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean there's different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so what do you think they're doing and
then what do you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't use anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: No I don't use anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've always used ice as the best agitator
you know and you want that free flow of
[SPEAKER_06]: ice and water to make that whirlpool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's using ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just also has in the bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what happens is you don't get this
movement.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you don't get these the trichomes all
of a sudden start.
[SPEAKER_06]: They start hitting each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: They get caught into the creases of the
bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I actually end up in my experience
and Phil and I have talked extensively
[SPEAKER_06]: about it and he always disagrees because
you know this is all masters have their
[SPEAKER_06]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah in my experience with that is I'd
always get less yield rate and the quality
[SPEAKER_06]: was a little less.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now what it does with the annoying side of
it is the machines you have to clean them
[SPEAKER_06]: more.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's more labor.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I've had the same kind of same
experience but I haven't had much like R&D
[SPEAKER_02]: in washing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a small little bubble bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tried it with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like it's way too fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to be more free flow and kind of
control.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're right now experimenting with a whole
new setup.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you guys know the
Bruteless setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: My eyes are on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK yeah we're looking at it as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess everybody is and they don't use
bags and they don't use bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you talk to Frenchy as well he swears
bags off just like I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean there's definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mean in the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah yeah yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they were collecting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not the collection bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately that's a necessary evil for
all of us.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are people that use bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you have Whistler Tech yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even in the Bruteless you're using
collection bags.
[SPEAKER_06]: No the only way to not use collection bags
is to go to the Whistler Tech out of
[SPEAKER_06]: Canada and you're dropping three fifty
four hundred thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you know anyone in L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: who has a Whistler Tech unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's all recorded isn't it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do and unfortunately it's someone
that is a partner with one of my partners
[SPEAKER_06]: and of his exposure to my world.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's now you know coming to compete with
us and he bought a he has a six hundred
[SPEAKER_06]: thousand dollar Whistler Tech setup going
in Van Nuys in the next two months and
[SPEAKER_06]: he'll be producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is this someone who's a competent like
a respected hash maker who bought the
[SPEAKER_00]: latest and greatest technology or is this
some dude who has a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an opportunist.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know again I mean in the end of
the day they're they're coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have actually heard two other instances
of them being installed.
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing with Whistler is they're so
massive and custom build that they
[SPEAKER_06]: literally it takes like three or four
months to to purchase it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_06]: They come and see your site.
[SPEAKER_06]: They approve you.
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually look at your schematics they
build out the lab specific for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know there's certain little things
they can change so they build it specific
[SPEAKER_06]: for your space.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like I said it's like the minimum is
four hundred and what you really need is
[SPEAKER_06]: six hundred thousand.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know they are expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so talk about like.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean sorry to interrupt your
question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean said all that about the equipment
the Whistler Tech and the Bruteless.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always love to tell this to my partners
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the best stuff from some of the
best masters and I'm talking about the guy
[SPEAKER_06]: up north that I've worked with these in
the 50s and doing it for 35 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: He makes it not even a horse trough and a
paddle.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: A stainless steel horse trough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he doesn't get 12 13 percent yields
but that's not if he doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_06]: He gets 7 8 percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: But his quality is amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Impeccable impeccable impeccable.
[SPEAKER_06]: He knows him well as well.
Impeccable.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a guy though that you can never get
off the mountain and never get him in the
[SPEAKER_06]: lab and he never works with anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know he's just going to always be
that he's very happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know to give you an idea he can
produce alone five pounds in four hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen him do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's that's that's remarkable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not many people can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is he with limited equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is he getting source material from friends
or is he growing himself.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's still in the traditional marketplace
and he's getting it all from medical
[SPEAKER_06]: friends friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting back to what we were talking
about before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're working with Wonder Bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were the other two.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonder Bread we're starting to work with
right now we're receiving exclusively from
[SPEAKER_06]: Triple 7 and Project Cannabis and that
whole team and then Headwaters.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the interplay between you saying
I would love you to grow these genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're the best for extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well for example being like here's what we
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: No great question.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we love Project Cannabis because they
have 800 light facility that's around the
[SPEAKER_06]: corner from our downtown lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what it gives us is access to like to
material that was cut the day before.
[SPEAKER_06]: And since we only need small batches it
works very well for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: The first like couple of weeks or no you
got to put more in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's the problem guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Frenchy I've never seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Frenchy just has it fully packed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he's just like put it off.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if this coal is not working great
we have another one we can try.
[SPEAKER_06]: Joe if you can handle this.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah I mean it's a long process
getting a reputable grower to grow your
[SPEAKER_06]: own genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what we're looking to do with Project
Cannabis we're already in negotiations
[SPEAKER_06]: with them because they have like I said
800 light facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: Each of their rooms is 20 30 lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's easy for them to dedicate one room
to a certain strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're very keen on having them produce
just exclusively for us Himalayan genetics
[SPEAKER_06]: you know so the proper original indoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like what can you talk about?
[SPEAKER_06]: Afghani to talk about one really Afghani
is the one I'm most keen on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean I've been working with Afghani
strains from the north and I have a good
[SPEAKER_06]: supplier out there who grows in
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_06]: But to actually to get your own seeds from
the Himalayas to you know to take 30 or 40
[SPEAKER_06]: of them and to do some genetic testing
yourself and really wheeze you know
[SPEAKER_06]: whittle down to those two or three
phenotypes that you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: That whole process is not only entirely
fun and satisfying on a passion level but
[SPEAKER_06]: it's incredible for marketing and for your
brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: People want to know where it's coming
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am talking from my own experience like
that's why I started doing what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I want to know where it came
from how it was processed and how it gets
[SPEAKER_02]: in my hands or in my lungs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as our market evolves it's evolving in
that direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean very acutely recently with the vape
epidemic again you know everyone's looking
[SPEAKER_06]: for holistic products they're looking for
products that guarantee you know their
[SPEAKER_06]: source.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I turned on to just the ice
water hash you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was a soccer mom and I heard this pen
was made from just you know no gas no
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing just ice and water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna people gonna take off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if they also know it came locally
sourced up in you know I'm a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: Santa Barbara area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they all knew that like you're
saying that's where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it's funny because I my neighbor who
doesn't smoke but he has like a Bebo pen
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's like you know this is what is
currently for people like me and him like
[SPEAKER_00]: considered a luxury product like a Louis
Vuitton bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like yeah that's like mid grade
concentrate for premium pricing like but
[SPEAKER_00]: your soccer mom sees the style like it
looks elegant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what you want to be pulling out of
your purse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just putting everything in here now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no turning back.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we're doing now is throwing some
raw product on top and we have all the
[SPEAKER_06]: press product underneath.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just add some aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't really we just blew through all
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well so with those Himalayan land is that
any genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like are you looking at the trichome head
size and structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what do you look in at that you like
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes you want to make product out of
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So versus something else other than the
fact that the traditional hash going back
[SPEAKER_06]: so long was made with these land races
which is by itself a reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good reason to start.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you I mean you but your question was
perfect because you hit the other.
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason it's been so successful as a
strain for making hash is the trichome
[SPEAKER_06]: size and not only trichome size but the
plant size.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the great things about these
land races from from that part of the
[SPEAKER_06]: world is they're they tend to be very
squat with really big trichomes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for us right now in the indoor world
where a lot of us are doing double
[SPEAKER_06]: canopies and triple canopies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like these plants are ideal.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know we're negotiating with them
and exciting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stacked with those land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so from what you have here talk about
like the nuanced differences between the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kelly has whatever else you're looking
at as a hash maker as you get the source
[SPEAKER_00]: raw material of these three different
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_06]: So source material for this product in
particular and it's not live resin like we
[SPEAKER_06]: talked about this cured product is you
want it five six days.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean if you can get it the day off the
trim table that's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: But usually that's not possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want it within a week.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's generally when we get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's reassuring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: From coming off the train.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had it in the fridge the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well all the rooms again the people I work
with don't freeze anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just use 40 degree control rooms
which most people do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most people do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean I don't know who doesn't these
days.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah because again when you freeze and
unfreeze things you're actually destroying
[SPEAKER_06]: a trichome.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're making these products it's
always very useful extracts in general to
[SPEAKER_06]: think like a trichome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean it sounds silly but I like to do
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to be the trichome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what's the best environment for a
trichome with stuff to stay just the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know and if you're going to do the
freezing if you're reheating and
[SPEAKER_06]: unfreezing you know that process like you
were talking about earlier you crystallize
[SPEAKER_06]: and un-crystallize.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're putting stress on the lipid
structure of each trichome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the oil is inside the head.
[SPEAKER_06]: And once you rip open the head you're
drying out the oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only work with right now is dry
material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know it's all I can get a hold of
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of luckily that's how he I get
it like with five six days off the trim
[SPEAKER_06]: table.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the best from in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I freeze it so maybe I'll try to not
freeze it and see what kind of results I
[SPEAKER_02]: get.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try not freezing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: See if there's any difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: I go you know I've gone back on that once
and like I think a year ago and I started
[SPEAKER_06]: freezing again and then I went back.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know I'm not 100 on it either like
anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You go you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're always learning.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm always.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have nothing set put.
[SPEAKER_06]: People ask me all the time what do you do
how you do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's artisanal.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of different every time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you got to feel out though that
specific biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah the cold different yeah and
different strain sizes different
[SPEAKER_06]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a favorite cultivar or like so
far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you like strain strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean anything Afghani I love.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Gorilla Glue which has one parent
Afghani I love and you can get a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: Gorilla Glue right now on the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So personally I get amazing results with
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you do for now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: G4 sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And did you for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gorilla Glue for.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the parent of that the male parent I
think is Afghani.
[SPEAKER_06]: So.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other one I've had amazing
success over the last 12 years in
[SPEAKER_06]: California.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean up north you have a lot of access
to that plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah it's a sativa and people are like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you make hash out of it you get
some of the best results.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean that's very true about sativas and
concentrates in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like even indicated people will complain
about sativas.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people that like concentrates the
sativa it still sedates you pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: heavily.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the difference is you get you get you
get a lot more profiled options.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just get more profiles more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: More and more a variance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that couch lock that most like
guys not most guys but like those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's the flip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the flavors are just attractive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that tangy that you just had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you said the word not a good yielder
but it's a flavorful one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tangy's not a good yielder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to mix it with like a great turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're looking for in hash because like
one of the things that everyone associates
[SPEAKER_06]: with hash is this couch lock feeling like
people tend to think that hash gets more
[SPEAKER_06]: of a body high and they're absolutely
correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: Back in the day that's why that's why
that's why people like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the traditional kind.
OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: Too much of a couch lock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But today you might want that more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I was just smoking different hash
back as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But why that's associated is very specific
reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you have live product live
cannabinoids a lot of it is CBG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it is THCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sleepy right.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBG is the precursor.
[SPEAKER_06]: CBG is precursor to almost all the CBs and
the THCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that makes you sleepy.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBN.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now CBN is only produced naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Messing up.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: By oxidization.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's oxidization.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just it's a contact with oxygen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's either air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it like decarboxylate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah in a way.
[SPEAKER_06]: But no decarboxylate is different.
[SPEAKER_06]: So decarboxylation speaks to taking one
carbon trichome off of the molecule
[SPEAKER_06]: trichome one carbon atom off of the
molecule.
[SPEAKER_06]: So on your Delta 9 molecule you have an
extra carbon molecule.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now when you decarboxylate you turn it
into its bioavailable form you're taking
[SPEAKER_06]: off one carbon molecule.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that makes it bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a chemist.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is slightly different.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we're speaking to is old old weed
does the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you smoke old hippie weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It gives you that couch lock too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or old Jamaican shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like old Jamaican shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to smoke in England.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would spend a year on a boat getting
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even in England we were like why not.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why did this get us so fucked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's CBN.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I've come to appreciate fully why
I love hash.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you really come down to it
personally for me it's CBN.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we're learning is the more we age
product the more CBN is created.
[SPEAKER_06]: And naturally in the flower CBN when it's
fresh is at point zero one point zero two.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the time it's a month old it's getting
to the two percents.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've aged stuff to six months and
we're getting to the six percents.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that stuff really does knock you on
your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you took a temple ball that was
buried for like 10 years and pulled it
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never been able to save hash for 10
years in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you would.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean we're developing multiple lines
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some tincture lines that are CBN
derivatives.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the whole intention of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a big believer in CBN.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the couch lock.
[SPEAKER_06]: I go low to get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I always look for the couch
lock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always look for the couch lock.
[SPEAKER_02]: A big snapper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a very hyper individual naturally so I
love CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Super on the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: ADD ADHD like going going and the couch
lock really just mellows you out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean that's also why we prefer the cured
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know and that's why people that's why
we built this brand in this form for that
[SPEAKER_06]: level.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is about the CBN and the
oxidization that occurs converting those
[SPEAKER_06]: molecules for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still learning myself as we all are.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know one thing that's helped me a
lot is all the testing we do now.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know and I'm able to R&D a product one
month three months six months in and
[SPEAKER_06]: really see how the profile changes and you
really start understanding.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And another thing that that disappears is
and I've come to appreciate is the
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenes and hash disappear when it's
cured over time and oxidized over time.
[SPEAKER_06]: You end up with what people say is a hash
smell.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well there's actually a terpene called
hashing and it's that is the terpene.
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of the terpenes change into this
hashing terpene and that carries with it
[SPEAKER_06]: its own potential effects and actually
have a little hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
That's good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
