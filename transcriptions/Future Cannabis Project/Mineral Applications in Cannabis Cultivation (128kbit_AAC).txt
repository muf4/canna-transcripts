[SPEAKER_04]: I think of it as nutrients and microbes
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Scott, I think of you as someone who eats
books and does research and then you poop
[SPEAKER_04]: out digestible, intelligent, coherent
thought bites for the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually been my role the entire
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shockingly, a lot of people don't want to
eat your poo, but I've been eating it
[SPEAKER_04]: since day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just clarify, there's no feces
involved, but no, that's totally what
[SPEAKER_01]: happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come from Southern California from a
pretty diverse neighborhood and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the homies from high school went really
hard on the indoor OG cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to come along and check it out and
it would be me and a bunch of homies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, well, why is that happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone would be like, the plants need the
proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, the plants need the proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, why are we doing this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants need the proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, none of you motherfuckers know
any reason why we're doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: No disrespect, but they were doing a great
job, but nobody knew why.
[SPEAKER_01]: My compulsion and obsession was the why.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to know why I'm doing something if
I'm going to tinker with it or else it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not worth my effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it has to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just would try to figure out why
something was happening or what did the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient even do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does nitrogen even do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does potassium even do?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we solve these problems?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just carrying on that same energy brought
me here, I guess, trying to figure out how
[SPEAKER_01]: to properly digest the complicated
science.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved learning about the minerals and
the spraying the minerals from you and Sam
[SPEAKER_02]: from Soilscape.
[SPEAKER_02]: That whole mineral attitude or doing that
and spraying is often like what you were
[SPEAKER_02]: doing down at that nursery.
[SPEAKER_02]: If more people would do that and even the
big facilities, I'd like to somehow slide
[SPEAKER_02]: that in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I run that file.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam had me check it out too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed it for my hill because I have
such an aggressive wind that I theorized
[SPEAKER_00]: that I wasn't getting calcium transport
adequately through the roots because the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment was so aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I think I really have to run a
foliar program to offset my environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to Sam.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, Kevin, I got this killer
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran it last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants have never looked so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had so few issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kept them on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a gift to be able to be around people
who are working on all the fringes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I always love hanging out with
you because I'm like, you've been touching
[SPEAKER_00]: the hoops since before.
[SPEAKER_00]: People knew what hoops were.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we stay on this as a coherent topic,
which is spraying minerals?
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it a phyloscape program that Sam
had over at a soil scape out of Arcata.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just really a good comprehensive
mineral nutrient spray program.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I went into it for is that my
situation is I have such a rough
[SPEAKER_00]: environment up the hill that the finished
product is excellent, but I never get the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth out of the plants that I wanted
because they're working so hard to work in
[SPEAKER_00]: that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I theorized that I needed to go into leaf
foliar development so that I could get
[SPEAKER_00]: around having to have the plant go through
the metabolic process from the root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: One day, Sam gives me a call and says,
hey, we have this beautiful program coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went down to the shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a look at an operation that he had
been using it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality of that, it was on an indoor
that he was shooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was stunning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, look, let me run it on my hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked the program up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the best run last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, when I ran those varieties on
that white label, there was at least 25
[SPEAKER_00]: farms that ran the same exact plants that
I ran.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone in California using those
varieties, I had the highest turp levels
[SPEAKER_00]: and highest cannabinoid levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had zero problems with the plants
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used beneficial insects in terms of
inoculation so that I had releases
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the season so that if I had any
problems come in, I would have a bank of
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials to do the job for me because I
don't like to use any kind of spray,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in tough environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprays are tough on leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the leaves are going through the beat
and they take up on the hill, the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: stresses out because of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That foliar program gave me incredible
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end product came out beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out so good that I picked up
enough to do the 18,000 square foot this
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to run it a second season
because I had such success with that
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar program.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe in it because Scott turned me on
to it and I got some clones that had a
[SPEAKER_02]: little spider mites or whatever issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we were talking about earlier,
we're really spraying for war all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if more people were spraying for
health, they would actually see a better
[SPEAKER_02]: result in the plant health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Secondly, the bugs don't like getting
sprayed with just plain water anyway if
[SPEAKER_02]: you do it every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a certain point where I was
trying to mimic what Scott was doing at a
[SPEAKER_02]: nursery where in the evening time,
I was spraying five, six nights a week
[SPEAKER_02]: with a different mineral throughout those
whole programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hadn't done any soil analysis or water
tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just said, fuck it, I'm going to spray
minerals and have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things he had me spray was
cocoa and aloe.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants just loved it and the bugs
hated it and they went away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never sprayed any type of pesticide.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just sprayed three else the whole time
and the plants got better.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bugs didn't like it and it was just
this win-win situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that can be done more at
scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just hard to implement and get people
to jump on to that, swallow that pill
[SPEAKER_02]: because we're so forced into the IPM
program of actually the war path.
[SPEAKER_02]: The health has to be there too,
obviously, but I think we could make a big
[SPEAKER_02]: turn in some of these bigger facilities if
we could incorporate some more health
[SPEAKER_02]: sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fully agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be proactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it was three times a week,
so Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would either get in at four o'clock in
the morning or I could shoot in the
[SPEAKER_00]: evening too so it had time to penetrate
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made such a difference that the people
who've been up the hill prior and saw the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants using that treatment couldn't
believe it because we've always
[SPEAKER_00]: historically had transplant issues in
terms of just slower growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I'll never get giant plants up
there because I have such a wind load all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time that when I run my test crops
down low, say at 550 feet at my spot,
[SPEAKER_00]: or I run it up at my farm at 2300 feet,
I get two to three times bigger plant down
[SPEAKER_00]: below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same mix, same media, same operator,
same cultivar, only difference
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that that particular place has an
impact on the plant, but when we utilized
[SPEAKER_00]: that foliar nutrition program to just
assist with the plant's uptake so it
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have to work so hard to pull it
through the vascular system from below up,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants just exploded.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends that came up and saw it,
they were just like, what did you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so dramatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the quality of the flower was
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got hit up by the company,
they said, hey, you just clean house on
[SPEAKER_00]: your turps and your cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only was the plant healthy,
but because it was healthier, it was able
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually go through its chemical
process and generate what we want,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is those desirable chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we want without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just quickly, Kevin, you mentioned
frequency, which is three times a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: Scott, can you talk about what minerals
are in the mixes that you're recommending?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you change it based on different stages
of plant growth?
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd have different mixes during the
early stages, veg and so on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To further clarify, the kit that they're
talking about is defined as the Filoscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the name of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's 11 or 12 bottles in the kit,
some powders, some liquids, and it's made
[SPEAKER_01]: by Soilscape Solutions out in Arcata.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I say is this kit
that Sam came out with, I will say we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: look back in history and say this kit was
one of the more dramatic impactors on the
[SPEAKER_01]: organic sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: He assures me that everything in there
except for one product is all organic and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's used with amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does look like chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the stuff's blue because copper is
blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does look like chemical nutrients,
but I trust Sam that all of them except
[SPEAKER_01]: just the nitrogen phosphate product are
organic, but it gives you the flexibility
[SPEAKER_01]: of hydroponics, which is what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: The standard kit has two recipes that you
do three times a week and alternate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has worked everywhere we've used it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the kit in a little bit different
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally use it as a toolkit for
hitting ideal math numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That does change slightly by the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also don't use every product in the kit
because we have some other products that I
[SPEAKER_01]: use in substitution.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in essence, what Sam's kit allows me
to do is you can formulate a full year
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient that has ideal values of almost
every main nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not seen anything else that
compares to that capability at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing on the planet that I think
gives you those capabilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use them everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use them with the hydroponic farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use them at the living soil farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think every single commercial farm I
work with at least gets a sample kit,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a funny deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it shows how much I believe in
that product is that by definition,
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam is an exact competitor of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We both make soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We both do consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We both do mineral analysis, and we both
do biological analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy that kit so much that I send my
competitors to his office to order
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that speaks to Sam as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't feel threatened by him and I trust
him and I respect him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, nothing's good from turning our
clients to him as well, which I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: rare in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to the good products that
support this industry and what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to do and achieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kit's extremely powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess to more clearly define,
I more go for a full fertility approach
[SPEAKER_01]: every chance I get because I'm trying to
be simple and scalable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most farms that hire us have an ultimate
goal of allowing to cross state lines,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether that means they invest further in
their own business and go across the
[SPEAKER_01]: states or they find outside investment,
they create set, whatever that means to
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most farms that we work with are
ultimately looking to expand and take
[SPEAKER_01]: advantage of the open market or the open
borders when that comes in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to do that, you need to have
scalable techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, most farms that we've worked with,
there's one, two or three key components
[SPEAKER_01]: that makes that system work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't scale yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to scale processes that are
repeatable and easy and predictable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take an extremely simplified approach
to cultivation and try to just provide
[SPEAKER_01]: full fertility at each step that we can
while monitoring biological activity in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we do that, then your cultivation
experience is actually scalable.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it starts to do is it simplifies the
process so that any employee can execute
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We choose process that have really low
volatility and really low chances of going
[SPEAKER_01]: haywire so that it keeps it within the
comfort of health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the way that you can then scale that
to multiple properties is that the initial
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis is being moved to a data point.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we take all the data points of a farm,
I can sit down and aggregate all the
[SPEAKER_01]: information of multiple facilities and
identify where the problems will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the biggest obstacle to scale right
now is if your strategy for cultivation is
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying everything three times a week and
you keep adding more square footage,
[SPEAKER_01]: at what point does that become the
breaking point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sarah and I have learned to take key data
points of soil nutrition, the nutrition of
[SPEAKER_01]: the feeds and foliar, and then the
populations of the organisms in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: By taking a look at those data sets,
you can make very clear correlations as to
[SPEAKER_01]: where the problems will be and you can
focus those efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can either determine is the
reason for the dysfunction of cultural
[SPEAKER_01]: practice, like our employees doing
something that's leading to problems,
[SPEAKER_01]: or is there an imbalance problem that we
need to correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, that allows you to then maintain
those one, two, or three key employees
[SPEAKER_01]: that make the facility run, but they can
then scale their focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on what I've seen from very
intensely watching cannabis operations,
[SPEAKER_01]: because even from the first day I went
into a cannabis growing facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was watching it in extreme interest of
how to make it successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've watched these obstacles of scale and
even in those early black market days of
[SPEAKER_01]: buddies trying to scale, the same problems
that my buddies ran into going from a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple houses to a 20,000 square foot
building are the same obstacles that every
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivator everywhere is running into.
[SPEAKER_01]: There just becomes a certain point where
you can't do everything the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've always done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's tripping up anybody that's going up
in any scale, whether that's from four to
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 lights or from four facilities to 26
facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sarah and I have provided advice and
consulting to farms with as many as,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the largest group was 26 different
properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to provide solutions that can be
emailed to 26 properties and come up with
[SPEAKER_01]: something that will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those same strategies apply to a tent
grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same systemic imbalances that
lead to headaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just moving the ball to prevention
and getting to the cause of things when we
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about these IPM strategies versus
always chasing your tail and spraying to
[SPEAKER_03]: kill.
[SPEAKER_03]: We always say spray the hill, not to kill.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can help it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is what Eric was talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eric's really champion that phrase and
that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like everybody's mindset is what do I
do to kill these aphids?
[SPEAKER_01]: From our standpoint, now that accountants
are involved counting everything about our
[SPEAKER_01]: process and everything that the cultivator
does to determine if it's financially
[SPEAKER_01]: viable, one of those things is sending
employees to spray something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those employees can either spray a
pesticide or like in Kevin's experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: he sprayed a foliar nutrient that led to
more terpenes, more potency, more
[SPEAKER_01]: saleability, higher velocity in the
market, all those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bugs hate it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to remind them that the bugs don't
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want the plant to get healthy
and they don't want to get hit with water
[SPEAKER_02]: even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do tornadoes affect reproduction rates
of humans?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do hurricanes affect reproduction
rates of humans?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can see it in our own life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Babies slow down a little bit when there's
a major catastrophe and a wave coming over
[SPEAKER_01]: the shore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I can only imagine that the same
thing is happening to a bug.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go in there three, four times a
week and spray anything, you're at least
[SPEAKER_01]: pissing them off and killing a couple of
eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might as well spray something that can
increase yield, spray something that can
[SPEAKER_01]: increase health, spray something that can
increase quality markers that will ease
[SPEAKER_01]: your product selling on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon and Washington, all these markets
that are completely destroyed by
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage points is really unfortunate,
but it's really shown us a lot about our
[SPEAKER_01]: process and what leads to higher numbers
because if that's the focus, that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're being put to work on.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we increase potency numbers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you definitely have to decrease
aphid problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first step and then provide
supplement that increases those numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the overall support of the plant?
[SPEAKER_05]: Replicating a natural system, we were
mentioning earlier, it's only sick plants
[SPEAKER_05]: that are being invested.
[SPEAKER_05]: The bugs are doing their job.
[SPEAKER_05]: The insects and the diseases are there to
break down that plant material that's not
[SPEAKER_05]: thriving.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the purpose and that's why those
things occur in the first place as we all
[SPEAKER_05]: agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Watching that develop and as the industry
moves more towards a greater understanding
[SPEAKER_05]: of what's going on, leaf surfaces around
roots, understanding the process of
[SPEAKER_05]: individually picking out a specific endo
or ecto mycorrhizal fungi and choosing
[SPEAKER_05]: whether or not your company is able to
grow all of that up at a vat and make it
[SPEAKER_05]: into a uniform product that people can
apply.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a completely different type of
system than understanding the minutia of
[SPEAKER_05]: being able to figure out your own compost
pile.
[SPEAKER_05]: Knowing the conditions of the place that
you're at and the different materials that
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to create new soil, new materials
to be able to feed the plant, surely it
[SPEAKER_05]: does take longer and surely there are
different types of facilities than others,
[SPEAKER_05]: but if you're dealing with plants that are
not healthy or sick or they don't have
[SPEAKER_05]: fans, they don't have the right amount of
air circulation, there's lots of things
[SPEAKER_05]: going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can be causing these issues in the
first place and you just want to watch out
[SPEAKER_05]: before they get started.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
