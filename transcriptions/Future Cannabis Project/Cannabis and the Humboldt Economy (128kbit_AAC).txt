[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's getting flushed out with
licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to see another flush out once
the temporary licenses go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be an interesting
landscape come early next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another thing I was talking to a
few growers this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them sitting on about 325 acres up
in Santa Barbara County near Longpoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the other guy has Humboldt Ranch
right outside of Eureka, literally right
[SPEAKER_01]: next to the airport.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting the two different
conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on in Humboldt is just crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't even say any cuss words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus how quick and efficient they're
being with licensing and permits too in a
[SPEAKER_01]: place like Santa Barbara County versus LA
where it's just been crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know this because you're the one
saving the day from the growers that can't
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in Humboldt, I'm in three different
jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have unincorporated area, Humboldt
County.
[SPEAKER_00]: City of Arcata.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a building in Arcata,
that's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's Eureka.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all three municipalities are on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eureka was the last one to come on board
but they're moving the fastest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're processing permit after permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting to see how the
local municipalities either roadblock or
[SPEAKER_00]: propel economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, it's real estate,
jobs, disposable income from Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your boutique shops, their business is
down but it's getting harder to find
[SPEAKER_00]: vacant real estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Housing market's doing really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grocery stores are doing really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Employment is definitely on the sore
because you drive by one of these cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities and there are people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are cars in the parking lot because
especially when you come to packaging and
[SPEAKER_00]: processing material, it takes a workforce.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to see because people don't get
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eureka for several years is not been a
thriving metropolis.
[SPEAKER_01]: When all the timber pulled out of Northern
California, by Northern California,
[SPEAKER_01]: we mean essentially north of San Francisco
or Santa Rosa more specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trinity, Humboldt, Eureka County,
Lake County, even into Nevada County,
[SPEAKER_01]: north of Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_01]: They saw this constant decline of
populace, of jobs, of opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where, again, a played out term but
that's where I think the green rush
[SPEAKER_01]: applies.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is injecting the money and the people
and everything back into societies that
[SPEAKER_01]: are kind of forgotten about.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't realize that's a big portion
of the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone thinks it's just from San
Francisco to San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like there's a whole other side of
the state from San Francisco to Medford.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the further, Eureka's pretty
down-pressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry's going to help clean up the
city.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be even better than if we can use
the cannabis to help get people off the
[SPEAKER_00]: opiates, get people off the meth and all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, besides just the economic face
value of it, that we can do a social
[SPEAKER_00]: economic improvement in terms of let's get
people on more cannabis and less opiates
[SPEAKER_00]: and less meth and all the nasty drugs that
kind of- Make it an exit drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hate to call it a drug, I think a lot
of us peers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, that's what really, never mind
Daryl Gates and the whole DARE movement
[SPEAKER_01]: from 1983, which again both of us grew up
with, put that to bed and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, if anything, if you're going to call
it a drug, this is an exit drug because to
[SPEAKER_01]: your point, opioid issue is an epidemic in
every corner of this country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just coming from that show in Utah I
mentioned, they're having problems there
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're seeing this as a solution,
not just a solution for cancer survivors
[SPEAKER_01]: like myself or for children with grand mal
and epileptic seizure issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: This really does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a miracle plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm totally serious about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talk to Aussies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Max Stone, this great guy from the
hemp embassy down in Australia,
[SPEAKER_01]: they always preach about freeing the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, at first I was like, free the plant
really?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do need to free the plant because
there's so much opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the Rostas call it the healing of the
nations.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're onto something that we'll talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
Okay.
