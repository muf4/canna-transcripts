[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is John Wilson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Tribune of the Stakeholders for
Seattle City Lights Lighting Design Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to set the table very quickly
and make up some time by talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, why do utilities care about this
conversation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they actually in it beyond the
sort of platitudes that we often hear?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm just trying to get some energy
efficiency and hit these targets,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really three reasons that
utilities are making this investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their business models are evolving,
and I'm just going to touch on that
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly, and the rest of my colleagues are
really going to take it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three topics really are, yes,
there's reliable energy savings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of like the first generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, we all understand utilities want to
get cost-effective savings, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's targets or regulations in
place, you know, requiring them to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next really big topic is what a lot of
utilities are describing generically as,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, customer service plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utilities are rapidly waking up to the
fact that they need to be part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: solution for technology transfer and not a
hindrance or, you know, somebody who is
[SPEAKER_00]: slowing that process down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to deliver, you know, technical,
professional services to utilities is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's going to reinforce the
utility business model and allow them to
[SPEAKER_00]: sustain what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last one is just kind of
funny because it's back in vogue after,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, since, like, the 1940s, but it's
next-generation electrification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this really has to do with our current
climate around carbon reduction and the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that electrification now leads to
hopefully a reduction in, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: harmful greenhouse gases and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are a utility, it's not any one
of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all three of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the utility community members in
the room, I encourage you to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: putting your business plan together and
addressing all three of these things to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a comprehensive plan for why your
utility should make a sustained investment
[SPEAKER_00]: in the CEA market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is different now than,
like, I don't know, the last five or 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, why are we at, you know,
what many people are kind of describing as
[SPEAKER_00]: an inflection point or a real growth
opportunity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I just described for you what has
changed on the utility landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no longer just about energy savings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about load growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about delivering a level of customer
service that makes, you know, that gives
[SPEAKER_00]: the utility a chance to have a positive
interaction with customers beyond just
[SPEAKER_00]: billing you once a month, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is happening is it's really how
those things are starting to align with
[SPEAKER_00]: the horticultural lighting market and
where things, you know, where the
[SPEAKER_00]: alignment is starting to come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So five, 10 years ago, we didn't have
great reliable product that was trusted by
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time wasn't right for utilities to
push that as a KWH saving mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, utilities were less interested
in load growth and electrification 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's reflected in any utility
conference that you go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the big buzzword.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last but not least, cultivators
are hungry for information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although utilities might be strange
bedfellows, as far as a resource where you
[SPEAKER_00]: would go to get that, people are hungry
for information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And utilities in just about every other
CNI market and with residential consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: have played a helpful role in the past
delivering that service and good
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see these things are up and
running.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're aligning in such a way that give
me a lot of optimism that we're gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to team up and really make a positive
impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is familiar with this basic
technology diffusion curve, invest on the
[SPEAKER_00]: left, cash out on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Matt was talking about making LED
lights in his basement, that's so far off
[SPEAKER_00]: the left that like, it's not even on this
chart, but it takes people like that to
[SPEAKER_00]: get this whole thing going, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're familiar with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is so cool, again, just reinforcing,
because I'm a visual learner, we now have
[SPEAKER_00]: organizations like the DLC, Lior is gonna
be up here taking this, that are helping
[SPEAKER_00]: propping this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have RII, what a phenomenal resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's really like, in my mind,
those two organizations are like two of
[SPEAKER_00]: the most critical pillars that needed to
be in place in order for utilities to come
[SPEAKER_00]: behind and like do the stuff that is our
bread and butter work in the traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: CNI markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we could be effective in this
market, we needed to, we needed the
[SPEAKER_00]: resources and the tools that are brought
by those other DLC and RII.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just terrific that these are in
place, because it gives us something as a
[SPEAKER_00]: utility personnel to work from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Information abounds, people are so hungry
for information out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where do you go when you're hungry for
information?
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to the YouTube, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a quick search about grow lights or
growing cannabis, you could spend all day
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the science stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could spend all day looking at this
stuff online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you might get some good nuggets
of information, it's nothing is as good as
[SPEAKER_00]: coming here to this conference and the
information that you're getting listening
[SPEAKER_00]: to these bona fide speakers get up and
really open up and share in the cross
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination we're getting with utilities
and the cultivation community coming
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside this cultivation space,
we have a really positive track record
[SPEAKER_00]: working with industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my favorite thing, the first efficient
yields workshop I went to, I did not know
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a utility function until somebody
like pointed that out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did the utility energy trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to give them props.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did so good getting out of the way
and letting there be a really healthy peer
[SPEAKER_00]: to peer information exchange that it was
unlike any other utility experience I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: ever gone to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really believe as we think about
utilities, how can we work better with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation community?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a big key.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, support good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a utility, continue to support
the good information that is out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider becoming a member of
organizations like RII.
[SPEAKER_00]: Support or at least engage with the work
DLC is doing in this horticultural space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's going to be a way to right
size your utility investment so you can be
[SPEAKER_00]: effective and participate in this market
even if you don't have a huge customer
[SPEAKER_00]: base underneath you that allows you to
have a dedicated person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amplify trusted information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my last one to sign out on,
my little daughter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water in the crops, the next generation
coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my next speaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm going to be talking about is some
industry trends that we've seen as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going on in the global market for
horticulture lighting, but then also some
[SPEAKER_02]: terminology and baselines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first again, I'm Corinne Wilder with
Fluence Bioengineering.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were a startup back in 2015 and now
we're owned by Osram, which is a $4.5
[SPEAKER_02]: billion lighting company.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got over 350 commercial cannabis
installations and over 80 commercial ag
[SPEAKER_02]: installations right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've learned a ton over that whole
time period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's one of those things that as we get
into looking at what is going on globally,
[SPEAKER_02]: we really have to pay attention to what's
coming the next 7, 10, 15 years and
[SPEAKER_02]: beyond.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we really look at, we were kind of
in as far as the whole global lighting
[SPEAKER_02]: market, sorry, excuse me, is the
greenhouse era and then going into
[SPEAKER_02]: vertical and city farming era.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's more indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more looking at R&D, vertical
farming and such.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the industry is just going to continue
to grow as we find more and more pressures
[SPEAKER_02]: environmentally and population wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully everyone in this room has
read the 2018 cannabis energy report that
[SPEAKER_02]: RII and New Frontier Data published two
years ago, which really took a very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very hard look.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was 25 plus pages of
information about just the cannabis energy
[SPEAKER_02]: sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really the key highlight there is it's 70
times more energy intensive than other
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial lighting applications right now
because of the amount of lights that's
[SPEAKER_02]: required.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to step into that a little bit
more, but also looking at the US,
[SPEAKER_02]: just US cannabis market trajectory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we've got medical and adult use
that's projected here through the year
[SPEAKER_02]: 2025.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also you can see the huge amount of
the illicit market, which is predominantly
[SPEAKER_02]: using HPS technology right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The impacts on the energy sector because
of that are just going to continue to
[SPEAKER_02]: scale up as we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to touch quickly about
segments because there's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: in this room that absolutely know this
information, hands down, back and forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's some people in this room,
we've got a very diverse crowd that is
[SPEAKER_02]: just brand new to the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really want to look at what does
greenhouse mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes these are multi-acre,
multi-hectare sites that require energy
[SPEAKER_02]: use through lighting and HVAC and reheat,
et cetera, to make sure that their crop
[SPEAKER_02]: production is going to continue.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be very small, multi-level,
two-tier sliding racks, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also a very energy intensive
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at it and our current legacy
install base as far as indoor versus
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse, a very important factor that
you have to understand when you're looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at energy modeling or producing rebates
for these potential plants is that when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're talking indoor cultivation,
you're talking sole source lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unless you're using something like
Solitube, the only lighting that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get is from the fixtures that
you're using in your environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, when you go to greenhouse and
you're looking at the supplemental
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting, which you have to look at,
this is where you're using the existing
[SPEAKER_02]: DLI from the sun plus whatever
supplemental lighting you're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for a cannabis operation, if you're
installing 900 PPF in this indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: environment here on the, what is that,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: On the left, you may only be installing
somewhere between three, four,
[SPEAKER_02]: 500 PPFD depending on where you are,
if your DLI is low or high.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's vertical farming as well that we
have to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam was talking about his farm earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's also research
environment, which are usually very
[SPEAKER_02]: tightly honed environments and require a
lot of controls.
[SPEAKER_02]: So terms and baselines and ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk a bit about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Nadia was talking about yesterday how
we haven't really touched on DLI.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't really touched on some of these
terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just go through some of them really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's PAR, which is Photosynthetic
Active Radiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really just the light,
the visible wavelength between four and
[SPEAKER_02]: 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is PAR.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Photosynthetic Photon Flux, PPF,
is the amount of light that's coming out
[SPEAKER_02]: of the fixtures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So amount of photons actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: That are coming out of the fixture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is kind of like the total number
of lumens that are coming out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: fixtures for the commercial lighting
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: PPFD, Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is how many photons are actually
hitting that plant canopy or whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy you're measuring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we call PPFD.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like foot candles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's DLI, which is Daily Light
Integral.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is the amount of light that is
hitting over a course of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a measurement of how much you're
going to get over six hours, eight hours,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10, 12, 18, whatever the time period is
that you need to measure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So quick little segue for lighting to
commercial or commercial lighting to
[SPEAKER_02]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got an office space,
I want to really look at the first
[SPEAKER_02]: category, which is PPFD on this chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a typical office space, you'll have
about 37 to 65 foot candles, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: equivalent to 6 to 10 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you will see in an office space.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody's got a Apogee or a Lycor light
meter, take it into your office and you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: see 10 or 11 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_02]: For cannabis, I mean, you can go 7,
900, 1500, 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see how much more energy
intensive that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to use the little analogy that you
think about all of the lights that are
[SPEAKER_02]: used in the Yankee Stadium, and then you
take those and you condense them into a
[SPEAKER_02]: large CVS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's about the equivalent to what a
cannabis grow operation is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have to remember always that our
true customer is actually the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we go back to maybe third, maybe fifth
grade science class and just remembering
[SPEAKER_02]: that chemical reaction behind
photosynthesis and what that means.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our true customer is actually the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to pay attention to the whole
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, there's different growth
stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in each of these growth stages,
you're going to require a different PPFD
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from germination propagation,
through veg and bulking, going into
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering and fruiting and finishing,
you can have a range of anywhere from 6,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10, 50 PPFD up to 900 and beyond.
[SPEAKER_02]: Environmental conditions, these are really
important to call out as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: because again, when you change one thing,
you're going to influence another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something about the ecosystem
that we really always have to pay
[SPEAKER_02]: attention to.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually did a study with SMUD a couple
years ago where we looked at all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: different systems together and a straight
HPS to LED conversion over to LED.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first round reduced 18% overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second round, they were able to
capture 25% savings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Casey actually touched on this in the
lighting breakout section the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's always important to test,
measure, verify, and repeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then continue to do this over and over
again so you can make incremental
[SPEAKER_02]: improvements as you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's baseline fixture crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is very important, again,
to the utilities in the room to understand
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're going from propagation to
vegetative to flower, there are definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: certain technologies that are used a lot
in these different areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you've got propagation,
and this isn't like a complete full list.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cannabis energy report has some.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also the best practices guide
calls some of these out too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can have some fixture crosses that
are quite reasonable now going from T5H0
[SPEAKER_02]: all the way to 1,000 watt high pressure
sodium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some more trends are just really quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got more and more best practices
guides and publications coming out every
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether this is something that's to do
with getting grow rooms right,
[SPEAKER_02]: LED, HVAC, something about energy,
it's really aggravating sometimes to hear
[SPEAKER_02]: that, oh, well, there's just not enough
data out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely some data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just to say and turn a blind eye
that we don't have the data, Colorado's
[SPEAKER_02]: got some really fantastic publications,
and so does California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say please go verify before
there's the idea that there's not data out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, program trends.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got state level programs that we've
talked about already.
[SPEAKER_02]: California has this awesome mixed tier
lighting for greenhouses, which is six
[SPEAKER_02]: watts and below, or six to 25 watts,
depending on what kind of tier you have
[SPEAKER_02]: for your greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as far as program levels,
Efficiency Vermont, which is Lauren,
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to have a nice rebate program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hydro-Québec also has a prescriptive
rebate program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now in Energy Trust of Oregon,
Doug is in the room, they've rolled out a
[SPEAKER_02]: program through their retail locations as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, what do customers want?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really, we have seen a very,
very dedicated trend between lighting
[SPEAKER_02]: sales and where rebates are.
[SPEAKER_02]: The better the rebates, the bigger the
market conversion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just it's been shown year
after year after year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_02]: The better incentives that we can get,
the more market adoption we absolutely get
[SPEAKER_02]: for customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is it for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am from the Design Lights Consortium.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you are a utility or have worked
with commercial lighting, you're familiar
[SPEAKER_03]: with who we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are interested in market
transformation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we promote high-quality,
energy-efficient lighting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we work with utilities, manufacturers,
energy efficiency programs in order to
[SPEAKER_03]: transform the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our guideposts are energy, quality,
and controllability.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's whether we're talking about
horticulture lighting, or network lighting
[SPEAKER_03]: controls, or our major QPL, our big list
about solid state lighting controls,
[SPEAKER_03]: which has half a million products.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are always our guideposts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are a nonprofit organization.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're located in Boston, Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have about 20 full-time staff located
across the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is very slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our main mode of operation is that we
create performance standards and standards
[SPEAKER_03]: for utilities in order to use for
incentives.
[SPEAKER_03]: We work with federal, local, and state
organizations in order to have test
[SPEAKER_03]: methods that can then inform qualified
product lists that help utilities provide
[SPEAKER_03]: incentives.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of our big outcomes is our qualified
products list.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have an emerging one for horticulture
lighting I'm going to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also have many tools and fact
sheets and information that we provide to
[SPEAKER_03]: utilities so that they understand what's
happening in the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, our goal is to accelerate
energy-efficient adoption.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now, that's mostly about LED
because it is the most efficacious light
[SPEAKER_03]: source that we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the one that promises the longest
life and the largest maintenance time.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things I want to tell you about
is that we very much are part of a
[SPEAKER_03]: rulemaking type of process.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not legislated or required to have
rulemaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: But every single time that we have a draft
of our technical specifications,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have a four- to six-week comment
period.
[SPEAKER_03]: We encourage you to provide your comments
to us in writing or by contacting us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we go through those comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: We work with our utility members to revise
a specification.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we put it out to a final draft.
[SPEAKER_03]: So please be involved in our rulemaking
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be a new draft for our
horticultural lighting specification in
[SPEAKER_03]: April.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the DLC is a member organization.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're supported by 74 member utilities
across the United States and Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a list of our utilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many of them in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, Lauren.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Seattle City Light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very appreciative.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is some new data I wanted to share
with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the things that we hope to do
with our horticultural lighting
[SPEAKER_03]: specification and our qualified products
list is show the relationship between the
[SPEAKER_03]: spec and the list and incentives.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is data from Bob Gunn from
Synergy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically it shows that out of the 122
top utilities in the United States,
[SPEAKER_03]: including DLC members, that about 40% of
them are either referencing the
[SPEAKER_03]: specification or are requiring the list.
[SPEAKER_03]: About another 50% don't use our list at
all, but we are seeing that change
[SPEAKER_03]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And about 10% of them don't have
horticultural lighting specification.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have horticultural lighting
rebates at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is something that we are keeping
track of and are hoping to see change in
[SPEAKER_03]: the next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why are utilities concerned about
rebates?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are they concerned about controlling
lighting?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because when you look at the power
demand, the electrical power demand that
[SPEAKER_03]: occurs in CEA, whether it's in greenhouses
for flour or veg or cannabis or indoor
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities, lighting is the dominant use
of electricity in these facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we can use more efficient lighting,
more efficacious lighting and still have
[SPEAKER_03]: the same light levels, the same DLI,
then we can really reduce our power
[SPEAKER_03]: demand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So regulators of course are concerned.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at the DOE report from 2017,
it predicts that horticultural lighting in
[SPEAKER_03]: CEA will grow by 15 to 25% year over year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is concerning to states that have
requirements for energy efficiency or
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon mitigation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they want to keep track of what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're seeing some variation in the
rollout of regulations across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Kay Doyle spoke about this
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we're seeing in the market is
either lighting power density limits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically this sets the top light level
for your light levels in your facility or
[SPEAKER_03]: a minimum requirement for efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is PPF per watt, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Light per watt.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Illinois, we see that Illinois allows
you to use the DLC QPL and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: automatically able to comply or you can
use an LPD requirement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Massachusetts is similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: They also have the ability for you to give
them data about products that aren't on
[SPEAKER_03]: the DLC QPL and they'll evaluate them for
quality control.
[SPEAKER_03]: California, we had a wonderful code
session yesterday is going through its
[SPEAKER_03]: rulemaking for CEA.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trending towards using efficacy
instead of lighting power density.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing it in building codes.
[SPEAKER_03]: City of Denver is an example that has a
brand new building code that's going to go
[SPEAKER_03]: into effect in April 1st that basically
says you have a PPE threshold or you can
[SPEAKER_03]: use the DLC QPL.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's different from lamps versus
fixtures and ICC, the International Energy
[SPEAKER_03]: Conservation Code, just passed through
voting a new mandatory requirement for CEA
[SPEAKER_03]: that will have a minimum efficacy for
these types of facilities along with a
[SPEAKER_03]: coverage area for that cultivation space.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the Wild West, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is early days in CEA and
horticultural lighting especially.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to bring some trusted
information to growers and utilities and
[SPEAKER_03]: code bodies and regulators with a QPL.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, we go through a rulemaking type
of process, public comment process where
[SPEAKER_03]: we're asking for information from lots of
stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, not only is the QPL about
efficacy but it's about high quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we mean by high quality is a life
in terms of par flux of 36,000 hours or
[SPEAKER_03]: longer, a life for drivers or fans of
50,000 hours or longer and a five-year
[SPEAKER_03]: warranty and a horticultural safety
certification.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't have all of that stuff,
you can't be on the QPL.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we work with DNR.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rose is one of the amazing reviewers for
our applications that looks at the
[SPEAKER_03]: horticultural lighting products.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are very appreciative of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we work together to make sure that only
high quality products are on the list.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, there's a value proposition for the
QPL for everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether you're a grower and you're looking
for trusted third party information,
[SPEAKER_03]: objective information, you can look at the
QPL to sort by efficacy or power demand or
[SPEAKER_03]: light or flux.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are a manufacturer, you can
differentiate yourself from other
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturers by having this trusted,
verified data.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's bad actors in every organization,
in every field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are seeing some of that in
horticultural lighting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really good that we're all sharing
the same type of information.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, for code bodies and
utilities, we're giving them trusted,
[SPEAKER_03]: verified information as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: The current specification that we've had
since October is version 1.2.
[SPEAKER_03]: The minimum performance spec for DLC is
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this case, our efficacy is 1.9
micromoles per joule.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a 5% lower tolerance so that
products can comply.
[SPEAKER_03]: But any product that's less than 1.9
micromoles per joule is not going to be on
[SPEAKER_03]: the QPL.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our standards, so when we have a technical
requirement, we are using IES standards
[SPEAKER_03]: and ASABI standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're, to some extent, limited by
those standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, liquid-cooled fixtures,
which we would like to see on the QPL,
[SPEAKER_03]: we don't have a standard from ASABI yet
that tells us how to test and measure
[SPEAKER_03]: those fixtures so that we know how to look
at that reporting.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're waiting for ASABI to complete that
process so that we can have liquid-cooled
[SPEAKER_03]: fixtures on the QPL.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see our technical requirements
below.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have almost 70 products on the QPL,
which is amazing considering that this has
[SPEAKER_03]: been live for less than a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the market actors, as I mentioned
before, is regulations from states.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a state compliance filter.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you click on the state compliance menu
on the left side, you can actually filter
[SPEAKER_03]: the list by either the Illinois
regulations or the Massachusetts
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, this is a screenshot from
last week.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had 68 products on Thursday.
[SPEAKER_03]: 52 of them would comply with the
Massachusetts regulations, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a very easy way to see what works.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to share some information about the
data with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the most current data against 68
products as of last week.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no relationship between efficacy
and light output.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want high light output products
that are, for example, equal to 1,000 watt
[SPEAKER_03]: HPS, you can find them on the QPL.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same or better efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want low light output products that
are very close to the crop that you would
[SPEAKER_03]: use, for example, in vertical farming,
you can find those products with high
[SPEAKER_03]: efficacy as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we easily can see one-for-one
replacements in all the categories for
[SPEAKER_03]: fixtures that are currently available.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, our average efficacy is 38%
higher than the most effective HPS
[SPEAKER_03]: double-ended product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're seeing a big jump in efficacy
from commercial products that are
[SPEAKER_03]: available now.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I said before, the efficacy is higher
than HPS.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it's 2.36 compared to 1.7,
but it's only increasing slowly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes we hear claims about efficacy
increasing rapidly.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of the products that we see on
the QPL, we're not seeing big improvements
[SPEAKER_03]: yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps we'll see them in a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, it's 24% higher than our
threshold of 1.9.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you filter the QPL for the state
regulations, for example, Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_03]: you will find that that regulation PPE is
16% higher than our threshold,
[SPEAKER_03]: 16% higher than 1.9.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what happens is there are about a
third of the products, a fourth of the
[SPEAKER_03]: products on our QPL that aren't compliant
with those regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you would essentially filter out the
products, which means for those
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturers, there's reason to improve
what they're offering.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that we used to see a
lot is sort of this blurple.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys heard of the term blurple or
pinkish light that you would see in
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the early LEDs only had blue and
red LEDs in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing that change.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing a lot of phosphor converted
white LEDs with red.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see among the mix, there's lots
of green content that is available among
[SPEAKER_03]: the fixtures.
[SPEAKER_03]: On average, the fixtures that we see on
the QPL have about a 35% green component
[SPEAKER_03]: and have about 3% far-red component.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's very few of those blurple
fixtures on the QPL.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no requirement that they have
phosphor converted white or white light,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's the way the market's trending.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're seeing that in the products that
are available.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my contact information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm Lauren.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an Emerging Technologies and Services
Manager at Efficiency Vermont.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I test new emerging technologies and
services, not just in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't work in the environment or ag
space, but in a lot of different spaces,
[SPEAKER_01]: I pilot those technologies in Vermont with
Vermont customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if those pilots go well,
then we implement those programs across
[SPEAKER_01]: the state at a much larger scale,
and in some cases, in other jurisdictions
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is more or less my agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go through why we're seeing current
market increases in Vermont and future
[SPEAKER_01]: market increases expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll talk a little bit about some
programs we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: As my colleagues mentioned, indoor grows,
greenhouses, and hemp are a really big
[SPEAKER_01]: reason for these increases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we definitely see all of those
applications in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where normally I'm presenting
to a group that's a little less interested
[SPEAKER_01]: in this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is where I say, let's get the
elephant out of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis legalization is becoming really
big.
[SPEAKER_01]: About a third of Americans are now living
under fully recreationalized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's an urbanization movement
happening as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, younger, more liberal folks are
moving from the Northeast across the US to
[SPEAKER_01]: get cheaper housing and better jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're seeing this phenomenon really
moving to move across the US into states
[SPEAKER_01]: like Illinois, as this mentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another big thing for Vermont was actually
the farm bill in 2018 through the USDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw a bunch of hemp come into the state
since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, Vermont's in a very unique
scenario where this is not a ballot
[SPEAKER_01]: initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a legislature initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the legislature has kicked around the
idea of doing commercial legalization with
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries and commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: For about five years in a row,
and they've never been able to pass it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually debating it right now in
the state house at this very moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it may pass this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'll see those commercial size
grows come online.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's been a really interesting market
to study because with the absence of that
[SPEAKER_01]: large cannabis grow, we're still seeing a
lot of CEA pop up in a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been really interesting to watch
this kind of fragmented market still move
[SPEAKER_01]: into the CEA space even without that main
cash crop driver.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some folks got into this earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, I use this case study to
describe to people that we really need to
[SPEAKER_01]: scale up our food production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmers need to harvest in the next four
decades the same amount of food as the
[SPEAKER_01]: last 8,000 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that we will be increasing our
greenhouse size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greenhouses are growing at about 20% year
over year across the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in about 10% in lit area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would venture to guess that in
Vermont it might even be faster than this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is Westland.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was another slide on it earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is just showing the scale at
which we might need to ramp up in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep this food production going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Vermont, we also have a big farm to
table movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: People love out of season produce and
greens in the middle of the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're seeing a lot of folks use local
greens.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a case study from Peru,
Vermont, in southern Vermont.
[SPEAKER_01]: This woman grows micro greens and
ornamental flowers in her basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see a lot of these small medium
businesses popping up in addition to a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of the large cannabis grows that you all
have been talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this woman sells her micro greens to a
local restaurant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's won a bunch of awards for using local
sustainable products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's very common in our state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is actually an upstate New York
customer right over the border.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also see a lot of dairy farmers
moving to hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Historically, they've had really low
margins or even negative margins in recent
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving to hemp is actually a really
great option for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if they don't make it, they might
make more money than they did in dairy,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a highly subsidized industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dairy farmers at the most maybe make 3%
margin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these margins on hemp are much lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much, much better if they do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is they have a lot of
land.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a really scarcely populated state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of these farmers have hundreds of
acres of land.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have growing experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have facilities that they haven't
used for a while, like barns that they can
[SPEAKER_01]: dry the hemp in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see a lot of them transitioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also climate resilience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the droughts in California,
the fires in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: The deep freeze in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a picture of some new Americans
going back to their plots after we had
[SPEAKER_01]: Hurricane Irene a couple years ago that
flooded most of the state of Vermont.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hear from these customers all the
time, I can't predict the winters like I
[SPEAKER_01]: used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't follow the almanac anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get random frosts in the middle of May
that I never had to worry about before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're actively looking into spending
more energy in these greenhouses or
[SPEAKER_01]: usually greenhouses in order to maintain
their crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't afford to lose a crop in the
middle of May due to a random frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they never really had that issue
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hearing more about people trying
to be resilient with their grows and
[SPEAKER_01]: really have backup systems so that they
can keep growing regardless of what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: John touched on this a little bit as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the utility space, we have been
addicted to screw-based lighting for a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been an easy market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has given us a lot of great savings per
unit, large volumes at a residential and
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that that's over and baselines are
creeping on that, we need to find a new
[SPEAKER_01]: area to get savings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this indoor ag market is a really
great one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also see that we're serving a lot of
markets that we normally wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: touched.
[SPEAKER_01]: People like low-income customers and
renters are some of the biggest home
[SPEAKER_01]: growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And home grow is legal in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do see a lot of small-scale
residential stuff happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really nice to be able to get
your foot in the door with a renter who
[SPEAKER_01]: can't really do anything other than
screw-based lighting in their space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's nice to be able to connect with
them and perhaps create more relationships
[SPEAKER_01]: for future state.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned, we have creeping
baselines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as codes get more and more efficient,
we're required to meet those codes and
[SPEAKER_01]: give incentives on things above code.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is getting harder and harder for
us as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this last one is really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But utilities are moving from reducing
energy to being really creative about when
[SPEAKER_01]: we use energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's often about overall grid health
now and carbon in comparison to reduction
[SPEAKER_01]: of overall use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're doing a lot of pilots around
flexible load management, carbon impacts,
[SPEAKER_01]: things like natural refrigerants that have
really intense carbon applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for our distribution utility partners,
the people who supply the power because
[SPEAKER_01]: we're responsible for saving the power as
an efficiency utility, they really care
[SPEAKER_01]: about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want sustainable load growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want people to be using energy
during off-peak times because that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: cleanest form of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the Northeast, we have a really,
really clean grid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's getting cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Vermont, we actually buy a lot of power
from Hydro-Québec.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is completely renewable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we see dirtier fuels come onto
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the distribution utilities are
required to buy things like coal when
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really trying to avoid those
peaks and be creative with these customers
[SPEAKER_01]: to understand how we keep them off-peak as
they're growing with 1,000-watt lights
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every couple feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'll talk about some programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the first residential indoor
prescriptive program in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: We developed it alongside Burlington
Electric.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's available for all Vermonters for
residential grow operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be any type of plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what our website looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's $100 off an LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it needs to meet the DLC standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's $100 off an LED grow light.
And it needs to meet the DLC
specifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were also finding that we were
basically selling out of dehumidifiers in
[SPEAKER_01]: the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're also really pushing the
dehumidifier rebates on Energy Star
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidifiers because we know that people
are using those for grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what our rebate form looks
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll probably make it a lot more
streamlined in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we needed to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we offer $100.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get minimal information back from the
customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like, what wattage were you
replacing this with?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many grow cycles per year do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have cooling in your grow space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do you use a window air conditioner?
[SPEAKER_01]: And our savings are related to those
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting this information so that we
can hone our savings more and create
[SPEAKER_01]: better solutions for customers in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice what we don't ask is,
what are you growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't necessarily want that information
in our books of what they're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really open to any type of
residential grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our savings calculations on what
we assumed for lighting and cooling
[SPEAKER_01]: savings in the residential space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these are the assumptions of what
we did for baseline versus new wattages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything on the right is products
that are on our QPL and actual wattages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the left, you can see what we kind
of assumed they were replacing in those
[SPEAKER_01]: scenarios.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that we'll look back at
once we get more data from customers using
[SPEAKER_01]: the rebate program to see, are we correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they actually replacing a 600-watt
light with a 345?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I am super excited to announce
that we just came up with a guide for a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse customers, along with an
initiative for rebates around greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, they're all custom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, what we'll be doing is we'll be
working with each greenhouse customer to
[SPEAKER_01]: model their space to understand the
interactive effects of lighting and HVAC
[SPEAKER_01]: and pumps and watering and everything
that's in that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have rebates for thermal curtains,
coverings like double polyethylene,
[SPEAKER_01]: heating systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both the system itself and if you're using
an efficient distribution system like
[SPEAKER_01]: radiant flooring, LED grow lights,
greenhouse controls, ventilation,
[SPEAKER_01]: motors, and VFDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will probably end up making some of
these prescriptive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my original goal with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really hard to make these things
prescriptive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started to go into these greenhouse
customers, and they all had different
[SPEAKER_01]: square footage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different heating systems, different
plans.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were growing different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really impossible at this stage
to create a prescriptive rebate program.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's absolutely something that we're
interested in doing for this group.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see thermal curtains.
[SPEAKER_01]: VFDs is more or less already prescriptive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then LED grow lights as future
prescriptive offerings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other things that we'll be doing is
looking into cryogenic freezers that
[SPEAKER_01]: happen in processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether we can do one for one
replacements with those, as well as drying
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of people who are drying
hemp themselves on their farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they use a lot of propane and oil and
electricity to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just a case study that I'm going
to go past.
[SPEAKER_01]: But thank you.
