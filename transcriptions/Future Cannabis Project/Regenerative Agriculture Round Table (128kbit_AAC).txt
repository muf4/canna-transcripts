[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, everyone, for being here and
Meadowlands for giving us this opportunity
[SPEAKER_07]: to talk about regenerative cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have, not sitting in order,
Jessie, who created the regenerative
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis farm award with Dan Marr over
here, as well as Jacob and Carla from
[SPEAKER_07]: Flower Days Farm in Trinity County.
[SPEAKER_07]: Forrest and Patricia from Sunroots Farm in
Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Josh from Moon Gazer Farm in Mendocino
County.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, all of these amazing farmers can tell
you guys all about regenerative farming.
[SPEAKER_07]: But before we start that, I just want to
let everyone know that the reason I'm here
[SPEAKER_07]: is because I spent years trying to find
the dankest weed that I could smoke,
[SPEAKER_07]: and that search led me to these farmers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And their weed really is the dankest.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when I found out that they grow in a
way that is actually good for the soil and
[SPEAKER_07]: their watersheds and the bees and the
whole ecosystem, I was amazed and inspired
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's basically the only thing giving
me hope for the future right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: But even if I didn't care about the
environment or my carbon footprint or the
[SPEAKER_07]: survival of humanity, I would still want
to smoke their weed because the flavors
[SPEAKER_07]: and the effects are of a spectacular
quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: And from my point of view as a pot snob
who cares a lot about quality,
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe that the key to that spectacular
dankness is in the relationships between
[SPEAKER_07]: the farmer and the plant and the soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's the key.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Jesse should tell us about the
regenerative cannabis farm award and how
[SPEAKER_07]: it recognizes those connections.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you have one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, traditionally in like cannabis cups,
we're celebrating the flowers.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're really excited about what's the
dankest.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that the dankest practices lead to
the dankest flowers that it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a relationship with the soil,
with the land, with community,
[SPEAKER_11]: the art that you put into the flower,
biodiversity, healthy environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: That comes forth.
[SPEAKER_11]: That makes the flower art.
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes it something that you want to
ingest.
[SPEAKER_11]: But how do we talk about that?
[SPEAKER_11]: And so with the Emerald Cup and the
Cultivation Classic, we created this award
[SPEAKER_11]: called the regenerative cannabis farm
award that recognizes these practices.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we created an application process
where we can have farms tell us about
[SPEAKER_11]: them, hear their story.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a lot of different specific things
that we ask about so we can know about
[SPEAKER_11]: watershed.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can know about soil practices,
closed loop systems, community work.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we get to set up site visits and
go and meet them.
[SPEAKER_11]: And recently, this last year, we've been
doing documentaries with Claire of La Oso
[SPEAKER_11]: Films who's filming right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And man, they've been coming out so
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: They connect the audience with the
practices because you can see the animals,
[SPEAKER_11]: you can see the soil, you can see the
connection with the land.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like, that's the cannabis I want
to smoke that's growing from this
[SPEAKER_11]: beautiful soil in polyculture.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's been this amazing journey the last
few years.
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the coolest parts is you get to
meet really amazing friends along the way
[SPEAKER_11]: and you get to learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you get to feature the best
farms.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then now this conversation is out
there about the practices.
[SPEAKER_11]: How is cannabis grown?
[SPEAKER_11]: How can we do it better for our
environment?
[SPEAKER_11]: How can we do it better for our
watersheds?
[SPEAKER_11]: And our communities and also grow the best
cannabis and reduce our costs at the same
[SPEAKER_11]: time and come together as a community of
sharing information.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have some amazing farmers here that
represent the last two years.
[SPEAKER_11]: Three years.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, sorry, three years.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: The original here too.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm representing MoonGazer here too.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the very first year, all three years
are represented.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: The very first year we had Dragonfly Earth
Medicine, Green Source Gardens and
[SPEAKER_11]: MoonGazer Farms.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's been amazing to see how having
them come up on stage, take that award,
[SPEAKER_11]: having people connect with that and seeing
the journey that's come from there and the
[SPEAKER_11]: information.
[SPEAKER_11]: Josh and Sandra have been doing amazing
work consistently building their land.
[SPEAKER_11]: Every year there's improvement.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's more closed loop systems.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so much food and polyculture.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now there's twins too.
[SPEAKER_11]: Little baby boy twins.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, it's an amazing place of life
and amazing cannabis and genetics.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a place of art.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really appreciate how much that
you've taken on connecting with the
[SPEAKER_11]: community, being at events like this to
continue talking about these practices.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like we all have these abilities
to do these things.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can build soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can build polyculture.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can grow better cannabis as we do
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the more we talk about it,
the more we empower each other,
[SPEAKER_11]: the more we show each other practices.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's not like one way to do something
the best.
[SPEAKER_11]: Each different environment, each different
community, you find what works for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a collaborative effort.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, let's hear a little bit about
what's going on on your farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Josh from MoonGazer Farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, it's been a wild journey
since 2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we had just actually landed at
this property.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had just started building our
hugelkultur beds then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just seeing how much life is coming
through in these beds and all the worms
[SPEAKER_03]: and activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we have just, you know,
the worms are now just kind of going even
[SPEAKER_03]: into like the forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're helping even just break down
like things in the woods, like even faster
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you create a sanctuary on your
land that is a haven for life and bees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're able to do that as small
cannabis farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we are able to do it, then why
shouldn't we do it is kind of how I feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a cannabis consumer myself,
[SPEAKER_03]: I prefer, why wouldn't I prefer to have,
well, I prefer to have something that's
[SPEAKER_03]: grown in the soil, in the full sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, sun-grown in general is better
than even indoor, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for me personally, I would like to see
it in the full sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where we talk about full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're talking about the highest quality
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it to be planted in the spring and
I want it to be harvested in the fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have, and it's going through the
entire cycles of nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and when we're talking about
like the moon cycles and the cosmic
[SPEAKER_03]: cycles, this is part of just the natural
rhythm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now it's spring, everything's green
outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, so that's kind of how we're
approaching it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just blessed that we're able to
grow from seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have the pressure of having to do
a lot of, you know, I understand people
[SPEAKER_03]: have to grow from clones that come from
who knows where.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you need to have a consistent product
for the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, we've been able to figure it
out to be able to grow from seed,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, continue to breed on our land,
continue to create strong genetics that
[SPEAKER_03]: are meant for our land.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course bring in, you have to bring
in genetics too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes from people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's nice to have this regenerative
network of people because you don't,
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't want to, I don't want to like to
inbreed too much too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what's beautiful about this
connection that we have with other farmers
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff too, that we're able to,
I got some velvet goo actually growing
[SPEAKER_03]: right now from sun roots that I'm pretty
stoked about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some cherry lime dog from Jesse that's
going real strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to get some of that rose lemonade
from you guys too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so that's kind of where I stand
and it's so beautiful to have this,
[SPEAKER_03]: just the support of the regenerative
movement so that we can really grow in
[SPEAKER_03]: the, in my opinion, like the most ideal
fashion possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: We still don't make a hundred percent all
of our own potting soil, but we're working
[SPEAKER_03]: towards that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you guys could talk about it a bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I just want to mention that I've
spent a lot of time in Moongazer's hugels
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's really, if you've been to a pot
farm, you really have not experienced
[SPEAKER_07]: anything like what it feels like to walk
around Moongazer's garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even from, you guys have been building up
your soil over the years and it just keeps
[SPEAKER_07]: getting better and better.
[SPEAKER_07]: But even from the first year, even when
you were still building them, there
[SPEAKER_07]: already was just bursting with this like
vibrant energetic life force that like
[SPEAKER_07]: just feels so different than what you
would normally think of as a farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: And watching it grow is really awesome and
watching it just like keep exponentially
[SPEAKER_07]: amplifying and building on itself and
watching the goat herd keep getting bigger
[SPEAKER_07]: is really a delight.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Josh and his wife Sandra, who's not
here, have been super awesome about
[SPEAKER_07]: inviting people to come and see what
they're doing and like feel that feeling
[SPEAKER_07]: and then take that home with them to their
farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's been really beautiful
what you've been doing to build community
[SPEAKER_07]: and like holding up that example for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was hoping that some, that actually
no flower days, that flower days would
[SPEAKER_07]: talk to us about their farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: And specifically what I think is really,
having also gotten to visit your farm,
[SPEAKER_07]: what really stands out is how you guys are
very dedicated to keeping things small
[SPEAKER_07]: because you're very focused on these
little details that might get lost
[SPEAKER_07]: otherwise.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it like, the way that you're
approaching it from this boutique
[SPEAKER_07]: standpoint, I was hoping you could tell us
about that and how that translates for
[SPEAKER_07]: you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, part of our effort to stay small is
also the limitations of the land we work
[SPEAKER_10]: with.
[SPEAKER_10]: So a goal on our farm is to try and
explore how we can cycle nutrients through
[SPEAKER_10]: the land.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we are keeping animals and the land
is also feeding them.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's also growing food to feed us.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so through that we're able to generate
enough fertility for what we're working
[SPEAKER_10]: on.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's a really special thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, since in 1925, farmers were
recognizing that soil and nutritional
[SPEAKER_10]: quality of food and medicine were
deteriorating.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so this has been a problem for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so since 1925, it's degraded even
further.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so what we need to do is recreate
natural cycles of animals consuming the
[SPEAKER_10]: coarse fibers that grow on the land,
not imported foods, and recirculating that
[SPEAKER_10]: through our farms so that we can rebuild
this high nutritional quality.
[SPEAKER_10]: And really that nutritional quality is
what's gonna give you the quality that
[SPEAKER_10]: you're gonna enjoy and taste in your food
and in your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I mean, that's something for all
agriculture to start striving for.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't really have time to start doing
anything else and keep getting this
[SPEAKER_10]: fertilizer from Indonesia and this thing
from there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And these cow bones are from industrial
slaughterhouses, but we call it organic.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not progress, you know?
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we're talking about climate change
and we have these goals that we're trying
[SPEAKER_10]: to meet.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so what is the answer to that?
[SPEAKER_10]: So for me, I took that really personally.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was living in the city and I felt like,
dude, my life is, this is not,
[SPEAKER_10]: this is not a solution that I'm being a
part of, participating in this huge
[SPEAKER_10]: consumptive society.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so how do we figure out how to fix
that?
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we went on a quest for that and
we've discovered that the cannabis we were
[SPEAKER_10]: producing was really high quality.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so it's our goal to produce cannabis
that goes out and inspires people to keep,
[SPEAKER_10]: to maybe make a change in their life.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that's kind of where we're coming
from with staying really small batch on
[SPEAKER_10]: our land.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we hope that as we build our
fertility, the batches will grow,
[SPEAKER_10]: but we are, we put ourselves in a box so
that we could try to think outside of the
[SPEAKER_10]: box.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think in a lot of ways we just
really made a lot of changes in our lives
[SPEAKER_05]: because of our, initially because of our
personal health and cannabis is very
[SPEAKER_05]: integral to our own healing and our both
physical and metaphysical and spiritual
[SPEAKER_05]: healing, I would say.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in our kind of quest to discover what
living a sustainable life really means in
[SPEAKER_05]: today's world and how, how we could
actually be part of the solution.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, through cannabis, the plant led us to,
to Trinity County and to this homesteading
[SPEAKER_05]: community in Hyampong, which is kind of
outside of Hayfork.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you get to Hayfork and then you stop to
go like 45 more minutes down to Lundy road
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's on the South fork of the Trinity
river.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's this just epic little Valley.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of beautiful,
epic little nooks out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's the mountains are steep around us
and it's like canvas just loves to grow
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have long outdoor growing season and we
can grow all our stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Josh is talking about doing it
through the whole full season and the
[SPEAKER_05]: cycle of nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once you start really integrating
yourself into nature, you start seeing
[SPEAKER_05]: like, like Caitlin's Caitlin's talking
about how lovely it is to see the goat
[SPEAKER_05]: herd and life exploding everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's spring time and you're really
witnessed that right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you start to see that you realize
that, okay, well, we know that it makes
[SPEAKER_05]: our food better.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know it makes our canvas better.
[SPEAKER_05]: We see in the science that everything
nutritionally, all of the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_05]: the whole profile, everything we're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't matter if you're talking about
food or, or cannabis, you, you see
[SPEAKER_05]: everything testing higher, better,
just more nuance coming out in the flavor,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially, but in the nutrition,
in the quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so for us being small batch,
we're a three acre property and we
[SPEAKER_05]: initially bought a place that needed some
work, but from a permaculture perspective,
[SPEAKER_05]: as far as a property that you could really
work on the soil, work on the design of
[SPEAKER_05]: the land as a whole and figure out how to
turn the farm into a real integrated
[SPEAKER_05]: living organism.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you can let the biological systems
really thrive and build the systems that
[SPEAKER_05]: provide sanctuary, then suddenly you see
that life is exploding and that you don't
[SPEAKER_05]: have to deal with the problems because
they're being dealt with already.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you don't have to spray for a pest or
you don't see a pest infestation because
[SPEAKER_05]: you have an actually complete ecosystem
that is dealing with itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have health and you have health in a,
in another way because you have this joy
[SPEAKER_05]: and you see, you start to see life really
working in a progressive way where it's
[SPEAKER_05]: actually getting better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Things are getting better and it happens
quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remediation happens quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Regeneration happens really quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cells rebuild themselves really quickly in
the human body.
[SPEAKER_05]: The human gut becomes healthy really
quickly, but you have to do the things to
[SPEAKER_05]: make the right environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you see the results in the
quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for us, it's about the art and it's
about the plant and that's never going to
[SPEAKER_05]: change.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we can only put so much energy in
and on three acres, you can do what you
[SPEAKER_05]: can do on three acres, but we're not
planting three acres of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We live on that three acres.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our animals live from that three acres and
we grow all our food on that three acres.
[SPEAKER_05]: We grow all our animals food on that three
acres.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we, we have things we source
sometimes locally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the other really integral part
of it is that it's a larger ecosystem that
[SPEAKER_05]: you're a part of.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're one part, you're a living
biological system, your farm is,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then it's part of another localized
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need to work in our localized
communities for resources because they're
[SPEAKER_05]: abundant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we use our surpluses that we have
on a small scale to supply each other,
[SPEAKER_05]: like hay fork needs to grow a lot more hay
because we need a lot more local,
[SPEAKER_05]: organic, strong, raw mulch.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually frustrating to try and
source things sometimes, which is why we
[SPEAKER_05]: went to the point of realizing like we
need to be self-reliant enough to not have
[SPEAKER_05]: to import anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's what we're striving for
ultimately.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what that does for the quality too,
is it builds your terroir.
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually makes your specific
characteristics of your soil and your land
[SPEAKER_05]: and the place where you live come out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a story behind each place and
you know, we really understand that to a
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty sophisticated level in wine.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as cannabis, we still have a
lot of education and people need to
[SPEAKER_05]: actually experience it to know it and
understand it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's part of what terroir means.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, the place and the
characteristics of that place that give
[SPEAKER_05]: the product that's being cultivated there,
whether it be wine or cheese, or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were just talking earlier about
Appalachians for chamomile.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's an amazing terpene in
chamomile, which we found in some of our
[SPEAKER_05]: strains were really prevalent and it's
part of what makes it calming.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's part of why it makes the high so
amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's so much nuance to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the art behind it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why it's so fun to be a farmer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we really need more of actually
is scientists to come out to the farm and
[SPEAKER_05]: help us continue to collect data because
it's a lot to manage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something we could really,
you know, use some collaboration with
[SPEAKER_05]: people doing that kind of work.
[SPEAKER_11]: Suggestion, I just got a weather station.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not that expensive and it
constantly just updates data.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's just a great tool to be able to
put right in your garden, your cultivation
[SPEAKER_11]: location and get the radiation,
the temperature, the humidity.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can get them with soil probes to get
temperature.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can set up game cams and really pay
attention to everything and the rhythms of
[SPEAKER_11]: the plants with the environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's cool just to have it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can look on your phone at any time and
see it updated.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: So those closed loops, looking at the farm
as a whole, we had a really good example
[SPEAKER_11]: this trip up to Oregon and our winners
this year, Lane Creek Hemp.
[SPEAKER_11]: They do full hugelkultures.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have animals on site, lots of
different like llamas and sheep and goats
[SPEAKER_11]: and pigs.
[SPEAKER_11]: They grow about 27 acres, I think,
of straw that's feed for the animals.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so they've actually fully closed that
loop.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's kind of interesting just like
looking at this land and seeing the way
[SPEAKER_11]: water moves and energy moves.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the way they've done small things that
are gonna lead to really big, thriving
[SPEAKER_11]: changes.
[SPEAKER_11]: And just with how energy flows,
how water flows, and putting the things in
[SPEAKER_11]: the right place for a system to build
itself.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then building diverse polyculture,
both in the soil diversity and in the
[SPEAKER_11]: plants that you're growing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you're doing that, you're
bringing up all this ability to process
[SPEAKER_11]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you have a diverse biology in the
soil, it's able to eat whatever is there
[SPEAKER_11]: and make it available for the plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then all these different plants are
able to bring all these different minerals
[SPEAKER_11]: and nutrition up and they bring it to the
surface.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then that's mulching back in and it's
just constantly building soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you're part of that process,
you're part of sequestering carbon to
[SPEAKER_11]: create something that leads to nutrition.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a system that just thrives and
thrives and thrives.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're able to make an economic
product at the same time.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something that has value that people
get jobs based off of that feed family.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're literally improving the
environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: How amazing is that?
[SPEAKER_11]: There's very little thing, few things in
the world of business that actually don't
[SPEAKER_11]: have dramatic negative effects on the
environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: And regenerative agriculture is one of
those things that do.
[SPEAKER_11]: And most of agriculture is horribly
destructive.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so the more we support small farmers
that build soil, that build polyculture,
[SPEAKER_11]: that reach out to community, that provide
really good products, that's what we need
[SPEAKER_11]: to do as a society.
[SPEAKER_11]: So support these farmers up here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for coming to things like this
and believing in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just gonna say real quick that in
the regenerative cannabis calendar I just
[SPEAKER_03]: saw for this month, the stropharia post,
there was a lot of info about it that I
[SPEAKER_03]: hadn't known about how it benefits the
bees even.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with those king stropharia mushroom,
you're benefiting the bees, you're growing
[SPEAKER_03]: food, you're sequestering carbon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a fine tenet of regenerative
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he's referring to wood-eating
mushrooms.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we're gonna hear it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Once Jesse starts talking about closing
loops, it's hard to... Well, I think
[SPEAKER_07]: everything that we're saying about systems
and all these things integrating really
[SPEAKER_07]: speaks to what for me is the real
differentiator between these farmers and
[SPEAKER_07]: most farmers is this attitude of instead
of you're the master farmer and you're
[SPEAKER_07]: looking down at your farm and everything
is your responsibility and if there's a
[SPEAKER_07]: pest problem, you have to solve it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's seeing there's this incredibly
powerful, larger force and it's working
[SPEAKER_07]: within that and creating the environment
that's necessary to let these forces do
[SPEAKER_07]: what they need to do is just a much more
powerful and effective approach,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what really makes all of the,
whether it's cannabis or produce,
[SPEAKER_07]: stand out when it comes out of these kinds
of gardens.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think Sunroots should tell us about
how they do that to make especially really
[SPEAKER_07]: beautiful, enormous, crazy-colored,
cool-looking plants in particular,
[SPEAKER_07]: but also just really nutritious and good
for the soil and all that stuff too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are all amazing and everyone here
for being here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much for taking the time to
care.
[SPEAKER_06]: It matters.
[SPEAKER_06]: It matters to care.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything that we do makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Patricia and speaking on kind of what
you were saying, Caitlin, about not
[SPEAKER_06]: looking down on your farm as if you're the
master gardener because there's no
[SPEAKER_06]: hierarchy in the garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: There is something I always want to speak
on when we talk about regenerative
[SPEAKER_06]: agriculture is that, yeah, letting go of
control in the garden and letting go of
[SPEAKER_06]: control in a way that helps you to open
your eyes and your perspective to what you
[SPEAKER_06]: may not see when you have all these ideas
and all these structures in front of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you let go in the garden,
you're listening more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's my biggest thing on
regeneration is that we're here not as
[SPEAKER_06]: controllers, but as servants to this earth
really, I see myself as this like,
[SPEAKER_06]: okay, mama earth, I will do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will continue working hard and for my
community and for everything that I stand
[SPEAKER_06]: for, it's not easy work.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's intensive, labor intensive,
mentally, physically, spiritually,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're in it all the time and it's a
commitment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're humans, so it's wonderful to
make mistakes because we learn and grow
[SPEAKER_06]: from them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, regeneration in the garden again
and just in our lives, that we're all need
[SPEAKER_06]: to do our part and empower each other and
support these kinds of small farms and
[SPEAKER_06]: support the lifestyle of helping one
another out because not only are we
[SPEAKER_06]: regenerating our land and working our
soils and building and building every part
[SPEAKER_06]: of the year, we're building up soil
because the work is not really ever done.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you continue doing things and as you
build up in that, you build up in other
[SPEAKER_06]: parts of yourself where you can be better
for the world and be better for the
[SPEAKER_06]: environment because right now we need all
these earth stewards to come forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you're all powerful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Each one of us has so much power to really
make a difference in this world.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, we're all these little small
farmers in these mountain areas way out
[SPEAKER_06]: there, but wherever you are, you make a
difference.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with your little gardens, plant what
you can and even if it's in a container in
[SPEAKER_06]: a patio in the city, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do our part.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll let Forrest talk about big plants
because this man is like, I always praise
[SPEAKER_06]: him up, but just, yeah, I walked into his
farm five years ago and it's changed a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: since then.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a lot more flowers and everything
is building and building.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're basically building compost piles for
every single plot of land.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have 10 by 10s where we just keep
adding the manure, adding the straw,
[SPEAKER_06]: adding mushroom, mycelium, wood chips,
adding plants, chop and drop.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is definitely a big creation of the
larger plants and also the genetics that
[SPEAKER_06]: we're working with our local.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll let Forrest get into it more,
but thank you all for listening.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so diversity is one of our main things
that we try to focus on having as many
[SPEAKER_08]: types of plants and as we can around the
ganja and giving space and the vision to
[SPEAKER_08]: seeing how, you know, if you're going to
grow a big plant, you need to like
[SPEAKER_08]: envision at the end, you know,
giving it enough space so it has that
[SPEAKER_08]: potential to get to where you want it to
go and just keep building the soil up
[SPEAKER_08]: layer by layer and having those natural,
you know, systems to help you on the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe get some context for when you say
big plants, what that means in case people
[SPEAKER_07]: haven't seen your plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year, the largest one was like 20
pounds.
[SPEAKER_08]: 16 feet.
[SPEAKER_08]: 20 pounds dried.
[SPEAKER_08]: Normally I call it bullshit, but I saw
these plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's insane, dude.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_08]: That one was grown on like a compost pile
of old weed, like stems and stalks,
[SPEAKER_08]: but like the majority of them were 10
plus, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are all strains that I've been
breeding myself, you know, on the farm for
[SPEAKER_08]: years, so.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not 20 feet high.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not quite that big.
[SPEAKER_08]: How wide?
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably like 12 feet wide by,
you know, 13, 14 feet tall, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: 16 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you go to regenerativecannabisfarming
.org, there's videos that you can link to
[SPEAKER_11]: that you walk through these monster
plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about how many bud sets, the density
of the colas, and how happy they are,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, if you're giving them the right
nutrients and an adequate amount of water,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have drip systems that go, you know,
once around the base and then around,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, the big part of, you know,
the mass amount of the soil that we have,
[SPEAKER_08]: and so like they pull out water when they
need it and, you know, have as much
[SPEAKER_08]: nutrients as they need also, so available.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, throughout their course of
growing, all I have to do is go out there
[SPEAKER_08]: with a hose and like do a hand water to
like feed them extra food, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have to add anything else.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything else, everything that they need
is in the soil already, so.
[SPEAKER_11]: Will you walk us through the soil building
and composting process?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's like a yearly process,
like in the fall, we prep the beds,
[SPEAKER_08]: by laying more straw and covering any bare
spots, and then we throw out cover crops,
[SPEAKER_08]: too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, during the winter,
there's cover crops that are growing,
[SPEAKER_08]: and then in the springtime, you know,
we cut the cover crops and add,
[SPEAKER_08]: bring in more manure locally sourced,
and our own, you know, we have alpacas,
[SPEAKER_08]: so they're really good, adding nutrients.
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a high phosphorus, so.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's phosphorus, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in Covalo, California, Mendocino,
so two hours inland from here,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I just want to say about the alpacas,
that they are amazing because they have
[SPEAKER_06]: communal dung piles, and they are really
hygienic, and they are light on the earth.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't eat as much, they don't drink
as much, and they're less harmful in ways
[SPEAKER_06]: that livestock can be, so that's one of
our, you, we don't milk them, just the
[SPEAKER_06]: little creas, the baby alpacas,
we let them have all the milk,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I think you can, though.
[SPEAKER_06]: The camel lid milk is apparently very
delicious, but we haven't tried it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, in the springtime, then we bring,
we pretty much make a pile of manure,
[SPEAKER_08]: right, in each plot where we're gonna put
one plant, so each plant gets a pile of
[SPEAKER_08]: manure.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, what was I gonna say?
[SPEAKER_08]: No till, so if anything, we have these
meadow forks, meadow creatures,
[SPEAKER_08]: they're great broad forks, so if you want
to loosen up your soil, you have those to
[SPEAKER_08]: do a little bit of mixing if you need to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Other than that, you know, that's pretty
much it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just pruning the plant up like three or
four times during the grow cycle,
[SPEAKER_08]: caging them really well, because we have
lots of strong wind, and they'll blow your
[SPEAKER_08]: plants right down if you don't have them
fence post in.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have T-posts on each corner,
and then a cage going up two feet high off
[SPEAKER_08]: the ground, so we can actually support the
plant well, and then we'll have to do the
[SPEAKER_08]: third cage at the end, right before
they're done in August, September,
[SPEAKER_08]: we're third caging it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it's a big process, but it's totally
worth, oh yeah, we start our seeds in
[SPEAKER_08]: February, second week in February,
second, third week in February.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, having that whole process of from
springtime all the way till fall,
[SPEAKER_08]: so these plants are sucking in all this
energy from the cosmos and the ground,
[SPEAKER_08]: all that nutrients, and just making a real
medicine for the people, and that's what
[SPEAKER_08]: it's about.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all growing medicine, and that's the
most important thing, keeping the cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: sacred.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that's how we feel.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was hoping that we could maybe get a
little bit more into kind of explaining
[SPEAKER_07]: what's going on in the soil that you guys
are creating, because for me, as I was
[SPEAKER_07]: like visiting farms like these guys,
and really starting to understand what
[SPEAKER_07]: makes them so special, that was like a big
light bulb moment for me, was like,
[SPEAKER_07]: oh, living soil, that's really what it
comes to.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like no-till, living soil,
going to a farm and having Jesse say,
[SPEAKER_07]: look at this soil, look at my soil,
look at these worms, look at these
[SPEAKER_07]: spiders, and he's like, oh my god,
my worms are amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I think we can talk about how you
build your soil, and that's really
[SPEAKER_07]: valuable information for people that are
gonna do it, but just for anyone that's
[SPEAKER_07]: gonna consume cannabis or buy cannabis or
sell it, what makes living soil different
[SPEAKER_07]: than a bagged soil with maybe,
you can put nutrients in it, but what
[SPEAKER_07]: makes that no-till living soil special and
different than dirt?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's connected to everything, and it has
an infinite potential of life energy.
[SPEAKER_11]: As far as building it, there's no this is
a way to build soil or make some super
[SPEAKER_11]: soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's working with your environment and
what makes sense.
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly cover cropping and mulching,
working with animals and building
[SPEAKER_11]: biodynamic compost and integrating that
back in, hugelkultures, burying wood,
[SPEAKER_11]: creating dynamic spaces with organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's tons of different types of foods
for very diverse microbes and continually
[SPEAKER_11]: building on that diversity and adding more
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_11]: As you do that, you just draw more and
more life.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not just about, we're talking about
the bacteria and the fungi, but when
[SPEAKER_11]: you're seeing a lot of the larger bugs,
the centipedes and little soil mites and
[SPEAKER_11]: all kinds of fun things, worms and
spiders, there's all this nutrient cycling
[SPEAKER_11]: that's happening.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just think about how much energy is
happening to constantly have these more
[SPEAKER_11]: and more critters that are moving around
eating and pooping, and they're just
[SPEAKER_11]: building more and more soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all just doing their own thing,
feeding themselves, but they're all
[SPEAKER_11]: improving everything as they do their
thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: They all have their specialized way.
[SPEAKER_11]: I kind of see that as part of this
regenerative movement is paying attention
[SPEAKER_11]: to all those bugs are building soil and
they're doing their own thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: How we can all connect like that and put
carbon in the ground and build living soil
[SPEAKER_11]: and grow good things out of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: The same with mutualistic relationships of
any kind with plants, with soil biology.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cannabis is a mutualistic organism.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how it evolves.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very smart, so it knows how to give
other organisms what it wants.
[SPEAKER_11]: The main process that's happening on the
root is this exudate exchange where the
[SPEAKER_11]: roots of the plant, they have all of this
energy from the sun that they can turn
[SPEAKER_11]: into carbohydrates and they can feed
different bacteria in the soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: They can feed different fungi.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those fungi have the enzymes that can then
break down other minerals in the soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: The plant can uptake that and it becomes
this cycle where the soil biology thrives,
[SPEAKER_11]: the plant thrives, all the energy is
coming from the sun, the carbon gets
[SPEAKER_11]: stored in the ground, and it's a system
that continually builds and builds and
[SPEAKER_11]: builds and what's left behind is soil.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those are the processes to mimic and
that's what plants have evolved to have
[SPEAKER_11]: their best health with.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like us eating a healthy diet,
like eating a farmer's market,
[SPEAKER_11]: eating our own food, a plant growing from
insect poop and fungi and well-developed
[SPEAKER_11]: and aerated because worms are moving
through and because the fungi clumps
[SPEAKER_11]: things together, we have aggregated soil
that allows the right amount of air,
[SPEAKER_11]: that allows the right amount of organisms
to have an environment to all thrive and
[SPEAKER_11]: it just continues and continues.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's gonna give rise to the best health,
the best in the plant, and then the best
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis and terpene production at the
end.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why if you buy soil and then throw
it away at the end of the season,
[SPEAKER_07]: that is incorrect and should not be your
approach.
[SPEAKER_11]: The soil, it should just be this thing
that you're constantly improving and
[SPEAKER_11]: adding to and it's the most valuable thing
you have.
[SPEAKER_11]: If we all think about that, that's where
everything of value comes from.
[SPEAKER_11]: We grow all of our nutrition, that's what
keeps us healthy and if every person,
[SPEAKER_11]: their space thinks about that soil as
sacred and something they can make thrive
[SPEAKER_11]: more and more every year, you're
sequestering carbon and you're bringing
[SPEAKER_11]: health to the world.
[SPEAKER_11]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, so easy, yeah, no, all kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_11]: Compaction, bare soil, the sun beating
down, having water go over incorrectly,
[SPEAKER_11]: spraying anything, doing any kind of salt
nutrients, pH going off.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's all kinds of things that you make
a change and the biology is very specific,
[SPEAKER_11]: especially different bacterias for a very
specific environment.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the pH gets thrown off, the salt
balance gets thrown, you have a total die
[SPEAKER_11]: out of a certain thing and then that
throws a whole cycle off.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have to be really careful of not
allowing any kind of collapse in your soil
[SPEAKER_11]: biology and using things like that,
keeping it protected.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't overcompact, don't leave things
bare, don't use salt nutrients,
[SPEAKER_11]: don't use pesticides.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for explaining that to us.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I started smoking cannabis that
came out of this kind of soil and realized
[SPEAKER_07]: how different it was than the cannabis
that I might have previously been smoking,
[SPEAKER_07]: it pretty quickly made me realize that I
only wanted to eat food that was coming
[SPEAKER_07]: out of living soil also because the
difference is so dramatic and then that
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of means you have to start growing
your own food and building your own soil
[SPEAKER_07]: if you want that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think a big part of all of your
gardens is that the same soil is providing
[SPEAKER_07]: your food that you eat.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not gonna spray pesticide on your
cannabis because you are dedicated to what
[SPEAKER_07]: you're doing and you know that's wrong,
but also that's your food that you're
[SPEAKER_07]: eating is coming from right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was hoping maybe anyone who wants to
speak to it or all of you could talk about
[SPEAKER_07]: just what it's like to have that kind of
connection.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's not just like this is my job.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my cash crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like this is my life.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my food.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is everything and that's I think a
really magical relationship that not very
[SPEAKER_07]: many people nowadays have gotten to see or
experience and it really like,
[SPEAKER_07]: it really colors like your whole existence
I think when you are doing that and eating
[SPEAKER_07]: the food that's coming out of those cugal
beds or those those beds.
[SPEAKER_07]: So does anybody want to talk about their
food that they grow?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll start because I think the change we
made in our lives basically saved my life
[SPEAKER_05]: from a health perspective I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know where I would be if I hadn't
started seeking the answers to like what
[SPEAKER_05]: am I eating and I mean the city sourcing
your food is it would take me all week and
[SPEAKER_05]: I had certain farmers at the farmers
market and I knew exactly how they grew
[SPEAKER_05]: their food and they nourished me and kept
me alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's really important that you
know ultimately the solutions are
[SPEAKER_05]: solutions to a lot of things and if we're
only focused on profits for the sake of
[SPEAKER_05]: profits and we're not taking into account
the people or the planet and their health
[SPEAKER_05]: like for real like the quality of the life
then what are we really gaining and for
[SPEAKER_05]: how long is that even sustainable and we
don't have the time to waste anymore to be
[SPEAKER_05]: playing that game and I'm not interested
in playing it I'm not interested in buying
[SPEAKER_05]: anything or consuming anything that does
doesn't take these things into account and
[SPEAKER_05]: so for me it was like a big life choice in
a lot of ways that led me to be a canvas
[SPEAKER_05]: farmer in a remote valley in northern
California where I'm growing all my own
[SPEAKER_05]: food but to know what it tastes like to go
to a high and palm potluck there's like
[SPEAKER_05]: the saying that like once you've been to a
high and palm potluck you're like ruined
[SPEAKER_05]: forever because you could go to like the
best restaurant in Paris or wherever and
[SPEAKER_05]: you're just gonna be like yeah it's pretty
good or you could appreciate the chef or
[SPEAKER_05]: if you go to a place that's really farmed
a table like for real and you can really
[SPEAKER_05]: appreciate it but there's nothing like
homegrown so like one thing is if you can
[SPEAKER_05]: grow it in your backyard I hope you will
and the other is that it's look it is
[SPEAKER_05]: lucrative to support sustainable business
that's based on health and well-being of
[SPEAKER_05]: everybody involved and it's mutually
beneficial and it's really important that
[SPEAKER_05]: we start thinking that way because if we
don't where are we going and how does that
[SPEAKER_05]: how does anybody really win otherwise and
it's just like we were just like there's
[SPEAKER_05]: no more time to waste we're just gonna
like die like I'm dying I can feel myself
[SPEAKER_05]: dying I'm like not even that old this is
fucked up you know so like what are we
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna do about it and oh look at these
mycelium in the woods they like found
[SPEAKER_05]: their way indigenous microorganisms to
this crazy plastic that some cartel left
[SPEAKER_05]: here and they're like eating it and
turning it into soil and like if you just
[SPEAKER_05]: build it they will come so like like
seeing the microbiology on our just three
[SPEAKER_05]: acres and what it could do to our
ecosystems I mean we can reverse climate
[SPEAKER_05]: change if we practice regenerative
agriculture it's very simple I don't even
[SPEAKER_07]: know what the original question was I'm
sorry okay so I think I covered it okay
[SPEAKER_03]: going back to the no till growing our food
in this system is is very unconventional
[SPEAKER_03]: in terms of agriculture having the this
this constant supply of luscious you know
[SPEAKER_03]: loamy amazing living soil for for your
food I mean we're going through this right
[SPEAKER_03]: now my you know with my wife just had two
babies and there's a whole there's this
[SPEAKER_03]: you know in terms of milk production and
lactation all this kind of stuff I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: there is a real nutrient like food sort of
science to all that you know I mean we're
[SPEAKER_03]: harvesting like stinging nettles out of
our garden and these are all things that
[SPEAKER_03]: are growing in like a no till nutrient
dense style and and it's real and you can
[SPEAKER_03]: really feel it and and it goes and I spoke
about worms in the beginning but it you
[SPEAKER_03]: know there's all kinds of life there's all
different kinds of earthworm castings are
[SPEAKER_03]: wonderful but then you have the insect
frass from the pill bugs and I mean it
[SPEAKER_03]: goes even all the way to hummingbird poop
I mean there's probably some special
[SPEAKER_03]: compound in that and we're attract and
we're attracting them with with certain
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers that we grow next to our plants
you know so it just creating creating good
[SPEAKER_06]: life is where it's at I wanted to tap in
and just say to like to be real also with
[SPEAKER_06]: not all of us have access to being on a
farm and up in the mountains like you live
[SPEAKER_06]: in the city you live in the city and
that's perfectly fine and I think it's
[SPEAKER_06]: important to find your strengths and where
you are you know like our strengths is
[SPEAKER_06]: growing food but that's not everybody's
lifestyle so you go and you support the
[SPEAKER_06]: people who support you back and in turn
you know where you guys have a mutually
[SPEAKER_06]: benefiting relationship and also
diversifying with different foods and
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine I think it's so important to talk
about not many people talk about this in
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis I feel like you know herbal
medicine there's all these other herbs and
[SPEAKER_06]: sacred flowers and food is medicine and
everything that's growing is basically
[SPEAKER_06]: medicinal all around us and when we can
combine the intake of cannabis with
[SPEAKER_06]: different herbs that we're either growing
or sourcing from someone that we know
[SPEAKER_06]: who's growing them I grow them if anyone
is ever interested in herbs because I
[SPEAKER_06]: believe that we have to blend up the
different medicinal values of each plant
[SPEAKER_06]: so you're not only receiving
anti-inflammatory and adaptogenic
[SPEAKER_06]: properties from one plant but you're
receiving it from multiple different
[SPEAKER_06]: sources so that your medicine is actually
now enhanced and more diversified and it's
[SPEAKER_06]: all about that it always comes down to
that how we can diversify everything
[SPEAKER_06]: around us our cultures our communities and
ourselves internally it's it's I think
[SPEAKER_07]: it's an important balance to have thank
you so much for bringing up the importance
[SPEAKER_07]: of diversity and I think that really comes
through across like the soil the companion
[SPEAKER_07]: planting growing your own food all of it
it's really like diversity is a huge part
[SPEAKER_07]: of every regenerative farm I think and
when I see like a big monoculture now it
[SPEAKER_07]: makes me just really sad and it looks dead
to me because it's like the diversity of
[SPEAKER_07]: all the different plants in one hugel bed
or in one space and then the diversity of
[SPEAKER_07]: all the different types of life that are
going on in the soil I think all of that
[SPEAKER_07]: comes together in this amazing symphony
and I thought it would be nice to hear you
[SPEAKER_07]: mentioned that Patricia you mentioned that
you didn't always have so much things
[SPEAKER_07]: besides cannabis growing in the cannabis
garden and now you guys have more flowers
[SPEAKER_07]: and more all different kinds of things and
I was wondering if you have noticed
[SPEAKER_07]: changes you know changes in the space
changes in the cannabis after increasing
[SPEAKER_06]: more different types of life absolutely
one of the parcels that we're on is
[SPEAKER_06]: actually was planted 20 years prior with
by a woman who created a wildlife
[SPEAKER_06]: sanctuary so we had one half of the
property that's like amazing thriving plum
[SPEAKER_06]: trees fruit trees everything that nature
and all these birds and bats want and then
[SPEAKER_06]: on our side of the property when we moved
there it was a long progress because most
[SPEAKER_06]: of it was just cattle ranching you know
our areas ag land so a lot of ranchers
[SPEAKER_06]: around there and it's all flat all the
trees have been kind of in the valley what
[SPEAKER_06]: was it used to be a swamp more grassland
and then it all got fenced off so what we
[SPEAKER_06]: had to do was sheet mulch and sheet
mulching is beautiful because you can
[SPEAKER_06]: start with like a graph a piece of like
land of gravel where nothing's growing at
[SPEAKER_06]: all and you just start adding the layers
of soil and two years later or even months
[SPEAKER_06]: late months later I mean three months
later you can see the difference in the
[SPEAKER_06]: soil you can put your hand in and it's
soft and it's it's workable but years
[SPEAKER_06]: later and I'm talking about now I mean the
amount of flowers and and thriving native
[SPEAKER_06]: plants and trees the birds are crazy like
people who stay over our house they're
[SPEAKER_06]: like oh my god why are these birds so
happy in the morning like 5 a.m.
[SPEAKER_06]: they're going off and you can't sleep
anymore but unless you're used to it like
[SPEAKER_06]: me and you can sleep through it but yeah
it's just you're creating like a paradise
[SPEAKER_06]: an ecosystem that is literally paradise
like if you can imagine the most beautiful
[SPEAKER_06]: place that you would want to go to I'm
sure it has flowers and gardens and
[SPEAKER_06]: edibles and fruit that you can just pick
off trees that drips on you and it's
[SPEAKER_06]: divine that's what we're striving for is
just making this paradise and I we keep
[SPEAKER_06]: spreading it wider and wider and wider and
that's what we do with each other too
[SPEAKER_11]: hopefully what's amazing with the herbs
and medicinal plants is just growing them
[SPEAKER_11]: with cannabis you you improve your pest
situation like big-time having yarrow
[SPEAKER_11]: having basil oregano lavender all these
different herbs that are really easy to
[SPEAKER_11]: grow that just kind of take off on their
own that you want to have in your garden
[SPEAKER_11]: anyway chamomile and love it's like
they're bringing in all these different
[SPEAKER_11]: insects that keep the the whole system in
balance and I almost never see out of
[SPEAKER_11]: control you know out of balance pest
issues in gardens with a huge amount of
[SPEAKER_08]: poly culture so last year we had aphids
for the first time they showed up and all
[SPEAKER_08]: of a sudden they were like all over in
certain parts of the garden and it was
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of a nerving for a minute and then
you know what do you do you know no we're
[SPEAKER_08]: not gonna spray chemicals on them so we
did a little research she found out that
[SPEAKER_08]: spraying milk on them helps so we started
doing that and then you know the
[SPEAKER_08]: beneficial bugs these little siffer flies
the Hoover Hoover flies they started
[SPEAKER_08]: laying their larvae on on the plants and I
was like what the heck what are these
[SPEAKER_08]: little larvas on here now I have all sorts
of bugs it's like it's like a haven for
[SPEAKER_08]: all you know all these types of new bugs
that I it's like whoa so he's like why'd
[SPEAKER_06]: you make us plant all these flowers here
this is ruining it but then then we find
[SPEAKER_08]: out that that they're you know they're
going around and eating these aphids and
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like taking the aphids and putting
them in front of the little larvae and
[SPEAKER_08]: watching them devour and then I see the
aphid population diminishing off of
[SPEAKER_08]: certain plants you know like some of them
almost like you know a hundred percent and
[SPEAKER_08]: so it's pretty amazing to see like this
actually working and you know the garden
[SPEAKER_08]: just taking care of itself you know so
having that diversity is very crucial and
[SPEAKER_08]: you know just having fruit trees around
and you know being able to pick your fruit
[SPEAKER_08]: with you know as you smell your buds and
you know it's it's all it's just you
[SPEAKER_08]: having like a garden of Eden around you
you know it's just that's all I think what
[SPEAKER_07]: we all want so I think that gives a really
different like seeing that seeing those
[SPEAKER_07]: systems work and seeing how quickly they
can work and how the garden can sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: take care of itself when it has the
appropriate amount of diversity it seems
[SPEAKER_07]: to make make you guys all a lot more calm
than a lot of people who are managing a
[SPEAKER_10]: garden like I've been in Josh takes
patience developing that patience and that
[SPEAKER_07]: calm really it comes and everything you do
the not panicking and also you start to
[SPEAKER_10]: learn you know these plants and the
animals and the insects they're not just
[SPEAKER_10]: like working for us they're beings of
their own independent nature that deserve
[SPEAKER_10]: our love and respect and we can't get
along well without them and so if we keep
[SPEAKER_10]: farming in ways that hurt these creatures
we're in big trouble yeah let's get along
[SPEAKER_07]: with the creatures I've been in I've been
in moon gazers garden a lot of times and
[SPEAKER_07]: seen they because like I said you guys
always have just different people coming
[SPEAKER_07]: through and checking out the garden and so
I always see we're always walking through
[SPEAKER_07]: the garden and someone's coming through
and they're like oh Josh I just found
[SPEAKER_07]: something here I there's you got a bugs
here there's some stuff growing here and
[SPEAKER_07]: every time he's so chill they're like oh
look out and these are you know
[SPEAKER_07]: experienced farmers not just random people
that are like oh my god a bug like they're
[SPEAKER_07]: experts that know what they're talking
about they're like oh you got something to
[SPEAKER_07]: worry about here and every single time you
just let it roll right you're like oh some
[SPEAKER_07]: will come along and eat that like just so
chill and your weed is amazing and it does
[SPEAKER_07]: not get all eaten by bugs so it seems like
it's working to just not stress out about
[SPEAKER_03]: that there's definitely an element of
trusting in nature that that it'll it'll
[SPEAKER_03]: it'll work out and and observing well yeah
biological intelligence is amazing and I
[SPEAKER_05]: mean it's very nuanced and so you have to
know what you're looking at for sure and
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes you have to constantly be doing
research and we need to be really
[SPEAKER_05]: connected in our communities because you
know just in agriculture like new things
[SPEAKER_05]: come in as like it's actually because of
hemp blowing up that we saw these new
[SPEAKER_05]: aphids for the first time on canvas the
their hemp aphids that crossed over so
[SPEAKER_05]: anyway there's always going to be
something new to deal with and it's always
[SPEAKER_05]: changing and but but biological
intelligence is very nuanced and it's it's
[SPEAKER_05]: something that you don't want to be ever
fighting against and actually if you just
[SPEAKER_05]: really constantly observe and really work
with its own balance balance it doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: mean you're always perfectly on a straight
line in the middle like this that's not
[SPEAKER_05]: how it works balance is fluid and
biological intelligence allows for a
[SPEAKER_05]: natural course of life to walk that line
in a way that's actually fluid and that's
[SPEAKER_05]: that's what life means and that and so
when you're creating as the farmer that
[SPEAKER_05]: creation that's what life is about it's
creative and so ultimately we are the
[SPEAKER_05]: innovators we are the ones that are that
come before the science the science is
[SPEAKER_05]: that is what we're doing but then the
numbers just are ways we can measure and
[SPEAKER_05]: demonstrate and improve what we are
discovering and so the discovery and the
[SPEAKER_05]: creation that's what life is doing and the
biological intelligence there's more more
[SPEAKER_05]: more more more to it the more to it that
you uncover in the more that you learn and
[SPEAKER_05]: so that's what's exciting about our job
but the other thing is we really need to
[SPEAKER_05]: build space where we can be working in
this way in agriculture and it is possible
[SPEAKER_05]: to create both abundance well-being health
for the planet and the people and have
[SPEAKER_05]: lucrative sustainable system so I think
that's really important that our industry
[SPEAKER_05]: be guiding this because we've been doing
this work there's research in Korea
[SPEAKER_05]: there's like a hundred years of research
from Germany and other places and we're
[SPEAKER_05]: one of the places in the United States and
this part of kind of the Western
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemisphere that you know in cannabis that
we've been doing this because our way of
[SPEAKER_05]: life kind of plant all of it leads to us
asking these questions and so as an
[SPEAKER_05]: industry how can we really support the
fact that we are in a lot of ways the
[SPEAKER_05]: innovators and and part of the people that
are doing some really creative work around
[SPEAKER_05]: what can happen positively in agriculture
and with this plant so I hope we'll all
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of continue to really think about
regardless like Patricia said of where you
[SPEAKER_05]: live how we can support those systems in
our regions because they're really
[SPEAKER_05]: important to the sustainability of our of
our cities and of our future in general so
[SPEAKER_03]: socially also promoting diversity as a
form of resilience when people come out to
[SPEAKER_03]: our farm and we have you know last year we
had about that we had at one point like 20
[SPEAKER_03]: visitors at one time came from CDFA
because they're coming up with their you
[SPEAKER_03]: know with their ways of looking at things
and and there was a couple farmers there
[SPEAKER_03]: too and one farmer said like aren't you
are you worried about you know pests
[SPEAKER_03]: coming over or you know and and it's it
doesn't really become an issue when you
[SPEAKER_03]: have the balanced ecosystem and and
resilient resilient nature mimicking sort
[SPEAKER_11]: of farm that we can create I want to say I
want to smoke the flowers that come from
[SPEAKER_11]: the farms where they're paying attention
to which plant had hummingbird poop on it
[SPEAKER_11]: and which plan you know and just noticing
the aphids and that there be you know that
[SPEAKER_11]: the hoverfly started eating them like that
kind of nuance like in connection with
[SPEAKER_11]: your landscape and your flowers there's no
way to replicate that it's something
[SPEAKER_11]: that's really special it's something
that's art and it's something that we
[SPEAKER_11]: should really do everything to support
[SPEAKER_07]: agreed well I think there's probably a lot
of things that you guys could share that
[SPEAKER_07]: are valuable because you're always
learning and discovering new things so I
[SPEAKER_07]: don't if there's anything that that we
haven't touched on that feels important to
[SPEAKER_07]: to share and then we can have questions
after that anything we missed I'd like to
[SPEAKER_11]: encourage everyone to go to the website
regenerative cannabis farming org you can
[SPEAKER_11]: learn about these farms there's cool photo
galleries and movies and a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: information about practices and resource
links cool does anybody have any questions
[SPEAKER_02]: that they want to ask these regenerative
cannabis farming org the regenerative
[SPEAKER_02]: farming is is that standalone on its own
or who is that sponsored by where does
[SPEAKER_11]: that stem from yeah it's it's a project
that I do with Dan Marr it's just a way of
[SPEAKER_11]: evaluating farms based on their ecological
and community standards and something that
[SPEAKER_11]: we just do independently for both the
Emerald Cup and the cultivation classic
[SPEAKER_11]: for awarding farms based off okay cool
yeah that was my question awesome but it's
[SPEAKER_11]: independent yeah I tied permaculture and
bio vortex it's very grassroots I just had
[SPEAKER_04]: a question as a like city dweller I have a
small garden and I was just wondering how
[SPEAKER_04]: it even gets started and introducing like
beneficial bugs to my crops and where I
[SPEAKER_04]: would get that and like how to get smaller
sizes like I don't need a thousand bugs
[SPEAKER_04]: you know for my little small garden just
build compost and build a bunch of and
[SPEAKER_10]: create a bunch of flowers create habitat
for them to come and they'll come so plant
[SPEAKER_10]: flowers you know move some law sticks logs
around or get some wood chips and there's
[SPEAKER_10]: a lot of availability of resources in
urban areas to do interesting permaculture
[SPEAKER_11]: projects look up who will culture beds to
and do a mini who will culture you might
[SPEAKER_06]: have fun with that in the yard it's always
fun to look at native plants in your area
[SPEAKER_06]: because that attracts the native
pollinators and bees and bugs that you
[SPEAKER_11]: might want yeah if you can do some
research look for a native plant nursery
[SPEAKER_11]: in your area and there'll be a awesome
resource to let you know how to you know
[SPEAKER_11]: give a habitat for the bugs that are best
for that particular area so I work in a
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery and a lot of the people that I
interact with have indoor grows that try
[SPEAKER_00]: to be very sterile and use a lot of really
unsustainable practices and I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone knows they can't last forever but
I'm curious what you guys think a path
[SPEAKER_00]: toward being more sustainable indoors
could look like well sustainable as far as
[SPEAKER_11]: pest control I think like a lot of people
have pretty good luck just doing common
[SPEAKER_11]: things like mineral oils and sulfur and
and then and then introducing biological
[SPEAKER_11]: controls like the bugs that might eat the
next one but that's a very controlled it's
[SPEAKER_11]: just such a different world the indoor
environment because it's like the opposite
[SPEAKER_11]: of what we're doing you know we're
attracting as much life as possible and
[SPEAKER_11]: you're trying to kind of control it
indoors but biological controls do work
[SPEAKER_11]: well and and living soil works super well
indoors and you don't have to replace it
[SPEAKER_11]: and it gets better and better there's a
lot of really good examples of people
[SPEAKER_11]: doing like 30 cycles and it just improves
every time I always pictured like the most
[SPEAKER_03]: ideal indoor situation would be like with
solar panels and you had some animals
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe grazing outside and you could use
that like material to compost your beds
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff like that and do like a no-till
indoor style and like if you check out
[SPEAKER_03]: check out green life productions over in
Nevada they have some cool indoor
[SPEAKER_03]: techniques that they use there's lots of
mycological life and stuff like that in
[SPEAKER_10]: there and it's there's a way to do
anything and there are also quite a few
[SPEAKER_10]: plant-based pesticide products on the
market that could be alternatives there's
[SPEAKER_10]: definitely I know one called SNS 209 which
hat is basically a rosemary extract it's a
[SPEAKER_10]: pet and it's like generally recognized as
safe food grade product that is it is a
[SPEAKER_10]: pesticide you water in made out of
rosemary and that's it so there are
[SPEAKER_10]: definitely options for for consumers to
support you know regenerative we grown
[SPEAKER_10]: products if you choose not to make it
yourself like we do and I think some of
[SPEAKER_10]: that is definitely worth supporting you
know I think it's cool to see in places
[SPEAKER_07]: where indoors the only legal option people
exploring companion planting and no-till
[SPEAKER_07]: living soil in an indoor environment but I
think that the best way to improve an
[SPEAKER_07]: indoor grow is to take the roof off and
then take the walls off and then take the
[SPEAKER_10]: floor away we have to remember that the
reason we grow indoors is not because it's
[SPEAKER_10]: superior or more clean it's because
helicopters used to fly over and you could
[SPEAKER_10]: get you could get away with it you know
that's the only reason we grow indoors why
[SPEAKER_10]: would you ever eat a tomato grown indoors
are you kidding me like who eats tomatoes
[SPEAKER_10]: grown indoors and prefers and providing
yourself medicine it definitely makes
[SPEAKER_10]: sense but to commercially be be using this
much energy I think I I don't know I heard
[SPEAKER_10]: some outrageous statistics about how much
fossil fuels go into an indoor pound
[SPEAKER_10]: that's just like the equivalent of a
server of a server center yeah it's like
[SPEAKER_10]: pretty terrible so we need to fix that
there's we don't really there's no excuses
[SPEAKER_05]: anymore at least not for us because we
have the environment to do it and we we
[SPEAKER_05]: need we should be celebrating that and and
doing that because we can now and there
[SPEAKER_05]: aren't I mean they're actually that's not
you there are still helicopters flying
[SPEAKER_05]: over but that's a longer story and not not
what this panel is about anyway so I had a
[SPEAKER_11]: friend who you know grew pretty
traditionally you know whatever worked
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of style and you know he was pretty
good at it and he definitely knows
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis well but he's doing a nursery and
he's all he's been all excited like
[SPEAKER_11]: calling me the last like several months is
like constantly like oh my god I'm doing
[SPEAKER_11]: so much less work I'm not like because
he's gone totally organic and he's just
[SPEAKER_11]: done natural predators for his nursery and
like there's no spray it's just like I
[SPEAKER_11]: don't have to hire anyone off to do
anything the plants are happier than I've
[SPEAKER_11]: ever seen and you know he's doing larger
amounts of club kind of classic you know
[SPEAKER_11]: hype strains and stuff like that too and
keeping them clean just with you know
[SPEAKER_11]: organic and biological control so it's
cool to see that next question yes thank
[SPEAKER_01]: you I'm gonna start off by saying that I'm
vegan and I'm very regenerative so these
[SPEAKER_01]: questions might come a little bit more of
a reality check for for me anyway 80% of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis that's consumed is grown
indoors and so the 20% which is where the
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful also gets pricing that's much
lower and often much better quality so I
[SPEAKER_01]: think there's got to be a way to bridge
that gap and be become more plant-centric
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure and you don't need an example of
that with regards to different kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: comp adding you know additives that you
might do whether it's chemicals salts
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever because you can look right around
you and see this beautiful that really
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have Monsanto here doesn't have
you know a peat number XXX it does it on
[SPEAKER_01]: its own it's been doing it for years right
I think the issue is how do we the Sun is
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely important as we all know the UV
factor so no matter whether you put it on
[SPEAKER_01]: a greenhouse or you do it indoors the
issue is you're not getting UV and UV is
[SPEAKER_01]: so significantly important for pest
control as well as compound development
[SPEAKER_01]: and outside we can get so much more
compounds so much more medicine it's all
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine whether you're getting high on it
or not it's medicine so my question is I
[SPEAKER_01]: see a lot of camaraderie I certainly do
and that's one of the reasons I came
[SPEAKER_01]: because I want to be centered in that it's
the kind of souls that are here but
[SPEAKER_01]: where's the collaboration in fighting off
that 80% grow and fighting from a quality
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective from a land race perspective
being able to buy the true medicines that
[SPEAKER_01]: are available to us not just in cannabis
and psychedelics and and then but grown in
[SPEAKER_01]: a way not only that you are a servant to
Mother Nature but that you produce the
[SPEAKER_01]: best highest quality because they will
find you so my question is what strains or
[SPEAKER_01]: what plants what are the plans of the
group here to differentiate yourself in
[SPEAKER_01]: the marketplace with a quality product
that no matter what other people make they
[SPEAKER_01]: know you your farm for that how how is it
that you're gonna do this against this
[SPEAKER_01]: huge machine that's gonna be branding and
they're gonna do everything else they're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna poison it and I do this often and
I'm sorry for this I'm getting on a
[SPEAKER_01]: soapbox I figure that everything that's
not done the way you do it is poison
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis truly is poison cannabis in this
way we extract it with bioaccumulates in
[SPEAKER_01]: our body along with the chemicals that you
use to grow it which also is in the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: so the question is how do we collaborate
in a way to be able to change that balance
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit because we all know in our
hearts the cannabis growing out there in
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil outdoors is gonna produce the
best medicine and high so how would you
[SPEAKER_11]: guys go about doing that well that is the
point of the regenerative cannabis farm
[SPEAKER_11]: award I got at the heart like that's the
concept it's like that getting this out
[SPEAKER_11]: there at that thermal cup you have 4,000
people on stage looking up and we're
[SPEAKER_11]: showing the movies connecting the farms
with the animals the soil the polyculture
[SPEAKER_11]: the community work and they see it and and
then you know connecting them with the
[SPEAKER_11]: flowers after that too and we had a really
cool flower testing too and you did these
[SPEAKER_11]: amazing reviews certified dank did amazing
reviews of all the different flowers so
[SPEAKER_11]: each different farm put in like two
different samples and they were they were
[SPEAKER_11]: all got these really fun elaborate wine
type reviews that were actually quite on
[SPEAKER_11]: point because I'm very familiar with a lot
of almost like wow that's really really
[SPEAKER_11]: good very specific it almost be fun if you
read one of those but the more that we
[SPEAKER_11]: like kind of have that the practices be
the subject and the more we communicate
[SPEAKER_11]: also with dispensaries there's certain
dispensaries like soulful that really do
[SPEAKER_11]: push forward these practices they have the
you know come meet the farmers and so then
[SPEAKER_11]: the consumers get to connect with you know
see pictures talk to the farmers know the
[SPEAKER_11]: practices and it's you know it starts off
slow you know a few years ago it was just
[SPEAKER_11]: like there's no concept you know as far as
the general public on these things and I
[SPEAKER_11]: think it's grown more and more every year
and we just have to just constantly be
[SPEAKER_11]: beating that down in beating that in
everyone's head talking to the
[SPEAKER_11]: dispensaries just letting everyone
demanding it as a consumer but the more
[SPEAKER_11]: people come in contact and learn about
these things there's only one direction
[SPEAKER_11]: nobody's all the sudden like nah I'm gonna
go back to that you know chemi indoor
[SPEAKER_11]: because that was working for me like this
region thing that there's only one
[SPEAKER_11]: direction I've never seen anyone like who
really gets to like know the quality of
[SPEAKER_11]: living soil sun-grown like amazing
genetics of course to go with it too but
[SPEAKER_11]: like once you've experienced that you know
there's there's not really backwards so I
[SPEAKER_11]: think it's a constant slope and it's all
of us constantly talking to each other
[SPEAKER_11]: about supporting each other and and bring
each other up it has to be mutualistic so
[SPEAKER_11]: much business it's like you know cutting
the other person down and why you're the
[SPEAKER_11]: best and it's not like that in this
movement it's why you know it's like
[SPEAKER_11]: supporting everyone's practices and
because there's there's stuff to be
[SPEAKER_11]: learned from everyone and and so
celebrating the differences in the
[SPEAKER_11]: diversity and how that makes us stronger
so just as a group just constantly putting
[SPEAKER_11]: out the education and and hopefully the
public supporting that it definitely feels
[SPEAKER_07]: like a David and Goliath situation and
it's like oh man there's so much indoor
[SPEAKER_07]: everyone like they think okay something
costs more to produce their for its more
[SPEAKER_07]: expensive therefore it must be better and
that's really frustrating to to see that
[SPEAKER_07]: attitude be so prevalent but at the same
time watching this movement grow and it's
[SPEAKER_07]: really been pretty rapid and amazing and
it's it's really true that basically all
[SPEAKER_07]: you have to do is just like smoke it once
and you'll make an effort to look for it
[SPEAKER_07]: in the future and so the more people that
just know that this exists and get a
[SPEAKER_07]: chance to try it the more it will become
available because the demand just like
[SPEAKER_07]: Jessie said you don't go in the opposite
direction once you go this way yeah I
[SPEAKER_10]: think the quality is what's really gonna
help us prevail because you know one thing
[SPEAKER_10]: that I've noticed and and as I've become a
farmer and when I drink wine I noticed
[SPEAKER_10]: this too is that people who use the same
things all their stuff tastes the same and
[SPEAKER_10]: so how do you differentiate yourself in
the market when you're using the same
[SPEAKER_10]: recipe as 6,000 other people or more and
so when you are bringing out a unique
[SPEAKER_10]: quality of your place that doesn't taste
like anybody else's place you know whether
[SPEAKER_10]: you're trying to get a lower price and
produce more and and you know process it
[SPEAKER_10]: in a in a more you know quick manner or
you're trying to do a smaller batch that
[SPEAKER_10]: you're trying to really you know train
those plants and and produce a quote a
[SPEAKER_10]: product that's equal to what people expect
of a top shelf indoor that's you know
[SPEAKER_10]: finally manicured and and taken care of
you know basically that quality quality is
[SPEAKER_10]: going to differentiate you because your
land is different from everybody else's
[SPEAKER_10]: land and whether you advertise your
practices or not that quality is going to
[SPEAKER_10]: help you distinguish yourself and so we as
a society and as an industry need to focus
[SPEAKER_08]: on quality above and be off absolutely and
and diversity so not just like growing
[SPEAKER_08]: tons of the same diet different same
clones you know like seeds they all have
[SPEAKER_08]: different phenotypes so each phenotype is
special so each plant is you know should
[SPEAKER_08]: be held to its full you know being you
know it's it's one seed it's it's not like
[SPEAKER_08]: any other it's like a snowflake you know
so it has all different properties and
[SPEAKER_08]: having diversity like that it could be a
way yeah exactly it's it's about the niche
[SPEAKER_05]: market which I mean as as an industry as a
retail market space as as a regulatory
[SPEAKER_05]: policy there's as far as you know all of
these things as far as like the the
[SPEAKER_05]: ability of the small farmer or small
business to operate as a regular small
[SPEAKER_05]: business we have no direct retail access
there's you have to be vertically
[SPEAKER_05]: integrated there's all these different
things that don't make sense that we're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing in our industry that aren't even
standard in all other industries and the
[SPEAKER_05]: markups and the the way who has to take
what cut out of where and it none of it
[SPEAKER_05]: makes any sense it's like we've been
talking all weekend about how crazy this
[SPEAKER_05]: is that we're all doing this but but at
the same time there you know the people
[SPEAKER_05]: who want the good weed and you know it and
back in the day you know we would get that
[SPEAKER_05]: amazing bag and you it would just come to
you magically because you didn't have
[SPEAKER_05]: control over what you would get
necessarily maybe you knew a guy or your
[SPEAKER_05]: friend's cousin or whatever if you were
lucky but but you know like you got this
[SPEAKER_05]: mate magic bag of weed and it was
incredible and you were like whoa and one
[SPEAKER_05]: day we actually met the people that grew
our weed and it changed our lives forever
[SPEAKER_05]: and just I mean like with wine we we have
a level of sophistication with the
[SPEAKER_05]: consumer now where you can have that niche
market really thrive and it's gonna take
[SPEAKER_05]: time and we don't even have our
Appalachians set at this point like it's
[SPEAKER_05]: it's gonna be difficult and we're at the
beginning of a long road of development as
[SPEAKER_05]: far as that and as far as consumer
education as far as all of these things
[SPEAKER_05]: but there is a very very strong desire
from all demographics of consumers
[SPEAKER_05]: realistically for things that are natural
that are pure that are healthy that are
[SPEAKER_05]: actually legitimately clean and that are
going to enhance their health because I
[SPEAKER_05]: think the latest statistic I heard was
like one in two people in the US now have
[SPEAKER_05]: cancer it's one in two so it's it's again
it just goes back to how all those things
[SPEAKER_05]: are connected but there are there's a
there's a bridge that we still have to
[SPEAKER_05]: build and then get across and we're at the
beginning of that right now and that
[SPEAKER_05]: that's just real reality but we live
really sustainably on our farms so we're
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna be alright we're gonna ride it out
you know for however long and whatever is
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna happen after that like I'd rather be
on my farm than anywhere if the shit hits
[SPEAKER_05]: the fan you know but but we want to help
help it thrive and we we want to help it
[SPEAKER_05]: move along as quickly as possible and
consumer advocacy and awareness or
[SPEAKER_05]: consumer awareness and just how we get the
knowledge out there is really what this
[SPEAKER_05]: movement is about and what regenerative
canvas farming org is about and why the
[SPEAKER_05]: Emerald Cup made it such a priority to
create an award specifically for how the
[SPEAKER_05]: farms are practicing and and really
centering around why that makes what we do
[SPEAKER_05]: up here in Northern California so special
and why ours that creates a uniqueness to
[SPEAKER_05]: our story that is definitely marketable
and the challenge is yeah there's you know
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of capital going into all kinds of
things right now and it's gonna be a shit
[SPEAKER_05]: show for a while so it's really about like
finding the other people on the other side
[SPEAKER_05]: that are all part of this that that care
because definitely people all over the
[SPEAKER_05]: place really care.
[SPEAKER_11]: Forrest was mentioning the
[SPEAKER_11]: uniqueness and the potential of that
flower and you know like this jar what's
[SPEAKER_11]: in it is it's high art and it can only
exist this year in this way you know like
[SPEAKER_11]: it's it's very unique that genetic
expression in that environment from that
[SPEAKER_11]: has the love of the cultivator in it as
well as a diverse living system around it
[SPEAKER_11]: that it gained to existence to then change
your consciousness like I don't know we're
[SPEAKER_11]: talking about things that change our
consciousness like let's like let's care
[SPEAKER_11]: about the process that went into creating
this like this is incredibly special art
[SPEAKER_11]: to me and I love I love cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: so I think we're out of time but these
guys are all incredibly generous if you
[SPEAKER_07]: find them and ask them questions I'm sure
they'll talk to you for a long time and
[SPEAKER_07]: tell you a lot of valuable information but
since we're out of time can we just can
[SPEAKER_07]: you since we're not on Instagram right now
maybe everyone could say where people can
[SPEAKER_07]: buy your flowers if they're available
anywhere does anyone can anyone find
[SPEAKER_07]: anyone's flowers in a store and buy them
if they want to they're all at soulful
[SPEAKER_05]: right every one of these farms is soulful
yeah I think we're all all of us are at
[SPEAKER_05]: soulful in Sebastopol and we want to thank
those guys for doing a lot of the work to
[SPEAKER_05]: find the people really doing the work on
the other side proper wellness for us in
[SPEAKER_05]: Eureka and the Kohong in in Oakland which
is a micro business that has been very
[SPEAKER_05]: fair trade with us and so we want to thank
them for for their support as well so I
[SPEAKER_06]: also want to thank I saw her out here

[SPEAKER_06]: of people we want to support that are a
small not big-time invested and we're
[SPEAKER_06]: alert we're all learning about this to
just smaller investors and companies that
[SPEAKER_06]: care and make a difference and make a
difference in their communities as well
[SPEAKER_06]: not just on the bigger level and
out-of-state and chemistry is doing really
