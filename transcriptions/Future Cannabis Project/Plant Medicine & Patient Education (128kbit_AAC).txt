[SPEAKER_08]: We are first going to hear from Wade
Lafter on plans and solutions to get
[SPEAKER_08]: medicine to our communities, keeping
medical cannabis relevant, language
[SPEAKER_08]: marketing we can use that supports
patients and future medicinal laws.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to try to keep it to about
five minutes for your speaker.
[SPEAKER_16]: If it has to be five minutes, then I would
start off by saying that cannabis as
[SPEAKER_16]: medicine works for, in my experience,
an incredible range of conditions.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the real trick is to look at your end
user, the person who's actually going to
[SPEAKER_16]: be using the product you have produced.
[SPEAKER_16]: And make sure that that product,
that the chemistry that's available in
[SPEAKER_16]: that product is appropriate for your end
user at a dose that's appropriate for your
[SPEAKER_16]: end user with guidance to your end user on
how to use that preparation and what side
[SPEAKER_16]: effects or beneficial effects they should
expect.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know that in my own life,
I started in this work as a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_16]: And organized a collective that involved
patients, quote unquote, under the Prop
[SPEAKER_16]: 215 law here in California, that allowed
groups of people to work together to
[SPEAKER_16]: provide medicine to those who most needed
it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And basically, one of the issues that I
have with, in California, we have
[SPEAKER_16]: commercialized cannabis, not legalized it.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have made it a heavily regulated
commercial activity.
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a shame because the only reason
that happened is there are so many people
[SPEAKER_16]: who can benefit from cannabis with those
guidelines that I just mentioned about
[SPEAKER_16]: dosage and chemistry and guidance on how
to use it.
[SPEAKER_16]: There are so many people that can benefit
from it that the laws that prohibition
[SPEAKER_16]: were based upon have been overturned.
[SPEAKER_16]: In California, you have a constitutional
right in California to access cannabis as
[SPEAKER_16]: medicine if you need it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And yet, we've set up these laws today
where patients the people who most need
[SPEAKER_16]: cannabis do not have access.
[SPEAKER_16]: For the most part, in my own life,
a number of years ago, I found a cultivar
[SPEAKER_16]: called Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_16]: I won't get into that story.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's pretty out there.
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you really want to hear the
details, ask me about it later because I
[SPEAKER_16]: only got five minutes.
[SPEAKER_16]: But where that's really relevant is among
the very first folks that I started
[SPEAKER_16]: interacting with who wanted something
other than getting stoned was people who
[SPEAKER_16]: were dealing with pain.
[SPEAKER_16]: And at first, again, I was just smoking a
joint.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what was lovely about Harlequin is it
actually worked for pain even if you were
[SPEAKER_16]: just smoking a joint.
[SPEAKER_16]: But pretty quickly, folks with cancer
started presenting themselves.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the one issue that really flipped
everything for me personally was getting
[SPEAKER_16]: involved with a family, with a young child
that had protracted long-term issues with
[SPEAKER_16]: epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_16]: Basically, from birth, this person had
been taking anti-apolectic drugs.
[SPEAKER_16]: When I met the family, he was on 15
different pharmaceutical drugs,
[SPEAKER_16]: totally locked up in rigor.
[SPEAKER_16]: I know there's a technical term for that,
Dr. Russo.
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe you could elucidate.
[SPEAKER_16]: But basically, in a wheelchair,
wearing diapers, blind, completely
[SPEAKER_16]: disconnected from the world.
[SPEAKER_16]: And his parents loved this child,
wanted him to be a successful human being.
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, today, he's down to one of those
anti-apoleptic medications.
[SPEAKER_16]: He can see again.
[SPEAKER_16]: He no longer has to wear diapers.
[SPEAKER_16]: He's 28 years old, by the way,
this person.
[SPEAKER_16]: And when he has to go to the bathroom,
he has enough ability to push himself up.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like he's trying to get out of his
wheelchair.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's when his parents know,
oh, he needs to go to the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_16]: So he's no longer having to wear diapers.
[SPEAKER_16]: When he's hungry, he's able to communicate
that this is something that he needs.
[SPEAKER_16]: He needs food.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so you have to understand what that
must feel like.
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're a parent, consider what you
would be dealing with if that was what
[SPEAKER_16]: your child was dealing with.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what's true is, must all of us take
health for granted?
[SPEAKER_16]: Health is just a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a thing that happens.
[SPEAKER_16]: But as you get older in your life,
or if your life is such that you're
[SPEAKER_16]: presented with a child who has health
issues, or someone that you love in your
[SPEAKER_16]: life comes into health issues,
this is where this plant can do.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm really reluctant to use the word
miraculous, because it's not really a
[SPEAKER_16]: miracle.
[SPEAKER_16]: The plant is creating this chemistry that
mimics the chemistry our bodies create in
[SPEAKER_16]: order to create health in our bodies.
[SPEAKER_16]: The endocannabinoid system, the way I
think of it is, it's the system that our
[SPEAKER_16]: body uses compounds, signaling compounds,
to help our tissues talk to each other so
[SPEAKER_16]: that the stomach and the bile ducts and
the gallbladder and the pancreas and all
[SPEAKER_16]: of those things can work together so we
can digest the breakfast we just had and
[SPEAKER_16]: take energy from that food, process it,
and make it available to us so that we can
[SPEAKER_16]: live.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what's true is, I think that cannabis
has become so important as a medicine
[SPEAKER_16]: because the combination of food that lacks
proper nutrient and is contaminated with
[SPEAKER_16]: all kinds of things, there's a whole
conversation there, toxins in the air,
[SPEAKER_16]: the stress of our culture, on and on and
on, our bodies are no longer able to
[SPEAKER_16]: successfully make the endocannabinoids
that we need to enjoy health.
[SPEAKER_16]: And for that reason, we are experiencing
all of the health issues that we are
[SPEAKER_16]: experiencing as a culture.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what's lovely to me is, so many of
them respond beautifully and perfectly to
[SPEAKER_16]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so as cultivators, as people who work
with cannabis, I feel like one of the
[SPEAKER_16]: central responsibilities when you talk
about ethics in our work is to make this
[SPEAKER_16]: plant and the medicine we can make from it
available to those who most need it.
[SPEAKER_16]: And ideally, it would be at little or no
cost because most people in our culture
[SPEAKER_16]: who are ill have no money.
[SPEAKER_16]: The medical system sucks it up like a huge
vacuum cleaner, even if you have good
[SPEAKER_16]: insurance.
[SPEAKER_16]: So we all know that when you set aside the
rules and the laws and the licenses and
[SPEAKER_16]: all of that crap that we are all dealing
with today, the pathogen of paper,
[SPEAKER_16]: as it was described yesterday,
if you set all of that aside, the actual
[SPEAKER_16]: true cost of cannabis medicine should be
literally pennies on the dollar for what
[SPEAKER_16]: it costs today.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's all I have to say.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's almost five minutes.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you talk about ways that you're
getting this medicine to the patients or
[SPEAKER_08]: terms or tools that you've thought about
or looking towards in the future to be
[SPEAKER_08]: getting this to the patients, supporting
the patients, supporting this movement?
[SPEAKER_16]: Two things about that.
[SPEAKER_16]: The biggest one is changing the rules.
[SPEAKER_16]: Here in California, we blew it really
badly in terms of leaving legalization,
[SPEAKER_16]: because it's not legalization.
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, it's highly, highly, highly
recommended, regulated commercialization,
[SPEAKER_16]: which is definitely not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: So at the state level, an organization
that I've done a lot of work with,
[SPEAKER_16]: the Caladrius Network, we put some effort
into changing state law in California.
[SPEAKER_16]: Caladrius, C-A-L-A-D-R-I-U-S, you'll have
to go back to the Wayback Machine online
[SPEAKER_16]: to find information about our work,
because we shut down.
[SPEAKER_16]: State law required the cessation of
collective activity at the beginning of
[SPEAKER_16]: this year.
[SPEAKER_16]: And so the Caladrius Network, our mission
statement was to provide education and,
[SPEAKER_16]: if appropriate, cannabis therapies to the
families of catastrophically ill children
[SPEAKER_16]: at no cost to those families ever.
[SPEAKER_16]: When we shut down in January, we had 146
families that we were helping directly by
[SPEAKER_16]: providing products that were appropriate
to their child's needs, and another 700 or
[SPEAKER_16]: so that were in line, if you will,
in our intake process to qualify for what
[SPEAKER_16]: we were doing.
[SPEAKER_16]: And when we had to shut down at the
beginning of this year, we did a big push
[SPEAKER_16]: to get those meds out to those families,
hoping that we would be able to rectify
[SPEAKER_16]: the situation by the end of this year.
[SPEAKER_16]: We did successfully get through compassion
bill at the state level that excludes all
[SPEAKER_16]: cannabis products that are donated from
taxation, which is a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: So really, the model that we used in
Caladrius Network is nurserymen,
[SPEAKER_16]: cultivators, manufacturers, laboratories,
distributors, and retailers, to whatever
[SPEAKER_16]: extent they could, contributed some
portion of their work to our efforts at no
[SPEAKER_16]: cost.
[SPEAKER_16]: To us, so that we could, in turn,
pass those medicines on to the families at
[SPEAKER_16]: no cost.
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, if you are a cultivator and
know lots and lots and lots about cannabis
[SPEAKER_16]: and how it works in your garden,
open yourself to the idea that there are
[SPEAKER_16]: people in your community who could benefit
from the material that you're making.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I assure you, I knew nothing.
[SPEAKER_16]: I did not know what CBD was when I learned
that harlequin was its high CBD strength.
[SPEAKER_16]: I've learned a lot about what CBD does and
what it can do for people and some of the
[SPEAKER_16]: compounds, the chemistry that this plant
is capable of in the years since then.
[SPEAKER_16]: And I assure you that all of you can
educate yourselves about what cannabis as
[SPEAKER_16]: medicine can do for people that you love
and what you can do in terms of creating
[SPEAKER_16]: products.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the last thing that I would like to
say about what you asked, Ruth,
[SPEAKER_16]: is to do with products.
[SPEAKER_16]: Basically, everybody that wants to smoke a
joint can smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_16]: You can find joints all across the
country, all around the world.
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a highly illegal drug and yet without
any advertising, without any distribution
[SPEAKER_16]: budget, without any, we have put it all
over the world.
[SPEAKER_16]: You can find a joint anywhere.
[SPEAKER_16]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_16]: The problem is most of the people who
really need cannabis aren't smoking
[SPEAKER_16]: joints.
[SPEAKER_16]: Start learning about the products,
the ways that you can prepare this plant
[SPEAKER_16]: into a form, be it a sublingual tincture
or a topical or a nasal spray or capsules
[SPEAKER_16]: that people are ingesting or edibles.
[SPEAKER_16]: There's so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_16]: The real trick is to get the chemistry
into the body at a dose that the user not
[SPEAKER_16]: only can tolerate but won't be frightened
because one of the stories I hear again
[SPEAKER_16]: and again is, oh, I tried cannabis,
lost my mind for eight hours and I ate it
[SPEAKER_16]: and it's a terrible drug and I never want
anything to do with it again.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that person lost the opportunity to
experience the wellness that's possible
[SPEAKER_16]: from this plant.
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate you saying make products.
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate you saying what type of
products.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the type of products you just
said, that was good information.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's a perfect segue because Mike
Frost is going to be talking with us about
[SPEAKER_08]: products that have worked for patients,
products that farmers can make,
[SPEAKER_08]: products that have medicinal value of
experience.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have one minute.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really appreciate being here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wade, you covered a lot of good stuff
already on kind of the types of products,
[SPEAKER_11]: but how can you get that into your body?
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, switching it over to what's easy for
the farmers?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, tinctures, straight activated oil,
sticking in some topicals.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not that difficult to get that
medicine out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess the way I'd look at it right now
is what's the easiest way to get it out in
[SPEAKER_11]: the cleanest?
[SPEAKER_11]: And more from a perspective of just get us
out of the way of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: The beauty is sitting there in the plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we learn to move away from the harmful
methods of extracting and get into what's
[SPEAKER_11]: a little bit more clean.
[SPEAKER_11]: But anything, whether it's ethanol,
bubble hash, squishing stuff, those are
[SPEAKER_11]: just great ways to get that oil out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once you get that oil out, the most
beautiful thing to work with is coconut
[SPEAKER_11]: oil.
[SPEAKER_11]: People love it.
[SPEAKER_11]: MCT oil has been a huge deal in all of us.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's how we blend our topicals.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how we make tinctures.
[SPEAKER_11]: The pets.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now we've got coconut drops that are
just oil mixed with MCT and about a third
[SPEAKER_11]: of real organic coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's really cool to have your dog come
up and you put a couple drops on your hand
[SPEAKER_11]: and they come up to take the medicine
right off your hand.
[SPEAKER_11]: Before it was try to get a capsule down a
dog's mouth.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a traumatic thing for a human or a
pet.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the methods are really easy.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can do a lot without a lot of
equipment.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you can get coconut oil,
MCT, you can put your plants right in
[SPEAKER_11]: there, heat up the oil, take some
cheesecloth, get your material out of
[SPEAKER_11]: there, and then put it into anything you
want.
[SPEAKER_11]: But literally we use that for our
tinctures and all the topicals.
[SPEAKER_11]: When we first started making the oil,
we had some oils for the capsules.
[SPEAKER_11]: So capsules and lotions is pretty much
what our family started working with.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the capsules, they couldn't have been
more simple.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was just get some activated oil,
Rick Simpson oil style oil.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's how I got into this was I had
three people tell me about the cancer
[SPEAKER_11]: curing properties of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I knew nothing about this.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I finally checked it out and
learned how to grow a plant and get some
[SPEAKER_11]: extract out.
[SPEAKER_11]: But what we did is get that activated oil
down, suck it into a syringe, and then you
[SPEAKER_11]: have your ability to store it.
[SPEAKER_11]: For the Rick Simpson oil type of method of
dosing, it came out to where out of that
[SPEAKER_11]: syringe, if you had like a half a grain of
rice for three times a day for four days,
[SPEAKER_11]: and you just keep bumping that up.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you'll build up your tolerance so
it's not freaking people out.
[SPEAKER_11]: And because you can hallucinate,
I'm sure some of us have been there.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's traumatic for people that are
just looking for medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: But that was the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that half a grain of rice coming out
of that syringe, that's about 10
[SPEAKER_11]: milligrams of THC, which ended up being
kind of a dose in Washington and around.
[SPEAKER_11]: As they get going, they can build up that
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the idea is you're going to take a
whole syringe of that a day.
[SPEAKER_11]: So in a real quick couple of minutes,
that's kind of the range from a quick
[SPEAKER_11]: topical to here's a full cancer treatment
thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the idea is that you're going to take
60 of those grams maybe over a course of
[SPEAKER_11]: two or three months.
[SPEAKER_11]: And really it's about, can you bring in
that much medicine without freaking out?
[SPEAKER_11]: From my experience, and I don't know if
this is legitimate data, but I guess I
[SPEAKER_11]: should also throw out most of the people
that I've been working with are my age and
[SPEAKER_11]: older and all the way up to an 83-year-old
gal.
[SPEAKER_11]: So none of them want to get high.
[SPEAKER_11]: But at that time, we didn't have the CBD
piece to add in there and add value there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we would get people ramping up and
trying to build up this tolerance.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the males I found, and it could have
been just coincidence, but I could not get
[SPEAKER_11]: them to take the full one gram deal.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I understand.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's heavy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I test it, and I've never taken a full
gram of oil either.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're glad.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I've taken enough to get me out of
normal smoking weed range and get in some
[SPEAKER_11]: really cool hallucinations too.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, that's a different thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_11]: But what I have found is we did get good
results.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the females and the older,
especially older females, they were able
[SPEAKER_11]: to get to that one gram no problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we can have some discussions
afterwards to see if there's anything that
[SPEAKER_11]: you guys have experienced on is there a
male-female element or not.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we had one gal, 83-year-old gal,
accidentally start dosing herself and got
[SPEAKER_11]: up to four grams in a day.
[SPEAKER_11]: And she's a pretty connected plant person.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, she's been learning indigenous
stuff for a long time.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's like, you want to go for it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But she got diagnosed with a real
aggressive type of cancer.
[SPEAKER_11]: And she knew she didn't have the time to
just start trying to stretch stuff out,
[SPEAKER_11]: or will this work?
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just told her, I think the best
thing, and it's an I think, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know a lot.
[SPEAKER_11]: But from experience, I think that there's
more power in blasting somebody and just
[SPEAKER_11]: putting them down.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're going to be down for a few
days.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just go through this.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we've seen tumors, nodules on lymph
nodes and stuff go away that have been
[SPEAKER_11]: photographed.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, like within a month and a half.
[SPEAKER_11]: I did this with a guy at work in the
information technology career.
[SPEAKER_11]: He was literally dropping snake type
things out of the syringe into coffee
[SPEAKER_11]: right next to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I had to learn this while I'm doing my
other career.
[SPEAKER_11]: And luckily, I've been fortunate enough to
get out here and try to make a living.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I want to work with this thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: This can change people.
[SPEAKER_11]: This hemp plant can change our planet.
[SPEAKER_11]: This can bring people together.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's possible we could clean up water and
air.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's possible we could have maybe a
replacement plastic.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, this thing is a huge topic.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if this is doable, to really switch
kind of the culture and get more moving on
[SPEAKER_11]: this hemp thing, it was Holly I was
talking with.
[SPEAKER_11]: I asked her, is this really doable that we
could switch and have this much of an
[SPEAKER_11]: industry impact on the planet by switching
just the topic of hemp to regenerative
[SPEAKER_11]: farming?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm watching and seeing two potential
pathways going out.
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of them is, oh my god,
if we continue our same agricultural
[SPEAKER_11]: practices to produce this easy to make
medicine, we're going to take something
[SPEAKER_11]: that really has the potential to put us in
a better position to have sustainable life
[SPEAKER_11]: here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the opposite is just not cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when I walked into this room,
and I'm pretty new to this community,
[SPEAKER_11]: to see how much power you guys have in all
of your knowledge and the heart and
[SPEAKER_11]: passion, which is the real driver.
[SPEAKER_11]: But take that heart and passion and drive
it down the real pathway.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys are giving me confidence that
this actually can happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can end with that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to add something.
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to add something.
[SPEAKER_16]: The high doses that this brother was just
speaking of can be really important and
[SPEAKER_16]: helpful for a few conditions in your
communities.
[SPEAKER_16]: But most of the people who are seeking
help want small doses.
[SPEAKER_16]: They want a little bit.
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't need these huge doses.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the beauty of that point of view is in
your kitchen.
[SPEAKER_16]: In olive oil or MCT, you can make
concentrated preparations that will be a
[SPEAKER_16]: benefit to most of the people that you
will encounter.
[SPEAKER_16]: Most people don't need a whole gram of oil
THC a day, because that is a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot, a lot of people that we've worked
with get benefit from five or 10
[SPEAKER_16]: milligrams over the course of a whole day.
[SPEAKER_16]: And Arno Hesekamp is the analytical
chemist for the Netherlands Cannabis
[SPEAKER_16]: Program.
[SPEAKER_16]: And he did a study on extractions.
[SPEAKER_16]: Where's the best capture of the terpenes
and cannabinoids present in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_16]: plant?
[SPEAKER_16]: And he found that olive oil done on a
kitchen stove is the best capture of the
[SPEAKER_16]: original chemistry in that plant.
[SPEAKER_16]: The limitation is he could only get up to
about 10 milligrams per milliliter of the
[SPEAKER_16]: material he was making.
[SPEAKER_16]: But in fact, 10 milligrams in a milliliter
is a pretty effective dose for a lot of
[SPEAKER_16]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_16]: Just got to say, again, these people are
not looking to get stoned.
[SPEAKER_16]: They're looking for benefit available in
that chemistry.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just wanted to add in that just everybody
coming together like this, you can look at
[SPEAKER_11]: it as like, OK, it's a synchronistic types
of things that are occurring.
[SPEAKER_11]: And recognizing that is just amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we haven't talked.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to have a little conversation
about Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's pretty unique that I'm sitting
here next to you in this group.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because Harlequin came into Washington
State.
[SPEAKER_11]: And somehow it came to us.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we spread that as much as we could.
[SPEAKER_11]: I get the same thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate your work.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I don't know how it got in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: But when the CBD piece came out,
we talk about the efficacy and the
[SPEAKER_11]: healing.
[SPEAKER_11]: The CBD piece brings in all of the anxiety
health, the bipolar, schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've stopped suicides from occurring with
CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's super powerful.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a quick question about efficacy
of those doses you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_13]: When you're giving a big dose like that,
would it be more efficacious to infuse
[SPEAKER_13]: that into a little bit of oil at least and
then not have to give as big of a dose?
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems like having that fat would bring
it into the body faster.
[SPEAKER_13]: So instead of putting the snake of real
sticky in the mouth, wouldn't you want to
[SPEAKER_13]: make that a little bit bigger?
[SPEAKER_13]: A little more easy for them taking?
[SPEAKER_13]: Because we've all put RS or FICO in our
mouths.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's like, if you think about a whole
snake.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a quick response on that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you can have some fats in there to deal
with the whole stomach issue without
[SPEAKER_11]: getting too gross, Nick, that's a helpful
segue into that topic of that 83-year-old
[SPEAKER_11]: gal who she started noticing that some
medicine might be coming out of her before
[SPEAKER_11]: getting absorbed into the system.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, adding the oil, or make sure
you're eating some fats means fats are
[SPEAKER_11]: great.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ice cream, I don't know if that's a real
deal, but ice cream seems to really,
[SPEAKER_11]: really work well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can just say a quick question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't need to be out of line.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done some studies on CBD and
different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And olive oil has definitely produced the
higher cannabinoid batches time after
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to then mix it with coconut oil,
but the olive oil has consistently been
[SPEAKER_02]: the winner.
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm a medical intuitive and shamanic
practitioner for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I've been working with patients for
the last almost four years with exactly
[SPEAKER_19]: what you're talking about, and titrating
up.
[SPEAKER_19]: But what I also do, and I do this myself,
is I take it suppositorily.
[SPEAKER_19]: I make my own pills.
[SPEAKER_19]: I started out with .10.
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm up to .50.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's my range.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I titrate it up until the next morning
I was feeling really kind of stoned.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I backed it off a bit, and that's my
dose.
[SPEAKER_19]: And suppositorily, it surpasses your brain
and your liver pretty much.
[SPEAKER_19]: So you don't get high.
[SPEAKER_19]: And you're getting the medicine in you.
[SPEAKER_19]: I've never had a digestive system better
than now.
[SPEAKER_19]: My bowels are better than ever,
just so you all know.
[SPEAKER_19]: So when I work with patients, I work with
CBD crude.
[SPEAKER_19]: I work with full spectrum RSO.
[SPEAKER_19]: We call it PPM, pure plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_19]: I work with THCA crystals.
[SPEAKER_19]: I combine, depending on what it is,
like Parkinson's patients, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_19]: use a higher CBD1 or CBD that's going to
go into for the neurological system.
[SPEAKER_19]: If it's somebody who's in pain,
I'm going to use higher PPM and maybe more
[SPEAKER_19]: of a THCA mixture.
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, when you're working with your
plant, the person, everybody's different.
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody's cells are different.
[SPEAKER_19]: So maybe have them get an endocannabinoid
test.
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what I'm having my patients do.
[SPEAKER_19]: First thing you come to me, get an
endocannabinoid test so I can see what
[SPEAKER_19]: your cells will and will not accept.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that gives you a start.
[SPEAKER_19]: Then you know what to grow.
[SPEAKER_19]: Then you know how to proceed with that
particular patient.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I guess I'm leading into me on how my
journey that brought me here.
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: So as I talked about in the first night,
I was diagnosed on January 24th of this
[SPEAKER_19]: year with stage four ovarian cancer.
[SPEAKER_19]: My tumors grew so quickly.
[SPEAKER_19]: They grew two and a half centimeters in
less than seven days.
[SPEAKER_19]: I had three masses, one on each ovarian,
one behind.
[SPEAKER_19]: By the time of my surgery on February 6th,
my masses were 6.4 and 4.9 and 3.4.
[SPEAKER_19]: They debunked me, meaning they did a
complete hysterectomy lapiscopically.
[SPEAKER_19]: They took out pieces of my body and found
I was 87% malignant.
[SPEAKER_19]: So they opened me up and they took eight
organs out.
[SPEAKER_19]: They closed me back up and in no uncertain
terms said, if you do not do chemo and
[SPEAKER_19]: radiation, you will die.
[SPEAKER_19]: And the fear mongering that goes on is
incredible.
[SPEAKER_19]: They said to Leighton in front of my
children, if you don't make her do chemo,
[SPEAKER_19]: you will kill her.
[SPEAKER_19]: This is on you.
[SPEAKER_19]: So the fear mongering that goes on is
terrible.
[SPEAKER_19]: But that leads me to I found a wonderful
natural path.
[SPEAKER_19]: I chose my doctors, my team of doctors.
[SPEAKER_19]: I said this is who I want to work with.
[SPEAKER_19]: I did all of my testing up front,
right?
[SPEAKER_19]: So I did the endocannabinoid test.
[SPEAKER_19]: I did something called the Keras test,
which showed me I wasn't able to do
[SPEAKER_19]: immunotherapy.
[SPEAKER_19]: I did something called the RGCC test,
which this is what told me what herbs I
[SPEAKER_19]: can use.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I found a really good natural path and
he put me on 15 different herbs.
[SPEAKER_19]: I take 130 pills a day.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's keeping me alive.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is what I'd like to really talk
about how you could help people like me.
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: We need herbs.
[SPEAKER_19]: We need herbs.
[SPEAKER_19]: We need whole food.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so think about it.
[SPEAKER_19]: If you plant a tomato plant and you put a
pepper plant next to it, what's going to
[SPEAKER_19]: happen?
[SPEAKER_19]: You're going to have some of those
properties from the root into the tomato
[SPEAKER_19]: plant, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: So the same thing.
[SPEAKER_19]: What can happen if you plant something
like binweed or sea kelp or high turkey
[SPEAKER_19]: tail?
[SPEAKER_19]: That's going to seep into your cannabis,
too, and the cannabis is going to seep
[SPEAKER_19]: into those.
[SPEAKER_19]: You're going to be able to make all these
other herbs, which I need desperately.
[SPEAKER_19]: We're spending $3,000 a month on herbs
alone.
[SPEAKER_19]: It shouldn't be like this, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's a lot of people out there that
really want to do this route, but
[SPEAKER_19]: insurance doesn't cover it.
[SPEAKER_19]: They look at me and go, we might help you
with your rent, but we won't pay for your
[SPEAKER_19]: herbs.
[SPEAKER_19]: We won't pay for your medicine.
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is, I think, something that we
could really talk about and come together
[SPEAKER_19]: as a collective to say, not only are we
going to give the cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_19]: this beautiful plant, the sacred plant,
the medicine that we can get from her,
[SPEAKER_19]: but also all of the other plants that go
with it, that people like me who,
[SPEAKER_19]: this is saving my life.
[SPEAKER_19]: And I take half a gram suppository at
night for my cannabis, and I have no scar
[SPEAKER_19]: tissue.
[SPEAKER_19]: Four months, a 14-inch scar, no scar
tissue, right?
[SPEAKER_19]: That's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think the way to get it into our
society is talk to your local wellness
[SPEAKER_19]: centers.
[SPEAKER_19]: They are really into this.
[SPEAKER_19]: Talk to them about what you have to offer.
[SPEAKER_19]: And maybe then do some lecturing and some
just educating your community on what,
[SPEAKER_19]: because everyone knows somebody who has
cancer.
[SPEAKER_19]: Statistics, one out of two men,
one out of three women in the next year
[SPEAKER_19]: are going to get it.
[SPEAKER_19]: So we really need to talk about this,
because somebody you love is going to get
[SPEAKER_19]: it.
[SPEAKER_19]: And so doing something, like really get
involved with, the other thing I did was
[SPEAKER_19]: my first patient, had breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_19]: She talked to the liaison, who was the
liaison for the eastern and western part
[SPEAKER_19]: of our hospital.
[SPEAKER_19]: We actually had somebody like this.
[SPEAKER_19]: In turn, this woman called me.
[SPEAKER_19]: We sat down and had a conversation.
[SPEAKER_19]: I taught her about regenerative organic
cannabis, because we're in Connecticut,
[SPEAKER_19]: right?
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, the only place you can get
cannabis is in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_19]: And she was like, I don't want to get it
here.
[SPEAKER_19]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_19]: I said, until it's federally, I can't,
even though I was like, don't tell
[SPEAKER_19]: anybody.
[SPEAKER_19]: But talk to your hospital who has an
alternative person.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they really believe me.
[SPEAKER_19]: They've been thinking about this for
years.
[SPEAKER_19]: And they want it to come into the
hospitals.
[SPEAKER_19]: So that, I think, is one of the best ways
we can maybe bridge east and west,
[SPEAKER_19]: so that there's not so much fear.
[SPEAKER_19]: Because as Dr. Russo will tell you,
the doctors, they're doing their job.
[SPEAKER_19]: And if they step out of that box a little
bit, they're going to lose their license.
[SPEAKER_19]: So until the day that they get educated
and maybe say, yeah, go ahead and try
[SPEAKER_19]: that.
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't tell you to do it.
[SPEAKER_19]: But go ahead and do it.
[SPEAKER_19]: Instead of, if you don't make her do
chemo, you're going to kill her.
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is what I would like to see
happen with everyone working with this
[SPEAKER_19]: plant.
[SPEAKER_19]: And get out into your community and talk
to these people who can help you make a
[SPEAKER_19]: difference.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_16]: Real quick, one of the things I'd add to
Pauline's sharing.
[SPEAKER_16]: If you're working with someone and you're
going to provide them cannabis as
[SPEAKER_16]: medicine, make sure you ask them if they
are taking any pharmaceutical drugs.
[SPEAKER_16]: Turns out there's lots of pharmaceutical
drugs that have interactions, some of
[SPEAKER_16]: which are harmful to the end user,
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_16]: And typically, what goes on is those
pharmaceutical drugs do not get broken
[SPEAKER_16]: down and eliminated by our bodies.
[SPEAKER_16]: Particularly CBD slows certain metabolic
pathways.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the position I've taken, instead of
trying to educate myself on all of these
[SPEAKER_16]: different pharmaceutical drugs,
is I tell the person, talk to the doctor
[SPEAKER_16]: who prescribed your medication.
[SPEAKER_16]: And two things happen there.
[SPEAKER_16]: One, the doctor gets to sign off on
whether or not this prescription drug is
[SPEAKER_16]: going to work with the cannabis or not.
[SPEAKER_16]: And two, they're likely to get more
educated about cannabis which I think is a
[SPEAKER_16]: really important thing.
[SPEAKER_16]: Doctors need this education.
[SPEAKER_16]: They need to understand that it's not
scary.
[SPEAKER_16]: That there are potential side effects.
[SPEAKER_16]: But for the most part, the side effects
are nothing compared to pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_16]: drugs.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Valerie couldn't be here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And she has written something that Sarah
is going to read for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is about how, as a collective,
we can get out education to consumers and
[SPEAKER_08]: how we can get medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: And to patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was given the task of representing
Valerie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to be a conduit for her
wisdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I'm reading, I'll maybe jump in and
give a little context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for indulging me and
listening as my lovely friend Sarah Russo
[SPEAKER_00]: represents Wham during this time of
evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can feel the buzz of the hive even 300
miles away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Valerie Corral has worked for decades
in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wham is her collective that started
shortly after the medical law was passed
[SPEAKER_00]: in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're based in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they offer patients free medicine who
are terminally ill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she also does hospice work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's been holding people's hands as
they transition for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she actually gets the opportunity
to do that with her mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why everything cannabis is changing,
the thing that remains is our deepening
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nature reveals pathways to surviving
in such critical time when commercialism
[SPEAKER_00]: threatens to careen out of balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Displacing farmers and businesses
critically abandoning sick and dying
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she reminds us to open and to soften,
to listen more deeply to the earth,
[SPEAKER_00]: to each other's truths that she expands
our consciousness, moves our hearts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and strengthens our resolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: In nature, everything in the forest grows
symbolically, seeking balance
[SPEAKER_00]: interdependent as a necessary part of the
whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: The demand that legalization have brought
forward around are rigorous, revealing
[SPEAKER_00]: that we cannot survive in isolation from
and in competition with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we may thrive in unity, reminding us
that we are a part of something greater
[SPEAKER_00]: than ourselves, serving the plant,
each other, and the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So came the growing pains stretching us to
be creative and us to reframe our work
[SPEAKER_00]: within the context of a B Corp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dedicated the wellness of our members,
clients, our staff, and the environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have created WAM Phytotherapies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a little diagram of her WAM.
[SPEAKER_00]: B corporations are businesses that meet
the highest standards of verified social
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental performance, public
transparency, and legal accountability to
[SPEAKER_00]: balance profit and purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: B Corps are accelerating a global culture
shift to refine success in business and
[SPEAKER_00]: build a more inclusive and sustainable
economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do this in order to provide the highest
standards of service, best quality organic
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, environmentally sound and
modestly priced products, an unsurpassed
[SPEAKER_00]: working environment for our employees,
and compassion cannabis for the neediest
[SPEAKER_00]: members of our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compassionate access, free cannabis
medicine for the needy is taxed as though
[SPEAKER_00]: as being sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this way, we seek means by which to
still provide the same care for the poor
[SPEAKER_00]: as we always have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potential for healing is inherent in
each of us and requires that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: influence and inspire our systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our work focuses on the endogenous
cannabinoid system and the symbiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: interface with the other systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, there is no panacea, no magic
potion or simple solution that cures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why cannabis proves to provide an
extraordinary career to potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And modality for healing is as complex as
each individual and is as interdependent
[SPEAKER_00]: as the systems that reside within all of
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the system, our networks must
also work symbolically to flourish,
[SPEAKER_00]: prosper, and serve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strengthened through our same collective
model for service to everyone,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will have joined forces with an
enchanted network of some of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: storied, experienced, and prolific
producers to create a web of service
[SPEAKER_00]: donating services and products,
taking on the cultivation efforts to serve
[SPEAKER_00]: and carry on our decades-long mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: The financial costs are great to rebuild
within this context, but by joining
[SPEAKER_00]: together to create a small dispensary with
a true community center, bringing the
[SPEAKER_00]: therapists from our community that
supports their work, educational sharing,
[SPEAKER_00]: expanding the framework of healing and
offering many alternative applications as
[SPEAKER_00]: we are able to reemerge as a truly
community-based and interdependent and
[SPEAKER_00]: supportive system focused on helping
people heal themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meeting of the Hive demonstrates the
greatest opportunities arise from sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: our skills and knowledge and enhance our
individual experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are all greater with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to say about Valerie that,
you know, as far as being a part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: movement, she's a foundational key player
in this whole scene and she always reminds
[SPEAKER_00]: us and reminds me of the need to,
first of all, work for the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: more than anything, and each other,
and hold us all in integrity with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that right now it's really
easy to get lost and to feel like while
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing is important and making money
for your livelihood is obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: important, to not lose sight of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's been a lot of people
who've been doing it for as long as she,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, not a lot of people, but the people
that have been doing it for as long as she
[SPEAKER_00]: have, some of them have faced other routes
of success and she just stays true to her
[SPEAKER_00]: integrity and her intentions in her work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and the other, just a personal story I
wanted to share about her.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was 17, I went to my first ICRS
conference and I met Valerie and I smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: Cali weed for the first time and it was
her stuff and it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a definitely different world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got to go see her farm,
so it was the first time I got to see
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis growing and of course it's
beautiful and amazing property and got to
[SPEAKER_00]: be with Valerie for a while and soon after
that happened, they were raided by the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal government.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, they got raided and then
they sued the federal government and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they won.
So,
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're gonna move right along to Martin
Lee and Zoe Sagan.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're a big man and who are going to
discuss with us ideas on how we get the
[SPEAKER_08]: word out that we support plant as medicine
education.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do we do this?
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I love the hive metaphor,
if you will, but I think that this group
[SPEAKER_15]: is more like a school of fish because it
sort of undulates and a hive, it conjures
[SPEAKER_15]: a sense of such efficiency, you know,
that insect, amazing insect intelligence,
[SPEAKER_15]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I didn't say that.
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, School of Fish has these very,
very movable boundaries.
[SPEAKER_15]: It kind of fits more.
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, education.
[SPEAKER_15]: In Project CBD, that's what we are.
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been engaged with this for 10 years
since we were involved in introducing CBD
[SPEAKER_15]: into the medical community in California.
[SPEAKER_15]: In terms of education, I think technically
the word means, in Latin, to lead out.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what does it mean if we're a school of
fish?
[SPEAKER_15]: How do we move the school of fish from
where we are to where we're going?
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's the challenge of education.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's very tricky, very, very tricky.
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure, we can have lots of information.
[SPEAKER_15]: We have lots of information on a website
about a particular minor cannabinoid or
[SPEAKER_15]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's really all really interesting
and important.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think at this point, given what
we've seen transpire over the last 10
[SPEAKER_15]: years, I think we're looking at maybe sort
of raising the stakes a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm reminded of a circle that Wade was at,
Sarah was at about 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_15]: nine years ago.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was right around this time of year.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's either December 2010, January 2011,
where a group of people, it was about two
[SPEAKER_15]: dozen, maybe more, were sitting in a
circle like this.
[SPEAKER_15]: And everybody had some kind of interest or
involvement with CBD, which was very new
[SPEAKER_15]: at the time.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was barely introduced.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was introduced into Northern
California.
[SPEAKER_15]: And everyone went around the room at that
point saying, well, kind of where they're
[SPEAKER_15]: at, what they thought this was all going
to mean, or what it might mean.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I remember very distinctly,
when it was my turn to speak, I emphasized
[SPEAKER_15]: two things.
[SPEAKER_15]: I said that CBD is a social medicine.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not just an individual medicine.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that what we were doing, introducing
it into the community, was a lot like an
[SPEAKER_15]: acupuncturist putting a needle in a body
and turning it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we were going to see what energies
were unleashed from turning that needle.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, the energies that were unleashed
were, well, we're in the midst of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And not all good, obviously.
[SPEAKER_15]: But for Project CBD, because we've
emphasized CBD as a focus of our work,
[SPEAKER_15]: and I should say we've never been involved
in privileging one compound over anything
[SPEAKER_15]: else in the plant, we reject that idea.
[SPEAKER_15]: But always emphasizing the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: But with CBD as an important element,
it was a new thing at the time.
[SPEAKER_15]: So really, the educational challenge was
just ringing the bell like the hunchback
[SPEAKER_15]: of Notre Dame.
[SPEAKER_15]: CBD, CBD, what it is, what it is.
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't have to do that anymore now that
Kim Kardashian is having her CBD-themed
[SPEAKER_15]: baby showers.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what does it mean for us?
[SPEAKER_15]: It means that we actually, all of a
sudden, got a very, very large audience.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just from doing what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And not just in numbers.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, earlier in the year, we were over
a million page views a month at our
[SPEAKER_15]: website.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's gone down quite a bit, because we're
not kissing Google's ring properly,
[SPEAKER_15]: apparently.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's just the way it goes.
[SPEAKER_15]: But one thing that's really striking in
these, just how unusual it is,
[SPEAKER_15]: the difficulties and challenges one faces
within the cannabis industry, as it's now
[SPEAKER_15]: called, or the cannabis community,
as I would prefer to call it.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's just unprecedented things that you
have to deal with from a business point of
[SPEAKER_15]: view that you don't have to deal with in
any other business.
[SPEAKER_15]: And a perfect example, sort of tying
together some of the things we've
[SPEAKER_15]: discussed.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know product makers where they're very
concerned about organic growing and
[SPEAKER_15]: getting good quality flour in.
[SPEAKER_15]: They test the flour.
[SPEAKER_15]: The flour passes.
[SPEAKER_15]: They do a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's always the danger that whatever is
in there, the residues could concentrate
[SPEAKER_15]: to the point of being beyond allowable
limits.
[SPEAKER_15]: They test the oil.
[SPEAKER_15]: The oil is perfect.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they mix it with the chocolate.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they have their chocolate.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then it fails.
[SPEAKER_15]: Why?
[SPEAKER_15]: Because of the cadmium levels in the
chocolate.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you have different standards.
[SPEAKER_15]: The cannabis product makers are actually
held to a higher standard than anyone
[SPEAKER_15]: else.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you think about that.
[SPEAKER_15]: You could say, on the one hand,
it's unfair.
[SPEAKER_15]: But then maybe there's an opportunity
here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we should lift it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Lift the standards up for everybody else
so that the cadmium levels aren't going to
[SPEAKER_15]: be in the chocolate for everybody,
not just for cannabis makers.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's kind of in the spirit of what I
want to introduce in the few moments more
[SPEAKER_15]: I have before I turn it over to Zoe.
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the things we're thinking about at
Project CBD, we actually started,
[SPEAKER_15]: is we put out special reports now and
then.
[SPEAKER_15]: And oftentimes they're on more medical
science related things.
[SPEAKER_15]: We just put out a report on the vaping
crisis where we identified synthetic,
[SPEAKER_15]: so-called synthetic marijuana is really a
key culprit that's being ignored here.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we put out a big report on CBD and THC
drug interactions with pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_15]: We just thought this is something that
would be helpful for physicians.
[SPEAKER_15]: But what we'd like to do is put out a
report on cannabis in the Green New Deal.
[SPEAKER_15]: And while I'm not really fixated on
federal level politics and stuff,
[SPEAKER_15]: there is an invitation that's been put out
by AOC and Bernie Sanders and others
[SPEAKER_15]: saying, we want to hear from local
communities.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're relying on local communities to
drive a Green New Deal.
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's call their bluff.
[SPEAKER_15]: So what we intend to do is both emphasize
some of the best in terms of the
[SPEAKER_15]: experiment that is going on when we think
about cannabis as a laboratory experiment
[SPEAKER_15]: in democracy was how Brandeis,
the great chief justice of all,
[SPEAKER_15]: imagined if we had justices like that
today.
[SPEAKER_15]: The other thing he mentioned that you
can't have democracy and morbid
[SPEAKER_15]: inequality.
[SPEAKER_15]: The two don't go together.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the whole point of the Green New Deal
is to address both the environmental
[SPEAKER_15]: crisis and the crisis of inequality.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that the cannabis,
the best of the cannabis community,
[SPEAKER_15]: as embodied here really in terms of
regenerative agriculture and many other
[SPEAKER_15]: aspects, really has something to offer,
to speak to what has been called for in
[SPEAKER_15]: terms of a Green New Deal.
[SPEAKER_15]: In the same way, I think the cannabis
industry would benefit tremendously if it
[SPEAKER_15]: would embody the ethos of a Green New Deal
because so much of the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_15]: doesn't.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we intend to put out a report that will
examine, we'll look at both sides of it,
[SPEAKER_15]: kind of dispassionately, saying here are
examples of what should be supported
[SPEAKER_15]: beyond even the local level, or that's
what counts most, are the kind of things
[SPEAKER_15]: that if you want to make a Green New Deal
real, well, let's look to what work has
[SPEAKER_15]: been done in the cannabis industry and the
cannabis community that really speaks to
[SPEAKER_15]: that in so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_15]: So to me, being here, listening to what
people are talking about, I can give lots
[SPEAKER_15]: of examples.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just one yesterday jumped out at me.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't sell food and cannabis at a
farmers market.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't sell anything besides cannabis
in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't sell other herbs.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_15]: And given how such a key vector driving
disease process food industry,
[SPEAKER_15]: wouldn't you want people to come out to a
farmers market because they want to get
[SPEAKER_15]: their cannabis and then look at all this
other great food?
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, you want to put the two together.
[SPEAKER_15]: And yet our policies are all wrong in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a state level policy.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think, well, let's lay it out.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, what if you actually had good
policies?
[SPEAKER_15]: What would they really be?
[SPEAKER_15]: So in addition to kind of examining
examples of experiment and examples of
[SPEAKER_15]: problems, also make some recommendations
specifically for what a Green New Deal is,
[SPEAKER_15]: how much it could benefit from cannabis
and how much it needs cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think beyond that, we also want to
do a second report on cannabis and you
[SPEAKER_15]: might call it single payer, Medicare for
all, just the human right of health.
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we always talk about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, if you're taking pharmaceuticals,
then you start taking cannabis,
[SPEAKER_15]: then you take less pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I think that's true.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you hear in states where there is
medical cannabis laws, there's less
[SPEAKER_15]: overdoses from opiates and so forth.
[SPEAKER_15]: It goes down a certain number.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, OK.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you hear some conflicting reports
about that.
[SPEAKER_15]: But let's assume we can arrive at a
number.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, if it's 25 percent less.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, how much does that mean in a state
that you save on funeral costs?
[SPEAKER_15]: And just add all the numbers up in terms
of, well, if you're buying less,
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, what would it really mean to
have cannabis integrated into a health
[SPEAKER_15]: care system?
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, Bernie Sanders has said that he's
open to the idea that it should be covered
[SPEAKER_15]: in insurance.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not here to promote a cow.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I love Bernie, but that's but you
know, this is now being discussed beyond
[SPEAKER_15]: our little circles in ways that people who
are good minded and have influence and may
[SPEAKER_15]: actually be steering the ship to some
degree.
[SPEAKER_15]: Although I think shutter to think if they
get in power, how difficult it will be for
[SPEAKER_15]: them.
[SPEAKER_15]: But so that's that's some of the thoughts
that we have that we'd like to do at
[SPEAKER_15]: Project CBD, pushing it beyond just the
individual healing, which is paramount and
[SPEAKER_15]: the ultimate, of course.
[SPEAKER_15]: But to just try to take it to another
level, because it might be one of those
[SPEAKER_15]: transformative moments as it was 10 years
ago when we're all sitting around kind of
[SPEAKER_15]: just, you know, smoking weed and say,
well, where are we at?
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, we're going to we're going to just let
loose some energies and see what happened.
[SPEAKER_15]: And here we are.
[SPEAKER_15]: So
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to take it in a slightly
different direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Zoe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I work with Martin with Project CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I do a lot of things, but I've been
thinking a lot about the question of
[SPEAKER_05]: education the way the last thing I did
before this was I was the director of
[SPEAKER_05]: education at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's been a lot of talk about
education over the past few days and over
[SPEAKER_05]: the past several years in the cannabis
community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the question really is like,
what do we mean by education?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who are we educating?
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's all sorts of different answers
to this question.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be educating consumers directly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be educating business owners who
are trying to open cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be educating bud tenders.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be educating doctors.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could be educating policy makers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And each one of those groups requires a
different strategy for education.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I don't think that there's a way to
answer how to educate each one of those
[SPEAKER_05]: groups in five minutes, but just know that
there isn't a single strategy that is
[SPEAKER_05]: going to convince all of those different
people that cannabis is a medicine and it
[SPEAKER_05]: should be treated like a medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one of the things I really wanted
to share from my experiences in this
[SPEAKER_05]: field, and this is maybe a little bit
against the grain in this room,
[SPEAKER_05]: is don't be afraid to admit when you don't
know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to where I am by working with
patients and reading all the research and
[SPEAKER_05]: saying, okay, I don't know anything about
science.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's read this paper together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this was done on mice.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is different than humans.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know if this is going to help
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know what the dosage is.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how you're going to approach it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So many people who come in who talk to
you, who talk to all of you, are like,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm dying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Help me.
[SPEAKER_05]: That puts you in a really difficult
position.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also an illegal position,
by the way, to give medical advice to
[SPEAKER_05]: someone without a medical license.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that anyone's enforcing that,
but just so you're aware, it is illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way to help them and to help
change the industry is to try and provide
[SPEAKER_05]: what information is available.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can provide anecdotes.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this helped me in this way,
you know, what Valerie was saying earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a story that she can share because
that was her experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: That does not mean that someone else with
cancer will have that same experience,
[SPEAKER_05]: even if it's the same type of cancer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that, anyway, I'll get off
onto a sidetrack.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, be familiar with the
literature.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be afraid to say that you don't
know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be afraid to do the research.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that it does much more harm to
say, oh, you take 15 milligrams of this
[SPEAKER_05]: for two months, and you'll get better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because what if they don't get better?
[SPEAKER_05]: What if they have a really bad experience?
[SPEAKER_05]: Then they're going to tell all of their
friends that they had a bad experience
[SPEAKER_05]: with cannabis, and none of their friends
are going to try it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is exactly the opposite of what
we want to happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the same is true when working with
medical professionals.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have been working with a group of
doctors at Oregon Health and Sciences
[SPEAKER_05]: University for a couple of years now,
and they're highly skeptical of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't come in and say, this is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: This will cure everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to be incredibly familiar with the
absolute cutting-edge data and come in
[SPEAKER_05]: armed with papers and be like,
OK, you don't trust this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go over these studies together
because that's how you're going to change
[SPEAKER_05]: their mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to figure out what are the
access points for the different groups
[SPEAKER_05]: that you're trying to educate and do that
work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think that the impetus is to be
like, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can cure all of these things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And while it has helped a lot of different
people with a lot of different conditions,
[SPEAKER_05]: it won't help everyone with that
condition.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's the biggest takeaway in
this moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zoe and Martin, you're talking about these
papers and maybe studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a point on your website or a
way that we can get in touch with you so
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can make these papers available to
the whole collective?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's the conditions paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a page on our website.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go to the home page, I think it
says CBD4.
[SPEAKER_05]: And each one of those conditions should
have a section of papers that are related
[SPEAKER_05]: to the study of cannabis in that
particular condition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Personally, I also have a research library
that's a little bit more extensive that
[SPEAKER_05]: should go on the website one day.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you have questions, I have a little
bit more in my personal store.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my email is zoe at projectcbd.org.
[SPEAKER_05]: So feel free to reach out if you have
specific questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I just wanted to say to encourage
everybody, here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hitting that conversation of data.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the ability to start collecting
data.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that we're going to
continue talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can we bigger our own library by
reaching out to collective members and
[SPEAKER_02]: other community members?
[SPEAKER_02]: And Nisha?
[SPEAKER_18]: I would also like to make our website have
all those, too, the Pure Farms website.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you whom I haven't had the
pleasure of meeting, my name is Nisha
[SPEAKER_04]: Whiteley.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have the pleasure of working with
Dr. Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be working with Dale Hunt as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And be happy to send you a paper that
Ethan wrote with Dr. Caroline McCallum
[SPEAKER_04]: from British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is the first dosing article that has
been published in a peer-reviewed medical
[SPEAKER_04]: journal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a fantastic resource that would help
all of you in helping your community.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll get that to you if you guys want
to send that out to everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Ethan, please go ahead.
[SPEAKER_14]: This isn't going to be five minutes.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was asked to talk about things to avoid
in preparations.
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is really a short conversation.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a problem with cannabis
components in general.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because there's almost nothing in there
that's dangerous at conventional doses.
[SPEAKER_14]: Flat-out statement I can defend.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have to think very hard to come up with
things that you should avoid in the plant
[SPEAKER_14]: proper.
[SPEAKER_14]: CBD, as we've heard about, an incredibly
versatile compound.
[SPEAKER_14]: 30 different mechanisms of action.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yet all of them are beneficial.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's hard to figure a side effect of CBD
unless you're talking about a pure
[SPEAKER_14]: preparation at phenomenal doses.
[SPEAKER_14]: There is nothing that CBD does that won't
be better with at least a touch of THC.
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, this is the antithesis of the
way drugs pharmaceuticals are made.
[SPEAKER_14]: Normally the process is, oh, we know the
receptor.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to computer design a molecule
that lodges there with the highest potency
[SPEAKER_14]: and the highest affinity.
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll spend a few hundred million dollars.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then seven years out, we'll find out
that it kills your liver, kills your bone
[SPEAKER_14]: marrow.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we're dealing with something that's
thousands of years old and has had this
[SPEAKER_14]: interchange with humanity for better or
for worse.
[SPEAKER_14]: Our bodies know how to handle this
medicine.
[SPEAKER_14]: There is one component, a terpenoid.
[SPEAKER_14]: When I wrote about this in 2001 with John
McPartland, we listed Pulajone as one of
[SPEAKER_14]: the agents, one of the terpenoids in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: It is potentially toxic.
[SPEAKER_14]: It can have an abortifacient effect at
high doses.
[SPEAKER_14]: It is in Pennyroyal, and Pennyroyal is
something to avoid in pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I have not seen that agent in any of
the analyses I've seen over the last 10
[SPEAKER_14]: years.
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be something to look out for.
[SPEAKER_14]: Chances are it would be in such a trace
amount that it would have no relevance.
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, this plant is very safe,
but how we use it may not be.
[SPEAKER_14]: I am fond of saying outside of primary
treatment of cancer, where big doses are
[SPEAKER_14]: often necessary, that for most medical
conditions, 15 milligrams of THC is
[SPEAKER_14]: usually enough to treat any condition in
conjunction with a whole plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_14]: 30 at the outside.
[SPEAKER_14]: Beyond that, you're usually dealing with
more side effects than benefits.
[SPEAKER_14]: Someone who doesn't respond at that level
is unlikely to gain a lot of benefit at a
[SPEAKER_14]: higher dose.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to take into account things like
tolerance and everything else.
[SPEAKER_14]: But in general, that's a safe place to be.
[SPEAKER_14]: The problem really comes in in
extractions.
[SPEAKER_14]: We heard mention of Rick Simpson oil.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a term I like to avoid because Rick
Simpson is not a professional.
[SPEAKER_14]: He developed an extraction technique using
naptha.
[SPEAKER_14]: Naptha actually isn't one thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a petroleum distillate.
[SPEAKER_14]: But there is no way to safely purge this
entirely from that kind of extraction.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I don't like butane either.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's more efficient at getting some things
out.
[SPEAKER_14]: But in the best of all possible worlds,
where there's plenty of base material,
[SPEAKER_14]: we always need to be going for quality
rather than quantity.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it doesn't matter, should not matter,
you're not getting every last little
[SPEAKER_14]: molecule there.
[SPEAKER_14]: You want the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: In that regard, the cleanest extraction
technique is supercritical CO2 extraction.
[SPEAKER_14]: The problem there is it tends to squander
the important monoturpenoids.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you end up with a concentrate that's
very rich in cannabinoids at the expense
[SPEAKER_14]: of the turpenoids.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that this is a problem.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because of that, as a simple extraction,
I prefer an oil-based extraction like
[SPEAKER_14]: we've heard about, coconut oil,
olive oil, or particularly cold ethanol
[SPEAKER_14]: extraction really will tend to do a better
job in getting material out.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then as we've heard yesterday,
solventless extraction, some of the old
[SPEAKER_14]: style techniques of making hash with
sieving technique, done on high quality
[SPEAKER_14]: material, it's possible to get a
concentration of like 62% THC plus other
[SPEAKER_14]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: One doesn't need 95% THC, such as in dabs.
[SPEAKER_14]: That is not a medical product.
[SPEAKER_14]: That is a product, that's a product for
going extra galactic.
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's really all I wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, we're dealing with very safe
material.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if it's treated with respect and a
little bit of applied science,
[SPEAKER_14]: good things will happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go to,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I know that you've been out in the
industry and you've been talking to all
[SPEAKER_02]: different members of the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the amazing rainbow flag
that you're flying is getting access to
[SPEAKER_02]: patients and helping people that are ill
with this medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is it that we, as a group,
can support your mission or other people's
[SPEAKER_02]: missions that are similar to yours?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Kelly?
[SPEAKER_04]: So she mentioned that I wrote a book.
[SPEAKER_04]: The book is called Chronic Relief,
A Guide to Cannabis for the Terminally and
[SPEAKER_04]: Chronically Ill.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll create a passcode when I get home
next week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you guys want to send it out to
everyone here, I'll offer it at a
[SPEAKER_04]: discount.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's available on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is really how I came to meet
Ethan, was through the writing of that
[SPEAKER_04]: book.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like, A, really understanding
your data is critical.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to be the primary resources for
information, and it's important.
[SPEAKER_04]: That we're giving accurate science-based
information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, where there is an absence of
that, we have to use what we've seen work
[SPEAKER_04]: in our communities and with the people
that we support.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really, the goal with the website,
which is mychronicrelief.com, is to
[SPEAKER_04]: educate people who are new to the topic of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that when people really
understand why and how the components of
[SPEAKER_04]: the cannabis plant work in their bodies,
it becomes so much less scary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've seen this fantastic evolution in
public sentiment about cannabis since
[SPEAKER_04]: Sanjay Gupta did his special about weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now there's CBD sold everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's really opened the
conversation, a much larger, far more
[SPEAKER_04]: important conversation about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis is medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: How and why does it work?
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that it's such a safe,
versatile, and effective component when
[SPEAKER_04]: we're seeing this takeover of human health
from the pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when people are consuming large
amounts of pharmaceuticals, the
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceuticals in and of themselves cause
a whole bunch of other problems that,
[SPEAKER_04]: oddly enough, cannabis helps to
ameliorate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what I endeavor to do with my
passion project, for which I make zero
[SPEAKER_04]: money, is just because it's the right
thing to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is through social media on
mychronicrelief's social sites and the
[SPEAKER_04]: work through the book.
[SPEAKER_04]: And any public speaking engagements is
just to alleviate fear.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the way we do that is by empowering
people with information and helping people
[SPEAKER_04]: understand their body and how it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unfortunate that in grade school and
through our education system, we don't
[SPEAKER_04]: have a better understanding of our bodies
and how they work.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, another challenge is the fact
that there might be, Ethan, what is it,
[SPEAKER_04]: something like 5% of medical schools
actually address the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: system in medical education.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, when we have an interaction
with a physician and we know more about
[SPEAKER_04]: the endocannabinoid system than they do,
or how and why cannabinoids and terpenes
[SPEAKER_04]: work together to alleviate a symptom,
I find that a little scary and sad,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's also an opportunity for us as
people in the cannabis industry to
[SPEAKER_04]: educate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'll really kind of sum it up in
the fact that it's up to us to spread the
[SPEAKER_04]: word about the fact that cannabis is a
safe, versatile, and effective medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And through constantly working to spread
just basic knowledge, we don't have to,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, make people feel like they're
drinking from the fire hose of too much
[SPEAKER_04]: information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a little bit of basic, fact-based
knowledge will empower them to live
[SPEAKER_04]: better, die better, be better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that, you know,
in the grand sense of regenerative
[SPEAKER_04]: farming, that's something that we're all
endeavoring to do in everything that we're
[SPEAKER_04]: doing, whether that's in our personal life
or our professional life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now, Erica Winters and Wendy Minty
speaking about charitable contributions,
[SPEAKER_08]: outreach with cannabis nonprofit groups,
and creating direct lines for producers to
[SPEAKER_08]: donate to patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: May I completely derail that and add one
more health education research resource
[SPEAKER_03]: that will connect both bridges.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many have heard of nationally
registered horticultural therapists in
[SPEAKER_03]: America?
[SPEAKER_03]: Certified horticultural therapists working
towards national registration.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a direct line into the hospitals.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're taking this modality seriously.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone in this room intuitively knows
what horticultural therapy is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Specifically, clinically, this is a
modality to achieve a rainbow of
[SPEAKER_03]: therapeutic goals by using nature-based
activities with every population group on
[SPEAKER_03]: the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hospital administrators are listening to
us right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been approached by several
administrators in the Eugene area about
[SPEAKER_03]: getting horticultural therapy programs
involved with cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, in our code of ethics,
we cannot make medical recommendations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I need the doctors, the endocannabinoid
experts, and be a liaison between the
[SPEAKER_03]: patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're moving in a direction where
insurance is on the table of discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this might be a direct line in.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody's interested in learning about
certification, hit me up over coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not easy, but it's super doable.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that,
[SPEAKER_03]: I am really excited to talk about charity
and outreach.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of my biggest passions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Wendy and I are here on behalf of
Women Leaders in Cannabis, a 501C6 in
[SPEAKER_03]: Eugene, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we all intuitively know that
charity and giving and outreach is epic,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we should all do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to fill the water tanks and pay
the bills, and it's a wonderful vision for
[SPEAKER_03]: next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to talk a little bit more about
the true value of outreach.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe this is so in line with our
mission here at Peer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to start by telling a story.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in a different chapter of my life,
I skateboarded competitively and rode for
[SPEAKER_03]: Tactics Board Shop in Eugene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were starting a petition to build a
skate park.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was my first foray into public policy
and activism.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we collected signatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: We met with the city officials.
[SPEAKER_03]: We built the damn thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is a regional destination skate
park, and we're very proud of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this naive little activist didn't
actually see what was also going on behind
[SPEAKER_03]: the scenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Tactics is getting press releases.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their Facebook likes and followers are
going up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are increasing local retail sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are posting their skateboards and
their tricks internationally.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting larger recognition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of a sudden, they are one of the
largest international distributors for
[SPEAKER_03]: board sports on the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love this model.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I believe that Matt and Bob genuinely
wanted that skate park built for our local
[SPEAKER_03]: skaters?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And their integrity and mission is what
allowed this project to be so successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there are so many different avenues
that we could take when it comes to
[SPEAKER_03]: charity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand deeply that this is a
goal for most of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just a matter of valuing it and
understanding there is a tremendous ROI to
[SPEAKER_03]: your business.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, I want to introduce Wendy,
one of our founding board members for
[SPEAKER_03]: Women Leaders, to talk a little bit more
about how that could fit into your
[SPEAKER_03]: marketing strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something with charitable outreach,
it comes down to our social
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: As businesses in this industry and in any
industry, really, we are here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are doing good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing powerful things for ourselves
and for our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the other hand, what responsibility
do we have to our community, to our
[SPEAKER_01]: partners, to our allies, to give back and
to help support them in the same ways that
[SPEAKER_01]: they ultimately, whether they intended to
or not, have supported us to the point
[SPEAKER_01]: where we are now, to be able to do this,
to operate, to pay taxes, and to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: legally without fear of going to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in this position now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the opportunity to give back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we absolutely should be, based on core
values and mission, but also because it
[SPEAKER_01]: does provide a beautiful opportunity to
get good ROI for our companies and for our
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can be really valuable in the
greater conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Kelly's been driving towards this
whole conversation is thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: internationally and thinking about opening
up new channels for later in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that's so important and
we really need to dig deep and get
[SPEAKER_01]: creative because the reality is we're
still pot farmers and a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_01]: scared to work with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can overcome that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Women Leaders in Cannabis absolutely
has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our very first charitable goal,
we wanted to put together food baskets for
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we tried to partner with Food for Lane
County and a couple different other
[SPEAKER_01]: organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't want our money.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't want our food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it came from the Women Leaders in
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have food.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, people are hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we can't say it came from Cannabis
because we're a federally funded
[SPEAKER_01]: organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We offered that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take our name off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a basket of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it shows up on your doorstep,
are you going to distribute it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a really hard conflict of
interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll find somebody who will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget it then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we fought and we looked and we found
people and organizations like Autism Rocks
[SPEAKER_01]: came to us like, we'll take your money.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so start digging deep and getting
creative and finding these organizations
[SPEAKER_01]: that strategically align with what you
value in your own ethics and work with
[SPEAKER_01]: them to support the greater mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll it'll come about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, you know, huge change
starts with women.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one small step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might be a really rigorous,
obnoxious, frustrating step.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once it starts, you keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really, really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all about mutualism.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as a group, it would be fantastic to
have later discussions to define our
[SPEAKER_03]: charity scope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we just want to work with patients year
one and do something that is manageable?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we want to work with established groups
like Hero Grown who already have direct
[SPEAKER_03]: distribution lines set up in place for
CBD?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm really excited to get together with
anybody who wants to discuss this further,
[SPEAKER_03]: because this is this is how we make the
magic happen together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm so excited to have this platform
to be able to reach everybody who needs
[SPEAKER_03]: this medicine.
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is back here, shoulder tapping me,
and I appreciate it very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that Eric and I have been really
passionate about over the last couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: years through women leaders is partnering
with an organization called Beyond Toxics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have been working so hard to write
some legislation and to implement Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: as a non toxic state.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work really heavily with the land
care acts about how to mitigate the use of
[SPEAKER_01]: toxic pesticides in our city planning and
land care, public land care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are making waves seriously,
seriously.
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that's a big part of this
mission this weekend is I think as a
[SPEAKER_18]: group, we really need to promote that kind
of stuff, because really like the
[SPEAKER_18]: origination of us creating this whole
thing was to save the world and to and to
[SPEAKER_18]: be compassionate care farmers and save the
world.
[SPEAKER_18]: So these types of missions, that's where I
personally and us, that's where we want to
[SPEAKER_18]: put all of our energy behind and behind
the medicine for the people, because
[SPEAKER_18]: really the you'll see us at Emerald Cup
will have two teepees and everyone else
[SPEAKER_18]: will have all this, you know, vinyl signs
and crazy marketing and stuff.
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's just the roots that really
matter.
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just the roots that matter to us.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Erica and I, this is the coolest thing
as the standards that are set for care for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis are not set anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and their whole thing is it is safer
for kids to come running through our
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis farms than it is for their kids
to go run through city parks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have a voice now to say that
this is possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics regenerative practices are
possible in any avenue that we want them
[SPEAKER_01]: to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just need to help people understand
that.
[SPEAKER_18]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're bumping up against so many hard
things all over the place.
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think, you know, being able to find
where we can move around is just is a
[SPEAKER_18]: better thing.
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to turn it over to Sky and
Sierra and they're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_18]: their mission with athletes and what
they've been finding in their touring the
[SPEAKER_18]: world with athletes and how our group
could maybe help you all.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Sky.
[SPEAKER_17]: My partner, Sierra.
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I mountain bike all around the world,
specifically downhill.
[SPEAKER_17]: I go to New Zealand and all over the place
and find that within the athlete world and
[SPEAKER_17]: mountain biking, there's a lot of on
health.
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lot of people kind of going to
races and have a healthy side to them and
[SPEAKER_17]: have a good side.
[SPEAKER_17]: But there's just a lot of
miscommunications and what is actually
[SPEAKER_17]: good and just kind of what you actually
should be taking in with a lot of health
[SPEAKER_06]: products which are really unhealthy are in
the athlete market today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of the nutrition that's put
forward by professional athletes is
[SPEAKER_06]: actually really unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're working towards getting medicine
that can actually help these athletes in a
[SPEAKER_06]: way that's going to make them healthy and
able to perform when they have injuries
[SPEAKER_06]: and need to be competing the next week
rather than taking something that might
[SPEAKER_06]: sustain them for that week.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they'll be down the next.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're trying to get something that is
testing across the boards low enough that
[SPEAKER_06]: athletes don't have to be worried about
coming up hot or having issues because
[SPEAKER_06]: that's the biggest fear with cannabis and
athletes right now.
[SPEAKER_17]: CBD is something that is not really talked
about within the mountain biking
[SPEAKER_17]: community.
[SPEAKER_17]: It was actually just opened up by the UCI
which is a federation that is in France
[SPEAKER_17]: and basically runs all mountain biking and
any biking industry of any sort.
[SPEAKER_17]: They have made THC and CBD and all these
cannabinoids totally illegal to use by any
[SPEAKER_17]: athletes.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it just makes it a little bit harder
to be able to go around and do your
[SPEAKER_17]: everyday sport without having the support
of the plants around you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Even beyond the CBD side we also want to
open up all the herbs that we have access
[SPEAKER_17]: to and all the amazing medicinal compounds
with those and just open up a discussion
[SPEAKER_17]: with CBD and natural resources that the
earth has to offer us and just kind of
[SPEAKER_17]: going back in time and going back hundreds
of centuries back to where our roots have
[SPEAKER_17]: always been.
[SPEAKER_17]: To create an ultimate health because
within the mountain biking and within all
[SPEAKER_17]: these industries there's a lot of energy
drinks and all that that really don't give
[SPEAKER_17]: you that good of a feeling.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean they might give you some energy but
let's be honest it's not a good way to
[SPEAKER_17]: sustain your athletic abilities.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah just trying to create a discussion of
health and creating an option and a place
[SPEAKER_17]: for people to come to to be able to get
all the information that they need and all
[SPEAKER_17]: of the products that they need as well.
[SPEAKER_17]: Because when it comes down to it people
don't know what to look for.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also want to say that athletes always
are inspiration to kids and kids look up
[SPEAKER_06]: to athletes forever.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'd be really great if we can have
some health and wellness to help propel
[SPEAKER_06]: those athletes so that our children who
are in regular school systems can be
[SPEAKER_06]: seeing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's something I'd really like to
see.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're working for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think our last speaker for this
session is going to be Zoe again is going
[SPEAKER_08]: to speak about the CBD new FDA regulations
and claims how to navigate the market and
[SPEAKER_08]: keep your CBD products on the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super easy topic to talk about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah cool cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to start this whole thing
with I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is not legal advice.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that being said I have read all of the
FDA regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: I testified in front of the FDA about CBD
and cannabis regulation in May.
[SPEAKER_05]: We submitted 300 pages of comments to the
FDA about regulating CBD and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you know two weeks ago they came
out and they said it is illegal to put CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: in food.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't label anything any CBD product
as a supplement and they don't think that
[SPEAKER_05]: it's safe for human or animal consumption.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah that's fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah so so enforcement of that is going to
be an issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that that's maybe in all of our
benefits because you know this industry is
[SPEAKER_05]: massive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And only going to get bigger.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's anyone's guess as to
what's actually going to happen in the
[SPEAKER_05]: legal side of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the DA decides that they're going to go
after everyone I mean like they could.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they probably not.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean like we're in a moment of deep
uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question really is like what do we
do from here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the answer is like as much as
it sucks and all of us in this room don't
[SPEAKER_05]: actually believe that it will work is
reach out to your congresspeople.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure that your legislators are
actually educated about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean like when I was talking to the PAC
in Portland that some of my friends are
[SPEAKER_05]: involved in and I heard what they were
like I can't afford to go to D.C.
[SPEAKER_05]: and do that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I heard what they were talking about
when they went to D.C.
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was only the banking act.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing they were talking about to
legislators in D.C.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super important.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also need to be talking about how to
put pressure on the FDA.
[SPEAKER_05]: To regulate CBD and cannabis in a way that
makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of the things that I did and
actually I was talking to Eleanor the
[SPEAKER_05]: other day which she should probably also
be involved in this conversation was read
[SPEAKER_05]: all of not all of but a lot of data and
information about how herbal medicines are
[SPEAKER_05]: regulated globally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so currently man how to do this in
five minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: The FDA regulates.
[SPEAKER_05]: Food and drugs and those are the two
categories that there are regulatory
[SPEAKER_05]: structures for.
[SPEAKER_05]: So drugs are pharmaceutical drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have like the whole pharmaceutical
process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every drug has to go through clinical
trials show efficacy theoretically.
[SPEAKER_05]: And food is its own category.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's all these sort of safety and
quality issues that come up with food.
[SPEAKER_05]: Supplements are considered food products.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're considered a subcategory of food
and the supplement industry is deeply
[SPEAKER_05]: problematic in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: The regulations governing supplements are
minimal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think a lot of people a lot of
corporate players in this scene would love
[SPEAKER_05]: to see cannabis regulated as a supplement.
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately I don't agree with that
regulatory structure because I don't think
[SPEAKER_05]: that they have the infrastructure to test
for purity and potency.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that that's like those are my
concerns.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when you deal with patients who need
to make sure that the products that
[SPEAKER_05]: they're taking is actually the product and
not only that like that they aren't taking
[SPEAKER_05]: pesticides or heavy metals which cannabis
is super great at like pulling from the
[SPEAKER_05]: soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to actually have a testing
infrastructure which the supplement
[SPEAKER_05]: industry doesn't formally have through the
federal government.
[SPEAKER_05]: Although there are third party testing
agencies for the supplement industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a mess.
[SPEAKER_05]: I came up with like a theoretical
regulatory structure for the regulation of
[SPEAKER_05]: traditional herbal medicinal products
which would be another category of
[SPEAKER_05]: regulation that would ensure purity and
potency.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like those are just the tests.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a lot of differing opinions on
how to regulate CBD and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think like as far as you are
concerned trying to educate your
[SPEAKER_05]: regulators on what it is and what it can
do its safety.
[SPEAKER_05]: Continuing to provide data to the people
who can make decisions about some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: things the FDA has said which is like it's
not safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well okay we've got all these studies
showing that it is safe.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then asking them to like come out and
regulate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean I think Martin and I have talked a
little bit about this which is like it's
[SPEAKER_05]: possible the FDA is sort of sidestepping a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: They would really love to not have to deal
with this issue because it's a massive
[SPEAKER_05]: industry and they don't have money.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like when I dug into how much
what their budget was to regulate the 32
[SPEAKER_05]: billion dollar supplement industry last
year it was twenty three million dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like where are they going to get the
budget to regulate the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't really know if there are
solutions yet but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: learning going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think like it is important to be
familiar with what's going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just please please please don't be
afraid of talking to your representatives
[SPEAKER_05]: and congresspeople.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know it's a pain in the butt and it
feels like you're not getting anywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like maybe that's true because we
don't really live in a democracy but like
[SPEAKER_05]: it's still worth trying because that's
where we are.
[SPEAKER_05]: We still have the opportunity to do this
right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of ways to do it wrong.
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah my feelings ignore the FDA.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean all they did was just say what
they're they didn't change anything with
[SPEAKER_15]: this statement.
[SPEAKER_15]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_15]: They basically said we're not going to
change.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yeah very briefly there are two ways
that you can be sure to run a foul of the
[SPEAKER_14]: FDA.
[SPEAKER_14]: One is to make a specific disease claim.
[SPEAKER_14]: That my preparation could cure cancer
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_14]: You will be in trouble with them.
[SPEAKER_14]: And the other is to have a
misrepresentation of the analysis of your
[SPEAKER_14]: product.
[SPEAKER_14]: If there is not the amount that should be
in there or too much compared to what
[SPEAKER_14]: should be in there and someone complains
you'll be in trouble.
[SPEAKER_14]: Beyond that I don't think they have the
bandwidth to deal with this industry right
[SPEAKER_14]: now.
[SPEAKER_14]: And Zoe was exactly right.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're sidestepping.
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't have the time money or
interest.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so it was a holding action at best.
[SPEAKER_14]: But avoid those two things and hopefully
you'll stay out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I make a comment?
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the most coming into the industry I
went to a science meeting and somebody
[SPEAKER_10]: explained the reason why nobody has ever
had a fatal overdose from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I knew that was true but I didn't know
why.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ethan can clean up the details of what I
tell you.
[SPEAKER_10]: But this is basically true.
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason that people die from a drug
overdose usually is because their brain
[SPEAKER_10]: stem shuts down.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it makes them stop breathing or makes
their heart stop beating or makes their
[SPEAKER_10]: brain stop functioning.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the brain stem is loaded with opioid
receptors or opiate receptors or whatever
[SPEAKER_10]: they're called.
[SPEAKER_10]: There are no cannabinoid receptors in the
brain stem.
[SPEAKER_10]: So no matter how much you get loaded up,
you won't die.
[SPEAKER_10]: And nobody ever has.
[SPEAKER_10]: When somebody thinks maybe one person died
it's big news, which proves the point.
[SPEAKER_10]: So as you're communicating with your
constituents, your congressman,
[SPEAKER_10]: whatever, congressperson, make sure that
you have just enough facts.
[SPEAKER_10]: Ethan will clean this up like I said.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a reason why no one has ever
overdosed, which is why the whole approach
[SPEAKER_10]: to regulating this as a dangerous drug is
messed up from the start.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want to clean that up for me?
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, can you paraphrase that in your
own medical words?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what Dale said was exactly right.
[SPEAKER_14]: There are scattered cannabinoid receptors
in the brain stem but not in the centers
[SPEAKER_14]: that subserve respiration.
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, so as he said, the mu-opioid
receptor, too much heroin, you stop
[SPEAKER_14]: breathing and you die because of that.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not because it's actually killing any
organ in the body.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's putting your brain to sleep and
you forget to breathe.
[SPEAKER_14]: And cannabis cannot do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: It just doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that wasn't a lot of cleaning up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to add one thing to the list
of no-nos for the FDA.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is definitely unsubstantiated medical
claims on your packaging is number one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Incorrect dosage on a package.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the other one is unsubstantiated label
claims based on ingredient content.
[SPEAKER_07]: That will hit you almost harder than if
you have the wrong amount of milligrams of
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Teracicum or calendula.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not having the appropriate species on your
label, they will ding you for.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's one thing everyone should start
to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: As things become more normalized and our
products become taken out of the
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensary proper and maybe are sitting in
an apothecary or a normal drug store,
[SPEAKER_07]: if your label claims, if you say you have
lavender in there, you better have
[SPEAKER_07]: lavender in there and there better not be
anything else in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are exceptionally important to
the FDA.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we have a very healthy disagreement
about the regulation of natural products.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're heavily regulated.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the landscape I work in, I consult with
a lot of individuals.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am a third party tester for botanical
identity because if you don't have those
[SPEAKER_07]: label claims correct, my clients get sued
and they get their products pulled from
[SPEAKER_07]: shelves and it's hundreds of thousands of
dollars of fixing that issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you really want to say a breast to
the FDA issue, one of the best
[SPEAKER_07]: organizations that I would encourage all
of you to at least look at them,
[SPEAKER_07]: if not become an active member is APA.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the American Herbal Products
Association.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the largest trade association that is
an advocate for natural products,
[SPEAKER_07]: supplements and natural medicines.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they deal not only in the national
scale, but the international scale and
[SPEAKER_07]: they're a really great resource.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if you want digested commentary about
what the FDA's put out, what's happening
[SPEAKER_07]: with the DEA with various aspects of
cannabis and CBD, they're an exceptional
[SPEAKER_07]: resource and they do amazing advocacy.
[SPEAKER_07]: They also have a cannabis committee,
which I'm a member of, which everyone
[SPEAKER_07]: should be a part of.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an open committee.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your opinions are really important because
they really have access to the government
[SPEAKER_07]: in a way that most of our small
organizations can never have that kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: access.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's APA, so American Herbal Products
Association.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so they do a lot of work and they do
a lot of work with the other plants,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So when Comfrey was banned basically for
use, they did a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they support us as herbalists and as
community healers in ways that are outside
[SPEAKER_07]: the normal work we do within our own
communities.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I would really encourage you to
check them out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_18]: One thing, just really quickly with it,
Sky and Sierra didn't say was that they
[SPEAKER_18]: created the DEM Pure Athlete Collective,
which is new and it is coming out.
And if you want to say anything else,
go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just that Sky is a professional mountain
biker.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, we do work with a lot of mountain
bikers, but it is open to all athletes of
[SPEAKER_06]: every sport.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's all.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
Thank you.
