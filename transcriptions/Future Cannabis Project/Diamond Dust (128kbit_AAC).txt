[SPEAKER_01]: Your babies which are your genetics that
you've read can you talk about kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like What you've read where you got like
the parents from why you love it how it
[SPEAKER_01]: grows how it smokes Right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of your favorite?
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite my favorite is the diamond
dust the diamond dust was a So I actually
[SPEAKER_00]: created something called the Holmes matrix
because I'm a math guy actually that's my
[SPEAKER_00]: background So I create a matrix that you
could use To help you make selections
[SPEAKER_00]: based on terpene profiles because when you
start to look at terpene profiles And you
[SPEAKER_00]: look at 40 terpenes per variety Okay,
I know kind of what the smell is but how
[SPEAKER_00]: do I compare all these varieties and make
a choice as a breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the the Holmes matrix or
something I just created is an algorithm
[SPEAKER_00]: type in all the terpene profiles and give
you Points into the direction of a choice
[SPEAKER_00]: that suits you sure Like as a consumer as
a as a breeder as a breeder like what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for and I'm using the consumer
also as like You know, I'm developing
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties for consumers as a cultivator
But not like this is your not like for
[SPEAKER_02]: like a not like for like a medical
diagnosis like more for like It's like
[SPEAKER_00]: what experience you're looking for what
experience and you know a lot of times
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a medical kind of experience But
yeah, I mean, it's just whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer wants us to develop something
that they like and it's yeah, it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: Relaxing it could be sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are there's certain terpene profiles
It seems are geared towards those in the
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at those types of things So
but in terms of over of a variety that I
[SPEAKER_00]: developed The diamond dust is one of my
favorites because it's the first drain
[SPEAKER_00]: that I really got to use that That
algorithm that helped point me in the
[SPEAKER_00]: right direction on the terpene side,
but it's essentially a double dream lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: haze bubblegum hybrid with sour And it
just it happened to be right in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like between like that really heavy
baba kind of sedative effect and the
[SPEAKER_00]: really kind of like uplifting sativa
really balanced hybrid right in the middle
[SPEAKER_00]: and It's beautiful in terms of like the
structure It has like really high
[SPEAKER_00]: trichrome production and it's a good
yielder and it's real vigorous in
[SPEAKER_00]: production and the effect is really
balanced So it kind of has all the
[SPEAKER_00]: trifecta Terpene has the effect has the
aesthetic And it's been a great variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're running it in production and
everybody loves it That's my favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the terpene like?
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpene profile is um, it's kind of
like a sweet baba But it it's mainly
[SPEAKER_00]: limonene, teriophiline, myrc like most
drains But it has a little bit of a funk
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like a sweet funk The funny thing is
it's kind of like, you know, breeding is
[SPEAKER_00]: like a long-term project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only like one step Yeah, they get to
react to get to like where you want to go
[SPEAKER_00]: the intention of developing diamond dust
Which diamond dust is just one step in
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the progression of getting there
I've always wanted to develop an OG terp
[SPEAKER_00]: profile a variety that's not really Just
because like that that that terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile is so amazing ROG and the effects
are amazing But it's just been inbred for
[SPEAKER_00]: so long the structure is bad and sure
yields are bad So trying to keep that same
[SPEAKER_00]: term start fresh start fresh going in a
different direction You know land races,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever we need to create a new
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more vigorous, you know,
that's less prone to dudding And still
[SPEAKER_00]: have that terp profile that EOG has And
being from LA that's obviously OG is
[SPEAKER_00]: historic, you know So that's that was kind
of the goal of the diamond dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diamond dust isn't quite that but
that's kind of what Motivated the
[SPEAKER_01]: development of diamond dust And who's been
breeding some stuff that you either want
[SPEAKER_01]: to play with or that you have been playing
with?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of great breeders I love CSI
Humble, Capulator Compound Genetics I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: too many to name.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of great breeders doing
great work But unfortunately, I only have
[SPEAKER_00]: so much canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had you know million square feet
just to do phenotype That's what it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: to get to the next level really it's all
about numbers, you know But we're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to be as smart as we can with without the
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really all we can do at this point
It's you know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that it's actually part
of my talk tomorrow There's this thought
[SPEAKER_02]: by some folks in the industry Like oh,
we just need like new molecular genomics
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff like that to like, you know
laser in on this thing It's actually like
[SPEAKER_02]: what actually what's most important to
breeding is like looking at a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants Yeah, it's like it's probably the
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probability, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's only so many phenotypes or
traits if you do the math on traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could calculate out how many varieties
you have to grow to find the variety
[SPEAKER_02]: that's all the exact things that you want
Yeah, I was trying to I was telling
[SPEAKER_02]: someone this might not be the most artful
way of saying Yeah, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know breeding is all about how big
does your fun?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does your funnel start out and like how
effective are you at selecting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's that's like the slope of your
phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and there's some I wish I can't
remember the equation but there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: equation to calculate like the probability
of varieties you have to run to find the
[SPEAKER_00]: variety that has an amount of specific
traits, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You might know it but that's kind of what
we're looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to plug the end in
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the name of your Like what you're
reading that you like Oh diamond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so with diamond dust was it just like
happenstance or was like Did you just pop
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of seeds and it happened you hit
on something that was a winner or Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean starting with good parents is
always important, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know as a breeder, you're always
standing on the shoulders of Giants,
[SPEAKER_00]: right and that's all science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean There's guys have been doing work
for 30 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to start with good parents But
then it's you know, we just said you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow tons of numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some luck involved It's being
smart as you can with what numbers you're
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed to run But at this stage when you
can't run five million plants if there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of luck But that's like what's
so amazing to me about the breeding that's
[SPEAKER_02]: been done in the space like, you know
folks that are like Some folks that are
[SPEAKER_02]: like Helicoptering into the space now,
like their perspective is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh the breeding is so like amateur and
we're gonna displace it all And I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: actually like so impressed with But like
I'm like so impressed with the work that
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders have done so far because it's
like You take these folks that have like
[SPEAKER_02]: always been working under like super
limited resources Super limited scale
[SPEAKER_02]: right like and and they've been like super
resourceful, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Super innovative super creative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that's what like to me I look at
that I'm like if you if you take that work
[SPEAKER_02]: and you multiply it by a million like
what's gonna happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, it's gonna be it's gonna knock
our socks off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the guys coming in go through a
helicopter
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the folks that have taken us to where
we're at today But with the diamond dust
[SPEAKER_01]: did you go through iterations where you're
like it's close But it's not there and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you kept kind of like tweaking it
iteratively it was actually the reverse I
[SPEAKER_00]: was excited about the grass and I knew it
had really good parents and You know
[SPEAKER_00]: putting the turkey profiles of the parents
through the matrix I was like really
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about kind of the the offspring
and then Like the first, you know 20 seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran I found something amazing and then I
was like shit I gotta go back to that set
[SPEAKER_00]: of Seeds and keep running more and I've
been running more and more and more You
[SPEAKER_00]: know hundreds and now it's like that one's
still the best So it's a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: luck you talked about probability,
you know run lots of plants But I mean you
[SPEAKER_00]: could run a million plants in The first
thousand you find the best one out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: million or it could be you know,
nine hundred thousand and fifty eight So
[SPEAKER_00]: you just you just never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but you know, I was able to like
also like you could look at a billion
[SPEAKER_02]: plants And if you don't know what you're
looking for, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're never gonna find it's a great one
Yeah, selection is also important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's where you know readers
experience comes in kind of know what how
[SPEAKER_00]: to Select how do you select parents?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it crucial aspect?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I mean with that experience
that like intuition Yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's so it's irreplaceable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you see guys like choosing these big
Easter coal It's a biomass producer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not you know producing Right,
so it just depends also on what the use is
[SPEAKER_00]: to be at the selection of the readers
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about what do you think
about seats As a production system,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we're obviously a Little too
early to use seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a full production system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think for outdoor For kind of like
large-scale extraction, I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really smart
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason you don't is because you
don't that's you don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: consistency That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, you know, like we're
launching a branded package company
[SPEAKER_00]: products flower pre-rolls whatever babes
those products have to be consistent,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know when you have Thousand seeds you
run them and produce flour that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna package and it's all way different
And that's really kind of where the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: game is now you buy packs of season to run
the varieties There's too much variability
[SPEAKER_00]: because it takes a lot of numbers and a
lot of generations to get to
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you you and I talked before about
and we won't name names but well-known
[SPEAKER_01]: California indoor cultivators that you
respect Who when you try their product
[SPEAKER_01]: from the retail shelves is not consistent
and they're probably cloning So like what
[SPEAKER_01]: do you attribute that to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think part of it is scale, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you have guys that are Been growing
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a really good job of producing
product And then the demand gets so high
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like you have to start sourcing out
to other cultivators and then you have
[SPEAKER_00]: different people in different areas with
different facilities growing the product
[SPEAKER_00]: same genetics, but the environmental
differences You know the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: differences the lighting just these little
differences, especially indoors make a big
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in the quality So I think it
just it's more of like It's a combination
[SPEAKER_00]: of several factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you know, maybe a high demand,
you know Facility design is different the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators different the formulations of
the nutrients are using are different all
[SPEAKER_00]: those things affect the consistency of the
product but There's just not enough
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge of indoor cultivation yet in
terms of environment and stability and
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting We're barely starting to measure
those things and how they contribute to
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency But I mean there's just that
just how it is Facilities are different
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rooms are generating different types of
product You You You You You You You
