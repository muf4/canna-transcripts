[SPEAKER_03]: Please welcome Dr. Pierre Jafois.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm delighted to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truly it's a wonderful city.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really grateful that I did take a taxi
this morning to get here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the same page as you are with the
homelessness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tragic to see and I'm really
delighted that you're trying so hard to do
[SPEAKER_00]: something about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a real eye-opener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to say that we don't have the same
problem in Canada, but of course the snow
[SPEAKER_00]: and the cold does make it slightly
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also proud to be here because I guess,
who's the basketball guys here or ladies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody follow basketball here?
[SPEAKER_00]: No?
[SPEAKER_00]: So our star guy from the Raptors is here
now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too happy about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really quite a shame.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm here for the next 25-30 minutes to
share with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to share with you my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, in Canada we just recently
legalized it both for recreational as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as for medical purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried before and we had in 2001
regulations that led to some abuse of the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations in terms of growing and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then they changed it and the new
regulations didn't allow for personal
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally in 2016, I think we
finally got it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of what I'm going to present to
you today is an offshoot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the work that I do is in nursing
homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, even though cannabis for
medical use is legal in Canada since 2016,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can expect in nursing homes,
policies had to be built around the use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the data I have to present to you is
limited on account of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nevertheless, I think it speaks
volumes about where we're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it became an open field,
shall we say, the number of LPs has grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I have here 194.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think recently it's actually 196.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's spread across the country,
which is kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you'll see, it's spread through
mostly British Columbia and Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Albertans, I think, are
discovering a new sort of oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis oil, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're into oil.
Anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the LPs are at various stages of
approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some haven't yet built and some are
actually producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Canada, the federal government and
Health Canada have played a very important
[SPEAKER_00]: role in trying to get this moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it speaks volumes and I'm really
quite proud of the Canadian government and
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go to their site, you'll see
that there's a load of information there,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is very useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to speak to you about that for
just a few seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you click on their site here,
Getting Cannabis for Medical Purposes and
[SPEAKER_00]: or Prescribing Cannabis to Patients,
you see that there's a lot of information
[SPEAKER_00]: for health care professionals,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a really positive step.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal government is actually out
there providing guidance to physicians and
[SPEAKER_00]: other health care professionals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to focus, however, on what it says
below here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's a bit of a disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is not an approved therapeutic
product, which it's not, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a therapeutic product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless a specific cannabis product has
been issued a DIN, a drug information
[SPEAKER_00]: number, and a notice of compliance,
then it's not a therapeutic product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The provision of this information should
not be interpreted as endorsement of the
[SPEAKER_00]: use of this product or cannabis and
cannabinoids, generally by Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a bit of a disclaimer,
but the reality is they're really there to
[SPEAKER_00]: support physicians, health care workers,
and patients alike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you dig a little further and you go
to information, a summary of the essential
[SPEAKER_00]: information about the use, you'll see a
lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm very interested in is this
list here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Health Canada actually has a list of
possible therapeutic areas for the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to focus on a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So number one, palliative care and quality
of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you heard earlier, I went through a
number of phases in my life going from
[SPEAKER_00]: emergency medicine all the way to
geriatric medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, I spend a lot of my time now
looking after people, trying to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that their last days are comfortable and
that I can provide to them the most
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of care as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I find I'm having the
most success with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really delights me to see this at
the top of the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we've heard about epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you a little bit about some
experience I've had with multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: sclerosis pain I'm interested in,
particularly chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the psychiatric disorders,
particularly anxiety, sleep, and
[SPEAKER_00]: Alzheimer's is what I'm going to be
talking to you about the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could talk to you about
everything here, but unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't quite have all that experience
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do also want to point out that no list
would be complete, at least not from
[SPEAKER_00]: Health Canada, if it didn't have a few
warnings and if it didn't talk a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit about adverse effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Canada, not everybody's on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the site of the Royal
College, which is the site for the
[SPEAKER_00]: specialists, you'll find that if you click
on cannabis for medical use, click,
[SPEAKER_00]: it actually gets you right back to Health
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just saying mum.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not saying anything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The College of Physicians, the Canadian
College of Family Physicians rather,
[SPEAKER_00]: has stepped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've published guidelines a year or two
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, their view is very
cautious, shall we say.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, they say the evidence indicates
the most consistent effects of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids are adverse events.
[SPEAKER_00]: A variety of adverse events have a greater
magnitude of effect than the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits for the conditions targeted,
which is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The conclusions drawn by this analysis are
not surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Study after study, which is not true,
because there isn't study after study,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I'll show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Analysis after analysis and review after
review have all reported the same
[SPEAKER_00]: findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has little place within current
therapeutic arsenals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I beg to defer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, and this is really one of
my key messages, is we need the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really need good clinical research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving south of the border to the
National Academies of Sciences and
[SPEAKER_00]: Engineering and Medicine, it's quite the
same cautionary tale, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they say here, despite increased
cannabis use and changing state level
[SPEAKER_00]: policy landscape, conclusive evidence
regarding the short and long term health
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, both harms and benefits of
cannabis use remains elusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for those people who, like myself,
are currently using it, prescribing it to
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, there's very little doubt of the
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it's just not proven the
way that we would like to see it proven
[SPEAKER_00]: for products that are currently marketed,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so there's this guy,
Plato, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said the mind is a chariot steered
by reason but pulled by passions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in keeping with the Hippocratic oath,
I strongly believe that I have to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: my patients with those things that are
available to them that will help them in
[SPEAKER_00]: their suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is that a more modern physician
said, prescribing medical cannabis should
[SPEAKER_00]: be steered by clinical science and pulled
by patients' needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, or fortunately rather,
the patient's needs are there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think the science is still lacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm hoping that after today,
you'll all be convinced that we need to go
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to push the institution's private
public to get out there and give us more
[SPEAKER_00]: research and really to fund the research
that needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so in the elderly, what have I been
doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've been looking after patients,
and I'll tell you a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: dementia in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been looking after elderly
patients who suffer from insomnia,
[SPEAKER_00]: agitation in dementia, which I'll talk to
you a bit more, anxiety, pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: So show me the evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about what I was able to find
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I think it's important to
understand what the constraints are on
[SPEAKER_00]: doing clinical research, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So need I say more about that first
heading?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's limited funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not because the money's not out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just who wishes to use that money for
clinical research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very poor standardization of product,
and I'll show you what I mean by that in
[SPEAKER_00]: just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Questionable compliance of subjects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to do a clinical trial in
somebody with cannabis if at home they're
[SPEAKER_00]: also smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So compliance is a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of confounders that are
difficult to control, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not just age and gender,
but there's comorbidities.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other medications.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's activities and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good research takes into account the
confounders that we need to look after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Searching for an indication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I mean, I think that you saw that
list from Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an awful lot of possibility,
but I think we're going to have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: really systematic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we shouldn't be funding
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to drill down trying to
see what we think as a society are the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest needs, prioritize, and move down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is in searching for an
indication, when you do clinical research,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to say, what is my outcome
measure?
[SPEAKER_00]: What difference am I trying to show?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not enough to say that people felt
better, and I think that's, to a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: extent, been the problem so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: A choice of control arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to do the research compared
to a pharmaceutical, or is it to a
[SPEAKER_00]: placebo, et cetera, et cetera,
the standard of care?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said just a minute ago,
we really do need validated outcome tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we studying?
[SPEAKER_00]: What outcomes do we want to look at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me talk a little bit about
Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parkinson's disease is very interesting
because the CB1 receptors are very dense
[SPEAKER_00]: in the basal ganglia, which is where the
substantia nigra is, which is where the
[SPEAKER_00]: disease of Parkinson's is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's very interesting to see that
all those receptors are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is some suggestion that the CB1
agonists attenuate the levodopa-induced
[SPEAKER_00]: dyskinesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So levodopa is a medication that's given
to patients with Parkinson's disease to
[SPEAKER_00]: relieve their symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to date, I've only been able to find
one study from 2004 that actually looked
[SPEAKER_00]: at that, and their study was frankly not
conclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think more work needs to be done in
that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the patients that I've been
treating with Parkinson's all have,
[SPEAKER_00]: are all taking levodopa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seen some studies, and I'll show
you some of those, that show an efficacy
[SPEAKER_00]: in Parkinson's disease in treating some of
the symptoms of tremor, rigidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and bradykinesia, which is that slow
movement that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some question as to whether or
not cannabis might not have
[SPEAKER_00]: neuroprotective effects via an antioxidant
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, very difficult to really pinpoint
where they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're out there, they're not in the
traditional literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that Israel, for instance,
has a lot of programs ongoing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but trying to get your hands on some of
that literature is very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a study that appeared in the
Journal of Psychopharmacology by Chagas in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked at 21 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They compared, I think they had two
patients on placebo versus 75 milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: of CBD or 300 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: The patients were treated for six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found no effect on the symptoms of
Parkinson's, but on quality of life
[SPEAKER_00]: questionnaires, they found quite a
significant difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay, you weren't able to treat the
symptoms, but you did improve the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of life, which is important, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's an important finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, sorry, it's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it was just the 300.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Lhotan, again, in 2014 in the
clinical neuropharmacology, they looked at
[SPEAKER_00]: 22 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was smoked cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 30 minutes later, they saw improved
rigidity, tremor, and bradykinesia,
[SPEAKER_00]: which lasted for up to three hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they were, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so that's a very good example of
what I mean by looking at outcomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're actually not able to cure
something, but if we're able to decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of medications that people are
taking, particularly in Parkinson's,
[SPEAKER_00]: where tolerance to the medication
currently out there builds and ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes less and less effective,
it'd be really nice to be able to reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: how much they take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, big time, big time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big, big time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're totally right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see right here that there's a
bit of a problem, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're talking about research here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're talking about giving CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we're talking about cannabis smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at 30 minutes rather than
six weeks out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's one of the problems
right now with some of the research is I
[SPEAKER_00]: think we're going to have to get it down
and see where we want to go with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't answer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's asking what the cannabis was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it flour or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it was detailed in there,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I think that speaks to the
issue that I have with the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not consistent, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so BPSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's familiar with BPSD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I always forget what BPSD stands
for because I use the term BPSD so much
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just use the acronym.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's behavioral psychological symptoms
of dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the patient population that I'm
treating, this is a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are currently giving what I consider to
be highly toxic drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody here has heard about
antipsychotics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that we're giving either
antipsychotics or benzodiazepines or other
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs that change the behavior of patients
suffering from dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are toxic substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if nothing else, if we can
find something that we can give to them
[SPEAKER_00]: that decreases some of the symptoms and
that is less toxic, why not, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't, but it's preferable not to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes you really... Yeah,
if they're having hallucinations and so on
[SPEAKER_00]: sooner or later, you do have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly when you're giving cannabis,
you don't want to increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: hallucinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a study in 2016 in the Journal of
Alzheimer's Disease, there was an open
[SPEAKER_00]: label add-on which means that whatever
they were on, we added the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 11 patients with dementia and
they receive daily cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the findings were interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, when you're talking about
just 11 patients, there's just no power.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is really more or less an
observational study, which is very much
[SPEAKER_00]: like what I'm going to show you that I've
been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in another study in 2017,
of course, this is using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's using products that are already
marketed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the studies are very small,
but it does seem like THC was able to
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease the severity of disturbed
behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found this one interesting because
this is a big issue, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sundowning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So later in the day, the symptoms become
far worse and it would appear that there
[SPEAKER_00]: may be some effect in nighttime agitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge study, two patients, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what about sleep?
[SPEAKER_00]: So sleep and anxiety are two of,
I think, my favorite indications for using
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sleep disturbances, as you know,
are very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just in the elderly, though as we
grow older, it does become more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But up to 70 million Americans are
actually affected with sleep disturbances
[SPEAKER_00]: of all sorts, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for the physicians in the room,
if you send a patient for a sleep study,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to end up with a mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it would be much nicer to give
them something that's a little less
[SPEAKER_00]: invasive than those masks with CPAP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 35% prevalence of insomnia in the
elderly, far worse, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: in patients suffering from dementia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, in a review by the National
Academies of Sciences, there appears to be
[SPEAKER_00]: moderate evidence of effect of medical
cannabis on sleep disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Donabinol versus amitriptyline,
of course, amitriptyline should not even
[SPEAKER_00]: be used in the elderly in this patient
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had a moderate effect there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, nabolone in fibromyalgia,
it looked at the quality of sleep there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just no studies on primary
insomnia.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no studies in patients with
dementia who have a huge issue with sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: How am I doing on time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not seeing any... Oh, there you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much time do I have?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, 18 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finally, in anxiety, there was one
study that was done with 600 milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: versus placebo, 24 patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's the outcome measure,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked at the effect of this on
anxiety prior to public speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how applicable is it to social anxiety,
disorder, or other anxiety disorders?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, very difficult to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, when we talk about anxiety,
if you look on the web, you're gonna find
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole lot of sites that preach to how
good their product is for anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, the evidence just isn't
there yet, though I think we all have a
[SPEAKER_00]: good feeling that it would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, in pain, Mark Ware from
McGill, did a study in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were actually looking at the side
effects of providing medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had 216 controlled patients,
215 patients that received cannabis with
[SPEAKER_00]: 12.5% THC, up to five grams per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's a little bit all over the
map, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: People were getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could use a little bit more,
a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult really to quantitate how
much they were getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's what they found.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, and I'll show you about the pain,
but what they did find is increased
[SPEAKER_00]: functionality and improved mood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're thinking about quality of
life, increasing functionality and mood,
[SPEAKER_00]: check, check, that's pretty important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you looked at pain,
now they said that they had an effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay, we'll go with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you can see, if you look at the
average pain intensity, it sort of evens
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't see, and I think really the
problem here is that we would need to do
[SPEAKER_00]: trials with far more patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can't just be looking at pain in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to really hone it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of pain are we looking at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chronic, acute, back pain, knee pain,
headache, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really need to hone it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, if you look at this
study that was just published very
[SPEAKER_00]: recently, they had a lot of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a registry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They followed them for six months,
and they looked at pain intensity,
[SPEAKER_00]: it decreased.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the thing, 18% were able to
stop opioids, opioid analgesics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That to me is phenomenal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what the kind of stuff that I like
to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, increase the quality of
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that there's anything
surprising there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so why nursing home patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be brief on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, now we have policies that
allows us to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they take a lot of toxic medicines
that I told you about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe it or not, extremely
receptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started talking to elderly patients
or their families about using this,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was, yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was able to tell them that no,
they're not going to have to go outside
[SPEAKER_00]: and smoke it, that we have oil,
they were very, very keen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm skipping ahead here, but the
uptake for me, so we started with one and
[SPEAKER_00]: two and three, and now it's weekly,
twice weekly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the nursing homes that I'm in,
and I look after close to 200 people,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's almost daily now that I'm getting a
request for medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it is just word of mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a controlled environment,
and it is a monitored environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a nice place to actually do this
because I know that everything else is
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that if I'm seeing an effect,
it's probably not because of some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: confounders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about the cons a little bit
with some slides later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is expensive, but my God, it's
difficult for the patients to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is, and I'm going to show you
that in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's more, it's impossible for me to
prescribe what the licensed producers are
[SPEAKER_00]: making.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're completely disconnected,
and I'll show you that in just a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, what are my objectives?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to relieve pain, anxiety,
insomnia, loss of appetite, depression.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give them back their
functionality and potentially a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of independence with their activities of
daily living.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can relieve some of the BPSD,
that would be fantastic because it means
[SPEAKER_00]: less toxic drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the way of my reasoning is if
I can take care of these illnesses,
[SPEAKER_00]: these mental health issues, am I going to
impact the agitation that these people
[SPEAKER_00]: suffer?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things about patients with
dementia is they can't tell you,
[SPEAKER_00]: my knee hurts, but they can act out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're able to treat their insomnia or
their anxiety, which they suffer a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: from, it may mean that in the end you're
actually treating some of the agitation
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of the symptoms of dementia that
they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to skip through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just to say that it's a very,
very controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to keep in mind that
endocannabinoids have a huge role to play
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cardiovascular system and that
elderly patients might be prone to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, you can get hypotension and
some dysrhythmias.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am on the lookout for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To date, I'm pleased to say that I have
had no issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so as I said, this is relatively new
in nursing homes, so my numbers are not
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do want to very quickly tell you
about some of the research and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: results that I've been having.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say research.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's all observational,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been looking after patients with
anxiety, insomnia, and agitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: My numbers are small.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the dosage range that I've been
giving of the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the success rate has been just
tremendous, just tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so pleased at how this has been
working out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's leave the questions for after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, can you change it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also used it in pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that one patient with spinal
stenosis decided not to take the CBD oil
[SPEAKER_00]: but decided to vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she had a paradoxical increase in
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she never took it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know really what happened
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have been looking after patients
with various pains and, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting some relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: Multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had only two patients, but they've
responded so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do use higher THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Parkinson's, I've had three patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really only one out of three had an
improvement in some of the motor symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, am I at the right dose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I use it for long enough, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_00]: TMJ, incidentally, one of my patients who
had MS had a pain in their jaw and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually went away, which I thought was
very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in progressive supranuclear policy,
which is another neurological disorder,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have any success there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: No controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my patients are cognitively
impaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the information is either
observed or told to me by family or
[SPEAKER_00]: nurses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, there's a very wide
variety of products received.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to talk to you about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this issue here of navigating the
web is extremely difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go and you look at various LPs,
and I just took them randomly,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see that there's a lot of
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to figure out what THC and CBD
they're supposed to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the list goes on, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the list goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'll just ask you to change the
slides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, here you can see THC, CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, various, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Various amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change the slide again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, now we're going up into the higher
THCs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very difficult for the patients
to navigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Canumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to prescribe one in 10 THC to
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I can't find it,
or my patients can't find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of the LPs are saying,
well, that's not what you prescribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have that resembles that,
guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like really, let's get with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want low THC, high CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is another manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have two oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is low THC, high CBD,
or low THC, much higher CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if they go to that site.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not allowed to tell them what site to
go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to go look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do try to tell them how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, one more extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is with Tilray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one's completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say 10 of 8 THC, 25 THC, 10 in 10,
and 25 in 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't even get the ratio with these
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, enthusiastic population,
consistent care, compliance, and
[SPEAKER_00]: monitored.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why research in nursing homes with
the elderly patients is a great venue for
[SPEAKER_00]: doing good quality research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to say one other thing about
something completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do addiction medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have about 300 or so patients that are
addicted to opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of them smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% have concomitant mental health
disorders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smoke because it relieves some of
their symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't we actually provide them with
good quality oils that may actually
[SPEAKER_00]: decrease the amount of methadone that I
have to give them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's face it, methadone is not a walk in
the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a toxic drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to finish then, oh, one more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not go down the avenue of taking
particular cannabinoids and saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, this one's good for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's good for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use this one or that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just no evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just stick with the oils for right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my conclusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is increasing demand for medicinal
cannabis use in long-term care.
[SPEAKER_00]: My patients are keen on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to do the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I showed you is not research.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's observational only.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there are signals there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it behooves us to go down that
path further.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do need to have validated tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do need to have standardized doses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't be prescribing one in 10 and
they're getting one in 25 or whatever is
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, if I didn't say so already,
the nursing home environment and the
[SPEAKER_00]: patients therein are a wonderful
environment for doing well-controlled,
[SPEAKER_00]: well-designed clinical research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on that note, I think I will end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be around most of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my email is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have questions, whatever ideas,
whatever you want to share, I'm happy to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either I dazzle you with my brilliance or
I baffle you with my bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said 10 to 1 CBD to THC is what you
would like to prescribe generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, I'm a novice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started down the path of 1 in 10,
which seemed to be what was available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm having to actually go back and
change so that I can prescribe what it is
[SPEAKER_00]: that the licensed producer is able to
supply to my patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, the way it works is in Canada,
I have to use the Health Canada-like form.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to take that form, go to the
web, find the licensed producer that suits
[SPEAKER_00]: them best, and then send in that
prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then get the feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other day, actually, and I'll say
their name, Green Relief, they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: called me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a great discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really nice to talk with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they made some really smart
suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to get the prescription
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kudos to Green Relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't identify what the ratio of the
cannabis was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It mentioned the dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would we assume it was the 1 to 10 on
those?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's a very wrong assumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little more randomized than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way more randomized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each producer has something completely
different, which is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I want to do some good clinical
work, it's difficult for me because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really know, honestly, what I'm
prescribing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be low THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be high CBD-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the end, from one patient to
another, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: How could you get these studies that
you're doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know they're observational.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would be the easiest way for you to
maybe work with some type of organization
[SPEAKER_03]: to get these actually looked at more
seriously and maybe change a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: things?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a possibility?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I could just hug you for that question
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because actually, it's something I want to
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you didn't hear the question?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would it take, ultimately,
to get the research done?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I went to a particular LP and I
said, look, can you fund my research?
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of say, well, what's in it with
me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ultimately, they'd be growing the
market without necessarily growing their
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of the pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if all the LPs got together and
said, together, we're going to set up a
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical research fund.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to take a certain
percentage of our profits, of our
[SPEAKER_00]: revenues, and put it into that fund.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will have a committee that
will decide based on the research in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way that national organizations do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physicians, researchers would ask for
funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd have a study proposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that organization with the funds from
all the LPs would then allocate those
[SPEAKER_00]: funds for various research projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just one LP.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in the end, I think it benefits us
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the LPs grow the market,
necessarily, their piece of the action
[SPEAKER_00]: grows with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget, the numbers in Canada are
growing by 25,000 people a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you multiply that by 10 in the US,
which is generally the ratio we use,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting 250,000 more patients with
Alzheimer's a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of nursing home care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just make a comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate your preliminary findings.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as an extension, at the same time,
we need to also be looking at the elderly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I run an elderly outpatient clinic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking about the patient with
osteoarthritis who can't take an NSAID
[SPEAKER_02]: because they have an impaired clinic liver
and renal function.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I give them an opioid, they're
going to fall and break their hip.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I'm going to call, just like
you, although the LPs and the ability to
[SPEAKER_02]: control variables is less, we need to
think about what you're showing us in
[SPEAKER_02]: patients who are older.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have 88-year-olds, 92-year-olds,
extremely accepting and exciting about the
[SPEAKER_02]: improvement in their quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our last question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, Dr. Pierre.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
