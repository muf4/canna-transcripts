[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like with Nitro Pak,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody says Nitro Pak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a guy fly in to talk to me,
and so because Humble County's a big
[SPEAKER_00]: timber region, there's a company called
Simpson Timber.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a massive timber company,
a multi-state timber company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the owner of the timber company comes
to me to get cannabis info, so that he can
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how's cannabis gonna affect my
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I chop it up with him, and then he
brings in people from other industries to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he brought a guy in that drives all
the lumber for like Pacific Lumber in
[SPEAKER_00]: Louisiana Pacific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm talking, we're talking lumber,
forest worth of lumber, and he does like
[SPEAKER_00]: Purina dog food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're having a conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, when's the last time you opened a
bag of dog food and saw mold on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, never.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, that's because we dry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see any nitrogen in that shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, because you don't need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, nitrogen is for people who don't
know how to stabilize products.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, from professional dryers,
from people who are drying global level
[SPEAKER_00]: dryers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're drying as an industry,
you're not drying it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, it's stabilization, bringing the
levels down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for me, doing outdoor biologicals
has a higher holdability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I do pro-biopod outside,
I have less of an oxidization degradation
[SPEAKER_00]: than I do if I run chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing outdoor organics,
it seems to hold longer as a comparative,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I get less oxidization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if a variety is moving like crazy,
not as important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're gonna sit on that stuff for
a minute and it starts to gold at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're dropping dollar value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people say, well, you nitro pack
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, nitro packing adds complexity and
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as you crack it, the
degradation after nitro's fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm talking to this guy that owns
this massive company from the East Coast
[SPEAKER_00]: of Carolinas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he flies out to chop it up,
because he and I were trying to come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with modular drying chambers that we could
set at farms in the hills so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer could control the drying of the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people use the word curing,
but curing's actually a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just holding it, it's
actually a process of holding at a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific temperature and dropping the
humidity by 15 points over a multi-month
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that multi-month period on a
computer gradient is what allows this
[SPEAKER_00]: product to actually stabilize and sustain
for time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you would be able to take the
product, rough bucket, put it into your
[SPEAKER_00]: drying chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were looking at solarization so that we
didn't have to use, because you can't use
[SPEAKER_00]: jenny's up in the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these farms don't have grid
power.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I said, look, if we could come up
with containers that were sealed,
[SPEAKER_00]: that were climatically stable,
and then we could have solarization,
[SPEAKER_00]: now we could deliver them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmer could now use this to hold the
product, because I worry about the farm is
[SPEAKER_00]: sending their product to other people to
work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had a lot of these giant
manufacturing facilities that are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, give us your product and we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, these guys can't even roll
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't even roll weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't define you, but it sure
gives me a pretty goddamn good clue of how
[SPEAKER_00]: much pot you've touched.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you can't handle it at the
consumption level, how are you supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: handle it at the production level?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm like, I wouldn't let you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I realized there was a need for
farmers to have an ability to hold their
[SPEAKER_00]: varietals and hand themselves,
but not use antiquated technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to have a heap of filter
scrubbers so that you didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenic issues while you were holding
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once the facility had the ability
to do your processing, because in
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt, most of the farms are offsite
processing, how do you take the product
[SPEAKER_00]: now and then you just put it on?
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to do buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, it won't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to move it too many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it into a container that they can then
haul onto the back of a truck and bring
[SPEAKER_00]: the truck back down the hill, drop the
container at the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sits in lots under a metal tag like you
do with you when you're shipping overseas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way it's been sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's solarized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have digital gauges on the outside
that you can check for maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know the climactic situation inside
this way when they're ready to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual processing of it from that point
forward, they can then crack it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you have is really high quality
product ready to be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is where we were working on it,
but it's trying to get the price points,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as the margins keep dropping in
cannabis, everybody who came into cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: had a price point of it's going to be 2000
a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next group comes in, it's going
to be 1400 a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then now these guys are
like, look, I told you I was going to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you 14 for your outdoor and I need to give
you seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of a sudden I'm like,
wait a minute, if you have to drop the
[SPEAKER_00]: number by half, you guys are going to go
out of business in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't want to give you any of my
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to touch any of my
products if you're going to go out of
[SPEAKER_00]: business, because where's my product going
to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of this is I'm working on all
this R and D with all these companies to
[SPEAKER_00]: mess around, but it's a matter of getting
some stabilization to occur in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry so that you have, companies are
actually going to be here in a year
[SPEAKER_00]: because half these cats I see aren't going
to be here in two months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially with legalization coming in
where like careful state come in,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to scrub you right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the problem is on these processing
facilities, if they, if all that material
[SPEAKER_00]: is there and they come in, they're not
going to shut you down and let you move
[SPEAKER_00]: the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to shut you down and seize
the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's something I couldn't
recommend to a farmer because otherwise
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're doing is you send them down
the road to get screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's a lot of this stuff on,
on how do you get the end user to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to get those price points to where cured
cannabis would be at these upper echelons,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's indoor or outdoor bio or,
or a chemical, all of them can deliver
[SPEAKER_00]: ultra high quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no question we can get high
quality for many different methodologies,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's all the secondary production.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was it processed and, and how did you
stabilize it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of the next issues that you
deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not part of what I'm working
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just what I'm working with,
with companies that are coming in saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, can you help us mess with this and
try to figure out what are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I need the farmers that I'm
involved with to be able to have the crop
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it out, have a known destination,
but have an ability to hold it on their
[SPEAKER_00]: own property safely until it gets trucked
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until the distributor grab it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I said, all these guys are
popping up and popping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I watched a couple of distributors
come through last year was it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: company was doing this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only mentioned their name, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ripped the number of people off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it was nutty where rivers of
cats got robbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all these cats come to me and
they're like, what's my recourse?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, you don't really have
a legal recourse because they've already
[SPEAKER_00]: dumped the company and they're out of
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your only recourse you have is old school
recourse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't recommend that really,
unless we're whispering in your ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's problematic because most people
aren't from the old day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they don't see it the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you wouldn't recommend that anybody
knew because that's something that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: completely uninvolved in and unaware of
how to go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't make any mistakes and you
can't put yourself in these terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically you just get screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm watching guys getting peeled for
200 pounds at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extractor was supposed to take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, extractor disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the stuff's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extractor's business is out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Homies moved out of the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: A new company picked it up and the new
company says, we're not picking up any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the debt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've washed the debt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's all my product?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we washed the debt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's exhausting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of it is trying to find cats
you can work with and trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you work because if we work in
capacity and sometimes tight, sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: loose, but it lets us have an ability to
continue going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once you really start to see the
level that's coming, it's going to be mind
[SPEAKER_00]: bending.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they come in and start to whack
this, I want to make sure that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces that are existing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachians are existing.
[SPEAKER_00]: LA has regions that are existing that are
known spots of production, people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: known for production, proprietary
methodologies, strain selection,
[SPEAKER_00]: and secondary post-production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Production handling, processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff has value because nobody's
just going to come in and just take it
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that they're going to come in
and they're going to come at you with
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive pricing and then lotage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll start to see it with genomics
where if we don't develop things that work
[SPEAKER_00]: for us, then they'll develop things that
work in Kansas and Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll be able to grow cannabis in
those regions that have high heat and high
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity because they'll find the
cultivars that work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll be able to use other
terpene methodologies to enhance this for
[SPEAKER_00]: all the edible markets, for the pen
markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, our market's getting
truncated and minimized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, I'm just like, I just brawl it
out right now as hard as I can and run as
[SPEAKER_00]: hard as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just don't make any mistakes by
teaming up with anybody that's shady and
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody that's like, we got big money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you got big problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in our world, we never just threw
money at problems like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen money wasted so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm like, how did you make this much
money if you were just stupid?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, and it's real because you
were brilliant in a field, but now you're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking, it's called, I was a salvage diver
for a while, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used to do underwater construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't take data from one table and
extrapolate it to another because your
[SPEAKER_00]: residual nitrogens aren't the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of a sudden, you start to find
out you're going to die underwater because
[SPEAKER_00]: you took data from one thing and applied
it to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't ever do that in mixed gas
diving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look at this and I'm like,
let me get this straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did something here and you're going to
apply it there and it's going to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: same?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm almost grateful to some respects
because it allows some of us to realize,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't do that and run as fast as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, the money's so
attractive to people who are desperate
[SPEAKER_00]: that they believe that these guys with
money are going to solve the problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: These big new super distributors with all
these massive facilities are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: solve your problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, these guys only got four
stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're moving to.
[SPEAKER_00]: How the hell are they going to move 11
metric tons a week to four stores?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got people that actually say this to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got seven acres outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, what store do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it better be the best store on
planet Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because nobody's moving 100,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a flower market,
not distillate market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in their mind, and I'm just like,
you guys aren't catching this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That this is very directed and you have to
utilize individuals that have careers in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis because we understand market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we understand what people want to
buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we understand that people are fickle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have product twice,
they find a new dealer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll come to you once.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got any fly out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, I'm out right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'll hit you again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hit you twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that person satisfies the deal and
does a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to go and reestablish your whole
distribution base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something I don't want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm doing now is just doing some
travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm getting to meet people that are in
similar situations where we're all trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to chew our way through the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our teeth are worn flat because we've
been chewing on it for so long already.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have shiny, sharp teeth,
you're too new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see a broken tooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see a couple broken ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: The chipped one where you fell on the
ground and got kneed, that lets me know
[SPEAKER_00]: that you at least understand the ups and
downs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what it does, it puts you in a
more cautious position to where you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to run headlong right into failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it lets us work with people that
are similar minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have new facilities that are
coming online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just lets us say, listen,
these are the things you need to be aware
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to mess with me,
mess with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't, don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm building a whole new facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not I'm getting into cannabis for
the first time in my whole goddamn life.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I'm doing is creating new
methodologies so that I can keep up with
[SPEAKER_00]: the pace of the technology so that as it's
moving, it's just that my lawyer always
[SPEAKER_00]: says, be the leading edge, not the
bleeding edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I touch as much tech as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I touch as much scientific shit as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I got to mess with so many
different university people, and I do
[SPEAKER_00]: projects with universities on an
intellectual sharing level, it allows me
[SPEAKER_00]: for them to say, hey, this is what we see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the problems are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it lets me get awareness I
wouldn't get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps educate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I need it, because otherwise I'm only
as good as I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think I know the whole
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a master of distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not where I spent my time.
