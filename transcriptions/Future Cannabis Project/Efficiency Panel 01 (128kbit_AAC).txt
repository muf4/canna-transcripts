[SPEAKER_03]: So welcome to the Heart of Cannabis 2019,
hopefully the first of many.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the efficiency panel and we have a
awesome group up here from all walks of
[SPEAKER_03]: life in the cannabis realm.
[SPEAKER_03]: To my left, we have Drew Plobani.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a commercial grower, consultant,
all around amazing helper guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll let him speak a little bit more on
what he does in a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: To my left, Dr. Nadia Saba.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's with Dr. Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to talk greenhouses,
this is the person to talk to so you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: set up for failure.
[SPEAKER_03]: To her left is Anya Gordon.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's from GrowTech Builders.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the ones to talk to when you're
just thinking about what you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she's the one that's going to help you
not fail in the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will give it up to them and they can
give a little bit more introduction on
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, good afternoon everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Drew Plobani.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the intro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the founder and CEO presently at
Commercial Cultivator Inc.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty special for me to sit here
honestly on stage as I used to live up
[SPEAKER_01]: here on the ridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can't hear me at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that better?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, as I was saying, I used to live
up here on the ridge so it's pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: special for me to sit up here on stage and
talk to you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: My background is in cultivation and before
that in geology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And environmental science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from the background of a
cultivator, the cost of production became
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And going forward as the industry has
evolved, cost of production is now much
[SPEAKER_01]: broader and much more involved than maybe
in the old model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where the company really started as a
both nutrient supply chain sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: solution to the grow store model,
we've sort of progressed into offering
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency services and consulting and
project management and owner's rep stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: for new builds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess that's my intro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll pass the mic down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am Nadia Saba.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the president and owner of Dr.
Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are an agricultural and mechanical
engineering firm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we design environmental control and
HVAC systems for greenhouses and indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: My PhD is in agricultural engineering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I studied evaporative cooling,
ventilation, water use efficiency for
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial tomato production houses for my
PhD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after that, I went on to learn how to
be a mechanical engineer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I designed HVAC systems for
commercial high rise residential buildings
[SPEAKER_02]: and the such.
[SPEAKER_02]: And about two and a half years ago,
I was able to bring my two passions
[SPEAKER_02]: together, agriculture and mechanical
engineering, to form Dr. Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been in business for about two
and a half years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we help growers all over the country
and in a few different countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've just finished or just started our
60th project in the last two and a half
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot more growers are looking into
greenhouses as a cost effective and
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient way of cultivating their
cannabis crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we do a lot of studies,
energy modeling studies, looking at the
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits of using shade systems,
of using different types of covering
[SPEAKER_02]: systems, looking how it interplays with
the crop that you're growing, the lighting
[SPEAKER_02]: system, the irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're really trying to help growers
learn how to maybe come out of their
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor facility and go into a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what works there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or people who are coming from,
say, tomatoes and cucumbers trying to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis then in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what the nuances are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not really a microphone person,
but my name is Anya Gordon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the co-owner of Grow Tech Builders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are exactly what we sound like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are builders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Primarily, actually, what we spend most of
our time doing now is project development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early stage project development,
working with various municipalities,
[SPEAKER_00]: utilities, and city, county, state,
code, and processes to navigate a project
[SPEAKER_00]: from start to finish and make sure that
all the T's get crossed and the I's get
[SPEAKER_00]: dotted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And working on the planning stages from
the very beginning to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_00]: process can be as efficient and functional
as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, it's all too often when the I's get
crossed and the T's get dotted these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: So essentially, this panel is pretty much
what you need to get going with an
[SPEAKER_03]: efficient project and something that's
going to actually succeed and be a
[SPEAKER_03]: long-term solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing that we've been talking about
is the knowledge that we've had within the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis community and where that's come
from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And agriculture and other crop science has
had the ability to look within itself,
[SPEAKER_03]: look within studies from university to
find out what their crops are doing,
[SPEAKER_03]: how to cultivate the crops, what proper
nutrient ratios, what environment they
[SPEAKER_03]: like, and really dive into the breeding to
specifically cultivate and breed crops for
[SPEAKER_03]: certain purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're finally getting to the point
where we're actually starting to
[SPEAKER_03]: understand what's going on with this
specific plant, which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the breeding that we've been doing
over the years and all the cultivation
[SPEAKER_03]: without really understanding why and how,
we're actually able to bring that out into
[SPEAKER_03]: the forefront.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of my really favorite areas is
data collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a data geek.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really love information on every single
aspect of cultivation, whether it's
[SPEAKER_03]: something to do with the substrate,
the biology, the environment, or the
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a plant nerd.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a data geek.
[SPEAKER_03]: So data collection is a big one for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're starting to see that a lot more
and more with a lot more automated
[SPEAKER_03]: systems, a lot more sensing equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's kind of talk about data
collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of points of data are extremely
important for a cultivator to not only
[SPEAKER_03]: start out understanding, but to develop
throughout their process to help them
[SPEAKER_03]: succeed?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can just kind of go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I think there's obviously a
few facets in the current commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis paradigm in terms of the various
data sets that we might be looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the cultivation side, solely,
I would say, obviously, you mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a few of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think really what I'd like to point out
in a certain way is if you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: experiments, if you're in a greenhouse
environment, if you're in an indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, what is the replicability of
that experiment?
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you're going forward and sort of
perhaps on the fly even, encountering new
[SPEAKER_01]: dynamics where you say, oh, man,
I need to monitor that particular aspect
[SPEAKER_01]: that perhaps I wasn't keying in on in a
different environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the dynamic is somewhat distinct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the cultivation side, it really
depends on the model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, a big piece of it is if you're
not collecting data, even if you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know where you're going and trying to get
as much as you can, it's tough to hone in
[SPEAKER_01]: on that model when you're ready to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you're sort of flying by night.
[SPEAKER_02]: So data is a big piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big piece of what we do and a lot
of what we're missing in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: As Casey mentioned, with other
horticultural crops, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: university research, historical research
has been done over 50 years or more,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on what you're growing,
that we have been able to develop growth
[SPEAKER_02]: models on, production models on,
understand how much light the crop needs,
[SPEAKER_02]: what the nutrient mixes should be to get
the best qualities and the best,
[SPEAKER_02]: highest yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with cannabis, we don't have that same
level of data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, universities aren't doing that
research because they feel like their
[SPEAKER_02]: hands are tied behind their back because
it's not federally legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we rely on you growers to help us
fill in those gaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you guys also come from a history of
not wanting to keep records for good
[SPEAKER_02]: reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of it has been anecdotal,
which has been a great place to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we really need to rely on you to
collect that data.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in a greenhouse, having a
weather station and knowing the dynamics
[SPEAKER_02]: of temperature and humidity and rain and
wind and how that might affect them,
[SPEAKER_02]: should you open up a vent to naturally
ventilate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you shut it down to use fans and maybe
an evaporative cooling system?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you use shade?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you shade, will it reduce the yield of
your crop?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you're not pumping the greenhouse
with carbon dioxide anyway, maybe you can
[SPEAKER_02]: shade or maybe you don't shade because or
maybe you do shade because you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get the full benefit of all that
sunlight if you're not also pumping the
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse with CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't have that data.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know how much light these plants
need.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know they need a lot of plant,
a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: But where's the threshold?
[SPEAKER_02]: We know they they can use a lot of CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: But where's the threshold, both high and
low?
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, we need to tie it to
production data and to quality data,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we really need that information from
all of you rather than it being anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we have some record keeping,
if we can even standardize what variables,
[SPEAKER_02]: what parameters we're monitoring and then
what the outcomes are so that we can make
[SPEAKER_02]: direct connections rather than,
oh, this will happen to be a sunny dry
[SPEAKER_02]: year and I got a really good crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to hope for another sunny dry
year next year when actually it had to do
[SPEAKER_02]: with, I don't know, the strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are growing that year, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So data is key to the success in moving
forward in this industry and being as
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually also going to, I mean,
maybe talk even from a sort of a 10,000
[SPEAKER_00]: foot level about data because and Casey,
you know this because I've spoken with you
[SPEAKER_00]: at a number of events that for me and from
our lens as a as a builder and as somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: who helps to develop these projects,
data is the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the primary component that ultimately
drives the industry towards success or
[SPEAKER_00]: failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the threshold of what are the minimum
baseline requirements that I need to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to be up and running in a
functional way that in the long run sets
[SPEAKER_00]: me up to actually be able to produce my
product efficiently, both from an energy
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint, from an environmental
standpoint, and from an economic
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of what I find happening now is
there's this rush to entry, rush to entry,
[SPEAKER_00]: rush to entry and it's kind of you're in a
chicken and an egg situation a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the data because of where
the industry has come from and because of
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of all of the various reasons that
there was never a reason to collect the
[SPEAKER_00]: data and there were never any supporting
entities doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the ultimate cause of that is that
we don't really know how much is
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable for it to cost to build a
facility and we don't really know how long
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to take for that to pay back
dividends in the long run and we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really know whether or not we can maintain
an economically successful production
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle without those data points because
not only can we not sort of compare with
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves from year to year, but we can't
compare with anybody else, which
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately means there's no successful,
healthy, equitable competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a 10,000 square foot view,
it's not even just the purpose of being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to cultivate effectively,
it's being able to operate as a business
[SPEAKER_00]: and as an industry effectively over the
long term.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to Anya's point too, the first
cannabis project, indoor project that I
[SPEAKER_02]: worked on about four or five years ago,
we told the grower, look, here's these two
[SPEAKER_02]: or three different HVAC system options you
could use.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's really efficient and it has an
18 month return or an 18 month payback.
[SPEAKER_02]: From coming from commercial buildings,
anything that's less than a 10 year
[SPEAKER_02]: payback is a score, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the grower literally said,
unless it has a six month payback,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because the risks are real of
being shut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, fast forward four or five years
later, now efficiency is starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: become part of this conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's just, we have to get over that
artifact of where the industry has come
[SPEAKER_02]: from and where it is now and where it can
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can be a real leader in agriculture
itself to be very efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
