[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be talking today about all
aspects of cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first off, we're going to start off
with Dale Schaeffer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll introduce him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had the honor of representing him
very briefly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he has been a martyr of the war on
cannabis in the sense that he did time in
[SPEAKER_02]: federal prison for standing up for his
beliefs about the righteousness of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and refusing to plead guilty to
something that should not be a crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can you give us a little bit of
background on how, you know, what inspired
[SPEAKER_02]: you to become a lawyer?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to start like way back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, I wanted to be a physician.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was on the track to be a medical
doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went in the military, learned medicine,
was on my way there and my friend said,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you want to be a doctor?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to get crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I taught high school, did antique
furniture and a friend of mine went to law
[SPEAKER_01]: school and went, oh, there's an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I started it, I was still in the
practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went right from law school into
medical malpractice work because I was
[SPEAKER_01]: working in medicine and I talked the
language and I had patients every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That moved me into the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you know, Molly, my ex-wife is a
medical doctor and she got breast cancer
[SPEAKER_01]: and we both smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like a big secret and her whole
family knew all about it, but now it was
[SPEAKER_01]: serious and I want, we just passed the
law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to do this the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cops showed up and they knew who
we were and they asked her to do
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they knew who the right people were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's cool until you give it to the
wrong person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she told him, I'm not a cop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that brings us into the light of
Barry McCafferty and the Clinton
[SPEAKER_01]: administration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's rewind back in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's rewind back in time a little bit to
your first experience with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was in high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was junior year and a buddy of mine
handed me something.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, this is Acapulco Gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, it was all history because
I went, oh, now it's like those guys that
[SPEAKER_01]: are colorblind, put the glasses on,
you go, is this what it really looks like?
[SPEAKER_02]: And where did you go to high school?
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to high school just north of
Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know who Rush Limbaugh is,
he used to make fun of our hometown,
[SPEAKER_01]: Real Linda.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, the trailer trash out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I grew up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you a frequent cannabis user?
[SPEAKER_01]: Daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daily?
[SPEAKER_01]: From then on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in the military.
[SPEAKER_02]: We figured it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about how you managed to use
cannabis in the military.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the MPs and the guys that did the
drug test were party and buddies of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you had a drug test, you wrote the
number of the bottle on the palm of your
[SPEAKER_01]: hand and you showed it to your buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a negative test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they were checking the gates,
the MPs would go, six is hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went to five or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just we we partied with the guys who
would do this stuff to get you in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you didn't get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hustle was we figured it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like hacking the system,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I first got to know you through Tony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony Sarah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony Sarah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He tried my case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's everybody's rock star.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love the guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to meet you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it that brought you to Tony?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cannabis, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Tony Sarah was speaking at Stanford
Law School.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the speakers at Stanford Law
School were super boring, like Anthony
[SPEAKER_02]: Scalia or some corporate lawyer who made a
lot of money for corporations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, that was not interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when Tony Sarah came, he was the most
animated and the most alive of all the
[SPEAKER_02]: speakers who had ever gone to Stanford Law
School.
[SPEAKER_02]: And watching that made me think like and I
was pretty young.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I think, twenty one years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, in law school as a first
year student, I didn't have like the
[SPEAKER_02]: wealth to like take a leap year or
whatever they call it, like the year to go
[SPEAKER_02]: to Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't I couldn't afford it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to go straight from college straight
to law school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was kind of burned up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But luckily, I had discovered cannabis
while I was in undergrad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I was in law school,
I didn't have a connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this guy, Tony Sarah, shows up and he
has long hair and he's talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I figured he had a connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so after his speech, all the law
students were asking him like,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, Mr. Sarah, can we apply to work with
you over the summer?
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tony's like, I don't really do it that
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you got to come to my office.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we asked him a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ever get high after seven p.m.?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, what time is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's seven thirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, this this is over.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to go get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went to the law school dorm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was after the board, the Supreme
Court justice who was denied his Supreme
[SPEAKER_02]: Court seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And rightfully so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Saturday Night Massacre and all that
good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so nobody wanted to go with Tony Sarah
to get high, except like a few,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, kind of counterculture rebels
from the law school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we went.
[SPEAKER_02]: To the law school dorm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got super high with Tony Sarah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to me, that was like pretty
entertaining.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I decided that my clients
would be human beings, not corporations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I got a job with the federal public
defender.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I got a job with a civil rights law
firm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I graduated law school,
I didn't have a job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tony Sarah was doing the Bear Lincoln
case for free pro bono.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I knew Tony Sarah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, come on, you know,
come work on this case.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we got a house.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can put you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come work on the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so back then, you know, I've supported
myself by selling cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would sell cannabis on the
weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would sell cannabis on the weekends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I had to arrange all my
deals during on the weekends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then during the deal during the week,
we'd go up to Mendocino County to Redwood
[SPEAKER_02]: Valley is where we live.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we would go to court in Ukiah
every morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we would wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wake up at 5 a.m., be at the courthouse by
like 8 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: Court would start around 8 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was three months of like super
exciting experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after Tony got Bear Lincoln acquitted,
and I was kind of working on the case,
[SPEAKER_02]: like doing a lot of juror investigation,
but I was working more on like the gag
[SPEAKER_02]: order.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put a gag order on Tony and on Bear
Lincoln.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we took a gag order all the way up
to the Cal Supreme Court.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we would have like Native American
supporters would fish salmon and they
[SPEAKER_02]: would like cook it for us like every
evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'd be eating well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd be like defending Bear Lincoln all
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at night, like people would feed
us like fresh salmon that had been caught
[SPEAKER_02]: the week before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think like the local
winery fray wines would like give us a
[SPEAKER_02]: hook up on, you know, cheap wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like it was like a very nice
convivial convivial attitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Working on a defense team, you know,
trying to save somebody's life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so after that, I was hooked on trial
law and working, you know, like righteous
[SPEAKER_02]: cases like with Tony.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did that for 12 years at Pier 5.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually moved my practice to Sonoma
County.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got sick of driving from like
living in Berkeley, driving to 506
[SPEAKER_02]: Broadway, which is Broadway and Kearney
right in the middle of North Beach,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and then going to court every
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so most of my cases were in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just moved closer to Mendocino
County, but I don't want to live in the
[SPEAKER_02]: county where I was defending all the
cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I moved to Sonoma County where there
was very few cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a ton of cases in Mendocino that
I was defending.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was a crackdown in
Mendocino County like two years after I
[SPEAKER_02]: moved there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then I had a ton of cases in Sonoma
County.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that pretty much continued until
Prop 65.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then before, successfully passed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a lot of the cases just went away
becoming like misdemeanors or infractions
[SPEAKER_02]: or getting outright dismissed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, the way of meeting Tony,
Tony has been really instrumental in my
[SPEAKER_02]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know for me, the pivot from being an
insurance defense lawyer to setting up
[SPEAKER_01]: these businesses was, it was a difficult
dive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you came from the criminal side,
coming back on the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I didn't pay enough attention in
law school to corporate and business law
[SPEAKER_01]: and contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it all, but I didn't really want
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, now you have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: How was that for you coming from the
courtroom to building businesses and
[SPEAKER_01]: anticipating problems?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it was not something I'd been trained.
[SPEAKER_02]: And luckily, like in October of this year,
the Continuing Education of the Bar set up
[SPEAKER_02]: a program called The Basics for Business
Law.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I went there and I saw Paul
Gallegos there and he was doing the same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing I was, like brushing up on the
basics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they basically taught us all about
like contract law, real estate leases,
[SPEAKER_02]: licensing agreements, like everything,
which I found really helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of like rounded me out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was thankful that such a resource
was available at the right time in my
[SPEAKER_02]: career that I could avail myself of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But definitely like it's been a vertical
learning curve since I graduated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I graduated law school.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel fortunate that I've been able to
utilize like maybe a little bit more than
[SPEAKER_02]: 10% of my brain just because like there's
so much to learn that you're always like
[SPEAKER_02]: having to learn in the cannabis law world.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a while, I was kind of like resting in
my laurels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like right before Prop 64, I've been doing
cannabis defense for so long and I was so
[SPEAKER_02]: good at it that it's almost like,
oh yeah, I'll follow the mirror and then
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do my prelim and, you know,
set up my Mauer motion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was almost like automatic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the law changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now I have to like, you know,
learn all about administrative law,
[SPEAKER_02]: the administrative rulemaking process,
regulations, you know, eventually there's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be like a disciplinary process
for all these licensees that becomes
[SPEAKER_02]: activated.
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't yet activated it because they
hadn't come up with an appellate
[SPEAKER_02]: framework.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I find curious and I want to get your
take on this, I see the next one to two
[SPEAKER_01]: grow seasons as furiously getting more
supply chain members.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as the supply chain matures,
the enforcement's going to come along,
[SPEAKER_01]: which brings the local permit being jerked
or fined, the state doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see yourself doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, how are you anticipating you're
going to help your clients maneuver
[SPEAKER_01]: through that as it comes to work?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your plan to get them ready to
handle that next phase of enforcement?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, probably compliance and like,
you know, really buckling down and paying
[SPEAKER_02]: attention, performing audits, you know,
like vesting somebody with responsibility
[SPEAKER_02]: in their organization for making sure that
compliance happens and periodic reviews
[SPEAKER_02]: take place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think a lot of the problems with
compliance can be that it can be dialed
[SPEAKER_02]: in, but then the regulations change and
they're constantly evolving right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when the regulations change and
somebody has it dialed in, it just means
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're outdated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's what we're seeing a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the regulators right now are super
what they call in the instructional mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very forgiving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I haven't seen much enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the criminal side, nobody's getting
busted except people at the airport.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the administrative enforcement
side, nobody's really getting busted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlicensed cannabis operators have just
competed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're competing with, you know,
the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people's free market, as some call it,
is alive and well in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of the tax burden,
it's pushing a lot of the more
[SPEAKER_02]: sophisticated consumers who are
traditionally patients from this
[SPEAKER_02]: overtaxed, overregulated system into the
legacy free people's market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think the black market is going
to continue to be an issue until it
[SPEAKER_02]: becomes federally legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is some encouraging noise coming
from Washington, which means that we could
[SPEAKER_02]: see some reform faster than any of us may
have expected, maybe by 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Trump will be smart enough to say as
a presidential reelection gambit to get
[SPEAKER_02]: the turnout that he will legalize
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe the Democrats will be smarter
than Trump and they'll outmaneuver him on
[SPEAKER_02]: that issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But somebody's going to take the lead on
that issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And claim it as a victory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, and you understand it's about my
case, that they'll set on information for
[SPEAKER_01]: a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can come back and haunt you.
[SPEAKER_01]: How concerned are you in this preliminary
phase where we're just checking a box and
[SPEAKER_01]: giving you some leeway to clean it up?
[SPEAKER_01]: At what point do you see that turning
into, you know, you're not learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not really staying on QA and QC and
have your controls in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to spank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: When do you see that coming along?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think right now, part of the latest BCC
regs in the disciplinary realm talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: a notice to cure, I think, or a notice to
rectify.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot what it's called.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some language about fix the
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now they're in educating people
about the problem and giving them a chance
[SPEAKER_02]: to fix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the ones who ignore repeated
opportunities to cure the deficiency are
[SPEAKER_02]: the ones who are going to see enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly the ones who don't even
bother getting a permit are the ones who
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to see enforcement just because
the locals, they want to see their money.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a new assembly bill that allows
local jurisdictions to start fining
[SPEAKER_02]: unlicensed cannabis operators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of our legal colleagues recently
reached out to me saying, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a client and this is an
unprecedented issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going after the landlord for
something the tenant did in Fresno.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is all based on a new law which
allows the local jurisdiction to really go
[SPEAKER_02]: hard after the landlord.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to play whack-a-mole.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going after the landlord.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every time they hit it, they're nuking
that hole and the mole can't hide there
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a recent referral for similar
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The landlord wasn't notified.
[SPEAKER_01]: A number of tenants got popped in a row
and he ended up with a $300,000 or
[SPEAKER_01]: $400,000 lien in his property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, I didn't get told that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a friend of mine is fighting those due
process notice types of issues right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I've experienced with some of
this local permitting and basically land
[SPEAKER_01]: use stuff, it ain't about having a chicken
in your backyard, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you couldn't afford a lawyer to
fight that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's going to bring in top flight
firms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of those lines that we all ask
which sides are going to turn out,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll get appellate decisions on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you remember a real following after
215 when mower comes out and you go,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, what's that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone was like, what does that
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a recent decision down south of
the trial level about over prohibitive
[SPEAKER_01]: restrictions on the six plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me what you think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you think the appellate court's
going to help us with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think in that case, the appellate
court did strike down the restrictions as
[SPEAKER_02]: unreasonable restrictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the word reasonable is like the
stuff that innumerable legal opinions are
[SPEAKER_02]: made of because it's so subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so because the law is phrased in terms
of reasonableness and it prohibits
[SPEAKER_02]: unreasonable restrictions, it really opens
up, you know, like a lot of discretion in
[SPEAKER_02]: enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think in places like Fresno,
we're going to see like maybe them backing
[SPEAKER_02]: off after the legislative loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in neighboring counties, they may not
get the message and they may still play
[SPEAKER_02]: silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a kind of impact litigation
that requires like several victories in a
[SPEAKER_02]: row so that all the counties get the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just one district that's got an
opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once they start seeing a trend and they
start seeing everybody's paying attorney
[SPEAKER_02]: fees, then it starts hurting them in their
pocketbook where it hurts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, that's how you make systemic
change using strategic litigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to have your thoughts on the
delivery across the entire state and the
[SPEAKER_01]: 26-200 local control fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you think that's going to turn out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think right now the fight has been
lost by the sheriffs and the cities,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they might take it to court claiming
that the regulations are inconsistent with
[SPEAKER_02]: the state law and with Prop 64 and local
control and their mandate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really think that ultimately
they're going to win.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like tilting at windmills
because the ones that do allow bans are
[SPEAKER_02]: just going to be like serving the
unregulated delivery services,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are still advertising on Weedmaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a bigger issue is like Weedmaps
continuing to advertise all of these
[SPEAKER_02]: unlicensed delivery services.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish the regulators would just create
like a Weedmaps license category and stop
[SPEAKER_02]: the charade, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And give everybody a license if that's the
way they're going to allow it to continue
[SPEAKER_02]: playing out and make everybody kind of be
on a more even playing field.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also understand that local control
and local control is required.
[SPEAKER_02]: I anticipate that maybe we'll see like a
local jurisdiction start handing out like
[SPEAKER_02]: virtually unlimited number of delivery
licenses as long as they have an office in
[SPEAKER_02]: that jurisdiction and maybe they have
other locations for the rest of the
[SPEAKER_02]: operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets a little dicey with that,
but there is no delivery radius in the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations.
I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, de facto $5,000 in profitability
will limit you some.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this last round of elections,
there were 30 plus ballot initiatives out
[SPEAKER_01]: there and the vast majority won.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you see that in the next cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think this is going to open more
places up to this is the business?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's regulate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do resource management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think the ideologues are going
to hang on for a while longer?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think that the ideologues,
their most compelling argument was this is
[SPEAKER_02]: untested.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is new.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to be the guinea pigs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was their strongest argument,
which carried the day back when they were
[SPEAKER_02]: opposing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think now that's not a very
compelling argument.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once all the tax revenue starts coming in
and the figures come in, they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have to basically change their approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their approach is probably going to be
something more about like we got to be
[SPEAKER_02]: compatible with local community uses and
really try to put people in a box in the
[SPEAKER_02]: least desirable development area for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that may happen in some of these
bank counties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also gets complicated with hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some counties may choose to become hemp
counties, not cannabis counties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's the issue of
cross-pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had some overt threats already from
the hemp people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to super pollinate all
your Senesemia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my first thought was they let a Rico
case go through on smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went to the jury.
[SPEAKER_01]: The jury said no.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the principle was if there's a
damaging impact on your neighbor's
[SPEAKER_01]: property, i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: you pollinate my stuff and ruin it,
do you think Rico could be a way to
[SPEAKER_01]: intervene if someone really wants to
weaponize pollen?
[SPEAKER_02]: They could in a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's interesting to see how the
federal court would rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may prioritize hemp over schedule one
cannabis just because cannabis is illegal
[SPEAKER_02]: and hemp is now legal thanks to the hemp
farm bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's an interesting question that
remains to be decided.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be a very strategically wise
option that some of these banks and
[SPEAKER_02]: counties could take.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for that reason, I have no hesitation
talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because it's strategically wise,
they'll never implement it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're more likely to do something
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hemp is really going to change the
game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we might see cannabis all over
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends on is it traditional
cannabis or is it less than 0.3%
[SPEAKER_02]: industrial hemp type cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read part of that farm bill which seems
to specifically take the resin extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: from hemp out of schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no longer scheduled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are talking about
concentrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if you're taking smidgens of THC,
maybe all those smidgens of THC can be
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrated to make federally legal
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you understand, this is a soil
remediator and a soil extractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the concerns we've talked about is
if I'm going to do CBD concentrates,
[SPEAKER_01]: you grow the seed producing phenotypes and
just have them so the chemo type is heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: in CBD and grow it on less physical space
so it has less opportunity to suck crap
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I don't know if that's actually going
to play out because California
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically said unless it comes to the
cannabis supply chain, you can't put CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: in anything or it's an adulterated
substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have yet to see an interstate
transportation permit to bring extracted
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD legally across these state lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody that contacts me,
when I ask them where's your federal
[SPEAKER_01]: permits, you get crickets.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at some point they're going to have to
call a truce because it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you think that line is going to
be drawn between the nutritional
[SPEAKER_01]: supplements and trying to overregulate
cannabis like it's Vicodin on a bush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you see that point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I think now with the farm bill,
FDA is the only impediment to CBD really
[SPEAKER_02]: being in all the products that we see in
the mass market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're right, CBD has attained maximum
market penetration and it's here to stay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's just going to be banned
overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't care about its status.
[SPEAKER_02]: It never did get made illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it could be prosecuted under the
analog act as some sort of analog
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled substance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's really no political will to do
any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think FDA enforcement has been way
chill compared to the DEA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if they're the ones who are
worrying about it, they seem to be far
[SPEAKER_02]: more willing to adapt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas I think some of these CBD
companies are going to start lobbying
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's just going to be too
profitable for them not to have the full
[SPEAKER_02]: advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they have 280E as an issue,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not a declared illegal substance
in the tax system, there's no 280E.
[SPEAKER_01]: The DEA doesn't get to make tax policy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well that gives an incredible competitive
advantage to hemp versus say the regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I see coming is taking cannabis and
jumping the hoops and comparing it to
[SPEAKER_01]: other comparable industries and say,
this isn't fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you see that fight playing out over
the next one to two years?
[SPEAKER_02]: One to two years, that's a major priority
with a lot of the national advocacy
[SPEAKER_02]: organizations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they are getting far more
sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's changes with the new Congress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't want to prejudge the new
Congress, but it seems like they are very
[SPEAKER_02]: motivated to make changes that have not
been made by the previous do nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: Congress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with a Democratic majority in Congress,
I'm very hopeful that we'll see tremendous
[SPEAKER_02]: changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One issue that is continuing up in the air
right now is the white labeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: The intellectual property rights,
who's the manager, who's just the
[SPEAKER_01]: financial interests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me how you see any lines that we can
understand around that that you could
[SPEAKER_01]: advise our clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you see that playing out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, there was a lot of guidance in the
final statement of reasons that the Bureau
[SPEAKER_02]: of Cannabis Control issued.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they basically said anybody who exerts
control over a licensee is considered an
[SPEAKER_02]: owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the BCC regs, they have a
definition of owner that is very different
[SPEAKER_02]: than what lawyers or regular people think
of when they hear the word owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally, ownership means that you have
some sort of interest and that you own
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever the property is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, according to the BCC, you don't have
to have any ownership interest in order to
[SPEAKER_02]: be an owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be an owner by the mere fact
that you are basically directing or
[SPEAKER_02]: managing or controlling the cannabis
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that creates an issue for intellectual
property brand owners.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's different than a BCC owner,
just somebody who owns rights in
[SPEAKER_02]: intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the issue is if they're going to sell
their intellectual property or assign
[SPEAKER_02]: rights to the intellectual property,
great, they sold it, it's off their hands,
[SPEAKER_02]: they can sell it to the licensee.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they want to license their brand,
basically rent the intellectual property,
[SPEAKER_02]: they have to maintain control over it so
that it's not a naked license,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is in trademark law, naked license
is when you try to license a brand or a
[SPEAKER_02]: mark, but you don't exert any quality
control over how the mark is used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore, you're basically
surrendering control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you surrender control,
it becomes public domain and you no longer
[SPEAKER_02]: have protectable rights in the mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so basically, because of the
requirement of not giving up control to
[SPEAKER_02]: avoid giving a naked license, a lot of
brand owners are now have to exert control
[SPEAKER_02]: over licensees, meaning they have to
register as owners under 5003 of the
[SPEAKER_02]: proposed regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that really expands, in my view,
what most people understood to be an
[SPEAKER_02]: owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: They thought like an owner, somebody maybe
like, you know, the plant manager could be
[SPEAKER_02]: an owner, even though they don't have an
actual ownership interest, because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: there day to day, they're directing the
operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But somebody who is just basically
directing and the specifications and the
[SPEAKER_02]: way that the product will be built,
but they're not there on an everyday
[SPEAKER_02]: basis, they may be considered an owner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the advice I'm going to give my clients
is, and the BCC said this in the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations, final statement of reasons,
is the BCC will give you guidance,
[SPEAKER_02]: come to us and we'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the safe thing is to ask,
better safe than sorry, and basically say
[SPEAKER_02]: the control we have to exert is limited,
but it is some sort of control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you consider this an owner?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the BCC basically wants to
know anybody who is playing the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you got to play the game, you got to
wear a jersey, you got to be on a team.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't want to wear a jersey,
get off the field, is basically what the
[SPEAKER_02]: BCC is saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and the marketing of products
exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this dropped into it, and they just
went to work marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have these weird sets of control
rules that are incompatible with the real
[SPEAKER_01]: legal world of IP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have an answer yet,
but I have some clients who have salary
[SPEAKER_01]: plus employees who get a piece of the
sales and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh right, like profit sharing,
because that's like a modern compensation
[SPEAKER_02]: trend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take the business, those are financial
interested people and they have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: declared.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, and if they're getting more
than 20%, now they're owners under the new
[SPEAKER_01]: regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: How far up they're going to swim for an
individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say that a brand is owned by another
corporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my pick is they want to know everybody
there, no more of this hiding behind some
[SPEAKER_01]: side door.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The regulations are quite explicit about
exactly what you're talking about,
[SPEAKER_02]: that they will be no more corporate
layering, is what they call it,
[SPEAKER_02]: is having a shell corporation owned by a
shell corporation, owned by another shell
[SPEAKER_02]: corporation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Owned by numerous shell corporations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the bureau of cannabis control to make
sure that nobody who shouldn't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: ownership interest in a laboratory has
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to get back to individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like whenever an owner is a corporate
entity, either a corporation or LLC,
[SPEAKER_02]: limited liability corporation,
or even a partnership, or some sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: like legal entity that is not a natural
person, they're going to go to see who
[SPEAKER_02]: owns that entity until only natural
persons are left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't call them natural persons
in the regulations, they call them
[SPEAKER_02]: individuals, which is kind of goofy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess individual, that brings to
mind that goofy Prop 215 case about people
[SPEAKER_02]: versus Perrone, where it said a caregiver
is an individual who assumes primary
[SPEAKER_02]: responsibility for the health,
safety, or housing of the patient,
[SPEAKER_02]: and therefore a cannabis club cannot be a
caregiver.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that word individual in the
regulations is kind of basically,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's okay for them to want
transparency and to see who is pulling the
[SPEAKER_02]: strings, because corporations always act
through their officers and directors and
[SPEAKER_02]: their employees, and so it is good to see
who is behind this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if people are ashamed to be in the
cannabis industry, then they shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_02]: in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if people shouldn't be in the cannabis
industry for whatever reason, maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: they're like a convicted fraudster,
then that should be disclosed and they
[SPEAKER_02]: should not be allowed in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bad enough the way it is now with the
checks and the regulators are not really
[SPEAKER_02]: enforcing any of the agreements.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's licensees getting burned left and
right on deals gone wrong, and I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing one of the regulations that says
you have to satisfy all court judgments,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me ask you about the metrics to buy
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having a lot of discussions with
people drafting contracts with me and for
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I go to court and you don't pay
because you say they didn't deliver what
[SPEAKER_01]: you contracted for, and I ask you,
well then what did you contract for,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you use terms like it was top shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you and I know that we're taught to
break things into their component parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the metrics?
[SPEAKER_01]: If your value is it's terpenes and it's
cold processed, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want a certain cannabinoid chemo
type profile, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Water content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you having discussions with attorneys
drafting these agreements on dialing in
[SPEAKER_01]: these terms?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you want to have a level of
granularity in the terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, if you're going to do a
distribution agreement and somebody's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be granting territorial rights,
it's better to be granular if you are a
[SPEAKER_02]: distributor and not give exclusive rights
for the whole state of California to a
[SPEAKER_02]: distributor who can only effectively
distribute maybe in the Bay Area,
[SPEAKER_02]: but does not have any market penetration
in LA or San Diego or Fresno or
[SPEAKER_02]: Bakersfield or Sacramento or anywhere else
in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it is good to be granular and what
you're talking about is like specifying
[SPEAKER_02]: the product and just calling the product
marijuana is simply would be too big.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just calling it by top shelf is
also too big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideally you would be specifying,
like you're saying, all of the desirable
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't seen that level of granularity
as a standard practice yet, but we will in
[SPEAKER_02]: the future because there's going to be
more accurate testing available and I
[SPEAKER_02]: think a lot of these criteria that you're
discussing are going to be key into
[SPEAKER_02]: testing, like the moisture content and the
terpenoid and the cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in writing conditions into
contracts, that if it isn't A,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be B and we're going to
price B at this and here's great and if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not B, it's C and rather than have to
go hire us at our reasonable rates to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure this out in court, I'm trying to
teach people do it now and when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: hugging and kissing, figure out how you're
going to disagree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the best time to figure out the
breakup is maybe before you're hugging and
[SPEAKER_02]: kissing, before you sign the contract,
and it's many times like a prenup,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's good for people to think about
what happens because if they have
[SPEAKER_02]: expectations that they don't want a
breakup to happen and it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: very painful breakup, many times that will
help them adhere to their obligations and
[SPEAKER_02]: not be so cavalier about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always encourage my clients to put it
in writing and be very definite about the
[SPEAKER_02]: terms and the more you think about the
terms, the more granular it can get,
[SPEAKER_02]: is it a good idea to have a template that
gives the client the whole range of
[SPEAKER_02]: possibilities and all the points of
negotiation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're doing them a service
instead of charging them on a per contract
[SPEAKER_02]: basis to come up with a master contract
and teach them what the points of
[SPEAKER_02]: negotiation are and then they can figure
that out on their own and put that in the
[SPEAKER_02]: contract.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many times it's always good for them to
have it reviewed, so I always tell my
[SPEAKER_02]: clients, you can go ahead and write your
contract, but if you want to run it by me,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to cost a lot less money
because it's an edit, it's not writing
[SPEAKER_02]: from scratch and that way you have a
second pair of eyes on it and it's always
[SPEAKER_02]: good to have somebody else look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Myself with my own work, I always have
somebody look at it and I always sleep on
[SPEAKER_02]: it if I have a chance to look at it with
fresh eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a round of cannibalism in some of
the legacy people right now who just
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't paying for the products they're
receiving, they're spending money on other
[SPEAKER_01]: things and not paying the suppliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a huge mess that's going to have to
be fixed somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it cannibalism because the industry
tends to either form a circular firing
[SPEAKER_01]: squad or eat itself up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me what you see coming with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think you make a very good point
that a lot of people are robbing Peter to
[SPEAKER_02]: pay Paul and by that I mean it's usually
distribution companies who are getting
[SPEAKER_02]: fronted all this product and they're
making promises that once it sells,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll pay you and then these poor farmers
are waiting and waiting and waiting and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not getting paid and there's
always a new excuse and so I have heard
[SPEAKER_02]: many stories like what you're mentioning
because right now I think there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: standard terms in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no industry standard anything and
so it hasn't really been defined.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely going to be the very
ethical distribution companies,
[SPEAKER_02]: very ethical cultivators, manufacturers,
retailers who probably will set like best
[SPEAKER_02]: practices that will just thrive and be
successful business models that everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: will imitate but for now that has not yet
emerged and there's a lot of like business
[SPEAKER_02]: models that are basically underwritten by
venture capitalists who are burning money
[SPEAKER_02]: and giving them seven years runway to make
stupid decisions and many companies have
[SPEAKER_02]: that you know kind of long runway and so
we're seeing a lot of distortions in the
[SPEAKER_02]: market because very inefficient operations
are gaining market share and they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: producing any money.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like losing money you know faster
than they can gain it but then they're
[SPEAKER_02]: able to claim that they're making tens of
millions of dollars in revenues while
[SPEAKER_02]: omitting the inconvenient fact that
they're losing far more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're being enabled to be
inefficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a recent laboratory problem in
Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it looks like there was at least
fraudulent activity maybe criminal
[SPEAKER_02]: activity and now the lab director said
that he had been you know keeping it from
[SPEAKER_02]: the owner and from everybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which kind of almost points like gross you
know negligence on the part of others.
[SPEAKER_01]: The phrase they had was penny wise and
pound foolish because they had no one
[SPEAKER_01]: watching him to make sure he was really
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my question is this may be the first
time or an insurance company says no we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to deny a claim because it was our
liabilities based on criminal activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you seeing any holes in the insurance
industry for the supply chain that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to contract or bridge around or do
you see that everything is now covered by
[SPEAKER_01]: an insurance policy of some kind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well there's insurance companies that will
sell insurance for pretty much every need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether or not they actually pay on
these claims or claim that the exclusions
[SPEAKER_02]: you know are triggered and that they don't
have to pay the claim is a totally
[SPEAKER_02]: different question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I happen to know an insurance
executive who basically tells me that a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of times when they're writing the
exclusions they're trying to make it so
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're paying minimal claims you
know and that they can litigate all of
[SPEAKER_02]: these non payment claims against a bad
faith insurance denies a lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think insurance companies are pretty
slick in what they do like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard too many cases of
insurance companies paying claims you know
[SPEAKER_02]: and making good on the coverage.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making a killing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody has to get insurance these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was an insurance defense lawyer so I've
had these discussions about reserving
[SPEAKER_01]: money and I know how they play the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've also had some discussions with
attorneys who are coverage counsel who
[SPEAKER_01]: specialize and review things that tell me
that these non admitted carriers are
[SPEAKER_01]: playing fast and loose and you're going to
have a hard time doing anything to them if
[SPEAKER_01]: they really deny and dump and run on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're not like writing their
exclusions carefully enough or they're
[SPEAKER_02]: making implied representations you know
that are contrary.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably doing all sorts of
sketchy things you know telling people
[SPEAKER_02]: like hey I'm this is perfect insurance for
your business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I have been involved in some bad
faith cases where the people that were
[SPEAKER_01]: selling the policies are making
representations and when it got the
[SPEAKER_01]: company went I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see a lot of that coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm my curiosity will peak when the
first big claim gets denied and a company
[SPEAKER_01]: takes a nosedive and fails and they have a
bad faith case because the appellate
[SPEAKER_01]: courts have lots of precedents for bad
faith.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they recently last year allowed
cannabis specific contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember when they amended those rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe 1150.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you can write a cannabis specific
California contract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when Lloyd's of London's writing it
they're right not writing it for
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see some definitional problems that
will get some denials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right they will fight that and
pay a claim because it's cheaper to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: taking the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see any other holes or problems in
the insurance coverage besides or just not
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean cannabis events you know like also
like there's probably got once all the
[SPEAKER_02]: product liability claims start coming in
product liability insurance skyrocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know there's probably going to be a
lot of like denials based on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I think there's like a few lawyers
who specialize in insurance law.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to have a lot of work in
the next few years because there's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be like increasingly more insurance
companies are going to start insuring
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis activity and that inevitably
leads to claims and litigation over
[SPEAKER_02]: claims.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean like you're saying like this whole
lab thing like you know would that be
[SPEAKER_02]: covered by the insurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: They probably have some sort of exclusion
about like ultra various activity and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to say this guy was not
acting within the scope of his duties.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know or maybe they're saying the
owners or whoever the name insured is was
[SPEAKER_02]: negligent and in breach of the policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They admitted it already Omar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have someone watching him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh bad move.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't spend the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was you know being penny wise and pound
foolish.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he admitted to defrauding an
official or falsifying an official
[SPEAKER_01]: statement that carries criminal sanctions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would deny it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like being drunk and get into an
accident and kill somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just shut up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't say nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah yeah yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've already sunk their ship.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they have a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: No obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well if they did you just have to wonder
was he awake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let them go out and do things like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many lawyers have potted plants and you
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well it's part of the pivot into this
industry to understand who you're dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: with here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had been to the lab and walked around
and you know asked some questions about if
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to defend you for what you're doing
there how do you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're taking pictures keeping track and
keeping records and they didn't really
[SPEAKER_01]: have a lot of answers because I'm a trial
lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got sued somebody died.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I defend you and prove that it
wasn't you that killed him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are discussions.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we show that there's no chance of
contamination here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a new provision added into
events for a five hundred dollars to
[SPEAKER_01]: change a premise to monitor modify a
premise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was talking to Susan's stories this
morning about that and she goes what's
[SPEAKER_01]: this here for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did they add a five hundred dollars to
change the modify a premise for an eye for
[SPEAKER_01]: an event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I I don't have an answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went back and looked at the statement
of reasons we couldn't find anything in
[SPEAKER_01]: there about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah my guess on that would be that
they're trying to discourage people from
[SPEAKER_02]: last minute modifications because like so
many of these event applications they
[SPEAKER_02]: submit an initial application that is bare
bones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the last second they're
submitting all these like new change of
[SPEAKER_02]: premises and new list of vendors and new
list of participants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know this is before like all the
new regs kick in requiring like
[SPEAKER_02]: responsibility by the event organizer and
babysitting of all the every all the
[SPEAKER_02]: licensees at the event and making sure
there's no unlicensed sales and making
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that the 21 and over area remains 21
and over and cannot be seen you know from
[SPEAKER_02]: outside and all of those requirements.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the main reason they put that
in I think is you know it's all
[SPEAKER_02]: speculative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well and we don't have the AOL telling us
we're going to let this through or not let
[SPEAKER_01]: it through either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that comes January you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm hoping is an issue that is
important to me would be the cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I challenge the definition of light
deprivation as mixed light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said and I submitted a very detailed
you know opposition and strenuous
[SPEAKER_02]: objections saying that mixed light
according to the statute requires
[SPEAKER_02]: supplemental artificial lighting and that
light deprivation artificial darkness is
[SPEAKER_02]: not supplemental artificial lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it may be an artificial
manipulation of the light period the photo
[SPEAKER_02]: period.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not what the legislature was
talking about when it came up with three
[SPEAKER_02]: categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really light that should be outdoors
and you know in the eyesore the initial
[SPEAKER_02]: statement of reasons I think CDFA said
well because you could get multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: harvests using light that then we really
believe that it should be classified as
[SPEAKER_02]: mixed light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking if you could get multiple
harvests and the consumers increase
[SPEAKER_02]: regular regulatory oversight just give
them extra inspections.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to redefine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of outdoor growers who if
they were allowed to use light that it
[SPEAKER_02]: would really mean the difference between
barely scraping by and making a decent
[SPEAKER_02]: living not a great living not you know the
olden days but definitely not barely
[SPEAKER_02]: scraping by.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's an important issue that I have
I don't know just kind of like pursued and
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you know nobody's going to pay me
to write about that because it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: not you know the poor farmers who need
that can't afford a lawyer to lobby on
[SPEAKER_02]: their behalf.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did it as a citizen it was like my
you know pro bono contribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had an issue with no new COA without
remediation if it turns out the labs
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes if I have R&D testing it shows that
I've got this or that's not there and all
[SPEAKER_01]: of a sudden it shows up and I can't get a
new COA without remediation and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing to remediate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes the lab will readily admit
we're wrong you know we it did not pass
[SPEAKER_02]: testing there's no COA but under the
previous interpretations they couldn't do
[SPEAKER_02]: anything about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't know what is the latest
draft of the regs that December draft say.
[SPEAKER_01]: There there's a remediation plan and when
I asked Lori this at a meeting so if I
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you I've got R&D testing all along
the line that this batch was clean and now
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes out dirty can I submit that on a
plan and get a new retest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know language change that I'm
aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know I would I would still do
it I submitted a remediation plan that I
[SPEAKER_01]: want a new COA because they're wrong and I
can prove it sure and I think that I could
[SPEAKER_01]: probably get one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah there needs to be like some error
correction and maybe they should give like
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see a regulation that
gives the regulators some discretion you
[SPEAKER_02]: know just to like correct equity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old common law I don't have a word for
it's the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The doctrine of equity and I don't know
what that would be maybe I was just like
[SPEAKER_02]: an error correction regulation you know
they have the power to like make it make
[SPEAKER_02]: it right and effectuate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well it can kill let's say a cultivator
has his entire harvest in something you
[SPEAKER_01]: failed the COA and you know I started
testing from day one and it's clean I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't get paid and I'm gonna go bankrupt
and you won't give me a retest until I fix
[SPEAKER_01]: it there's nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the concern I always had a big
person or a big corporation moving a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of biomass they could probably set on
something for a minute these smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: people can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very interested in organizing up in El
Dorado where I'm doing work these small
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cooperative associations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have if you have an idea about
this they exempt antitrust for that
[SPEAKER_01]: association itself but it's got a limit on
it four acres but if four or five of them
[SPEAKER_01]: come together I then started asking
questions where's the antitrust line for
[SPEAKER_01]: them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah a combination of cooperatives I think
they don't have any antitrust protection
[SPEAKER_02]: the cooperative itself has antitrust
protection there's no limit on the size of
[SPEAKER_02]: the cooperative is there?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a four acre cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh that's not very large.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well then I think these cannabis
cooperatives need to start lobbying to
[SPEAKER_02]: lift that four acre cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four acre cap is ridiculous it's obviously
low considering that some of these Santa
[SPEAKER_02]: Barbara licensees own far more than four
acres you know with cumulative permits I
[SPEAKER_02]: think it makes sense to like change it so
that these cooperative associations could
[SPEAKER_02]: have maybe 40 acres which is not really
that much when you think about it you know
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the traditional 40 acres and a meal
which is enough to like support one family
[SPEAKER_02]: it wasn't all that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well there are regions I know Mendo and
Casey O'Neill I've talked to him Hezekiah
[SPEAKER_01]: was working in that same area to organize
them and we're gonna take the templates
[SPEAKER_01]: over across the valley but we want to work
in these mountainous production areas
[SPEAKER_01]: cooperatively and I don't think we have an
answer yet as to how far you can go to try
[SPEAKER_01]: and sell in bulk without getting accused
of manipulating the market in a
[SPEAKER_01]: combination and restraint of trade so
that's interesting to roll it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah that is very interesting there has
been serious enforcement by the attorney
[SPEAKER_02]: general when it comes to that you know
just like there has been serious
[SPEAKER_02]: enforcement by attorney general when it
came to all the medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: collectives or cooperatives and they made
a switch from not-for-profit to for-profit
[SPEAKER_02]: entities and many times did it without
taking a vote of the membership or
[SPEAKER_02]: following any of the rules required of
cooperatives and the attorney general was
[SPEAKER_02]: absent in the enforcement of the law
entirely I haven't seen any indication
[SPEAKER_02]: that the AG is gonna step in and start
saying hey there's you know somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to corner the weed market and make
a killing but I'm sure somebody can and
[SPEAKER_02]: would because cornering the market is as
old you know it's just like market
[SPEAKER_02]: manipulation one-on-one until somebody
like you know I'm happy that the I think
[SPEAKER_02]: Malkursa expressly says that there shall
not be restraints on trade and
[SPEAKER_02]: combinations which tend to diminish
competition that's really important that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's in there in the statute because there
is a appreciable risk unfortunately
[SPEAKER_02]: there's nobody in charge of it I don't see
like an enforcement unit within the Bureau
[SPEAKER_02]: of Cannabis Control focused on anti-trust
or you know anti-competitiveness and there
[SPEAKER_02]: probably is some anti-competitive actions
not that I'm aware of but there's got to
[SPEAKER_02]: be you know it's just the natural flow of
capitalism when it's completely you know
[SPEAKER_02]: unregulated somebody's got to try to take
advantage well we all have a hustle some
[SPEAKER_02]: of us have a license to our hustle you
know yeah well and of course cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: tends to attract people with a high-risk
tolerance and who are usually not gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: like scrupulous adherence of regulatory
regimes and so you know put those together
[SPEAKER_02]: and the scoff laws some people call the
black market the free people's market and
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the latter better it's
laissez-faire capitalism yes and we had
[SPEAKER_02]: that with Prop 215 and Senate Bill 420 and
everything up until Malkursa you know
[SPEAKER_02]: people blame Prop 64 for ruining the party
but it was really ruined by the
[SPEAKER_02]: legislature and Malkursa's predecessor
Mkursa or Mimursa that was a boil on your
[SPEAKER_01]: butt we couldn't say that too much how is
money being moved between operators now I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean de facto how is that being done I
think a lot of it remains cash which is
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually taken to the tax collector you
know there's some banking I have a few
[SPEAKER_02]: clients who have like you know these
marijuana banking accounts and they play
[SPEAKER_02]: exorbitant fees for but it makes things a
lot easier but that really disadvantages
[SPEAKER_02]: the smaller operators I don't see a viable
banking solution that is readily available
[SPEAKER_02]: for the smaller operators at this junction
usually they have to be you know almost
[SPEAKER_02]: big enough to own a bank to get a bank
account in a regulated cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: well and I know you and I believe that we
want to encourage the smaller craft
[SPEAKER_01]: operators and the corporate people coming
in have the better business acumen and the
[SPEAKER_01]: more money but you know my heart's not
really into it it's not that I don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: clients like that but they have to agree
with my ethos in business before I take
[SPEAKER_01]: them on as a client sure and one of the
one of my big issues right now is
[SPEAKER_01]: recycling everything out of this industry
and putting in sustainable practices I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to figure out the cultivation waste
and the minimum compost it don't just
[SPEAKER_01]: throw it into a landfill somewhere but the
the biomass the post extraction biomass is
[SPEAKER_01]: in regulatory hell in the public resources
recycling environment right now
[SPEAKER_01]: it's being stacked in warehouses right now
because it it's off gassing it's got if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a volatile extraction it's off
gassing and the Bureau of Toxic Substance
[SPEAKER_01]: Control did a test where they put fish in
a barrel of water and they put the stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: in and it's supposed to test at what level
of the toxic well apparently they
[SPEAKER_01]: suffocated the fish and no oxygen
basically is toxic okay so now we have
[SPEAKER_01]: declarations of at least especially
handled waste and if it's hazardous it
[SPEAKER_01]: really gets ugly if it's toxic it's got to
be trucked to Utah you got to entertain
[SPEAKER_01]: transportation permit so it you hit a
brick wall like a ticking time bomb for a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of these companies well and one of the
discussions we had with the
[SPEAKER_01]: environmentalists who are on the boot the
ground is they said go ask them about
[SPEAKER_01]: eucalyptus leaves post extraction what do
they do with that nice and she goes just
[SPEAKER_01]: hang on to this because when they get
really stupid and you go okay but you just
[SPEAKER_01]: dump post extracted eucalyptus biomass
where what do you do with it that's some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the juxtapositions we're gonna have to
make between what they make us do sure and
[SPEAKER_01]: the other side you don't care or you go to
Walmart and right there's the liquor aisle
[SPEAKER_01]: and right there's the kids toys yeah and
yet we owe the children don't forget the
[SPEAKER_02]: children I'll ask you first what was the
biggest surprise of 2018 how ill prepared
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry was for phase two testing it
was a may it was a major fail on a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses that they didn't anticipate and
the the unregulated market was still
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to push invert product in and move
it through and and they just got caught
[SPEAKER_01]: with a bunch of product in places where
now it's worthless in this system and now
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to sneak it back out and they
exposed themselves to problems and I
[SPEAKER_01]: thought somebody just was not awake
thinking about what was going to happen
[SPEAKER_01]: when you not have to test for all this
stuff and your products worthless so I was
[SPEAKER_01]: a bit surprised at how naive they were and
okay what were you most surprised about in
[SPEAKER_02]: 2018 I wasn't expecting all these
extinction events which we might be seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: another one you know with phase three
testing starting January 1st or the summer
[SPEAKER_02]: 31st technically but like you said that
July this location of the market was super
[SPEAKER_02]: disruptive you know we thought like by now
by you know what December 15th 2018 the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations would have been permanent I
don't think anybody expected us to be
[SPEAKER_02]: still operating under emergency
regulations with high uncertainty about
[SPEAKER_02]: what the final form of the final permanent
regulations will take it's completely
[SPEAKER_02]: indeterminate and this level of
uncertainty is not something I anticipated
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it would be pretty figured out
by now I also thought that track and trace
[SPEAKER_02]: would be in place by now and that's just
turned out to be like some sort of bad
[SPEAKER_02]: joke that nobody wants to think about I
you know I don't know what accountability
[SPEAKER_02]: needs to be had but this whole track and
trace has been a complete snafu and needs
[SPEAKER_02]: to be revisited because it's obviously not
operational and we were promised to
[SPEAKER_02]: operate operationality like a long time
ago so I didn't really expect that we'd
[SPEAKER_02]: still be operating under emergency regs
and that track and trace would not be
[SPEAKER_01]: operational you know I don't see it I
don't see a cure Maryland went live and it
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately crashed yeah and Maryland the
state is like a corner of one part of LA
[SPEAKER_01]: County like you guys are killing me you're
gonna turn it on it's gonna crash and now
[SPEAKER_01]: what there's no plan B the paper received
are a recipe for fraud and apparently
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a bunch of techies in the Bay Area
who saw this crash coming and there is a
[SPEAKER_02]: plan B that they're waiting for for track
and trace to flame out entirely I have
[SPEAKER_01]: some some tech geek friends of mine who
the same thing it's like they see
[SPEAKER_01]: something coming we got some plans here
yeah but I'm so IT challenged like oh tell
[SPEAKER_01]: me oh it went over my head yeah let me
know how it works out exactly hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody will come up with a solution
because this track and trace is just gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: like be bigger than a regulatory burn just
like a tech headache that nobody do you
[SPEAKER_01]: remember the DMV system they kept spending
millions and millions they finally just
[SPEAKER_01]: burned it at what point do you burn it and
move on and then who gets sued for
[SPEAKER_01]: incompetence for letting them get a
contract for this I don't know it's
[SPEAKER_01]: government procurement right yes the
giraffe was started out as a horse and
[SPEAKER_02]: sent to the legislature right so I guess
let me ask you what predictions will you
[SPEAKER_01]: make for 2019 that people who are not
willing to accept that this system exists
[SPEAKER_01]: are gonna die yeah you keep asking why
just go find another job yeah so and if
[SPEAKER_01]: you really get the program like George
Carlin said you'd be sitting there just
[SPEAKER_01]: taking notes how crazy yeah it's really
crazy but you didn't do it right we lost
[SPEAKER_01]: 60% of our cultivators because they
couldn't finish the loop up they started
[SPEAKER_01]: temporary and just threw their hands up so
we don't have enough of the market yet
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got to rebuild itself and the people
who are just not going to get it are gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: die they're circling the drain they don't
know it they're circling the drain right
[SPEAKER_01]: now like in the regulated market you mean
yeah oh yeah this is not a game yeah you
[SPEAKER_01]: got to play by the rules oh no that's not
going away the black market black market
[SPEAKER_02]: is still strong and independent in
parallel but yeah we're talking about the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulated market he's talking about like a
lot of the I don't know the operators who
[SPEAKER_01]: are just kind of like there they still
think they can tread water is gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: okay no you're gonna sink and die you
better hire people that know what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing and you go in your lane grow good
pot let somebody run the business get a
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance person quality control quality
assurance has to be there or you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: being stupid that's that's stupid so some
people aren't edumacatable it's just you
[SPEAKER_01]: know it's like okay then you don't want me
as your lawyer I'm firing myself goodbye
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not listening so I guess my
prediction would be there's probably gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: be increased enforcement after the
collective and cooperative defense expires
[SPEAKER_02]: January 9th and we'll see like I don't
know what you know type of enforcement
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll see maybe all the unlicensed we map
suspensories maybe we maps itself will
[SPEAKER_01]: become subject to enforcement I had an
ongoing discussion about that because of
[SPEAKER_01]: my experience that aiding a better betting
and conspiracy to violate the federal law
[SPEAKER_01]: is a real thing when you have unlicensed
outside our federal protection from
[SPEAKER_01]: Rohrbacher you're playing some games here
and there's people watching yeah and they
[SPEAKER_01]: they were poking Lori you can't do
anything to me I've represented enough
[SPEAKER_01]: cops to know that I didn't get you today
but I know who you are I think that kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of explains 503 to they said there's a lot
of well unlicensed that in ease is another
[SPEAKER_01]: one that was playing fast and loose we're
a tech platform everybody knew what they
[SPEAKER_01]: were doing there was pictures I was
looking at yes you are delivering and you
[SPEAKER_01]: got stock in your warehouse so stop it I
was found that finally kind of in house
[SPEAKER_02]: incredulous when I would hear like you
know these tech companies say we're a tech
[SPEAKER_02]: platform I'm like really I never I was
never taught about that in law school the
[SPEAKER_02]: tech platform exception to every law yeah
yeah yeah don't you know it's in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Universal Convention at the Hague don't
you know right now but see people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: that's naive there they're doing it's not
gonna make it my other prediction would be
[SPEAKER_02]: like for cannabis events now with AB 2020
coming in they're not gonna be just a
[SPEAKER_02]: fairgrounds you know that we're gonna see
big events probably at first but
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually they're gonna be medium-sized
and smaller events and these these are no
[SPEAKER_02]: longer prop 215 areas these are just like
straight up a we used to have to sneak our
[SPEAKER_01]: pot into concerts and you could buy liquor
there okay my kids play in bands and my my
[SPEAKER_01]: nephew does too it's like you need a venue
you can go there and really let them sneak
[SPEAKER_01]: their whiskey in but let them get their
cannabis and consume it and let's let's
[SPEAKER_01]: open some concerts back up where we can
they don't have to be woodstock but small
[SPEAKER_01]: to medium venues can put on decent music
events have cannabis consumption or
[SPEAKER_01]: deliver it there so you follow all the
directions give them a place to do it help
[SPEAKER_01]: have a sports bar or something you can't
make money it's like if the government
[SPEAKER_01]: can't make money to whorehouse you got no
business doing it you can do this because
[SPEAKER_01]: people want cannabis they can consume
where they go here just not like booze I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean like the way the event regs read like
temporary for these temporary cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: events the delivery only retailers can
also retail at events so if you had a
[SPEAKER_02]: delivery service you can be selling set up
a booth at an event or get a organizer
[SPEAKER_02]: license and set up your own event and then
direct a consumer retailing without having
[SPEAKER_02]: to get one of those super expensive
storefront dispensary licenses we tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: rent a hall to put on an event and for 50
bucks I could get a liquor license I could
[SPEAKER_01]: get a flicker license for $50 there's like
80 different types you can get but oh the
[SPEAKER_01]: children we can't let you have this so
eventually they'll catch up with the
[SPEAKER_01]: reality of what people want to do but
today today you you you
