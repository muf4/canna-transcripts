[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Jeremy Moberg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm CEO of Kennesaw Farms and president
and founder of the Washington Sungrowers
[SPEAKER_01]: Industry Association, which is a group in
Washington state that represents sun
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and Hi guys, I'm Jade Stefano and
I'm CEO and co-founder of puffin farm also
[SPEAKER_00]: a sungrown farm and I'm also on the board
of directors of the Washington Sungrowers
[SPEAKER_01]: Industry Association as well and we were
going to talk about start the conversation
[SPEAKER_01]: off with How we select strains and how we
kind of follow the market trends on
[SPEAKER_01]: strains, which can be a really annoying
thing actually So I know that I I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: think I've I chased the strains as much
and I don't think you're a big change
[SPEAKER_01]: Tracer either I'm not following the
Instagrams looking for what's hot You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, was it wedding cake or wedding Mac
or Mac or any of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've I've taken sort of a Kind of
a slower approach but not to say that we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have What we call signature strains
and in Kennesaw Farms Which is a really
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult thing to do to kind of claim a
strain and to make it Sort of your brand
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you've had you have a couple
strains We have a couple strains that we
[SPEAKER_00]: are that are have a cult following in
Washington We have a Hindu Kush which
[SPEAKER_00]: originally came out of Oregon as a clone
only and we also have a high CBD strain
[SPEAKER_00]: called dance hall which originated from
Spain and those are seeds that we imported
[SPEAKER_00]: from Spain prior to Legalization back in
the medical days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you sprouted and so we sprouted that
one Yeah, and so both the other one was a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone The other one was a clone that we
are given by an Oregon grower a friend of
[SPEAKER_00]: ours And so those two strains the reason
why we have stuck with those is when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing outdoors You can't really
grow every strain you have to grow it
[SPEAKER_00]: works in your environment So we originally
started out with maybe 50 100 strains and
[SPEAKER_00]: we've winnowed it down to like the ones
that really win on our terroir so like
[SPEAKER_00]: some strains they might do beautifully
indoors at our farm they don't do well and
[SPEAKER_00]: They might do well at Jeremy's farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taken a little bit of different
approach I believe that I can grow any
[SPEAKER_01]: strain except for the completely
equatorial strains Those are just out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the question can't be can't really be
grown in a commercial environment at all
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you get irritated when you see or have
you ever seen a different like the Hindu
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush?
[SPEAKER_01]: Produced by a different farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there are other Hindu Kush
phenotypes out there and which we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: told ours is the best one in Washington
and so They're not the other ones are not
[SPEAKER_00]: super powerful popular from what I can
tell and people say that ours is the best
[SPEAKER_00]: so ours is kind of Really establish itself
in the market, but there are Hindu but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of hard to own a strain It is
and we don't own it and but we have the we
[SPEAKER_00]: this phenotype though is is very special
It is a huge producer outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is an early season finisher and it
tastes Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's beautiful bud structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like indoor weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got everything going for his
disease resistant It's like the miracle
[SPEAKER_00]: strain and we just got so Lucky and
blessed to be given that and so,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that was pure luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't even seek that out Someone gave
that to us as a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that was our that was definitely
a clear champion and every year after year
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great producer and does amazing a
produces often tend to one to other
[SPEAKER_00]: strains That we grow like dance hall for
instance and some of the CBD strains We do
[SPEAKER_00]: specialize in CBD strains, which has
differentiated us in the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're abysmal producers for the most
part But we provide that for people that
[SPEAKER_00]: need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to grow it And it helps us get a
niche that we wouldn't otherwise have and
[SPEAKER_00]: we have three quarters of an acre of
canopy 30,000 square feet our farm We're
[SPEAKER_00]: on a 20 acre farm by the river.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do full season Jeremy does And so we've
got a little different model going as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as and he can grow more strains Like he
said he can grow anything because he does
[SPEAKER_00]: light depth with a full season.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're much more limited You're so limited
at the northern latitudes by what you can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow full term And so it really becomes
the full terms that you know, it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's low.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's low cost you can produce some really
nice Material from it and it's really an
[SPEAKER_01]: expression of the terrarium of the of the
weather and everything and so We do have
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of our signature strains We call them
kind of picked them up when you know in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2011 when you started seeing clone markets
in Seattle You know, that was the very
[SPEAKER_01]: first time where I could like go get
genetics and go buy a clone You know
[SPEAKER_01]: besides like from a friend, you know,
and that was really amazing So I started
[SPEAKER_01]: just getting everything that I could and I
went up to about 250 Clones at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning and have whittled that down And
I'm always somewhere between 80 and 150
[SPEAKER_01]: different clones our signature strains as
we call them are Alice in Wonderland,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was a clone that we picked up in the
medical market in 2011 Double lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: cheesecake was also a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We picked up back then and then Cassie's
honey which came from The CBD project and
[SPEAKER_01]: Ringo's farm in California and that's been
an amazing one that we have Popularized as
[SPEAKER_01]: as a strain and then on the full term side
we had a strain that local Okanagan where
[SPEAKER_01]: we are man had been breeding and it was It
was harvested like in mid September,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is just great for outdoors And so we
started crossing that with everything
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was high terpene high cabernet
So now we have all these juicy crosses I
[SPEAKER_01]: got the juicy double lemon juicy Durbin
juicy Alice in Wonderland and so that's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of how we've handled the Full-term
outdoor market one thing we've discovered
[SPEAKER_00]: we've both been licensed for five and a
half years at this point we're going into
[SPEAKER_00]: our sixth season and so it's definitely a
game of like branding and distinguishing
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and and going in and talking to
people and You know getting to know the
[SPEAKER_00]: bud tenders getting to know the buyers And
so we spend quite a bit of time at events
[SPEAKER_00]: going into stores talking to people making
friends You know smoking people out and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a large social element to all this
and you know You could be a really great
[SPEAKER_00]: grower and have beautiful flower,
but if you can't Get in and and be there
[SPEAKER_00]: on the ground to interact with people It
gets really difficult and then and the
[SPEAKER_00]: brand is really important to you have to
have a brand that resonates with people
[SPEAKER_00]: That's attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty you have to think about
packaging and there's a lot to this It's
[SPEAKER_00]: not I mean you can grow great weed But if
you can't sell it it doesn't do you any
[SPEAKER_00]: good and selling it is a lot more about
personal relationships as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging and branding that it is
necessarily about the quality and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually proven when there's a lot of
shitty weed and Beautiful well branded
[SPEAKER_01]: packages is doing quite well Yeah,
no, it's and when you have a brand that
[SPEAKER_01]: You're trying to appeal say to a 45 year
old demographic and your bud tenders and
[SPEAKER_01]: your and your buyers are in their mid-20s
and more concerned about the Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: account than really you know the
sustainability or the practices that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using That becomes very difficult
so your your audience is maybe a 40 year
[SPEAKER_01]: old woman But you've got to get past the
25 year old kid that you know for some
[SPEAKER_01]: reason is In charge of buying because the
owner is a little bit disconnected and
[SPEAKER_01]: thinks that well all the all the young
kids know weed the most you know and so
[SPEAKER_01]: that becomes difficult to get past and You
know and then so then you're like you're
[SPEAKER_01]: really having to schmooze These these bud
tenders and you know and they're the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that are reacting like to the next
greatest strain and everything Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so there is definitely this market
pressure to sort of chase the next best
[SPEAKER_01]: strain We kind of believe or I kind of
believe that A lot of my demographic or
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of soul consumers really want to
establish what they like and they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: stick with it And they're not really
chasing the next thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's more of the younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah generation Yeah, I agree with all
that and one thing I am seeing though just
[SPEAKER_00]: to give a little more hope to the
situation is that some of these young kids
[SPEAKER_00]: are they're smart and they They start
learning about terpenes and they start
[SPEAKER_00]: actually tasting a difference themselves
And it kind of opens their eyes to like
[SPEAKER_00]: this whole new world So once you get past
that barrier with them that they can that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's about terpenes and it's about the
experience Flavor and it's not about the
[SPEAKER_00]: brand or how the buds look they get really
excited about it And there's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: become a following there's like young,
you know millennial kids who are like
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil fanboys and fangirls and it's
really great to see that and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that is kind of the last two
years is becoming more and more evident
[SPEAKER_00]: where you'll see these millennial bud
hunters showing up to Cultivation panels
[SPEAKER_00]: to listen about living soil, which is just
great and that's given me some hope and
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington in particular like Oregon and
California doesn't have this problem so
[SPEAKER_01]: much In Washington, we have such a long
history of indoor growing that all there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just this there is this sort of
look and feel for marijuana that the
[SPEAKER_01]: market has has kept going after and To see
the bud tenders finally starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that high quality Cannabis can
be grown under the Sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, what we're learning is higher
quality cannabis because we're not only
[SPEAKER_01]: not even to mention the environmental
impacts but also the Kaminoids and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Turpenes are generally higher when grown
outside under the right conditions and
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly light depth when you're
taking advantage of those hot dry summer
[SPEAKER_01]: days and so we're slowly starting to get
some bud tenders to kind of come around
[SPEAKER_01]: and understand the value of sun grown and
the harm of indoor grown and in one way we
[SPEAKER_01]: do that is that we we are about ready to
come on to our second annual Sun Cup and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's held right around 420 in Earth Day
because before 20 there was another
[SPEAKER_01]: holiday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called Earth Day and now 420 kind
of took over Earth Day and in Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly they're celebrating indoor
grown a Cannabis that just has a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to bring that discussion
back in and then the judges are all bud
[SPEAKER_01]: tenders So we're you know trying to get
bud tenders to to appreciate Sun grown
[SPEAKER_01]: give them give them a judging position.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all get excited they They they tell
all their friends, you know and then all
[SPEAKER_01]: of a sudden you start to lose the biased
against it, but Washington unlike other
[SPEAKER_01]: markets will at least what California and
Oregon is very biased towards indoors and
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're gonna see this bias continue
as legalization goes to the east and we
[SPEAKER_01]: really Washington really needs to get a
handle on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean for example, you know, Willie
Nelson has a brand out there and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: primarily indoor grown and then he puts
out a brand called Sun grown and of
[SPEAKER_01]: course, it's cheaper and and lower quality
and at the bottom of the shelf so even
[SPEAKER_01]: Willie, you know, probably unbeknownst to
him is is propagating this idea that
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor Cannabis is is a higher quality and
should be more expensive our companies in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular We're we believe that people
want to pay for these words sustainability
[SPEAKER_01]: organic things that they're used to seeing
as as as top shelf, you know when the when
[SPEAKER_01]: the consumer comes in and they're driving
a Prius and we're in Patagonia and they
[SPEAKER_01]: ask for sustainable weed and they're sent
to the bottom shelf, you know that
[SPEAKER_01]: retailer just left money on the table and
so that it's starting to change where
[SPEAKER_01]: we're being active in changing those
perceptions, but Washington in particular
[SPEAKER_01]: as a really strong biased against Sun
grown Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no the policy standpoint so we get
one harvest a year maybe two so we can we
[SPEAKER_00]: can grow the same canopy We've got 30,000
square feet as does an indoor farm which
[SPEAKER_00]: can flip that canopy five plus times So
I'm an indoor farm of the same license
[SPEAKER_00]: size can grow Five to ten times the amount
depending on the strain choice and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of growing methods There's a lot of other
stuff that goes into yields co2 enrichment
[SPEAKER_00]: light intensity so they can grow much much
much more cannabis at an indoor farm and
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to shoulder all the same expenses
the only the only place we have the lower
[SPEAKER_00]: cost of production is with the Electrical
the lighting the HVAC which is a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: place to be able to save money But when
they have the economy of scale of having
[SPEAKER_00]: five to ten times of production they can
kind of absorb that extra cost and Put the
[SPEAKER_00]: craft growers in a really hard position
where we have a lot of the same expenses
[SPEAKER_00]: we can't sell our weed for as much because
it's outdoor and We can't grow as much and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's it's surprising to hear probably
that we you know would say that Indoor has
[SPEAKER_01]: the scale and that's because of the of how
the LCB in Washington has regulated Canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: it's by the square foot so they didn't pay
attention at all to the annual cycle or
[SPEAKER_01]: how many times you could run that square
foot so Our square foot of a Sun grower is
[SPEAKER_01]: not equal to an indoor square foot,
you know You can run that indoor square
[SPEAKER_01]: foot five times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a tier three Indoor is actually
equivalent to five to three sun grown and
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's where that difference comes and
we've we've You know, there's this there's
[SPEAKER_01]: an idea in the industry that the
overproduction is coming from Outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: grown and that definitely is partially
true.
[SPEAKER_01]: However indoor growers are also adding to
a And it really hasn't that impact has not
[SPEAKER_01]: been assessed correctly by the LCB They
just did a canopy report and came out and
[SPEAKER_01]: did canopy assessments at all the farms
and they failed to To account for how many
[SPEAKER_01]: times that square footage was being used
and so all things all other things being
[SPEAKER_01]: equal They want to say well the outdoor
growers have are seem to be growing more
[SPEAKER_01]: over canopy But really without the
temporal aspect of it Clearly the indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: growers are able under the same amount of
square footage able to produce much much
[SPEAKER_00]: more Yeah, and in fact Washington State
was gonna make outdoor growing completely
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal initially and then thanks to
Jeremy here he kind of saved the day along
[SPEAKER_00]: with a couple other people they he went in
and he lobbied and he educated the
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians and the administrators and You
know was able to make it so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: grow outdoors But at the end of the day we
were given a penalty which is the canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: we he was we weren't able to get a Canopy
with parity to indoor growing and so we
[SPEAKER_00]: were put at a disadvantage and a liquor
board has been quoted as saying that we
[SPEAKER_00]: made a business decision to grow outdoors
so we can grow less that's our fault for
[SPEAKER_00]: not choosing to grow indoors and having to
spend five million dollars to build out a
[SPEAKER_00]: facility is the unsaid part there as well
as pollute the environment and Increase
[SPEAKER_00]: global warming and do all these other
things that really kill the orcas that
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't benefit society while we're in
the midst of a environmental global
[SPEAKER_00]: warming carbon crisis Well and policies
being rolled out that is increasing this
[SPEAKER_01]: problem by our governor who's running for
president who was kind of asleep at the
[SPEAKER_01]: wheel as as the cannabis industry sort of
you know just came into being and Started
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming two to four percent of the
state's hydroelectric power, you know This
[SPEAKER_01]: is clean power that is not producing
carbons and should be protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing we should be doing with our
clean hydroelectric Resources is producing
[SPEAKER_01]: a recreational drug crop when you can
produce it under the Sun and You know the
[SPEAKER_01]: governor has really not sort of been
sensitive to this issue, even though he
[SPEAKER_01]: claims to be You know staunch carbon
carbon governor and one example of that is
[SPEAKER_01]: recently Washington passed a law last year
that for an organic standard in in the
[SPEAKER_01]: state and We were both on that advisory
committee to the that the WSDA the
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington Department of Ag put together
and we were adamant that a plant that has
[SPEAKER_01]: never seen the light of day or put its
roots In soil should not be called
[SPEAKER_01]: organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well some through some wonky sort of
federal rules governing USDA and
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponic rules It's actually allowed,
you know, we we appealed to the governor
[SPEAKER_01]: and said hey, you know, you don't we're
not federally regulated You do not have to
[SPEAKER_01]: follow the W the USDA organics Lead here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can say no that we are not going to
allow indoor grown cannabis to be called
[SPEAKER_01]: organic and we failed at that we didn't
get that and that was a real Missed
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity for a governor that you know
claims to be concerned about carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're giving the the consumers The
real information when they when they're
[SPEAKER_01]: buying organic, they're also buying
sustainable Absolutely, and I think one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the failures that have happened here is
that cannabis legalization is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: typically a liberal kind of Democrat
left-wing issue and so and it's been grown
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors due to prohibition and whatnot and
so I think a lot of the policy Makers
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't actually understand that you can
grow it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They saw indoor cultivation as like the
default kind of best way Only way you can
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, and there are people there's a
narrative out there that you can't grow
[SPEAKER_01]: good cannabis indoors And that well look
who's supporting the narrative when we're
[SPEAKER_01]: at a show that is dominated by light
companies HVAC companies LED companies
[SPEAKER_01]: there is there is an industrial complex
that has invested interest in keeping very
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive indoor operations or now they
kind of see oh well, we have a Problem
[SPEAKER_01]: with you know with how bad indoor is for
the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're gonna move it to these
greenhouses But we're gonna add more
[SPEAKER_01]: lights and we're gonna have we're gonna
add more HVAC and those we're calling
[SPEAKER_01]: hyper greenhouses and dr Evan Mills who's
well known for Assessing the environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: impacts of indoor grows recently put out a
white paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was about a year ago Sort of assessing
that these hyper greenhouses are really
[SPEAKER_00]: better And I feel like the excitement of
cannabis legalization among the liberal
[SPEAKER_00]: left and the kind of pro cannabis people
in general had their That's so excited
[SPEAKER_00]: that they forgot to get deep into the the
environmental policy about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want it legal so badly And so it
let them it gave they gave a big handout
[SPEAKER_00]: to corporate infrastructure companies
unintentionally I think to some extent
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were so excited to just get
cannabis legal and and the drug war and
[SPEAKER_01]: And your company I mean you made the right
decision even though you were based out of
[SPEAKER_01]: Seattle and kind of lived You know because
Seattle is you may know is not a good
[SPEAKER_01]: place to grow cannabis outdoors Um,
so Jade actually sort of you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people looked at that and said,
oh well, we can't do that We have to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We live in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, she was like no, there's Eastern
Washington And and so she's got half of
[SPEAKER_01]: her her productions out in Eastern
Washington and her processing is in
[SPEAKER_01]: Seattle Which is kind of the best of both
worlds because you're close to the market,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're going sustainable a lot of
people want to make that Decision and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: heard people say well, what were we
supposed to do, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're where we supposed to move to
Eastern Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes you were you know Or just don't claim
that you're going sustainable and central
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington where our farm is actually 90
miles from Seattle So it's not even that
[SPEAKER_00]: bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm four and a half hours, but there were
options There are options that are closer
[SPEAKER_00]: in I think some of the bigger tier three
companies ran numbers on production
[SPEAKER_00]: realized a five-time canopy Would be
something that they could yeah And I think
[SPEAKER_01]: a pet peeve of ours is these when these
indoor growers sort of steal our language
[SPEAKER_01]: and they start claiming sustainability
That becomes a real problem for us And
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know just because you put up LED
lights does not make your your indoor grow
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable And so, you know, these people
are taking our language they They're
[SPEAKER_01]: they're putting in little, you know,
the LED revolution, you know, and even
[SPEAKER_01]: even calling themselves There's some farms
called there's one indoor grown farm that
[SPEAKER_01]: is sunshine farms, you know And then I saw
a tagline that said indoor sun grown and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just like what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there was one indoor grown light
touched or Sun touched Sun Sun touched
[SPEAKER_01]: that was a Good one, you know,
and I actually have more respect for these
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor companies that You know don't
really take that language from us,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know And and then we've got policy
sort of backing this up where you could
[SPEAKER_01]: you can be running an indoor grow and you
can go to your your local utility district
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can get a rebate and there has
been like $200,000 rebates given to 502
[SPEAKER_01]: farms in Washington in order for them to
buy their LED lighting which is just
[SPEAKER_01]: ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we don't have any funds available to
us and we're already sustainable Like why
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't why weren't we given money to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not give them money to not have
lighting at all like give us light money
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're not using lights There's
some crazy sort of wonky Responses and the
[SPEAKER_00]: scary part is with legalization rolling
out across the country Is that the the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the infrastructure lobbyists and
stuff are actually getting ahead of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So even before medical becomes legal in
states There are already people at those
[SPEAKER_00]: government agencies and lobbying against
it lobbying against saying that in outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: is a hazard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's a hazard Children might break
into the fence and steal it there might be
[SPEAKER_00]: theft or Outdoor is gonna be dirty pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't keep it sterile Medical patients
are gonna get sick because there's the
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial complex on the cannabis that's
here And those people are very well funded
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're well ahead of us And so right
now they're in states like, you know in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Midwest and Missouri, Oklahoma
Everywhere and they are already crafting
[SPEAKER_00]: policy that is gonna make it really
difficult to grow outdoors Nationwide and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always thought we needed a little a
little committee like a little I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know fire committee or something that
would fly to these different places and be
[SPEAKER_01]: like hey guys You can grow it out sort
outside and if you don't this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon footprint you're looking at because
I mean Western Washington is fortunate to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a lot of carbon free power as soon as
you start going East it's all carbon or
[SPEAKER_01]: nuclear so, you know, it becomes much more
important as we start legalizing to the
[SPEAKER_01]: east that they Grow outdoors, but like you
said, there's they have lobbyists now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're protecting their their industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just saw Plant growth canopies the big
company out of Canada, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they they've got the massive massive
indoor gross Well, we saw the CEO they're
[SPEAKER_01]: lobbying the Parliament that maybe we
shouldn't have some grown and that was the
[SPEAKER_01]: worst thing they could Possible do and
invoking the children in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes in Canada some grown is actually
currently illegal and it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed in 2020 But that's two years after
the rollout of medical legalization So
[SPEAKER_00]: that's giving the indoor on big
infrastructure companies a huge head start
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, and so I've been talking to a
Canadian actually about this So he's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: start growing in two years outdoors in
Canada But but they're way behind because
[SPEAKER_00]: they were not they were not allowed to
grow outdoors for 30 miles from the border
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I could take my operation which you
know, it's sustainable low-cost high-tech
[SPEAKER_01]: quality product and just move it right
across the border there's any Canadians
[SPEAKER_00]: and The unfortunate part is the regulators
and the policymakers in the states outside
[SPEAKER_00]: of like the kind of epicenter on the west
coast They're they're kind of ignorant
[SPEAKER_00]: about how it grows So they have like quote
experts coming in and telling them it has
[SPEAKER_00]: to be indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not safe If it's not indoors,
it's not clean There's gonna be security
[SPEAKER_00]: issues And so they're being lobbied like
really early on with you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: typical reefer madness on fear tactics
actually about the kind of scourge and
[SPEAKER_00]: danger of outdoor Cannabis and and they're
they're driving policy as this stuff rolls
[SPEAKER_00]: out nationwide and there's really no one
and there's no organizations at a national
[SPEAKER_00]: level yet to kind of Counter this and so
that's something I would like to do soon
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy is we need to deal with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, yeah We need to try to stay
ahead of it a little bit because we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to see the entire country with 90%
indoor cannabis creating a huge carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: disaster that While you know our world is
drowning and people are dying and our
[SPEAKER_00]: Children are gonna have a really shitty
place to live in our grandchildren and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, maybe it's too late But I like to
think we should still you know Try to at
[SPEAKER_01]: least do what we can to modulate how bad
we also have to realize what Cannabis has
[SPEAKER_01]: done to it has created this whole new form
of agriculture called industrialized
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor agriculture So well now it took a
high-value Crop like marijuana to sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: advance the science enough that LEDs are
cheap enough and that you can kind of you
[SPEAKER_01]: know now we can consider sort of Just full
indoor agriculture, which is just kills my
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, you know, it just it's it's it's yes
Maybe in some futuristic world where we
[SPEAKER_01]: can't breathe the air or we got to go to
different planets We need this technology
[SPEAKER_01]: But farming is is the way that you
sustainably produce goods and food in this
[SPEAKER_01]: country Remain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and we need to try to preserve what
we have like, you know I don't think we're
[SPEAKER_00]: at the point where we just write it all
off as a complete disaster and that let's
[SPEAKER_00]: just you know Like, you know, we're not at
that point yet and we should never be at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point There's always hope and we want
to try to have this planet at least,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Go downhill a little bit slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to try to keep stuff nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So And the other thing that sun grown has
done at least in Washington Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: Really has the most successful
legalization in the country and because
[SPEAKER_01]: the people that are measure Legalization
success is not the business owners It's
[SPEAKER_01]: the tax collectors and the consumers and
the tax Collectors are reaping it in in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington and the consumers are loving
it, too They've got and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, it's all on the backs of
farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not let's not forget who's actually
bearing the cost It's not the retailers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's even not even the processors It's the
producers that are that are the ones and
[SPEAKER_01]: we've seen this story over and over and
over right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how agriculture has gone in
America is that the the farmers get
[SPEAKER_01]: screwed So we're kind of I guess we're
what we think it was gonna be any
[SPEAKER_01]: different But it's ungrown really is what
made Washington such a successful
[SPEAKER_01]: Experiment and legalization because you
come to eat you go to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna pay more and you're gonna
have less quality You're gonna have less
[SPEAKER_01]: choices and they're collecting less taxes
you go to Washington You're gonna pay less
[SPEAKER_01]: even though there's more taxes collected
You're gonna have more choices and the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality is gonna be higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you can thank your son
growers for that The question is what's
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of piquing our interest and the
production side?
[SPEAKER_01]: of Cannabis and you know, I've actually
sort of taken it the other way I'm buying
[SPEAKER_01]: less products than I ever have I am doing
less sort of compost teas or or or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything and and it's really because I've
fully adopted living soils and and
[SPEAKER_01]: Understanding what living soils are you
don't buy living soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't purchase products that get you
living soils It's really a long Term
[SPEAKER_01]: commitment to building up your soil health
and after five years, you know I'm finally
[SPEAKER_01]: realizing that benefit and so I'm buying
very very little nutrients, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two ways to look at nutrients one
is as a stream flow, right and hydroponics
[SPEAKER_01]: are exactly that right the nutrients go by
the roots and when they're done they go
[SPEAKER_01]: down the drain and they've got a bike be
treated for phosphates or Nitrates whereas
[SPEAKER_01]: my view of nutrients are the more
sustainable view of nutrients is it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket and you feel The bucket and then as
you grow, you know You pull just a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit out of that bucket as you harvest and
you just need to tap that bucket off a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit You know, and so that's kind of
how I how I think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really just my thinking that's
changed And and it reminds me back of the
[SPEAKER_01]: guerrilla days of growing in the hills,
you know because that was Korean natural
[SPEAKER_01]: farming we just didn't have the words for
it You know, we used to go out into the
[SPEAKER_01]: woods and we couldn't carry fertilizers
They were too heavy and so we would go out
[SPEAKER_01]: there and we'd oh, there's some deciduous
trees, you know We'd go grab the deciduous
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and then we'd grab the duff under the
pines and then we would you know get them
[SPEAKER_01]: all together and that that's really kind
of what's got me excited and Really just
[SPEAKER_01]: not having to do anything To your soil and
still producing high quality product is
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, and I am right there with you Jeremy
I'm like just reducing inputs like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: a year after year and same thing our first
few years We bought a lot of stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: every year we buy less and less our soil
gets better and better and that's like
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a really and the nutrient
efficiencies are less exactly and trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to yeah and trying to figure out ways to
also take to streamline via like reduction
[SPEAKER_00]: in nutrients and also, you know utilizing
kind of Conventional agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques like, you know vineyard
trellising.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something we keep have been
geeking out on the last two years is For
[SPEAKER_00]: some reason cannabis trellising has always
been this like huge fucking project like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know They'd use like like fence like
metal fencing and like, you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic netting that's such as to know
it's disposable Every year you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: throw out a bunch of plastic nasty plastic
netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does that end up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably in the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it's getting swallowed by whales I
mean, so we've been eliminating plastics
[SPEAKER_00]: from our operation in the form of ground
cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have moved to all you know,
basically cover crop and weed So we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: blend of cover crop and natural weeds and
you know Whereas we used to be much more
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned about the weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've realized actually the weeds are not
causing any problem They're helping us
[SPEAKER_00]: retain water and they're providing habitat
for beneficial insects and they're keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: the dust down and like so we've stopped
stressing out about weeds and we we do
[SPEAKER_00]: Vetch clover and then we do some
beneficial insect attracting plants like
[SPEAKER_00]: yarrow calendula Some radish family type
plants cilantro parsley's so we put a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of that out Kind of around our
perimeters to kind of provide habitat for
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials on our aisles We do a mixture
of we seed with vetch and clover and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the natural weeds are very vigorous and we
can't really stop them and we've given up
[SPEAKER_00]: trying and it causes no problems and so
we've saved a lot of labor and energy like
[SPEAKER_00]: fighting weeds and that's something where
a Lot of new farmers they think weeds are
[SPEAKER_00]: the enemy and we got to fight the weeds
You got to weed it you got to you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: ho them up and and it is such a waste of
effort because we were there we tried that
[SPEAKER_00]: and all it was was labor and Backbreaking
horrible, you know sweating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it didn't get you anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grew back two weeks later Yeah,
but it was set up by rule, you know We
[SPEAKER_01]: were talking earlier about how there's
constantly rules that seem to be
[SPEAKER_01]: advantageous for indoor growers and
disadvantageous for outdoor growers And
[SPEAKER_01]: one of them was yeast and molds yeast and
molds is the most arbitrary Measure of
[SPEAKER_01]: that you could possibly apply it means
nothing, you know In fact, we know that a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of these yeast and molds are very
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in the early days I was so
concerned about yeast and mold that I weed
[SPEAKER_01]: barrier my entire farm and I'm glad I did
I think I've totally reduced my amounts of
[SPEAKER_01]: fails for for yeast and molds We
eventually got that that requirement for
[SPEAKER_01]: testing removed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still some states out there doing
It totally dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should stop now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We replaced it with with testing for
mycotoxins, which actually kill people can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually hurt people I mean before under
the old rules you could pass a Yeast and
[SPEAKER_01]: mold test and you could be full of
vestigial s and actually be harmful So
[SPEAKER_01]: now, you know, that was a huge win for the
Sun growers another rule that was really
[SPEAKER_01]: disadvantageous to us was the requirement
for the harvest date on the packaging and
[SPEAKER_01]: You know and people didn't understand that
curing And all that and so they would just
[SPEAKER_01]: call it old and then the retailers,
you know They would use that date to see
[SPEAKER_01]: be like, oh, it's been six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want a 20% decrease in your cost I'm
like, well actually it's cured longer and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's more expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah so but Back to the cover cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm totally geeking out on that for the
first time too because my new farm You
[SPEAKER_01]: know that I don't that I'm building now I
I don't have those same concerns anymore
[SPEAKER_01]: now that the yeast and mold requirement is
gone So I'm adopting much more of the
[SPEAKER_01]: practices that Jade has and Totally
geeking out on like what you know crimson
[SPEAKER_01]: or not crimson, but a white clover and
annual ryegrass and that's you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully to knock out some of the
perennial grasses and and and compete with
[SPEAKER_01]: the weeds, so I'm really excited about
that I'm getting a roller for my tractor
[SPEAKER_01]: so I can roll them in and and Yeah,
and start to start to put the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: fixing Stuff in there and just don't pay
for stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Buy stuff in plastic bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't generate waste in your farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really don't need to at the end of the
day It's a plant and it's it's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: special plant but as far as growing it and
stuff It's not that special and there have
[SPEAKER_00]: been farmers growing all kinds of crops
for thousands of years and humans know how
[SPEAKER_00]: to farm and so just applying like,
you know ancient, you know knowledge and
[SPEAKER_00]: farming knowledge that we've been
gathering for thousands of years to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is a perfectly reasonable and
preferable approach everyone wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: reinvent the wheel with cannabis and it
just It's already we we we can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to grow plants humans are
excellent at it So we just need to you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, use our existing knowledge and and
just get better that way
[SPEAKER_01]: We're ground growers we're in the ground
We're we're big believers of being in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground, you know the smart pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call them dumb pots I mean, they're
they're so dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean you got 200 gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know they're around here somewhere
You know, you got a 200 gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't you can't move You got a fabric
case that's You know, you don't yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't totally know what it's And
they're just silly and they dry out,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, especially when you're in the
desert and whatnot Every farm is
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are blessed with sandy loam soil so we
can tractor till it we can plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know We got good drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are situations where you might have
poor drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil is rocky clay where Remediating
that soil and getting it to a point where
[SPEAKER_00]: you get drainage would be ridiculously
expensive So bringing in soil and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: raised beds is a very reasonable approach
in some situations and that's what we did
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what yeah It's always about us
You have to assess your individual soil
[SPEAKER_00]: type and location and make the decision
based on that we followed Phil we did fill
[SPEAKER_01]: and drill because you know the cost of
just basically bringing in 12 inches of
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil is extreme and often with negative
environmental impacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our approach Was to drill a hole in the
ground and fill it up with soil and of
[SPEAKER_01]: course, you know, we don't use fagnum peat
moss that's a Unsustainable non-renewable
[SPEAKER_01]: product that is widely used in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a peat bog Within 30 miles of the
farm that's hypnum peat which is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: a much better peat in my mind as far as
holding water and whatnot And that is
[SPEAKER_01]: delivered mixed up by a local guy and then
delivered in a 60 yard truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know we Don't grow in the native
soil at all In fact, I am very careful to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep the native soil even from even from
coming into my holes It's just it's this
[SPEAKER_01]: it's this silt that if it gets on the top
of a hole It'll create an impermeable
[SPEAKER_01]: layer and the oxygen can't get through So
you're lucky to have good soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've it's probably been one of our
biggest costs But it was a one-time cost,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know You we brought the soil in one
time and now we're in our we're going in
[SPEAKER_01]: our sixth year of no-till
[SPEAKER_01]: Living soil Yes, yes, so tarar can only go
so far, you know, like in in you've got to
[SPEAKER_01]: have good soil for grapes Like bad soil
seems to be a thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for marijuana No, it likes good soil
and you've got to have good soil So,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it gets difficult to talk about
tarar and particularly if you're an indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: grower don't talk about tarar Just leave
that alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our language You've got you've got
drywall terroir indoors Chinese drywall
[SPEAKER_00]: with formaldehyde residue Yeah,
well, yeah, but also the walls and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything around the terroir is not just
the soil, but it's the surrounding
[SPEAKER_01]: structures in the environment So yeah,
what can what can 56% humidity and 72
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees do for you 24 hours a day?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, here's the thing with indoor
growths, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're they're they're the they're the
definition of monoculture environments I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean they are such a controlled
environment But that plant is not
[SPEAKER_01]: expressing itself I mean the terpenes are
a response to the environment and if your
[SPEAKER_01]: environment is always 72 degrees and 56%
humidity You're not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not getting a response out of 100%
not gonna get a higher quality product at
[SPEAKER_00]: Bastyr I studied herbal medicine and so
one of my teachers who I see is one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: mentors He's a one of the most brilliant
minds in herbal medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He taught us in this class called
pharmacognos II He said the best herbal
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines come from plants that are
slightly nutrient deprived slightly water
[SPEAKER_00]: deprived have weeds and there's insects
around and insect pressure and those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants you're gonna get the highest
production of secondary plant compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: which are what Cannabinoids and terpenoids
are they are plant defense mechanisms and
[SPEAKER_00]: so by having those stressors you're gonna
get a higher quality medicine and Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is a medicine and those compounds that
we're all looking for terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids Those are those compounds
that you need those stressors to maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: those items and that was something that he
taught us not he didn't Even teach about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis at all, but that applies
obviously to cannabis and and we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: get that narrative out there Oh,
yeah, and and you know, I've got some
[SPEAKER_01]: old-timers that have been around weed
forever and they're like Oh that indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: weed just doesn't do it for me and and
there's reason that it's not doing him for
[SPEAKER_01]: forum and you know that I have one guy
who's like just doesn't have legs,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and it doesn't because the
cannabinoid profile is very narrow,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know indoor growers are harvesting
early because they want to they want it
[SPEAKER_01]: they got a big power bell and they don't
want to keep on going so they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing the cannabinoid profile to widen
Now with the CBN CBG CBC's everything else
[SPEAKER_01]: that that really adds to that Effect and
if and if all you're doing is is growing
[SPEAKER_01]: short flowering time early harvest Then
you're gonna end up with a very narrow
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene profile and a very narrow
cannabinoid profile And that's why the
[SPEAKER_01]: old-timers there's some truth to what
they're saying You've got to go back and
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to hit that bong ten minutes after
you hit it and it's just they don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have legs It doesn't stick with
you because it doesn't have all of those
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids interacting Themselves in the
entourage effect and making that
[SPEAKER_01]: long-lasting effect, but it looks pretty
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks it looks no I call it while
you're smoking it in the joint you see
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and everybody's buying on looks
right and that's what that's what's
[SPEAKER_01]: driving these these bud tenders to sort of
You know have this undue preference for
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor grown is that they they look at it
and I try to explain to them It's like
[SPEAKER_01]: look you're not looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna smoke it You know and and and
I call it loud weed I've been calling
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor weed loud weed for you know ten
years and and it's not a compliment and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know loud weed is it it it looks
bright green because they was pumped full
[SPEAKER_01]: of ammonium nitrates because they wanted
the yield you know and then they had to
[SPEAKER_01]: use a cleaner to like push out all of
those those nitrates so it doesn't you
[SPEAKER_01]: know end up being a black ash at the end
it's it's white and trichome because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like Like crystal because it wasn't
allowed to mature So a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome structures get really jacked up
and so it's not that there's actually more
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid in there But the surrounding
cuticles on the trichomes are larger,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so it looks more crystalline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not more cannabinoid It's just more
kind of the surrounding structure of that
[SPEAKER_00]: trichrome Trichome filling in from extra
carbon dioxide and nutrients and also not
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed to turn milky or even not allowed
to turn reddish which is an indication
[SPEAKER_01]: That you've got your CBN's and that you're
actually Getting to a mature plant you
[SPEAKER_01]: know so there's all of these forces that
that kind of contribute to this loud weed
[SPEAKER_01]: the other thing is that you know you open
it up and it kind of overwhelms you in in
[SPEAKER_01]: the initial or odor well, that's when when
you're volatizing terpenes like that that
[SPEAKER_01]: means you didn't cure it at all and And
that's not going to be good either because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to end up the taste is going
to have this freshy greenish taste because
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't allowed to Mellow some of those
compounds out so that's what loud weed is
[SPEAKER_01]: bright green smells amazing and Doesn't
get you high as like that like sun-grown does
