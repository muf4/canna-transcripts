[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many veterans right now that,
yeah, I have, you know, vets that have
[SPEAKER_00]: lost limbs and stuff and, you know,
have their physical incapacities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's veterans like myself that
physically were fit, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to an extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's veterans right now that are in
their houses with a car that runs,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a body that's able to come out and be
a part of something like this that's
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can't get out of bed because the
wound is in the mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like so many of us right now,
man, that are at home, like just miserable
[SPEAKER_00]: to where if they understood that there's a
community of people out here that like
[SPEAKER_00]: leave your house and come spend an
afternoon and like watch it change your
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're like a selfless person,
like that's something that the military
[SPEAKER_00]: teaches you, like immediately you get the
basic training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have like, you know, core values
and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is selfless service.
[SPEAKER_00]: And selfless service is you give your life
for your country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's where that kind of honor code
within a vet that you see, like when we
[SPEAKER_00]: die, like it's for the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that comes from when you get the
basic training, you already know you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but they actually have a fucking term
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, do work at all costs just
for the greater good, regardless of what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens to you anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work selflessly without expectation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do right because doing right is what you
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go get the bad guys because they're
fucking hurting people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's where, you know, so life can
be kind of like that balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I'm sorry, your name and your
organization and like where are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're coming from Florida?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from South Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Jose Bellen and my organization
is Mission Zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like my story pretty much is I was
part of the invasion into Iraq in 2003
[SPEAKER_00]: from upstate New York, small town called
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew up there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was that kid on the
street at 12 years old on probation for
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking burglars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my family basically was like,
look, you're going to be a fucking loser.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, took five years, but I graduated
high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I knew like I I couldn't go to
college.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I at least knew like I didn't want to
just fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I could do is join the military.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I could join the military,
which my family known in the world would
[SPEAKER_00]: ever expect that, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like given my trajectory,
you know, but I got to a firm stop like
[SPEAKER_00]: when I failed 11th grade, I'm like,
wait, dude, come on, like, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let what your stepdad's telling you
be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I made a choice myself
consciously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying, you know what, I'm going to
fucking join the military.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to try to do the hardest job
that I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can do that, I can do anything in
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I swear on my mom like that,
17, 18 years old, man, I had that
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation where I'm like, you know
what, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to join the military and I'm
going to make something of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like what got me to basic
training and like got me through it was
[SPEAKER_00]: the intestinal fortitude like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a loser.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be what society has been
saying, you know, to me as a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make something of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my service for me, you know,
holds an invaluable fucking place in my
[SPEAKER_00]: heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing for so many vets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's so personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we enlist a lot of us,
most of us come from broken homes and
[SPEAKER_00]: broken communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's like, you know,
you give that honor, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, to say, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure we're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you recording?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, Leo?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when when you get to the fucking
service, you get the basic training.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like there's just this like
immediate understanding that that person
[SPEAKER_00]: next to you, like we're all about to get
the biggest mind fuck of our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about to all just go through
something crazy, traumatic experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all going through the same amount of
pain at the same time and physically being
[SPEAKER_00]: there to pick each other up when we're all
being just broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like that's the whole thing with
veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not a sob story what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just real.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been like this code of fucking
we don't talk about it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: out of service.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that I had a Vietnam veteran tell me
when I came home, he's like, Jose,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to talk about your service.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, because I didn't talk about it
for 30 years and I'm fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I watch this man struggle as a vet
before serving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's like, listen, you talk about it
when you're ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so this is my 15th year home
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but I've found
[SPEAKER_00]: through all the pain associated with
service, you know, the connection and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that, the things you experience in combat,
that when we get out of service,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're very hard on ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everything needs to be fucking
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if our marriage ain't right,
the whole fucking thing ain't right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it has to be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we have to be able to figure it out,
you know, and make everything work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we realize that, that man on your
left, your right's not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it begins a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing with veterans is like,
we're not mentally ill, mentally strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fighting a battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we think we don't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that all the shit that we've been
through was for nothing because we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: do it for the glory.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't do it for the medals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But only if that understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we lose hope in ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the biggest things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, look, you know, we all have a
story to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I speak now is to inspire
that veteran that was just like me
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking like the best alternative is just
to end it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like to be there and know you
want to die that bad, but you won't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you put the gun down, you're
consciously aware, like emotionally you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to die, but you know you don't want
to leave your dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, OK, fuck that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you put the gun down.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens after that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still faced with living the same
life that you had that pushed you to want
[SPEAKER_00]: to kill yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to figure out a way to accept
and understand that this is your life now,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is where you're at right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to get better tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do my best to fucking do it
because I don't want to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my goal is to get the vets who are
right there who already put the gun down,
[SPEAKER_00]: but every day are still like I want to
check out today anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, look, pause.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's 18 million of us out out
of service.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do some things together where the
private sector won't give you a job
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're missing your limb.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take care of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something healing about working
with plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, it's not just smoking together,
you know, enjoying the fruits of our labor
[SPEAKER_01]: that connects us, you know, but like
learning how the plants and the animals
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're all part of those systems and
you can play a role in affecting the
[SPEAKER_01]: abundance that you reap, you know,
is like that stuff is powerful,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I don't have much experience,
you know, working with veterans per se,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I've working with, you know,
people with disabilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen amazing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it just makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes everybody happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just like, like working with
good regenerative soil practices seems to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a positive impact on the spirit,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't because I'm in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to just, that's, that's the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just trying to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why this is so huge, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm trying to create initiatives
right now because I understand,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how much of a life-saving tool
this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But federally, I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm handcuffed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't mean... They encourage you to
have the conversation at the VA with your
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, their whole stance is...
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's... It's backwards right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so veterans like myself,
I'm left to... Like right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, you know, establishing, you know,
a curriculum in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was telling you about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my goal is, you know, hemp is... You're
going to be able to put in for a hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: license in Florida next month,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my mind immediately went to,
okay, how can I get, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: into this market?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to have the ability to
fucking do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I do to live like my,
my virtue is hope, happiness, opportunity,
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose, and empowerment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's my goal, you know,
to provide to veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's my ethos personally,
hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happiness, because if you provide a
veteran with happiness, that's giving
[SPEAKER_00]: them, you know, hope, you know,
for an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the opportunity is giving them a
purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he's empowered them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So...
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I do now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my mind immediately went to,
I want to put in for a hemp license,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and, you know, industrialize
Hemp Creek, you know, an installation to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out a way to build veteran homes,
but also, and that operation, I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with a local college or university to
be able to provide veterans that want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get education, a degree in engineering or
ag, whatever, course curriculum there to
[SPEAKER_00]: get college credits at our farm and then
create also a certification program.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a vet doesn't want to go to get a
degree, he can get certified at the farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: eight to 12 weeks, you know, and now guess
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's employable within the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what have we just done?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have provided a veteran with an
empowerment element that now is giving
[SPEAKER_00]: them education.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's getting therapy just through being
around the medicine, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he's getting, getting towards
employment within our own operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if he wants to go in the industry,
we connect them with whoever, but now you
[SPEAKER_00]: have given a veteran that was supposed to
be disabled, living off his shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: disability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all of a sudden he's, you know,
built again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's always been be all you can be
in the army.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about be all you can be when
you're not in the army anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the red tape and what's it going
to take?
[SPEAKER_00]: Funding, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that, that's realistically,
I can have the greatest ideas in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, so honestly I've just
kind of, I can't say the name of the
[SPEAKER_00]: college, but I pitched a college and they,
we've already kind of put the first phase
[SPEAKER_00]: layer, the curriculum together,
you know, to roll this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, you know, so it's just been really
been finding someone who believes just as
[SPEAKER_00]: much as me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's money to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone knows that the whole thing is
what is your goal when you get it and what
[SPEAKER_00]: are you going to do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm coming into this to try to help
you do, don't cross me in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've had to learn a vicious lesson
in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole other side that people
don't know about, you know, that you
[SPEAKER_00]: really have to figure out a way to stay in
your lane without selling yourself out,
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing that it's going to be a hard ass
journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I believe man, strong enough that,
you know, I'm trying to create an
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem for veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got 200,000 coming out of service every
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you call it an ecosystem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to create, you know,
that whole thing because we're killing
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's raw data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's known.
[SPEAKER_00]: The government acknowledges.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know there's a veteran that is right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know where he is,
but he doesn't have to, she doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to because where you're forgotten about
out there, you're not forgotten about
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I have, you know, a daughter and
a stepson, my daughter's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: My stepson is going to be 18 next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at the end of the day,
man, we're all going to clock out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, whether we want to or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I learned a lesson on death and
combat that dude, there's dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: even right now, you know, so you,
you really, you know, get to a point where
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to understand that it's not about
the zeros in the bank account,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we can all live a life, you know,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it's about is what is your legacy?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what am I doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: That if my clock runs out tonight,
that my daughter, you know, my stepson,
[SPEAKER_00]: can say, you know what, my father stood
for something.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stood for humanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I want for everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I want to see my neighbor win.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see if I can help you,
you know, in any way, let's just,
[SPEAKER_00]: just do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fires me up, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're saying is let's just let it
grow because if it has one more day or two
[SPEAKER_02]: more days or fucking 10 more, more years
or who knows, we live in the weird world
[SPEAKER_02]: of modern science, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's live that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plants want the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're connecting a whole
ecosystem, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the intent that you bring to your
grow, no matter how big sets the stage and
[SPEAKER_02]: how you start.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how are we going to let these plants
grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to pump them full of salt,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not wanting to grow like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this ecosystem, you've talked about
education.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've talked about agriculture,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You've talked about opportunities and
healing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Employment, purpose, healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's the, that's the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, we, we're, we're so onto
something and veterans have, there's 18
[SPEAKER_00]: million of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you really think about that
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many of us are so doped up that we
don't even realize that the value we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what, what's the heartbreak in
this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the government, you know,
I've been blessed to be here as a speaker
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've spoken the U S Capitol lobby,
I do all that stuff because at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day, what is wrong is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I learned that in war.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think that's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in the shittiest of places,
I learned the most valuable of lessons
[SPEAKER_00]: that right is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're wrong, dude, just own your
wrong and you'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the only thing I wanted the
government to fucking do is say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what, you can't change yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, you did with the native Americans,
you know, we can't go back in time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we can make a conscious choice today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow can make it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my whole beef has always been like,
why keep 18 million veterans unaware of
[SPEAKER_00]: their true value to this country?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, make these men and women aware
so they don't want to die at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you like, like I've nearly taken
my, my life a number of times that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, one of the most fucked up ones
was on a Saturday afternoon, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, get into that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was fortunate when I got out
of the service, I got into the insurance
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was one of the number one insurance
professionals in corporate America,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you never knew I had PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was making 20, $30,000 a month just,
and all hard work, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: No shortcuts, but you know what,
I was suicidal every fucking day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I got, you know,
in my car one afternoon after leaving the
[SPEAKER_00]: barbershop, I called my father.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I'm going to kill myself right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get home, I have a wife and two
kids, beautiful house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had it all at the time, you know,
and, um, you know, I call all the things
[SPEAKER_00]: you thought you needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, and I earned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you, but it was still mine,
but you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, again, like the virtues of a
veteran, like we learned that you earn
[SPEAKER_00]: your keep, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, when I made that phone
call to my dad and I'm crying on the phone
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, he's like, what's the
matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a cold or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, but I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know it was the last time I'm
going to talk to my father and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just so fucking, you know,
going off on the meds and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pull in my driveway, you know,
I have my six hour with a round in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking chamber off safety right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take seven pounds of pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, uh, hung up the phone with
my dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife was out with my kids and I'm like
quarter of a million dollar house,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, American dream, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to war, got my fucking house.
[SPEAKER_00]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking earned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That VA home loan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Baghdad and got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought it home with me, you know,
so I had all the reasons to feel
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfied, but the fog of war is so like
the twist is, is so overpowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just remember, you know,
just sitting there gun, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: on my hip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at it, just rocking back and
forth, crying and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, got fucking Nirvana playing or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, just say, I don't want to fucking
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, just like had this fight,
pick up the gun and do it or just don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't, don't, don't, don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is the struggle
continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still having, you realize you don't
want to die, but the same pain that pushed
[SPEAKER_00]: you to want to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, you're going to have to face it
every day, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want veterans to understand,
like come off the ledge, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if that's where you're at,
cause I've, but come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to die.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is where the grind is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you get through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just fucking not wanting to die.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but then it shifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just, that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's life, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's what I want to tell every
single person who's right now fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: suicidal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like, hold on, hold on buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we, and we got each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why this is so beautiful with
what we're surrounded by.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the plant's been here for 3000
years for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an endocannabinoid system for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's like, let's just
understand that it's going to take a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of work, but it's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You meet all of us to do it the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it and you build it the right
way, it's going to work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, don't sell yourself out,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't sell yourself short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's those come from,
like, when you enlist in the military,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, veterans, like army,
we have our core value, loyalty,
[SPEAKER_00]: duty, respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selfless service, honor, integrity,
and personal courage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and those are, you know,
ingrained in us, in basic training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let alone you go to combat, you get to the
point where, you know, you're willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: die for your country.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like there's a liberation in
that moment that you just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you make peace with your, I made peace
with my maker out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand like, this is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are bad people doing bad things
here, regardless of what the government
[SPEAKER_00]: initiative is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see I'm here to stop evil.
[SPEAKER_02]: My job is to do good.
[SPEAKER_00]: My job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is such a beauty in living your
truth that, you know, like I used to just
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the flag on my arm and just thank
God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at it, you know, in combat,
because you get to a point where,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least for me, I'm a field artillery
veteran, you know, so our job,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, is blow shit up and just seek
and destroy that and kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we were tasked with securing
Baghdad, so we did more infantry
[SPEAKER_00]: operations than anything, raids and all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get to a point where death,
it's just, you know, quick draw,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, it's 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also realize that the brother next
to you, if anything, or sister next to
[SPEAKER_00]: you, anything, was to be put in that
person's way of harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That giving your life for that person,
like is not, it's, that's what's so hard
[SPEAKER_00]: for veterans to articulate, is that that
bond is so real that like if there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: grenade and you see it rolling towards
you, there's just, it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just at that point and die for you,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that love, you know, that's why
when we, like you ever want to see a grown
[SPEAKER_00]: man cry, kill his brother in combat,
that's a pain, you know, that never goes
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we come back, we're confused
because warriors don't cry, but fuck yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we cry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're human.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's getting the veteran to
understand that just because you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: valued by your country as you should be
warrior, right, like thousands of years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, you know, you would come home and you
would have land and you would have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, things, you'd be set for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be gilded, whatever the case may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, you know, there is, that doesn't
exist, but it can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know there's 200,000 veterans coming
out of service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's create as many operations as
possible to make sure that if the private
[SPEAKER_00]: sector won't hire them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: Create, you know, product, hemp creep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I want, how am I going to help
reduce, you know, the veteran homeless
[SPEAKER_02]: issue?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's build some houses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and then that connects to that as
well, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you leverage, like when I go to go to
DC or I go to Tallahassee and I speak to
[SPEAKER_00]: these law, to the lawmakers and stuff,
you know, I just put it to them black and
[SPEAKER_00]: white.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, listen, guys, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here with a bunch of veterans on my
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see they're being ignored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm coming to talk to these
politicians, I said, look, at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day, this is a right from wrong issue,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to explain to me why right
now, you'll make it available for veterans
[SPEAKER_00]: to go get narcotics, but they still can't
get medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I either say, look, you support me and
you support what I'm fighting for,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you're turning your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the leverage we have to put on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I love speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically, you hold them accountable.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, you have influence
that I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are people that are suffering
and they can't be here to tell you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you willing to make the change or
not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't give me a political response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me the real yes or no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what they fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're entering a new decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you think about like the
trajectory of what's going on right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's like a subculture that has just
pretty much gotten to a point where we can
[SPEAKER_00]: really make some influence and we can do
some things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Misfits made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so heading into a new decade,
let's already start on, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this decade and the last decades,
man, have been pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we just start the new one,
just crushing it already, establishing
[SPEAKER_00]: we've always had the opportunity to be the
next greatest generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've educated ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to use the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the smoke and mirrors effect is
gone for these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's up to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is now it's like it's openly
like just chaos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, this is what it is,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least, you know, we're attempting to
cover shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what should motivate,
you know, vets just as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, what's speaking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my organization's Mission Zero,
www.missionzero.us.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife and I started it in 2018 and I put
my corporate career, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we let the house go, move back in with my
mom, like just straight grind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, last two years, just leap of
faith.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm on a mission to end veteran
suicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's over eight thousand of us a
year committing suicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I can't do it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned through this journey more
about altruism and wanting to just do
[SPEAKER_00]: things for the greater good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mission Zero is my organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just self-published my first book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called PG-13.
[SPEAKER_00]: A Combat Veterans 13 Steps Towards
Personal Growth.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Amazon for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote the manuscript like two years ago
and I just put it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a book out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called PG-13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just self-published, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just follow the steps on Kindle
self-publishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it about?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's kind of like a little helper's
guide, you know, for vets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, got 13 different chapters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pretty much when I wrote it two
years ago, I wrote it like with this
[SPEAKER_00]: intention, like if this was ever to be a
book, like I really I'm going to put my
[SPEAKER_00]: heart and soul into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have chapters on like faith and
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't buy happiness for example,
is one of them because I made a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I made it to what I thought was
the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that chapter, I talk about,
look guys, like it's not so much about
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, what's your intention once you
have it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's where that lesson,
you know, because I want to guide people
[SPEAKER_00]: in the right mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put it together, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got five star reviews, a few
veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a veteran that put a review on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He no one personally went to combat
together, but he wrote he's read it three
[SPEAKER_00]: times directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sent me a message saying that
anytime he feels alone, he breaks the book
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also online.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's PG-13, Jose Balen,
J-O-S-E-B-E-L-E-N.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Kindle just has an opportunity
for people that want to try to put their
[SPEAKER_00]: own books out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it sells, it sells.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a seed, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to plant it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to plant it.
