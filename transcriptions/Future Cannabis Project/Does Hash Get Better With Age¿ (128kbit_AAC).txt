[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing bubble for 20 years now or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I started in Humboldt,
I could just go dumpster dive trim out of
[SPEAKER_01]: some dumpsters in Garberville.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how it all started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody was doing it back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing how much knowledge you need
to understand that the resin is where all
[SPEAKER_00]: the power is.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the cannabinoid, all the terpenes are
in those trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that much in the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine only 10 years ago, despite all
the knowledge you had and everything you
[SPEAKER_00]: knew, you couldn't figure out that you
were throwing treasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine the first dude that realized that
the whole power is in something he
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't even see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's been the case for all of
mankind.
[SPEAKER_01]: The power is there where you don't know
where it's coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it's like when you have the
plant and you have the resin that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the plant and you have the ability
to calculate that the power is actually in
[SPEAKER_00]: that part that is not the plant that you
cannot even see, really, that looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: dust when you shake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To figure out to collect that and to make
ash over it, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the longest time, I thought,
OK, the plant produced cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought the plant was psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's easy to think that, OK,
the first dude touched the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been testing hundreds and hundreds
of thousands of plants to figure out and
[SPEAKER_00]: create agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a tendency to always test a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the person who touched that plant the
first time would have the knowledge of the
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactivity of the resin before the
nutrition of the seed and the fiber would
[SPEAKER_00]: make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lately I learned that actually
the CBD synthase is older than the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that somewhere back in time,
some were not only figure out that the
[SPEAKER_00]: power was in the resin aid, but it breeded
the psychoactive THC in it because it came
[SPEAKER_00]: after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Domestication, basically, you're talking
about, of the plant, because as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: you start breeding specifically for it,
even if it's not domestication breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: like we see it because it may go back in
time where it was really nomadic people,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is, for the plant to become hemp and
seed in China, somebody breeded a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that produced cannabinoid so that it
produced very little, but a lot of fiber
[SPEAKER_00]: and seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you breed a plant on one side,
there is somebody that has the knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: of what you want to breed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's going to be interested by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no history of it, but some,
oh, somebody figure out how to start the
[SPEAKER_00]: THC synthase into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be unconscious breeding most
certainly, bringing the plant in new
[SPEAKER_00]: territory and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it's pretty typical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I respect so much tradition
because if you look at how ignorant we
[SPEAKER_00]: were not so long ago here about resin and
that ash has thousands and thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: years of history, anything that is a
methodology that create that ash for so
[SPEAKER_00]: long and that is still used in every
producing country should be paid respect
[SPEAKER_00]: and studied by scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: My whole position and the big deals they
made of me, that's my style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know for the facts we experience that
ashish is greater than the unpressed
[SPEAKER_00]: resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like wine is greater than grape,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little heat and pressure is where the
magic happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, that's where a part of me is
into the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The magic happened before me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The magic is a grow world, it's a genetic,
it's a land, it's a climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you are saying that once you have the
resin and you turn it into the hash,
[SPEAKER_01]: that there has been some sort of
transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is studies that show that there is
50 plus super rare compounds that are
[SPEAKER_00]: created in traditional ashish that you
cannot trace to the original starting
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the live plant or the dry plant,
but you can trace the precursor of what
[SPEAKER_00]: created those rare compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can create the what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Through pressure, through making
traditional ash, not certainly aging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there is within the temple ball
compared to a pressed hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been found, I don't actually
know the name of the chemical,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there is a direct chemical that has a
different psychoactive effect that only
[SPEAKER_01]: happens in the resin balls, in the temple
balls, in the center.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really like the aging.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you explode all those little resin
heads and you crush them together,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not like extracting the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You crush something that has a lot of
corrosivity with a bunch of membrane and
[SPEAKER_00]: lipid and stuff that are not perpene or
resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resin is going to absorb it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in India, when you do charas,
your hands are never more than five,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven grams when you play really clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, we packed it between two,
six sheets of plastic with as little air
[SPEAKER_00]: space as possible on the side so that you
can really see by transparency,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the first day, you always have little
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see them through the transparency
of your resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hardly smoke more than one chillum of
something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you just put it on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go back three weeks later,
there's no sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been absorbed, but it goes beyond
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a chemical reaction that is
happening that has never been studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go beyond that chemical reaction
happening, a little bit like fermentation
[SPEAKER_00]: would be for grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You let everything settle down,
then it age.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets smoother and it transforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, it's like a good quality age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not, let's say, a first grade,
but not a full melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You package it well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two years later, it's a full melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot open your resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is the whole thing in Afghanistan
where they would consider it immoral to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke keif unless it had been aged for a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the reason that I found is that
maybe you are creating some new chemicals,
[SPEAKER_01]: but mostly, the effect is just a lot
smoother.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's smoother when you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have the harshness.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some extra flakes that kick in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the Afghans, they often sieve just
after drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't cure like other producing
country months before they actually sieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they do that, they put the resin in
goat skin with the fur out, and they put
[SPEAKER_00]: them underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they call their cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, they price it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, the agents work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in this country, aging is not
something known.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a bunch of friends that have been
aging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend in India who lives there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have even a passport anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're local for that matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year, they put some underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked some stuff from 12 years old that
was mind-blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have some 15 years that's in
humble right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to go recollect it, but that was my
2012 plan for when the world ended.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have my stash of aged hash that
was all good, but that didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can prove that there is really
greatness created through aging,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we can calculate that chemical process
like the wine industry calculates the
[SPEAKER_00]: fermentation, then hash takes another
dimension.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to buy your hash this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be more expensive next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a perishable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a product that is becoming more
valuable year after year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: The current cannabis model right now is...
Nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no niche in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no niche in the cannabis industry
where you have that ability to age and
[SPEAKER_00]: gain in quality through time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people's perception of quality is
the color of how white it is and clear and
[SPEAKER_01]: golden, but when you press it and age it,
you're inevitably going to turn it brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take any material and you
microplane it fine enough, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be white, even ebena, even the darkest
wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grind it fine enough, it will be
white, and you go further, it becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: invisible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how your eyes can capture that image.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take a microplane resin from a
freezer and you hold it in a few seconds
[SPEAKER_00]: in your hand, it's going to melt together
when it's really good, and it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a nice amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand how people can not get
the clues that it is very difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the good resin not to stick together
because resin needs to be together to
[SPEAKER_00]: become greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put it in the freezer,
you literally work against nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the first thing that resin will
do, it's sticking together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to lose your color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to become more in an amber
color, and then if you want to decarb and
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of that carboxyl acid that makes
all the psychoactive potency of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid latent until it's gone,
well, you're going to ingest a lot of THCA
[SPEAKER_00]: and CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to decarb on the nail,
but when you need it, 15 minutes at 300,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much when you lose at 320,
how much do you decarb at 700?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you press the ash, my decarb is
somewhere around 30, 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the ash is going to bubble like crazy
on the nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have another 20%, 25,
maybe 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're in the range of 70%,
80% of decarb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over that, your THC becomes CBN faster
that you lose that carboxyl acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a certain sense, you activate your
cannabinoid because you take away that
[SPEAKER_00]: compound that locked down the psychoactive
potency of the cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings it to a nice ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings you to a level where when you
smoke the ash, you really feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I edge, I go a bit lower down and I
let the edging do a better decarb.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lower the temperature, it's like
cooking, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slow cooking, it's warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a bit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I know I'm going to edge, I don't do as
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I know that I'm going to wait only a
month to six weeks before the minimum time
[SPEAKER_00]: I give myself before I put something on
the market, I don't have that great decarb
[SPEAKER_00]: coming after.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you going to try to edge all of the
product that you make?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to work with three different
dispensaries where I'm going to bring a
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of dry resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to test the dry resin before I
press.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to press it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to test it just after
pressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to work it the way I
normally do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to edge it there and
test it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you haven't done it yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to be the education that
will need for the public to create a
[SPEAKER_01]: demand for the age.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be the proof of a concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be scientific proof of an
experience of an experiential knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have, kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like something that I've experienced so
many times to be able to create more than
[SPEAKER_00]: a buzz and create such a market of the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my gift to anybody who wants to
make a super life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go into domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every cultivar is going to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, then you have incredible
discovery territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to need to work intensely
with that, which is super good because
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes you even more knowledgeable on
your soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you analyze everything you do from the
first sprouts to the end product,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you do the soul and the product,
you know what the plant is taking from the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like all this data.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a lot of data right there
because there's so many variables within
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the soil is one aspect of what is
going to be produced from the trichrome,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also is the humidity and the
temperature.
It's going to be a lot of data.
It's going to be a lot of data.
