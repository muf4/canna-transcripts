[SPEAKER_00]: CDFA has been in Humboldt, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're setting up Humboldt offices and
how has that potentially impacted the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations, right, this latest addition?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I feel like as ICFA, right,
and probably groups that you've worked
[SPEAKER_00]: with to Sequoia, we've, for the last year
or more, 18 months, have put in comment
[SPEAKER_00]: that light deprivation needs to be allowed
in the outdoor tier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I was fascinated by CDFA being up
in Humboldt doing inspections was that I
[SPEAKER_00]: had a number of farmers tell me that the
inspectors came to their farms where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's these, you know, to harvest light
depth seasonal facilities where all the
[SPEAKER_00]: tarps go away, all the fans come out,
all the, you know, any lighting that's
[SPEAKER_00]: there, if there's any, goes away for the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CDFA repeatedly noted that they were
amazed by what they were seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had no idea that light deprivation
could happen without supplemental
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had no idea that it was happening
on such a, I don't know, maybe kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional or rudimentary scale,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have these, you know,
gutter connect greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We literally have people tilling the
ground and adding amendments and they have
[SPEAKER_00]: very, yep, they have very low tech
structures and they're using very simple
[SPEAKER_00]: farming techniques that, I mean,
they're outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are subject to all the elements,
yet- Why it's so amazing that there hasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: been any shift in the regulations showing
that they understood that this exists or
[SPEAKER_02]: being able to, you know, they obviously
created different pricing tiers for other
[SPEAKER_02]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they were able to see that that was
happening, you would have thought that
[SPEAKER_02]: there was some kind of additional
licensing tiers maybe for light
[SPEAKER_02]: deprivation without any supplemental
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I was hoping, I was hoping
that if nothing else, they would have kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of broadened the scale of pricing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was some more opportunities in
that kind of in between outdoor and ML1
[SPEAKER_00]: tier because I mean, the vast majority of
the farmers, like the longtime farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: have developed their property with,
you know, a little bit of outdoor full
[SPEAKER_00]: term, some ML1 activities happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really a matter of resources and
convenience and having the timing to
[SPEAKER_00]: manage that farm with a low amount of
staff and being as mellow on the landscape
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it falls back to the farmers
needing the ability to be flexible with
[SPEAKER_02]: the circumstances that they have when you
talk about their elements and other
[SPEAKER_02]: resources and being able to respond to
those the way a farmer does, which is by
[SPEAKER_02]: fixing the situation with the solution
without having to have, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: government really is now telling them how
they can run their farm without really
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding how a farm is run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't have the flexibility to be
a farmer and make those decisions on the
farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if a farmer is farming and all
of a sudden there's a heavy rain coming
[SPEAKER_02]: that they didn't expect, they want to be
able to put up a tarp because that's what
[SPEAKER_02]: they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, all of a sudden, they can't just put
a tarp up and cover their crop and protect
[SPEAKER_02]: it from the rain because they'll get in
trouble for having the wrong license for
[SPEAKER_02]: that practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The regulators have no idea about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The regulators that have been chosen to
regulate cannabis have no idea about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis because the people that do know
about cannabis, the regulators feel they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't trust them because they were working
in the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like this catch 22.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the people that should be the ones
making the decisions about the regulations
[SPEAKER_01]: can't because they were doing it for so
long that they were part of an illicit
[SPEAKER_01]: market that means the regulators don't
trust them to come in and make the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, so we end up having a
situation where the regulations do not
[SPEAKER_01]: match the reality, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're trying to make sure that
they've captured the ability to,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not being work around.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to stop there being any
flexibility or any opportunity for someone
[SPEAKER_02]: to not give them what it is they're
looking for, which is either the control
[SPEAKER_02]: or the information or the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also think that regulators in many
cases like to look to other programs that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been adopted and utilized in other
areas, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis programs in Colorado and
Washington state, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And not a lot of them include outdoor
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those programs were established and
then birthed an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are 20 plus years down the road
to California with this very robust
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and trying to take those very
linear programs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which are, you know, trying to cram that
squareness into our round way of life,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily working and we're
really far away from the regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the point with CDFA coming up
and what is that doing for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're a little too little,
a little too late, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they showed up too late in the
regulatory process to actually understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what the farmers need, what they're going
through, what the challenges and the
[SPEAKER_00]: struggles are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here they are in August having,
in September, having their first
[SPEAKER_00]: inspections on these farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're the oldest farms that are
trying the hardest to take their square
[SPEAKER_00]: farm and cram it into a round hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't, it doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I sometimes wonder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like, sometimes I feel like they
are listening and they are very intrigued
[SPEAKER_02]: and interested in what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are trying to come to the farms
and see these things and understand what's
[SPEAKER_02]: going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then something happens between that,
them seeing and understanding and them
[SPEAKER_02]: going back and making regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there's some other
influence or some other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's both of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of very now well financed
sectors of the industry that are in rooms
[SPEAKER_01]: with lobbyists all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's definitely happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think also these folks are
fighting cognitive dissonance of reefer
[SPEAKER_01]: madness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're still trying to not feel that
cannabis plants are dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: They feel it deep inside themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though now intellectually they're
understanding it differently and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing images that are replacing that
feeling, they still come back and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they're still like, oh, but I'm still
really kind of scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like that's something we have
to deal with, that that reefer madness is
[SPEAKER_01]: still going to hold on for a little bit
longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to show up in these regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to show up in being afraid of
sun grown and being afraid of social
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption and being afraid of farmers
selling directly to consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's still very much rooted in
reefer madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and one of the biggest reefer
madness things I feel like I saw in the
[SPEAKER_00]: regs was this language about changing the
definition of immature plants to anything
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 inches wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or 18 inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even understand how this is
going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I see some impacts, but they only
did it in CDPH and BCC regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then yeah, not in the cultivation
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it doesn't necessarily change a
farmer's ability to propagate and at what
[SPEAKER_00]: time their propagated material moves into
their flowering canopy, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: totally change the nursery industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if BCC says that a mature plant an
immature plant is anything smaller than 18
[SPEAKER_00]: inches tall and 18 inches wide,
those are the only plants that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: transported through a distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the only plants that can be sold
at a retailer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how does that work for someone
who's a cultivator that is a micro
[SPEAKER_02]: business who is A supposed to follow the
rules in the CDFA regs that states it's
[SPEAKER_02]: one way and B follow the rules that the
BCC has developed for micro businesses
[SPEAKER_02]: that is a whole different definition.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we need to go smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because wrapping my brain around how I
will ever get seed plants again is really
[SPEAKER_00]: hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's just so fascinating
because they don't put it all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like we're supposed to be the in this
whole equation of like government and us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're supposed to be the ones that don't
understand things and are like making
[SPEAKER_01]: things that contradict each other and
aren't making sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's supposed to be us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're supposed to be the stoners.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like we're sitting here trying
to explain this in like the most basic
[SPEAKER_01]: like first greater level and then
regulators are just like smoking something
[SPEAKER_01]: and have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like it's almost just like this
weird reality where like the stoners know
[SPEAKER_01]: what to do and the government is just off
like in their own little world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I mean in all fairness right trying
to regulate a 20 plus year old industry
[SPEAKER_00]: has got to be really really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier if you ask the people from the
industry how to do it and listen to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: At some level that it probably is a sign
of over regulation because there's too
[SPEAKER_02]: much regulation that's crossing over and
not connecting and causing problems with
[SPEAKER_02]: other regulation that is make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I want to share that says
overregulated like a bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that regulation you know all
these other industries are regulated and I
[SPEAKER_02]: feel like I think we were all kind not all
but I feel like we were ready for it
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhat and we're ready for there to be
some kind of rules to follow and to be
[SPEAKER_02]: accountable but it is too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well because it's the intersection of
cannabis in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean if we were cannabis in some other
state it would be easier if we were
[SPEAKER_01]: another industry in California it would be
easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact that we're cannabis which is
overregulated everywhere and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: California that over regulates everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have it really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it like it literally is a shit
storm created by how we have do business
[SPEAKER_01]: in our state intersecting with how states
do business with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we probably have more agencies
involved than any other cannabis program
[SPEAKER_00]: on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more taxes more more agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the three primary regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're a cultivator you also have
fish and wildlife and the water boards
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation the tax agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's elaborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're exhausted.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's starting to become a dangerous place
my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
