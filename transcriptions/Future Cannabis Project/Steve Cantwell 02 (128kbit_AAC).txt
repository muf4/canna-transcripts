[SPEAKER_00]: You're up here in the triangle,
the animal triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You build a brand around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes you different?
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in the animal triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a set of strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow them the best you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Market them really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just keep going, keep going,
keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get intimidated when you see these
huge corporate grows open up Dan Barzerian
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these crazy freaking huge
corporate monsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, at the end of the day,
just let your enemies kill themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're shooting themselves in the foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stand back, do your own thing,
stay in your own lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of blessings out there for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't got to get jealous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't got to see your neighbor
cropping out bigger than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, he didn't lock his trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you don't got to think things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be thankful for what you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And try to create more of that community
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in Nevada, where I'm from,
it's extremely competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The corruption is unreal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not a real community vibe
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that the dust has kind of settled
a little bit, we're kind of starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But California, you guys have a good
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't lose that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely stay true to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get hostile towards your neighbors
because they're able to pay for their
[SPEAKER_00]: license or they're able to crop out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to make a sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to do this because that's the
most toxic thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most toxic thing you can do is spend
your energy on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, back to Brandon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so we started off in Nevada,
competitive market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did things completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do these things because they were
trending back when I did them four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody was hashtagging freaking living
soil or no till or any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the cool kids were doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, for me, it was more about this is
the pot that I want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the pot that I want to bring to
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it was just what is the purest
way to grow cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as an indoor farmer, that's one of my
biggest annoying things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to have a roof over my head every
single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I walk outside in the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some of the most sun you can
ever freaking ask for, almost too much
[SPEAKER_00]: sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, work with what you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make the best of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build a brand around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just make sure that you're not chasing
trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of that going on these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather see a group of individuals
setting trends than chasing trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's too many of this cool kid
stuff going on where everybody's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: going in the same direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the total wrong direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a sheep's getting led to
the slaughter kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the main things that you can
protect yourself with is having a voice,
[SPEAKER_00]: having a story, making sure that you have
a brand that people support, that people
[SPEAKER_00]: can stand behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, again, it was a whole
regenerative movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do things that support the regenerative
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, as a farmer, I can't save the world
single-handedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can try to plant a seed in each
individual's head.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just turns on that, hey, it makes
them think more regeneratively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the things that we do to kind
of highlight what I just said is we have
[SPEAKER_00]: our jar recycling program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So years ago, when we opened up our
facility, my investors, like if any of you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys that have investors, are probably
done like, hey, we want to go cheap,
[SPEAKER_00]: cheap, cheap on packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to put good weed in the cheapest
bag possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: No go, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I fought really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gentleman right here actually helped
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found jars that were the best jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not the best looking jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually look like something you get
tomato pasta sauce in or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not the best looking jars,
I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is the best jar, in my opinion,
to store weed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did all kind of trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has the best seal and lid that you
just open it, you just close the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we ran with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a whole jar packaging program
basically to protect the quality of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be selling, you don't
want to grow the best herb in the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in a 10-cent bag, and then by the
time it gets to the consumer, it turns to
[SPEAKER_00]: dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, make sure that you're able
to make those proper decisions when that
[SPEAKER_00]: spot goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a lot of that ruin the good grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter how good you grow,
but if you don't put it in something,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to have a quality package
and you're screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, I forgot where I was going
with that jar, my bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with our jar, we do a recycling
program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is we ask people,
hey, if you have 10 GOP jars, 7 I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: starts at, 7 GOP jars, you get a half,
10, 20 GOP jars, you get a pre-roll,
[SPEAKER_00]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that does is we get this huge
thing that people are hashtagging us and
[SPEAKER_00]: how they reuse their jars with candles,
coin this, ashtrays that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we got people bringing hundreds of
jars coming, and sometimes they don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: want to pre-roll it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the idea that they feel like
they're recycling and pitching into
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a whole program to where we
then peel the stickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stickers that we use are easy to peel
for that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can run them through a dishwasher,
clean them, put them back into rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just one more way that we're
kind of spreading that regenerative,
[SPEAKER_00]: that thinking process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just to open, rip, use, throw away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as the regenerative movement,
the whole idea is to just basically to
[SPEAKER_00]: look further down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just sit there and just build
this huge trash pile of heaping piles of
[SPEAKER_00]: garbage as you try to get rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to make your soil better,
more regenerative by reusing all the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you produce and try to
basically not have to open your front gate
[SPEAKER_00]: and become a consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be a producer and not a consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to produce without having to
intake, intake, intake, without being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce on my own property.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even with my soil company or our flower
company right now, we take very little
[SPEAKER_00]: from the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I might get a little bit of
coconut powder here and now and then to
[SPEAKER_00]: spoil my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't figured out how to make that
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: For most of the seeds, we catch our own
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything, we have drying racks for,
we have drying rooms for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have drying racks for plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because anything I grow, I don't want to
put back in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to just take, take,
take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have different things for different
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like half my room gets put into a dry
room, half my room gets put into dry racks
[SPEAKER_00]: and put back into the room or into a
composting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that compost now gets used into
the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything we use, everything we cut
down ends up getting back into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that doesn't go back in the
soil is the bugs that we sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do things like water catchment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So indoors, we have the ability to control
our environment, the sealed environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any water that we put into that room,
we have to then remove from the room with
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidification or HVAC or HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we catch that water and we reuse
that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we have to filter and purify it to
make sure that our coils are copper,
[SPEAKER_00]: not aluminum.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's things like that to make sure you
look into.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be dumping a bunch of
heavy metals that you guys in California
[SPEAKER_00]: have had that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be watering your plants
with a bunch of heavy metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you definitely got to make sure you
have the right equipment to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But water catchment is a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're in the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the most valuable resources in
the desert is water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have plenty of sun, we have plenty of
that, but we don't have a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the things I try to focus
on the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say right now, we're probably
capturing about, reusing about 70% of our
[SPEAKER_00]: water when taking about 30% from the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they did our water accounts,
we used about as much as the average
[SPEAKER_00]: household to run a 10,000 square foot grow
facility or a residential household.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was pretty cool when they're
making that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they thought something was broken
is why they actually sent the people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, this can't be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are stealing water kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of had to explain to them this
whole mechanism of how you can get water
[SPEAKER_00]: from air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, yeah, you never heard of
rain?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's all kinds of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I was forced to go indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of experience indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't look at the negative side of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at the positive side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took those challenges and I used them to
make me better, not to limit my potential,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to make me better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So indoors was just one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbial testing was one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbial testing is a huge challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be able to pass that and grow a
quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why so many people struggle with
pesticides and fungicides, because they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have the ability to grow in an
environment that won't have those pests,
[SPEAKER_00]: those pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one, you got to be good at what you do
to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you've got to understand what it
is that you're up against when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: facing biologicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're up against anaerobic microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure that you're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm not a big fan personally of
KNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that I don't think KNF works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that I don't think KNF grows
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've smoked great fricking herb that
was KNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that I don't think KNF will work in a
commercial setting where they have mold
[SPEAKER_00]: and yeast testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just know what you're up against as far as
that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as the regenerative stuff goes,
yeah, it's just going green, focusing on
[SPEAKER_00]: using less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we use LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our power consumption indoors is cut by
50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things like that, just chasing that
goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal as even an indoor farmer is I want
to be able to shut my front gate and to
[SPEAKER_00]: only be a producer and sell stuff and not
have to intake any thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to catch my own water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make my own nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to grow my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I use alfalfa, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to grow a little field of alfalfa
right next to my indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I need predator bugs, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know how to make pirate bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know how to make square sea mice
or breed them, populate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the direction that we're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be able to close my front gate
and not need anything from anybody and
[SPEAKER_00]: just be able to supply everybody with
everything is kind of the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from my regenerative mindset as a
regenerative farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it goes further than that,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, a regenerative mindset also
goes into the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that you have a
healthy community because without a
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy community supporting you,
you can't support your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, there's a whole, there's
definitely layers to that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for us, that's the approach I took.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the cannabis industry in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a huge stage for the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought, hey, if we could use
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If cannabis is known as a gateway drug to
failures and to hate, heroin, and rape,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these things, why can't it be a
gateway drug to something positive,
[SPEAKER_00]: to permaculture, to regenerative farming,
to plant medicine, to things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to flip the strip in that sense
and use it as a tool of picking things up
[SPEAKER_00]: and not putting it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We chased that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, indoors in the desert,
we have our challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Nevada right now, there's probably 15
dispensaries, really 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there might be 20 brands,
or 30 brands, but there's really like 15
[SPEAKER_00]: ownership groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like 200 brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, how do you really separate?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not all garbage, I assure you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 200 brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, 50% of them are probably if-ish
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's really some really good guys
out there that are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you compete with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got people that got every strain in
the world now is out there for grabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like, oh, I got the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, gee, you don't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I got the real girl stuff cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or whatever it is, whatever the MAC won,
whatever it is that you've got,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's got everything now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you separate yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you've got to build a brand behind
something, stand behind that people you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know, never met will stand behind,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the regenerative movement is something
that if you don't stand behind it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to wake up real quick,
for all of our sake, because it's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we really need to start focusing
on being more regenerative, more
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to be regenerative, you first
have to be sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just go straight to being
regenerative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to first create a sustainable
business model is the first part to being
[SPEAKER_00]: a sustainable farm or a regenerative farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, a single business model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you can make money,
pay the bills, keep the lights on,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the pump pumping, wherever the case
may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can start to work on that
next phase, being regenerative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the words are used interchangeably
a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my own mind, I kind of separate
them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sustainable and regenerative, two
completely different things that coexist
[SPEAKER_00]: with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have one without the other,
in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, so yeah, so that's kind of
what we did in the Valor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We focused on that in a highly competitive
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We focused on our strengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: We focused on a quality plant,
what I felt was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we built that brand around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a really good team.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have really good reputation for what we
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go to any dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just that, hey, they grow the
best weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, no, those guys, they grow the
best weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their sales team sells the best weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The delivery team is always on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the front door to the back door,
we get compliments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really, really important,
because at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the biggest hangups you're going to
have as a brand, as a business,
[SPEAKER_00]: is, again, is getting that sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you've got to get in the door of
the dispensary, and then you've got to get
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone's got to buy your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't just focus on the person
buying your weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to focus on the person who's
got to buy it from you, the purchasing
[SPEAKER_00]: manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you make your weed hard to buy for
the person who buys, they're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy weed from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a weed dealer, and every time
you called him, he'd say, I'll be there in
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He shows up fucking three days later with
fucking the wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to start looking for a
different weed guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your business isn't on point,
isn't structured to where you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting those every single thing,
and you're just hitting on point,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to be competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be competitive.
You're not going to be competitive.
You're going to be competitive.
