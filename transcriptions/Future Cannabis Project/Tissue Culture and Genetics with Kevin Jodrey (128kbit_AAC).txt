[SPEAKER_01]: with the clones and tissue culture,
you have some phenomenal stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: and not even just stateside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're kind of tapped in globally
as far as land race and some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: other things when it comes to true
genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In projects I am, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean things stay within the borders of
the country, but being involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for a long time and sharing
genetics for a long time, I never really,
[SPEAKER_00]: I never understood the real impact of it
over the course of decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always move material to people,
and I always shared material with people
[SPEAKER_00]: because I believe fundamentally people
need good quality material to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that being generous with that one
aspect allows people to have a much higher
[SPEAKER_00]: level of success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see my fellow cultivators or
nursery operators really as competitors
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a big industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what you are is you're all in
the same situation working kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboratively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've always moved the material that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it did is it allowed me to get a
global amount of people that I've dealt
[SPEAKER_00]: with over the course of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it lets me see what's going on in all
these different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nuts, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff in Spain,
a lot of stuff up in Middle Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got fields of weed in Iran.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iran has got fields of good grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's amazing to see all over
Europe, it's amazing to see what's taking
[SPEAKER_00]: place all through the Americas,
Australia, New Zealand, they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to me it's amazing because it lets
us really take a look at the picture of
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for us what we did is we shifted
into a full tissue culture build out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried to figure out for years,
how do you run an operation using the
[SPEAKER_00]: most, and what I did is I looked for
whatever was the stringent most difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: standards to try to follow with the amount
of inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would find out, could you actually
succeed following a regulated system in
[SPEAKER_00]: ag?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because no other ag is regulated like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's finding out how hard it is
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you don't have the tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can't suddenly have a mistake
and go, all right, I'm going to use a
[SPEAKER_00]: tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no tool to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried to figure it out for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we knew that tissue culture was the
only way to go around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked with TC Labs for a while
playing around, but it just wasn't dialed
[SPEAKER_00]: in enough to make it efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the price point was too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could plug the cut, but you
couldn't get the price point down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to work with the lab out
of Petaluma Node and get it to the point
[SPEAKER_00]: where our new facility is designed to just
receive the material from them in
[SPEAKER_00]: micro-plantlet form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just grow it out into a clonal
form so that we can then wholesale it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of puts us in a jobber level of
a wholesale so that it lets us put
[SPEAKER_00]: material into nurseries, other nurseries
that's been virally stamped and
[SPEAKER_00]: third-party.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this way you have the ability to start
with material that has been certified by
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody other than us that's coming from
TC so it's not carrying any inherent
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses, any kind of pathogenic problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fusarium is what you see so much of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So scrubbing it gets rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it lets you grow and then work off of
getting your protocol straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you can run the same variety a
couple of times in a row and actually have
[SPEAKER_00]: a predicated concept of what are you going
to make?
[SPEAKER_00]: And without this stabilization,
it's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're seeing TC blow up
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of it is they're just trying to
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're ready to do the full rollout
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited because, man, it's a
nightmare to run nursery operations in
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated conditions because, morally,
you don't want to use any of this crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on a business level, you're not
allowed to under regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have no tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis is constantly being exposed
to new pathogens all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your technology comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so strawberries, bananas, fruit trees,
they all use this to get around this
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where we're going to have to
go with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a lot of ways, using the technology
is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would rather have the tech and the
expense than I would rather have toxic
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't agree with it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been challenging people for
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can talk smack, but come over and
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's never been any pesticides or
fungicides or regulators on any of these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's an artificial reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes, man, you've got to look
stupid to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it's amazing how time
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who looks bad and who doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all in all, if we can do this
correctly, then what it does, it allows us
[SPEAKER_00]: to start taking old varieties that are
basically, they want to get rid of them
[SPEAKER_00]: and scrub them on a cellular level and get
the pathogenic weight off of it so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can then have material that's
beautiful again and then hold it in banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because so much of those source material
is being diminished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you remove the population of
cultivators that used to cultivate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't afford to hold a library if you
can only sell OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why do you hold the other 26 varieties?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty soon you have nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone goes, the big guys will have
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the big guys come in, and we'll call
any of these large LPs, when they buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow company, they buy the company and
they buy their genetic collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's the genetic collection that
seems to have the value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have an extensive genetic collection
that we laugh that goes back in time,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always laugh and I'm just like,
it's the toolbox because I can go into
[SPEAKER_00]: this collection and I can pull out a lot
of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's neat now is some of the
newer collections because a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: newer cannabis, it's not that it's worse
or better than older cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just marketed to different groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now that you have a bigger
demographic to sell to because you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually target them, we can start to have
specific stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, I'm excited about stuff that's
meant for 50 to 70 year olds that want to
[SPEAKER_00]: go back to just smoking good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it because you're one of the only
other guys in the industry besides that's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I have a friend who's got 135 acres
down in Santa Barbara County.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, if you want to do something
different, he's like, I'm trying to figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out, I'm trying to chase all these trendy
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I'll tell you one thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the largest group that's consuming
cannabis is 39 and under.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fastest growing segment is over
40.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, you know, do something
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you have a lot of dispenser
will say they won't buy it, they won't buy
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you get the marketing on point,
I'm like, I'm telling you, get some of
[SPEAKER_01]: those strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the strain that you and I grew up
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the strain that your dad grew up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make sure that you are letting the
individuals that you really want to have
[SPEAKER_00]: experience that know it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're not they're not looking at
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care about numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't care about numbers in the
past.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care about Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they what they care about is I want
to smoke something that makes me happy or
[SPEAKER_00]: or calm or euphoric or contemplative or
relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want the experience to be quality in
any one of those directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the newer cannabis,
because the potency levels are so high,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't titrate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can't get the dose right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go burn a joint or two,
and they're just sauced.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why that's what I'm worried about
is people are going to be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is why I stopped doing the I mean,
my mom, she was like, I don't like how it
[SPEAKER_01]: feels is this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Mom, that's like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to go down to Mexico during spring
break, you know, kid growing up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, that'd be me going down
there for spring break, getting drunk off
[SPEAKER_01]: tequila, saying I'm never drinking again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just it's not the right
mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your point when I think it's BDS
analytics that pointed out that the
[SPEAKER_01]: potency of cannabis specifically as it
relates to THC has been a multiplier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been 4x in the last seven years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we grew up with six to nine
percent on a good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the extraction needs it,
though, because if you're not pulling over
[SPEAKER_00]: 20, you're not you're not making any money
on the extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just really trying to
stratify.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like nobody smokes flour anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's market across the board for
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just you have to target it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are people that smoke flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them want experience over sheer
knockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where you can get into the
extracts because we can make anything
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger and then add a package to direct
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the people that want to be able to
consume cannabis in an enjoyable manner
[SPEAKER_00]: where they can burn five, six joints and
hang out and laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that we know that the lung
ailments don't exist with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this way, so it's a smoking weed is bad
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to test for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lungs are pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that that allows you to really get
rid of that argument and go back into this
[SPEAKER_00]: is how I prefer to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want is I want cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me feel good in the direction I
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't need a celebrity endorser on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need a special box on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to get it in a baggy out the back
of a car from a dude named Shiloh.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying, yeah, no, we can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really what the truth of it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just give it to them in a clean
form, safe form, reliable form,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then have it so they can go get it
through the course of the year or make a
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-buy or be able to get because people
would buy a couple ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't get them in one shot,
but you could buy a quarter pound over a
[SPEAKER_00]: week, put it in your house, throw a Vita
pack in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't keep it moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have yourself some rich cannabis
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that group would do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm in Q, I mean, we did a little
field trip down to Mercy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love the guys down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in Q and the guy in front of me is
like, all I know is I found the one I like
[SPEAKER_01]: and I keep coming back because they have
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, do you know which farm,
not just the strain, do you know which
[SPEAKER_01]: farm are getting it from me?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a genotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a production type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the same varietal in the hands of two
different people is a radically different
[SPEAKER_00]: animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you find a good farm,
reward the farmer by rebuying his product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can also contact the farm and
ask them, what else do you do that's like
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And who else might I want to smoke weed
from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we all used to advertise each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's so competitive, but it doesn't
need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: What needs to be competitive is getting
the education to the public so that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have enough tools to make smart decisions
so that they're satisfied with what they
[SPEAKER_00]: buy and they rebuy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to be of service to these
people that they do not know and they
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't been exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dispensaries shield the truth in a
lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the grower needs to be able to make
these direct connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people find that they love a
flower from a farm and they can contact
[SPEAKER_00]: the farm and have a communication over the
internet, it may not be able to sell to
[SPEAKER_00]: them directly, but they can sure as hell
help them understand why they are who they
[SPEAKER_00]: are, which then lets word of mouth drive
your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can also say, these are other
farms that have nice products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should check them out because that's
what you're doing is now you're being a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis human being.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we were just having dinner last
night downtown here in Santa Rosa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was I would venture to say there
were some growers sitting at the table
[SPEAKER_01]: next to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of them brought that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, screw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to go straight to the dispenser.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be able to tell my story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be able to share what makes us
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was really interesting how
that exactly your point.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, if we could cut out the
distributor, we would want to communicate
[SPEAKER_00]: what we'll do with those at the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the one log.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll set it up to where we have the
grower events where we can get all the
[SPEAKER_00]: growers that want to come down from the
hills and meet the public that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: advertise for bring them because we have a
beautiful facility to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can then sell their product
through the store legally for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't have to be the person that
interprets who you are and then explains
[SPEAKER_00]: it to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they can confer with us and we
can we can substantiate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they are those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said they do a really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does now, you have
confirmation of a hypothesis, a belief
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've confirmed becomes a purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's good, they buy it twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you buy it twice, it's on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that model when I cruised up,
checked out the dispensary up there with
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I was impressed by because
you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go into some of these, especially the
higher bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not knocking them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially the higher volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's too business in the disconnect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know we're trying to be more PC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting to call them cannabis
consultants versus but tenders.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of them is what they call them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a new term.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's hella funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: C squared, C squared cannabis consultant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like we somewhere we segue from
rec to adult use and terminology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inspirational use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inspirational use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was talking to one gal and I
secret shop and not to call it went out
[SPEAKER_01]: just to experience it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this young lady, I'm like,
well, you know, what's your favorite?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, well, I was just blazing that at
lunch and I just ripped that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: She was full on high when she is talking
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is recommending based on someone who
their idea of hitting the pinnacle is
[SPEAKER_01]: Chernobyl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked her what her favorite terpium was.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'd be like, yeah, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it the farmer, the farmer needs
to be able to get in there because
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately that there's a well,
there's a lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis consultant names kill me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always I'm always aggressive on the bud
tender, but it's not because I have any
[SPEAKER_00]: disrespect for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that they're having a lot of
responsibility put on their back for not a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the education just needs to be put in
place so that they're understanding more
[SPEAKER_00]: on how to market and satisfy the desire of
the farm and the buyer, the user.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot of weight on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they always get a ration and shift
and not being educated enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm like, if you want to treat it like
a career, do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a that's like a real barista in
Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a different job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not regular coffee maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're conductors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can they conduct a business,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They run a tight ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw that when we were really quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's there was a gal.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is Neil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing a vendor day at a jetty and
packs there, which was nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is an older woman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd venture to guess about sixty eight,
sixty nine sitting on the couch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you had a cannabis consultant that was
talking to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was eavesdropping because being in
the industry, I just want to hear people's
[SPEAKER_01]: story.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way that this woman was
explaining it and speaking at her level.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like, OK, obviously she went
to college and took speech one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She knew her audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: She knew how to speak to this woman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she is being very specific on the
dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before you go to bed, one puff.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, if you wake up, obviously sleep
deprivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sixty four percent of people consume
cannabis, according to BDS, is because of
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: This woman was one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wake up three, four in the morning,
one more puff that should carry you
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the fact that she has taken the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there is there is acute.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fifty people in line.
[SPEAKER_00]: This woman was all about the detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of stuff, you can't fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like everybody has these policies where
we do all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, the people that serve
cannabis, the tenders, when they're when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're real, they they're so crucial
because they interface all these people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are undereducated in how to use the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they alleviate their fear that
they're going to make a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they give them confidence to try
things and they they give them information
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can direct them and steer them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a beautiful relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, for someone who's been running
the defense for a long time, but tenders
[SPEAKER_00]: get their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like bartenders or cannabis
consultants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a liquor consultant?
[SPEAKER_00]: The liquor consultant gets a an
unbelievable following because of how they
[SPEAKER_00]: serve that drink to the person and make
them feel that it's worth their time to be
[SPEAKER_00]: there in the interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's it's it's it's it's pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with with cannabis, it's brand new in
that respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to be able to put it
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to be able to have
tenders that understand what the products
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to have the ability to
have farms have reps that are human and
[SPEAKER_00]: patient that are able to say this is take
the time and you repeat yourself a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: because each person is going to ask the
same questions.

[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you really look at it like that,
it allows you to really get lost in what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing.

affected because they go, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like you saw that girl or that woman
serve that other woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always look at the woman who did the
serving differently because you realize

[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't to push upsell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You weren't trying to sell them a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were just trying to get them something
that worked and the effort was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, that's why I love cannabis

[SPEAKER_01]: Very true.
Yeah.
