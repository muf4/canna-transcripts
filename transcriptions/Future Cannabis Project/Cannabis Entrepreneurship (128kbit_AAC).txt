[SPEAKER_03]: Whistle if you have your own company right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whistle if you have your own company and
you sell products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whistle if you have your own company and
you sell products and you develop
[SPEAKER_03]: partnerships.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whistle if you communicate with other
human beings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whistle if you communicate with other
human beings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whistle if you communicate with other
human beings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whistle if you communicate with other
human beings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whistle if you communicate with other
human beings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whistle if you communicate with other
human beings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whistle if you communicate with other
human beings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting a pitch should not begin with the
great things that you do and how much you
[SPEAKER_03]: love your product and huge words no one
understands.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not about proving how smart you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about proving how well you can
communicate with any level of
[SPEAKER_03]: intelligence.
[SPEAKER_03]: A great pitch is simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: It explains things in very, very simple,
everyday, common, personal terms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, when it comes down to understanding
what a pitch is, I think we have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who you are, what you do, why it's
important to other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, in particular, the person you're
talking to at the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, pitches come in very, very different
states.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're at a networking event and you meet
someone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you have to answer those three
questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it important to me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's really important you have this
polished.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you have one minute on stage to
pitch investors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you have three minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: People come to us and say, I need to
develop my 20-minute TED talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, if that is in your head,
until Ted calls you himself, remove it
[SPEAKER_03]: from your mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: The most important thing you can do is
explain who you are in 15 to 20 seconds
[SPEAKER_03]: and get intrigued.
[SPEAKER_03]: The purpose of a great pitch, what a great
pitch does, opens up the, it stimulates
[SPEAKER_03]: dopamine in the mind just like a drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are selling a verbal drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you are selling a pitch, you have to
stimulate the dopamine in someone's brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to know more.
[SPEAKER_03]: The best result of a pitch is not,
how do I write you a check?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, ooh, how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, where do I go from here?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the next step?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's to get buying indicators from people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I want two entrepreneurs to come up on
stage with me today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who would like some free pitch advice?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, frankly, fuck all of you
then if you don't want my help.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Two of you, come on up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cancer survivor, absolutely,
come on up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three, come on up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be courageous and active.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like both of those two terms.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your business?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, I'm an event planner.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of events do you run?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis events.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the outcomes of these events?
[SPEAKER_07]: People come, they enjoy entertainment,
comedy, burlesque, dance performance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see how this already developed from
I'm an event planner to hosting cool
[SPEAKER_03]: events?
[SPEAKER_03]: How about you, come on up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like teaching.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like experiential learning.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm an entrepreneur coming into this
industry learning to make an extract for
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, my name is Claudia and I own a brand
new company that is proficient in
[SPEAKER_06]: marketing in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, these are actually all pretty good,
concise pitches, but let's work on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, the first thing, who are you and what
you have an interesting story you've
[SPEAKER_03]: already shared, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If I were you, the way I would explain my
story and stimulate dopamine is I'm a
[SPEAKER_03]: cancer survivor and I attribute my
survival to the cannabis plan because I
[SPEAKER_03]: have survived this process, this
turbulence in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I now believe I'm free to get business
around the holistic effects of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking further to that, why do you do
event planning?
[SPEAKER_07]: I do event planning mostly because the
events I've already been to in LA are a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of guys who are getting really,
really high and I want to provide
[SPEAKER_07]: something else for women, for anybody who
wants to do art.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so again, we're talking about
setting a frame, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people in the movie industry in
the city.
[SPEAKER_03]: Framing, frame your work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, because I've been to so many awful
events with stoner dudes everywhere,
[SPEAKER_03]: I've decided to take a stance,
become an event planner and create amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis-related events that provide for
legal medication and enjoyable formats,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you get into branding?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or why?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, mostly I got into it because I saw
branding needed a lot of help in this
[SPEAKER_06]: industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was really wanting to strive to break
the stigma, the teaching trauma,
[SPEAKER_06]: just bring more professional work to this
industry.
Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, here is the most, I relate everything
to movies, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, a great pitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody seen Goodfellas?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody remember the first line in
the entire movie?
[SPEAKER_03]: For as long as I can remember,
I've always wanted to be a gangster.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It sets the tone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tells you this person has passion,
gumption for his chosen career path.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, in the same context, for as long as I
can remember, I've disliked how things
[SPEAKER_03]: were branded.
[SPEAKER_03]: I decided to take a stance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked at this industry, I understand it
well, and now I provide X, Y, and Z
[SPEAKER_03]: services to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, thinking about it, who you are,
very important that you explain who you
[SPEAKER_03]: are, why you're doing what you do,
because it makes you relatable to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care really what your business is,
or your P&L, or your graphs and
[SPEAKER_03]: spreadsheets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I care about why you do what you do,
then I care about what you do,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I care about how we can do it
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, breaking these down, you guys are very
succinct, but very blind.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, remember this, in your pitches,
for as long as I can remember,
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always wanted to be a gangster.
[SPEAKER_03]: For as long as I can remember,
I've always wanted to be an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_03]: For as long as I can remember,
I've always wanted to throw great events.
[SPEAKER_03]: Start everything that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sets a great framework context to show
some passion for what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fall?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I put who's, is anyone asleep yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: You will be, never mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: In your pitch, I want you to refine it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very succinct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, tell me exactly what it is,
one by one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your new pitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a trick question.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of you can do this in like seven
seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a total trick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please, thank you for being brave and
coming out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, some necessary requirements of a
pitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, Todd and I work
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Todd's a partner in 25 Ventures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Todd has been on the investment side of,
you know, my bullshit for generations,
[SPEAKER_03]: of being able to pitch products to
investors and actually get capital from
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moreover, them telling me to kick rocks
more than I can possibly imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, if you're not taking enough shots,
getting enough failure, and not pitching
[SPEAKER_03]: enough people, it's just that simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, from the other side of the table,
that's all that counts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you how to craft something
beautiful and be able to tell an elegant,
[SPEAKER_03]: quick story, but you have to know the
other side of the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: My career started out managing money,
so I totally understand I've been pitched
[SPEAKER_03]: as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're talking to an investor,
primarily, the first thing you have to
[SPEAKER_03]: understand is what they invest in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be able to put yourself into a
bucket quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am this person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's why I do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the company and the bucket I belong
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you're talking to someone who
invests in, you know, elder care,
[SPEAKER_03]: it might make sense to talk about
cannabis, but they're probably not
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in cannabis space, or it's
something new to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, if they're a fund, they may not
legally be allowed to invest in anything
[SPEAKER_03]: but elder care.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, get your background right away,
find out who you're pitching to,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then make it interesting to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can figure out right away what
bucket you belong in, and I'm a software
[SPEAKER_03]: company, I invest in software,
I want to listen to your work,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I've developed this that does this,
ooh, I like the way that that works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're building a pitch, a sync pitch
that allows you to communicate with
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because again, pitching, most people think
is a primary, one-way street, where I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna pitch you, and I'm gonna live this
Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross dream of selling
[SPEAKER_03]: and having, nobody buys anything any
longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to be part of what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to understand that a pitch
that's primary purpose is not to get a
[SPEAKER_03]: check, it's not to close the deal,
it's to interest the other person and get
[SPEAKER_03]: them to take the next step.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything has a process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Investors have a process.
[SPEAKER_03]: They meet you, they like you, they see
your idea, they see it with a bit slither
[SPEAKER_03]: structure, and by the way, at the end of
the day, investors invest in people they
[SPEAKER_03]: can go have a drink with.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they invest in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget you're a human being.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get caught up so much into the
science, because there's a lot of cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: companies, there's a lot of science
involved in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get caught up in the value of ads,
as opposed to telling me, and this is the
[SPEAKER_03]: most common mistake entrepreneurs make,
when I ask someone, hey, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Most commonly, they tell me how they do
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They tell me, oh, well we provide software
that pulls from APIs or data sites.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, okay, you make it
easier for me to go from one social
[SPEAKER_03]: network to the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember the value you provide.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I'm an event planner and I'm
throwing events in the cannabis space,
[SPEAKER_03]: I make it amazing to enjoy cannabis with
other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is actually the value that you
provide.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the event, it's not the process,
it's not the how, it's the what.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the value that you get to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the next, this is an extremely
important thing to do when you are
[SPEAKER_03]: developing your pitch, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, we can help you with this,
we're not here for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're developing your pitch,
if you cannot explain what you do in six
[SPEAKER_03]: pictures with no words, you don't know it
well enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We live in a world of de-gressing
communication.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not moving forward as human beings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Text is actually outdated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pictures are how you explain everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are 100%, we live in an illustrated
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some interesting facts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every 60 seconds around the globe,
there are 250 babies born.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every 60 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: My high school class of 241, my high
school class is born every 60 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are 1.8 million people who like
something on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are 300 hours of information and
video uploaded to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are 22,000 pieces of pizza consumed
every 60 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put that on top of the fact that you have
a baby and a spouse and money and a job
[SPEAKER_03]: and taxes and a career and an automobile
with a broken tire and you have Twitter
[SPEAKER_03]: and Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't neglect the fact that this is
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that right now, while I'm talking
to you, I have a pretty good social
[SPEAKER_03]: presence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel free to find me, look me up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a pretty good social presence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, during this speech,
I've probably gotten 25 emails.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's probably been 13,000 tweets that
have gone through my message board.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unknown hundreds that have gone through
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all huge distractions that keep
me from actually being able to pay
[SPEAKER_03]: attention to what you're pitching me.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you acknowledge that and take heat of
it right away and understand this person
[SPEAKER_03]: has the same problems that I have,
they're not a target, they're a human
[SPEAKER_03]: being and they have kids and they have
distractions, digital distractions,
[SPEAKER_03]: a device in your pocket that's literally
going off all the time, especially if
[SPEAKER_03]: they're busy people.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can understand those things,
you will learn that it's really important
[SPEAKER_03]: to be concise, not elaborate.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of you have been programmed by our
educational system to fail at pitching.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Your teachers, God bless their soul,
not rest their soul, God bless their soul,
[SPEAKER_03]: have had a very difficult job to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what they teach you is backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: We live in a world right now, I spoke at
USC a couple weeks ago and I literally
[SPEAKER_03]: showed the class of entrepreneurs,
who by the way, learning entrepreneurship
[SPEAKER_03]: in school doesn't make sense either,
you need to learn it on the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I showed them a message from a very
prominent CEO.
[SPEAKER_03]: His email to me was nine words.
[SPEAKER_03]: My reply was three.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will get together and discuss this
thoroughly in the end, but for right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: nine words, three words were sufficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because in the world we live in,
we are taught from the time that we are
[SPEAKER_03]: children, hey, we're gonna do a paper on
Abraham Lincoln.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want you to write 1,000 words about
the importance of Abraham Lincoln.
[SPEAKER_03]: Couldn't you just as easily put together
six bullet points?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ended slavery, had a cold beer,
shot in the theater, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what your brain actually extracts
and collects?
[SPEAKER_03]: But we live in a world of digital
distractions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We reduce the attention spans,
I don't care who you are, your attention
[SPEAKER_03]: span 10 years ago was a heck of a lot more
than it is today.
[SPEAKER_03]: The older you get, the worse it gets.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a curve, it's a fellow curve.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're little, it's pretty short,
and then when you're old, it's very,
[SPEAKER_03]: very short.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as you get older, you have to
understand the older person you're talking
[SPEAKER_03]: to, the less time they have to pay
attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: More importantly, they're taking in so
much information on a daily basis that you
[SPEAKER_03]: have to become very memorable in their
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Extremely memorable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone here has limited storage space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone, if you see five to 8,000 ads per
day, your eyes take in 100,000 words.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds stupid, but take a step outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at all the words you see in this
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all data your brain is taking in.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do not understand and know how to
navigate that quickly, in an entertaining
[SPEAKER_03]: manner, that provides some sort of
memorable experience, you are destined to
[SPEAKER_03]: fail at pitching.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no miracle pill I can give you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to learn how to explain who you
are, what you do, why it's important to
[SPEAKER_03]: other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really quickly, smile on your face with
the intent of them saying, that's
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting, how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really all it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pitching is not a science, it's an art
form, and it all comes down to your
[SPEAKER_03]: ability.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm not standing up here with some
proper posture in front of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be who you are, but explain quickly who
you are, what you do, why it's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, a couple things I can give you when
it comes down to learning your pitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here are some tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have a notebook or an iPad,
an iPhone, I suggest that you write this
[SPEAKER_03]: shit down because it's pretty important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone mind my language?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a very transparent person.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, the important thing here,
identify seven bullet points about your
[SPEAKER_03]: company.
[SPEAKER_03]: The things that are important.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you do, why it's different from
everyone else, so on, so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven clear identifying factors that make
your business different from everyone
[SPEAKER_03]: else's.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put those down, memorize them,
and then put them in order.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, a pitch is nothing but a very,
very short pitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a short story, done in verbal and
visual format.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a story.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all begins with once upon a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once upon a time, some problem existed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every day, people experienced this
problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every day, things got worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until one day, I had this great idea to
solve this problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because I solved that problem,
this, this, and this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So remember, once upon a time,
every day, every day, fill in those lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Until one day, I had my idea for the
solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because of the solution, this happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because of that, this happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the seventh point at the end is,
and everyone lives, this is a story format
[SPEAKER_03]: that's embedded into you as children that
you can follow, that's retainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be able to tell them one minute of your
once upon a time story.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's extremely important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's some tips and insights we generally
don't share in the general public.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, once you have your seven items
identified, chronologically in order,
[SPEAKER_03]: and put it in some way that doesn't put
people to sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you have that cool little story,
this is my seven points, I want you to
[SPEAKER_03]: memorize a pitch that says who you are,
what you do, and why it's important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I want you to do it with your
eyes closed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, sounds strange.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want everyone in the room to take the
butts of your hands and put your hands
[SPEAKER_03]: together like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at your middle finger.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is longer than the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: One is always longer than the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not, this is rhetorical.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is always longer than the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I want you to take your hands,
shake them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you to put your butts of your hands
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put your hands together in the same
format.
[SPEAKER_03]: Close your eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the next four seconds,
I want your brain to tell your fingers to
[SPEAKER_03]: be the same length.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be the same length.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be the same length finger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Middle finger, be the same length as the
other finger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Open your eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your fingers are the same length.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is undeniable and categorical.
[SPEAKER_03]: The amount of pixelation your eyes take in
is so distracting and defocusing to your
[SPEAKER_03]: brain waves that you will actually confuse
yourself with your eyes open.
[SPEAKER_03]: Saying I can do it with my eyes closed is
ass backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually harder than you're standing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stand on one foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, nope, no assistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, put your foot down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stand on one foot with your eyes closed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy crap, is that hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So remove, when you're trying to put down
your pitch, if you close your eyes,
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't see anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it means you hear and you produce,
you produce noise and you hear noise very
[SPEAKER_03]: clearly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you will hear your own bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You will find out what sounds good and
what does not sound good to you
[SPEAKER_03]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's undeniable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to mention the fact that these seven
bullet points about who you are,
[SPEAKER_03]: what you do, why it's important to other
people, with your eyes open, you'll get
[SPEAKER_03]: five of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that you're bad, it's just everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone gets five of them all the time
and they always, ah, those other two,
[SPEAKER_03]: if I'd have just thrown that in there,
it would have been awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: With your eyes closed, you never forget
those other two bullet points.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can, and this is proven,
we work with hundreds and hundreds of
[SPEAKER_03]: people on this, if you can tell your pitch
with your eyes closed succinctly in the
[SPEAKER_03]: exact format, which is who you are,
why it's important to the other person,
[SPEAKER_03]: with your eyes closed, it sounds good to
you, it probably sounds good to other
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So make sure that you are following the
simple practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead of boring you for the 15
minutes, which I always advise,
[SPEAKER_03]: we teach people if somebody gives you five
minutes to pitch, learn how to pitch in
[SPEAKER_03]: one and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: Albert Einstein said it best, if you can't
explain it simply, you don't know it well
[SPEAKER_03]: enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you know your business well,
you can explain it like a dummy.
[SPEAKER_03]: To a hillbilly in Arkansas, he can
understand your complex business.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guy living in the hills never had a TV.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we always advise, get the Q&A.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where impact is made.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is where people get what they want
from what you're saying and that's where
[SPEAKER_03]: you get to show off how smart you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm more than happy to take some
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Todd will also come up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Todd has been a private investment better
for a Swedish billionaire, he's been an
[SPEAKER_03]: investment banker, comes from a financial
background, he's been pitching hundreds of
[SPEAKER_03]: deals over the course of his career.
[SPEAKER_03]: So happy to answer any questions you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you the Mike conduit?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone have any questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's one, there's no way that I've
explained enough that you don't have any
[SPEAKER_03]: questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you put your mouth closer to the
microphone?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a newborn care specialist.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are not the newborn.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am and some people call us the baby
nurse, but I am really interested in the
[SPEAKER_05]: way that the cannabis industry can help
children who have all kinds of problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this about pitching?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, because now how am I going to
present this to the public, to the
position?
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is how do I present cannabis
specifically?
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of you have the same stereotypes
built into you that the rest, we work
[SPEAKER_03]: with, we work with our frontera advisors,
we work with Frontera Law Group,
[SPEAKER_03]: we deal with cannabis companies every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually Michael, we talked about this
today with his board, they asked the same
[SPEAKER_03]: question, have you done this before?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no one has done this before in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the stigma of cannabis and creating a
company that you're pitching to investors,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know those called my five years ago,
it's called drug dealing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need money to move and believe me,
I've been in that business as a college
[SPEAKER_03]: student as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the cannabis space, you can't
explain your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you label yourself as a cannabis
company, you've automatically eliminated
[SPEAKER_03]: 80% of potential partners, just from
stigmas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not to mention the fact that cannabis,
unless you are selling pure flower or
[SPEAKER_03]: plants in its pure format, you aren't a
cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are a hardware company, a beverage
company, a software company, whatever it
[SPEAKER_03]: may be.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that cannabis is a chemical that
is involved in your product should not
[SPEAKER_03]: impact the way you pitch it whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: All it does is address the market you can
and cannot serve legally.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is not a different way to pitch a
cannabis company from a software or a
[SPEAKER_03]: construction company.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a product, that product has a
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know how many people can buy it,
what you sell it for, how you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: make money, and how you're going to do
this and scale the business up to the
[SPEAKER_03]: point where it's worth me putting my money
in time to answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: I always feel like it's a homeopathic
remedy to drugs, and that's what infants
[SPEAKER_05]: are given, steroids and all kinds of
things that are so bad for their human
[SPEAKER_05]: intake.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to interrupt you because we hear
this a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We work with a lot of cannabis companies,
so we hear it all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one thing you can't do is convert
people from their mind in one minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot convert them from the existing
stereotype they have in their brains,
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding your way of thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why try?
[SPEAKER_05]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to explain the core of your
business, what you do, succinctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your business that you have for
kids?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now I'm a baby nurse, but I advise
people on care for their children who have
[SPEAKER_05]: unusual circumstances.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in your instance right now,
you're a child nurse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: You explore alternatives to traditional
medicines and pharmaceuticals to provide
[SPEAKER_03]: better solutions to children with less
damaging impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to use more cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a pitch, I want you to say one thing to
me when I'm done with my pitch,
[SPEAKER_03]: how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I will tell you I do it through using
CBD or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You explain the effect to your nurse,
and then you explore natural and home
[SPEAKER_03]: opathic alternatives for children to
provide the same results, if not better,
[SPEAKER_03]: than chemical substances can provide to
the human body.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Next one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We solved your problem, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Davina, and we're starting a
company for enabling people to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis at home, but the question I have
for you is we are looking for investors
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to create a pitch deck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any recommendations on pages
and information that we should make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that we include in providing a pitch deck
when they first have interest and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: send us something, and you're not able to
talk to them to continue to gain that
[SPEAKER_00]: interest?
[SPEAKER_03]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sinc, concise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, so the basic business model format
for a pitch deck is as follows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Title slide, the problem we solved,
the solution, not your solution,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the solution, product explanation,
market size, how big can it be,
[SPEAKER_03]: be very succinct with it, your
competition, your business model,
[SPEAKER_03]: go to strategy, and then your team.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can move those around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear startups always ask, should I have
a fund?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you don't have a fund.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of your financial slide is illusory.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just fake numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a second meeting with an
investor.
[SPEAKER_03]: But always be prepared to be able to send
somebody a four-slide deck about the
[SPEAKER_03]: problem, the solution, the market size,
five, your product, and the team.
[SPEAKER_03]: That said, most people don't, just so you
know, most investors, if you're an early
[SPEAKER_03]: company, they really don't even care what
your product is.
[SPEAKER_03]: They care about backing good people and
supporting them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't go to people and say, all I want is
your money and contacts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fundamental.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ask for money, you get advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You ask for advice, and you get money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always remember that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smart people will always help you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name's Mitch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just recently in the process of taking
over my dad's 35-year-old company,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is packaging machinery and robotics,
which goes into how everything gets
[SPEAKER_04]: packaged.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very interested in speaking with you
about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just started a little offshoot called
Canapac USA, which is specifically
[SPEAKER_04]: niche-marketed for the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other stigma in the cannabis industry
is there's a lot of fakers in the space.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people that say,
oh yeah, I do this for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really no difference in how you
market, present, promote, sell products.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's none.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no reason to coin yourself or pin
yourself in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're providing for a new industry,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you do differently?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything from a robotics or
packaging that you do any differently than
[SPEAKER_03]: you did before?
[SPEAKER_04]: Mainly from the legislative standpoint.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a situation recently... So it's
compliance packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're complying with state law.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, compliance is staying up with the
legislation, specifically in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_04]: California, and other states, where
legislation can dictate how much... How
[SPEAKER_04]: does legislation impact packaging?
[SPEAKER_04]: It impacts from the standpoint of how many
milligrams or millimeters of THC can go
[SPEAKER_04]: into a certain bottle, and those
bottles...
[SPEAKER_04]: The machinery that fills those bottles are
custom-made.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is... You're taking over your
dad's industry, your dad's 35-year-old
[SPEAKER_03]: company, and you're moving it into the
cannabis space because... It's just
[SPEAKER_04]: another market of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened was, is what I was going on
as Burmeister Packaging, nobody was really
[SPEAKER_04]: listening per se.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I started Canapac USA and been
promoting it as that now, people seemed to
[SPEAKER_04]: be listening a little bit more,
but I was wanting to know how can I
[SPEAKER_04]: penetrate the market more, both
legislatively speaking, because that has a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot to do with the types of machinery and
robotics that are used, and the filling,
[SPEAKER_03]: the capping... The question is how you
penetrate the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Penetrating the market is a go-to-market
marketing strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have that answer for you,
from just being frank, and I don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I can tell you is it all starts
with your ability to explain what
[SPEAKER_03]: differentiates you from the rest of the
world, simply.
[SPEAKER_03]: So being able to explain the fact that
your packaging follows state laws and
[SPEAKER_03]: compliance for cannabis companies would be
my niche.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't promote it as a cannabis
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would promote it as a manufacturing and
packaging company that follows cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: state regulation, that removes you from
stereotype and immediately puts you into a
[SPEAKER_03]: position of authority.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone else?
[SPEAKER_03]: One more.
[SPEAKER_03]: One more.
[SPEAKER_03]: None more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grab that mic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're tonight's rapper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the MC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything specific that women
should do while pitching that men tend not
[SPEAKER_04]: to do?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to ask this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there's a lot of stigma,
I think, especially in terms of the value
[SPEAKER_06]: in terms of investment in women.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually the way I was going to
start, but in my background, you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know anything about me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been working with women entrepreneurs
since before you were called women
entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you were simply entrepreneurs,
I was part of the team that broke the
[SPEAKER_03]: actual information and statistical
breakdown of venture capital, realizing
[SPEAKER_03]: that 74% of all venture capital returns
come from women led investments,
[SPEAKER_03]: which account for less than 9% of their
actual allocated funds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that make sense to you?
[SPEAKER_03]: So 9% of their investments go into women
who produce 74% of their money.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's asinine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the fact that that even exists and the
stigma is one that I don't try to promote,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing this for more than a
decade with women.
[SPEAKER_03]: I work with Springboard Enterprises,
the largest women led enterprise.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do women pitch differently than men?
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not necessarily in what you say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Women tend to be a little longer winded
because of a lack of confidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've already also labeled yourself in
your brain by saying, I'm a woman
[SPEAKER_03]: entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it means you try to prove that you're
smart way harder than everyone else.
But in actuality, women who explain things
in very few words pause and look at the
[SPEAKER_03]: bridge of your nose, sell whatever they
want.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that you're succinct,
just like men, there's no difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no sexism in pitching.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's none.
[SPEAKER_03]: Either you have a good pitch, good
business, or you don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that you're a woman is only a
hindrance before you get on stage and
[SPEAKER_03]: pitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you're on stage, you're an
entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the secret sauce for women is to learn
how to be more succinct than men.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I can tell that Todd will back
this up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Todd, how much do you hate hearing 35
minute pitches about a company?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've listened to over 15,000
pitches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's brutally horrible to sit behind
and lots of money to want to put into
[SPEAKER_01]: work, have to wait through that and only
invest in five companies a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe 6,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's brutal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please make it short.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shorten it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be concise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be illustrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Women have much, first of all,
obviously we support women led business in
[SPEAKER_03]: the world a ton of women.
[SPEAKER_03]: But women have a better ability to explain
things in pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, the way that pitching works is,
I tell you a beautiful story like you're a
[SPEAKER_03]: child.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look at you and I tell you about once
upon a time, it was this big problem that
[SPEAKER_03]: my idea came to a head when I realized it
was an actual problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's how I figured it all out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to speed you up and get you
excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: The entire time behind me is a PowerPoint.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that PowerPoint, this is what women do
all the time by the way, if that
[SPEAKER_03]: PowerPoint says word for word,
I'm saying to you, what the hell am I
[SPEAKER_03]: doing in the room?
[SPEAKER_03]: But if that PowerPoint shows an
illustration of what I just said,
[SPEAKER_03]: just an illustration, it embeds it
neurologically in someone's head.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Women are so good at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uncork that part of you that can let your
creative juices go when you pitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Verbally, pitch like a very short map.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aren't most smart people, don't they
answer a question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch any movie if they're real smart
person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you telling me the end of the world is
going to occur to this asteroid?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You believe that person because they're
succinct.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't say, well, actually the
trajectory of that asteroid is about 36
[SPEAKER_03]: degrees off in this normal state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you, you're blind because of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it visual.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for your time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to answer any questions.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
