[SPEAKER_00]: Korean Natural Farming, a regenerative
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Christina Trout of La La Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, there was thistle.
[SPEAKER_00]: To understand thistle, I need to tell you
about a reoccurring dream I had as a child
[SPEAKER_00]: involving a centipede.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weirdly, the scene of the crime was in a
white bathroom in a white bathtub.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my attempts to kill the centipede,
it break into half and grow, and those
[SPEAKER_00]: halves would break into halves and grow
until the bathroom was literally full of
[SPEAKER_00]: centipedes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terrifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I view thistle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thistle arrived after I'd done everything
on my property I thought a good
[SPEAKER_00]: permaculturist should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd already tilled, too late for
preserving the existing fungal communities
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil, but I knew enough by the end
of my training that if I could keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil covered, that diversity would return.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to work building layers of
cardboard, wood chips, leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: not to mention the literal dump truckloads
of composted manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I feel like I needed to do all of
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have rock-hard clay soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most used tool in my bucket of garden
tools is an ice pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than a decade later, I have soils
that are still prone to compaction,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are clumps now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aggregates, with clay and organic matter,
riddled with worm tunnels, and I can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of things I couldn't then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the thistle, fast in succession,
after the bindweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd created a haven for these unruly
misfits who moved in quickly and with
[SPEAKER_00]: great determination.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're well-versed in the problems of these
invasive cousins.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when we try to chop a poison
thistle?
[SPEAKER_00]: It splits into two, three, four,
and each surviving piece starts to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: more vigorously than had you left it
alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemical solutions seem the only option
for meeting the challenges of these
[SPEAKER_00]: successional plants, whose sole duty is to
populate and return to the earth en masse
[SPEAKER_00]: in an attempt to heal the original damage
done from disruption, including tilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also knew enough to recognize that with
so much effort applied in creating an
[SPEAKER_00]: environment a fungi would love,
they simply were not showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even over a period of time, bringing spore
back from my mushroom hunts and dispersing
[SPEAKER_00]: it into the micro-climates I'd created
specifically for them, I'd get an
[SPEAKER_00]: occasional burst of chip-loving species,
a few puff balls, but what thrived in my
[SPEAKER_00]: soil were mustards and lattices,
radicchios and brassicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do these species have in common?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're bacterial-loving species.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had created bacterial-dominant
nitrogen-rich soils and was helping
[SPEAKER_00]: succession happen in a big way,
because successional plants like ragweed
[SPEAKER_00]: and thistle love bacterial-dominant soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Succession happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than seeing this as a natural law
to be respected and encouraged,
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural science-backed products and
practices have us attempting to halt or
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse succession with a fix-it attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soils are to be amended and weeds
controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Succession happens, from bacterial to
fungal dominance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's natural's way of self-correcting
building soils to support even more
[SPEAKER_00]: evolving complex ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungal-dominant soils perform in amazing
ways, including water retention,
[SPEAKER_00]: disruption of pathogens, absorption of
toxins, pH balancing, providing plants
[SPEAKER_00]: with a network of nutrient-seeking
populations whose sole function is to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide plants with everything that plant
asks for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungal-dominant soils are literally the
probiotic for the soil in direct
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with the probiotics within
our own bodies, the very ones which secure
[SPEAKER_00]: our longevity, youthfulness and vitality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without probiotics, we can't derive the
nutrients we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are plants, and plants are us without
legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without mobility, plants have evolved
within their micro-regions to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: the microorganisms in the soil to provide
all it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microorganisms, in turn, derive their
nutrients from clay and rock, the dance of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil building between plant and microbe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problem is, we've been taught as
cultivators to treat the plant rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: the conditions under which it is grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: To stave off problems, we front-load our
soils with everything we think a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: needs over its life cycle rather than
equating it with avenues to find what it
[SPEAKER_00]: needs through relationships with the
indigenous life in the soil, even
[SPEAKER_00]: disrupting the soils in order to give the
plant a head start in its supposed battle
[SPEAKER_00]: with nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We anticipate what needs to be fixed in an
unbalanced system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea how to fix my thistle
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided to do nothing, literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I quit spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encouraged the plants which decided to
stay, clipped seed heads of those I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: want, and set an accordion of naturalizing
without understanding what or could
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first learned about Korean Natural
Farming, or KNF, as it became first
[SPEAKER_00]: practiced in small circles of cannabis
growers in California and the Pacific
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest, who raved about KNF,
living soils, and amazing results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And down the rabbit hole I went.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't follow directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came at it with a fixed attitude,
endless ideas for how to improve the
[SPEAKER_00]: system, having experimented with
fermentation and derivation, I thought I
[SPEAKER_00]: understood what I was gathering from the
misinformation prevalent online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made huge mistakes, and yet the cannabis
I grew was of such an extraordinary
[SPEAKER_00]: quality that I knew I had to learn the
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't believe the qualitative
difference in not only flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: terpian expression, but in medicinal
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was as if the plant was expressing a
part of herself that hadn't been possible
[SPEAKER_00]: before introducing even a fraction of
diversity that would later prove to me the
[SPEAKER_00]: power of indigenous microorganisms true to
place and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first learned the fundamentals of Korean
Natural Farming from Chris Tromp,
[SPEAKER_00]: whose family owns an 800 acre macadamia
farm in Hawaii, where his practice of
[SPEAKER_00]: natural farming literally saved their
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris learned directly from Master Cho,
making the trek to Korea 11 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2011, Chris and his family applied KNF
to a few trees, moving to a 50 acre trial
[SPEAKER_00]: of trees, where finally his family farm is
now 100% KNF and thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris teaches all over the world,
and there's no end to the benefit of
[SPEAKER_00]: learning this teaching hands-on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Master Cho, who began practicing natural
farming in the 60s, devoted his life to
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching, even though he faced persecution
from chemical company lobbyists and
[SPEAKER_00]: government officials for his teaching and
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Master Cho in turn recognizes three
teachers from his early visits to Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: One taught him respect for all life.
[SPEAKER_00]: From another, he learned about enzymes and
indigenous microorganisms, or IMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: His third teacher, who made the first
Kyoho cultivars in Japan, which are grapes
[SPEAKER_00]: the size of a baby's fist, teaching Cho
the nutritive cycle of plants and the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of observing natural law.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is so revolutionary about Master
Cho's life work in Korean Natural Farming
[SPEAKER_00]: is that it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works in any environment at any time,
using the plants found thriving in your
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It teaches one to speak the language of
plants through simple observation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's nutritive cycle, much like a human
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Cho's simple technology is a sane
response to conventional agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is ecologically not sustainable,
economically also not viable, and
[SPEAKER_00]: environmentally ruinous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant science as practice now is more
concerned with unlocking the secrets of
[SPEAKER_00]: how things work.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an effort to fix a broken system than
on observation of how life actually works,
[SPEAKER_00]: to not only self-correct, but thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial agriculture backed by plant
science views natural systems through the
[SPEAKER_00]: same inherited fix-it lens, and it teaches
us to do the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fix-it scenario applied to my problem,
clay soils, required all my fix-it
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches, ultimately defeating me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was left hacking thistle and soil with
an ice pick with no perceivable end.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the thistle was filling the
spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: A crisis of imagination, with nature's
imbalances, too big a problem to fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a year after Chris's class to
begin practice in my outdoor gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made the applications and continued to
apply them in my indoor smaller garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: gaining confidence in my skills of making
and applying applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was still entertaining the fix-it
mentality, subtly thinking of ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve the system, coming to terms with
my rebellious nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The paradigm shift occurred with my first
successful harvest of indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Building a box, making the rice,
choosing a spot 500 feet in elevation
[SPEAKER_00]: above but within my microclimate that's
fungal and lush, planting the rice-filled
[SPEAKER_00]: box in place for seven days or so,
returning and unwrapping the gift of that
[SPEAKER_00]: place in such a fuzzy display of
diversity, filling my nose with the aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: of a primordial force.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intoxicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: What natural farming requires is a
willingness to practice in order to see,
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to come into a greater
understanding of how nature works and to
[SPEAKER_00]: trust the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural farming requires us to view nature
as perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not as a static thing, but as a perfect
working system of balancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires us to become citizen
scientists, basing our findings on
[SPEAKER_00]: side-by-side trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to observe the outcomes of our
practices, learn exactly how our inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: are supporting the natural system and a
plant's drive to express its genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learn to talk to plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our education concerning the growth of
plants must include the awareness that a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has everything it needs to thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In concert with indigenous microorganisms,
plants have the capacity to build soil
[SPEAKER_00]: from rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: In healthy, fungal, balanced soil,
plants and expression of true health and
[SPEAKER_00]: vitality signal to us an ecosystem in a
state of regenerative abundance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regenerative is not isolating plant
compounds as weapons against insects,
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses, or pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regenerative is not bugs in a jug,
microbes isolated and grown out of a lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: nor microbes brought from far off places.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not plastic mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not tilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regenerative systems are discovered
through simple observational skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regenerative systems restore our capacity
for wonder, for imagination, for
[SPEAKER_00]: discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the practice of natural
farming?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the heart of natural farming lies a
process of cultivating indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms through a simple but
precise method of harvesting without
[SPEAKER_00]: disruption of any ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Introducing this diversity into our
disrupted soils where it comes into
[SPEAKER_00]: balance with what's there, building and
restoring a robust biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time that these IMO
populations are being introduced,
[SPEAKER_00]: other applications are applied to our
cultivated plants through foliar or soil
[SPEAKER_00]: drenches, which directly support a plant's
communication with its environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are various applications derived
from plant materials which will populate
[SPEAKER_00]: your shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: A library of applications needed over the
course of a growing season according to
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutritive cycle of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural farming, in essence, is the
application of the right material,
[SPEAKER_00]: the right amount, at the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is simple but specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: These applications are applied at ratios
of 1 to 1,000 or 1 to 500 or 1 to 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're homeopathic in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while the gathering of materials
requires attention throughout the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: a small amount of the applications you've
gathered go a long way and are relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: free in cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural farming is effective in any place,
any climate, any condition, and by its
[SPEAKER_00]: simplicity of application entirely
scalable and highly economical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivation becomes stewardship with such
restorative practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as one becomes proficient in gathering
and applying these plant-based
[SPEAKER_00]: applications, side-by-side trials are
incorporated as a means to observe
[SPEAKER_00]: directly how varying applications work to
increase vitality and to enhance whole
[SPEAKER_00]: system functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If science is more inclusive of an
observational approach within whole
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, intent on compiling shareable
data through these simple side-by-side
[SPEAKER_00]: trials, then we could chart through
observation in what ways nature is a
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect system and much more efficient at
solving the same problems we are trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: solve through derivative-based fix-it
solutions, namely food security and a
[SPEAKER_00]: thriving ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather than unlocking secrets,
if our attention is a scientific and
[SPEAKER_00]: academic community, we're on understanding
the relationship between things plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, animal to human, human to the
ecological whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would naturally come into harmony as
stewards equipped with wisdom born of
[SPEAKER_00]: practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long live the natural farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: About thistle.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the KNF applications requires the
cultivation of the top four inches of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material at dawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science supports this magician's approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growth tips of plants are populated with
undifferentiated cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cells are potent with possibilities
that are easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In response to a host of environmental
conditions, these cells can literally do
[SPEAKER_00]: and become anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the materials required are present,
including hormones and enzymes necessary
[SPEAKER_00]: for growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's these compounds we're drawing out
with sugar which has a drawing effect much
[SPEAKER_00]: like salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thistle is one of the plants I now harvest
for this application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its growth pattern is unmatched.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mineral content impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two, it's medicine for parasites in humans
and anti-pathogenic in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: By increasing the vigor and growth of my
hemp this year, in part through the
[SPEAKER_00]: application of thistle, I was able to use
my hemp crop to control the understory of
[SPEAKER_00]: thistle from emerging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still present, but I'm no longer
cutting it in an attempt to kill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's become an indicator of soil health
and a marker of the successional state of
[SPEAKER_00]: my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know to mulch and inoculate,
to harvest and respect through deep
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciation, what nature is trying to
show me.
