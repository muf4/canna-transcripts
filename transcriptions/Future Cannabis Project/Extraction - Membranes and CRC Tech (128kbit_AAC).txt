[SPEAKER_04]: It's really boring really it's efficiency
is kind of all we talk about you know math
[SPEAKER_04]: and numbers on how can we save a couple
pennies over here on energy versus using
[SPEAKER_04]: big screens like if I had to boil down
what was said today is that Membranes
[SPEAKER_04]: which is a big filter that that was kind
of like the takeaway that I think will be
[SPEAKER_04]: most valuable to the most amount of people
that was something that it's been out
[SPEAKER_04]: there, but it's been not as Openly talked
about as it was today, so that was
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting I thought I saw the hesitation
and Noah's eyes saying it out loud,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then he went with it, so it was
interesting It was immediately there,
[SPEAKER_05]: and he was just like me All right Oh,
yeah dread pirates here with some of his
[SPEAKER_04]: CRC and that stuff was incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have this I think it went to dinner,
but uh oh How about that you got the good
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who is Noah with he was with Harry and Ken
and ace from beaker and wrench that was a
[SPEAKER_04]: good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that one Dread pirate he's on the
forum He's the guy that first released the
[SPEAKER_04]: CRC tech on the forum kind of like the
first draft of it With him and the endo
[SPEAKER_04]: fab guys It's like a remediation of the
impurities that you don't necessarily want
[SPEAKER_04]: or need to smoke a lot of them are color
compounds and other random things you do
[SPEAKER_04]: tend to pull a little bit of some of like
the ethers or not eat there's a Esters and
[SPEAKER_04]: and aldehydes and alcohols which kind of
changes the smell we still get a really
[SPEAKER_04]: bright terpy smell from it and all the
mids, but some of the lower ones seem to
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes tend to drag behind in the
column in the CRC Well,
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely had CRC stuff that looks
amazing and then tastes like trim you know
[SPEAKER_03]: because it doesn't get rid Yeah,
exactly it tastes like what what it is
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly you can't add to it you're
definitely definitely doing that,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I've also had some I've also had some
CRC that I think people aren't filtering
[SPEAKER_03]: enough, and I've definitely dabbed some
that had some Filtration media left in it
[SPEAKER_03]: so I've been on yeah Something that people
need to like make sure they're filtering
[SPEAKER_03]: that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know so that's my main thing I'd say
about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard that a chas a chas bowl do the
same thing Don't be shy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that's the future of you know with
great power foot with great power comes
[SPEAKER_02]: great responsibility and when we're
starting to take these chemistry routes
[SPEAKER_02]: that isn't you know they're not It's not
just you know making some charis.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is going on over there with dead skin
and shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's We're turning we're turning a
point into actual you know trying to adopt
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical science and as absurd as
homegrown Pharmaceutical science is it's
[SPEAKER_02]: what this kind of this one country.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something else It's what this
industry has done for the last 70 years
[SPEAKER_02]: means since prohibition We've had to find
our own ways about doing things and that
[SPEAKER_02]: right there is the culmination of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's you know the ultimate fuck you
[SPEAKER_02]: To the man That's the ethereal the
ethereal who I guess really whatever's
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to that's that gets to a personal
level almost a spiritual level But what
[SPEAKER_02]: this means this is what happens when
people you know are You can call it
[SPEAKER_02]: entrepreneurship you can call it
capitalism, but you know this is
[SPEAKER_02]: Innovation the fluid innovation in
progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean we're watching it happen day by day
and Man, it's just fascinating to be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to be a part of it Most definitely that's
something that all this really is man like
[SPEAKER_03]: genius minds trying to come to work with a
plant Under while being under immense
[SPEAKER_03]: oppression or you know obstacles or just
you know legalization and whatnot Yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: Having to sacrifice the potential for your
livelihood to even do science with this
[SPEAKER_03]: plan in the first place kind of comes to I
guess like that accumulation where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like this is the best science we could do
and Bombs, you know, it's like Next level
[SPEAKER_02]: shit, you know Well, this is you know,
this is what happens when people innovate
[SPEAKER_02]: for themselves and we're not relying on
massive corporations to take our
[SPEAKER_02]: innovation You know by the hills and do it
for us because when you get to a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: point I mean you just can't I mean that
was Dustin's talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't beat the open source.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not happening
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just a really phenomenal Starting
material and phenomenal process credit to
[SPEAKER_02]: the grower credit to the processor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all parts of the whole It takes
excellence in every step possible But the
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting thing is really the potential
that we have to do I mean these same
[SPEAKER_02]: refinement techniques Will take the will
take place in other industries and other
[SPEAKER_02]: nutraceutical I mean we talked about a lot
of mycology today and all these same
[SPEAKER_02]: refinement techniques are going to come up
sooner later and it's cool if you can use
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis with it, but I know I'm sure I
don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure the ball container corporation is
pretty happy with all of their mason jar
[SPEAKER_02]: sales and I'm sure there's some refineries
out of Texas who See these new places
[SPEAKER_02]: popping up there capitalizing on it What
kind of take do you think a different
[SPEAKER_03]: industry would learn from us, you know
compared to us learn from the
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmaceutical, you know So like with
cultivation when cannabis farmers can turn
[SPEAKER_05]: four times a year versus like an outdoor
corn farmer You're learning four times as
[SPEAKER_05]: fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like at full speed and they're like
waiting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god We noticed like a great crew
like we did X and yields were up,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just like you guys are doing cool
crazy shit that like They do co2
[SPEAKER_06]: extraction and also I don't know they make
like a distillate product which has
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenes that they Post inject to like
flavor their stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's pretty phenomenal But I think
there is opportunity we run like super
[SPEAKER_04]: high margin which allows us a lot of
flexibility to run R&D on our product too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that helps and the type of
person that's in cannabis in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: industry right now is not the same type of
person that may have Gone a more
[SPEAKER_04]: traditional route with a less,
you know, they're they're they're not as
[SPEAKER_04]: Willing to take risk right as the typical
cannabis Person is because we've been
[SPEAKER_04]: taking risks the whole fucking time So you
kind of have a different type of person
[SPEAKER_04]: and that there's you know, there's pros
and cons to each different side But one of
[SPEAKER_04]: them is that we can have rapid development
and adaptation of new technologies better
[SPEAKER_04]: than any other industry we've That I've
seen we can scour the internet for obscure
[SPEAKER_04]: little pieces of data and convert it into
something that's making Billions of
[SPEAKER_05]: dollars like what show me another industry
that's doing something like that
[SPEAKER_01]: Just just being able to come back and see
my like I've known Boris for 20 years I've
[SPEAKER_01]: known, you know a bunch of these guys so
Just to be able to come out and see these
[SPEAKER_01]: guys now my homies 10 years later or like,
you know industry leaders and leading the
[SPEAKER_01]: way and And they got nothing to worry
about, you know, I mean and it's cool and
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's amazing You know,
it's a beautiful thing to see And you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, it's definitely something we need to
pay reverence to but we also need to
[SPEAKER_02]: realize There's still plenty of people
locked up because of this bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do it every single day You You You You
You You You You You
