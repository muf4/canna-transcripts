[SPEAKER_01]: We really appreciate everybody joining us
to discuss the 10 cardinal parameters of
[SPEAKER_01]: plant health and vitality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our intention is to share some information
that we, researchers, and other industry
[SPEAKER_01]: professionals in our ecosystem have
collected and applied to large-scale
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cultivation facilities to
minimize cultivation risks and maximize
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the title of our webinar suggests,
there are 10 parameters that work in
[SPEAKER_01]: symphony to produce an end product that
contains and preserves all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: secondary metabolites, which consist of
cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids
[SPEAKER_01]: that are of value for recreational and
therapeutic cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_01]: The structure of today's webinar will
consist of a 30-minute presentation by
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse Porter, Inspire's Cannabis Business
Specialist, and Robbie Batts, Inspire's
[SPEAKER_01]: Chief Technology Officer.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, I'll pass it off to Rob to kick
us off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's talk is truly inspired by Dr.
Bruce Bugby's presentation at the CGC in
[SPEAKER_00]: Niagara Falls in late 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: His sectioning of the main inputs into
nine cardinal parameters is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: brought us to the realization that all of
the systems of plant growth are
[SPEAKER_00]: intertwined in a way that it's impossible
to focus on one without having an impact
[SPEAKER_00]: on perhaps several others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why do we have 10 and the esteemed Dr.
Bugby has nine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Dr. Bugby was specific about his
nine parameters being environmental only.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are humbly adding a tenth, which is
microbes, because our conversation is
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically general plant inputs around
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen its impact on the high dollar
value of the cannabis plant, and we would
[SPEAKER_00]: be remiss if we did not include them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find that when most people talk about
growing environments, cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're most often looking for that
negative wisdom as it pertains to VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of you probably join for just
that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we don't blame you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a topic we take most seriously as a
company that is built on a backbone of
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and humidity control equipment
and controllers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a deeper dive shortly,
but to set the stage, let's talk about it
[SPEAKER_00]: right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: VPD is vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is water vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our business at Inspire has become
control of this very important metric by
[SPEAKER_00]: designing efficient systems that control,
track, and trend the metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is amazing things happen when you get
it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen some less than desirable
things happen when you get it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take our job of dehumidifying and
conditioning the air very seriously,
[SPEAKER_00]: because without some place for water to
move from inside the plant to outside the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, it would be impossible for plants
to thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, that's our
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's almost the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to both leave temperature
control and the photosynthetic process
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the real understanding that plants
only use a small fraction of the water you
[SPEAKER_00]: give them is the start of a deeper
understanding to environmental controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, water is pulled through the roots,
up the stem, into the leaves, and would
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise have no place to go except for
the fact that there are tiny pores in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant called stomata through which the
water can escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these pores are mainly where CO2
enters the plant, oxygen gas leaves the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, and also the water that entered the
plant through the roots as a liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporates out into the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in order for the liquid to evaporate
into the air, the surrounding air must be
[SPEAKER_00]: below the saturation threshold of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking a closer look at the picture on the
left that you're going to see again and
[SPEAKER_00]: again and again in this presentation,
you can see that there is a sub-stomato
[SPEAKER_00]: cavity just on the inside of the stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire gas exchange process I
mentioned in the previous slide,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, that happens here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the surrounding air is moist,
there's a good balance of CO2 entering and
[SPEAKER_00]: H2O leaving the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the surrounding air is too dry relative
to inside the plant, the CO2 has a hard
[SPEAKER_00]: time fighting its way upstream from all
the water vapor leaving the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that that's out of the way,
let's talk about the interplay of all
[SPEAKER_00]: these variables in the context of plant
vitality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse, take it from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, thanks, Rob.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great information there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think diving into the parameters of
plant influence, there are wonderful
[SPEAKER_02]: reference points for understanding the
interactions that maximize the plant's
[SPEAKER_02]: vitality and directly influence PPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: These cardinal parameters work
synergistically to create the ideal
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we collect more data, we might even
uncover more parameters of influence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hormones, maybe?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for now, we'll talk about 10,
many of which you're probably familiar
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Light, humidity, temperature, CO2,
and airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then down in the root zone,
we have temperature, again, nutrients,
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes, oxygen, and water that are all
major influencers in plant health.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But understanding the genetics and
breeding history of a cultivar can have
[SPEAKER_02]: significant influence on our environmental
set points.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I speak on genetics, it's very easy
for me to show you pictures of beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: strains automizing, expressing unique
traits, and oozing their oils.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's even more powerful to
share a concept from Robert C.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clark and his book, Marijuana Botany.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see in the diagram,
phenotypes are the byproduct of genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: mixing with the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Strains are bred to thrive and are
uniquely adapted to the environments in
[SPEAKER_02]: which they're created.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether you're growing a maple leaf
indica from a reputable seed breeder,
[SPEAKER_02]: a land race Vietnamese black you picked up
on vacation, or a handful of beans from a
[SPEAKER_02]: friend, it can be very helpful to
understand where they came from and how
[SPEAKER_02]: they were bred in order to let them sing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think you're trying to create the
perfect conditions for your genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: you should first consider the habitats
associated with the genetic origin and
[SPEAKER_02]: then follow the environments in which it
was developed in order to get the most out
[SPEAKER_02]: of your phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with genetics considered, let's take a
quick look at light and its powerful and
[SPEAKER_02]: dramatic interaction with the other plant
parameters.
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to maximize photosynthetic rate
and your lighting investment, it's
[SPEAKER_02]: important to harmonize temperature,
CO2 levels, and PPFD while thinking about
[SPEAKER_02]: your lighting source.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you will see later, there are separate
VPD charts for LED and HID lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is because HID lighting emits radiant
heat, which impacts the plant and leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a result, the same plant will prefer a
lower temperature room for HID for maximum
[SPEAKER_02]: production, and a higher room temperature
in an LED room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maximizing the photosynthetic rate of
cannabis requires a keen understanding of
[SPEAKER_02]: the relational set points associated with
your lighting choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as mentioned, there's also a
relationship between light and CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know plants use light energy to convert
CO2 and water into sugar and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's photosynthesis, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also know as light intensity goes
up, the amount of CO2 utilized by the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant does too.
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2 is a plant food that passes through
the stomata and is necessary for the
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthetic process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the amount of CO2 assimilation is
directly related to the accumulation of
[SPEAKER_02]: plant biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you consider parts per million of
CO2, you should correlate that to PPFD and
[SPEAKER_02]: the stage of plant growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the plant transitions from clone to veg
to flower, CO2 can be increased alongside
[SPEAKER_02]: light intensity in order to maximize the
plant's development.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what good is CO2 if you can't deliver
it to the plants effectively, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Air flow has a direct impact on how CO2 is
delivered to the stomata.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also affects the leaf temperature,
influences stomatal reactions,
[SPEAKER_02]: microclimate management, and VPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: In cannabis plants, the stomata is on the
undersides of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the most efficient way to deliver
conditioned CO2-rich air is up through the
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy and directly to the undersides of
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as air passes the leaf surface,
it has a drying and cooling effect that
[SPEAKER_02]: should be accounted for when determining
room conditions and leaf temp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Air flow considerations are also
imperative to a successful harvest as it
[SPEAKER_02]: can break up canopy overlap, contribute to
cultural control, help mitigate odor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can even impact drying and curing,
employee health, and overall IPM strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Air flow also plays a part in successful
regulation of temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on that note I'll pass things back to
Rob who can talk about what happens when
[SPEAKER_02]: we get hot and wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Inspire, we spent almost a decade
trying to understand the interplay of
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and humidity and its influence
on plant metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it turns out that when water
evaporates from inside the sub-stomatal
[SPEAKER_00]: cavity that I talked about before,
it has the same effect as sweat leaving a
[SPEAKER_00]: person's skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll cool the plant down and make the
environment around it more moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the rate at which this happens is
very important because the leaf has a
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat narrow band of temperature where
the chemical processes are most efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Efficient chemical processes inside of a
plant mean higher yields and higher
[SPEAKER_00]: revenues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we measure this for a plant,
it should be easy enough to just set the
[SPEAKER_00]: room temperature to the leaf temperature
we want, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And bingo, increased yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although some days I really wish it was
that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, all sorts of variables affect
leaf temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And leaf temperature is almost always not
room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's not exactly easy to measure this
effect because leaf canopies are not a
[SPEAKER_00]: single temperature, as you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, they vary even across a single
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in practice, the room is easy to
measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We set up an array of aspirated sensors
inside or close to the leaf canopy and
[SPEAKER_00]: take our readings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to understand the leaf temperature,
most often we use an indirect measurement
[SPEAKER_00]: via, for example, a thermal imaging
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's important to remember that the
primary heating source for a plant is the
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation that is absorbed by the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this comes from primarily two
different sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in a room lit by HPS lights,
we have the lights themselves that are
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing infrared photons into and through
the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, we have a source of heat
similar to a microwave heating the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: from the inside out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, most LED lit rooms don't have this
energy source.
[SPEAKER_00]: To maintain the correct leaf temperature,
we have to bring heat to the plant by
[SPEAKER_00]: elevating the room temperature around it
from the walls and the surfaces to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: some infrared input to heat the leaf up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And further, we'll use convection and
warmer air inside the room to keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf in the narrow band I mentioned
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this might be a topic of a webinar in
and of itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to jump ahead,
maybe hop onto Google and study the Bowen
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this defines the amount of energy up,
thermal outputs, and heat flow through the
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, speaking of which, remember what I
told you before, that we need some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: lower moisture environment so the plants
can transpire and the water can move
[SPEAKER_00]: through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk about humidity in a
different context.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the pests that thrive in
human environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we're going to be showing you some
tables later that indicate a good humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: relative to temperature for different
stages of growing environments and growing
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this might lead you to believe that
anywhere inside those rooms and those
[SPEAKER_00]: ranges is good for plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be considered true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, inside of a room
where we are moving often hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons of water through the air,
we have to be careful not to give the
[SPEAKER_00]: pests a place to thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's widely understood that humidity
has a direct impact on things like powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew and petritis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep this in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general rule of thumb is the wetter
the room, the higher the likelihood that
[SPEAKER_00]: even a small outbreak of these pests can
become unmanageable and a revenue
[SPEAKER_00]: destroying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about the plants now and the
effect of humidity on them?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at this leaf cross section,
we have to remember that in order for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to use and move water, we need to
have a humidity level outside the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that is less than inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: This difference is literally sucking the
water through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This difference is VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's actually a fairly simple task to
get an appropriate VPD chart if you know
[SPEAKER_00]: just three of the things I've already
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get yourself over to the website you see
in the bottom right hand corner with your
[SPEAKER_00]: room temperature, your room humidity,
and leaf temperature in hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And voila, you can generate a VPD chart
for almost any type of growing environment
[SPEAKER_00]: assuming that the chart is drawn for
whatever plant you're growing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't forget, lighting type affects
how the chart is drawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chart below might be the kind of chart
you'd use in an LED lit room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the kind of chart you would
find if you're using an LHPS or CMH lit
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Notice that the corresponding good areas
of transpiration have changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's make things a little more
complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see from this chart on the
right hand side, a plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesize less and less as the VPD
increases, that is, as we make the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we decrease the VPD, make it more
humid, the photosynthesis will increase,
[SPEAKER_00]: but so does the ability of a pathogen to
thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a balance in there somewhere,
and understanding that is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: really critical to understanding how you
can maximize the plants in your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now remember when I told you that leaf
temperature is not room temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that we had to use different types of
measurement systems for both types of
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's see how really, really
complicated this can get when we look at a
[SPEAKER_00]: 15-hour leaf and room temperature trend in
one of the rooms that we've put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here, things change
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wanted to take a look at just this
differential, you can see here that the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between the leaf temperature
and the air temperature changes almost
[SPEAKER_00]: minute by minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The peaks on the left and right hand side
indicate areas when the lights are on,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the valley in the middle is when the
lights are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this specific room, if you're trying to
manage VPD with a static chart on the
[SPEAKER_00]: wall, you might have a hard time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we use control systems and produce
control systems that can measure
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and humidity and plant
temperature across an entire range of
[SPEAKER_00]: time, from the beginning of the plants
being moved into a room to the time the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's with these sensors and controllers
that we're able to measure the moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: removal from the room every single day and
feed that information back to growers who
[SPEAKER_00]: might find some useful nuggets out of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'd say is we can see that the plants
transpire more when the lights are on,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's the blue bar on the right hand
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: At night, they transpire less,
and in fact, most of that moisture is
[SPEAKER_00]: particular moisture loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: By adding the blue and the red bar up,
we can tell you with pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: certainty, plus or minus 5%, exactly how
much transpiration is being sent through
[SPEAKER_00]: the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're going to start off by
trying to control room humidity and VPD,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to need to size your
equipment appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use the equation on the left-hand side
as a starting point based on the data
[SPEAKER_00]: we've taken from rooms, and we suggest you
do as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's enough about temperature and
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse, why don't you take it from here and
talk about root zone temperature and the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the parameters.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again, Rob.
[SPEAKER_02]: So temperature is also a major factor in
creating a healthy root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to the root zone,
I think it's really important to consider
[SPEAKER_02]: the media and its role in root zone
thermoregulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, we know that soil holds its
temperature differently than rock wall,
[SPEAKER_02]: and if you're thinking about an aeroponic
approach, it's going to be heavily
[SPEAKER_02]: influenced by water temperature and room
conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Root zone temps play an important role in
nutrient uptake and root exudate
[SPEAKER_02]: production.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, studies show us that root
zone temps higher than 77 degrees inhibit
[SPEAKER_02]: the uptake of calcium and other nutrients,
and a root zone that is too cold will slow
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical reactions and lessen the plant's
ability to capture nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: A highly accomplished colleague of mine
would say finding the sweet spot for your
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics is about determining the
temperature that balances enzyme and ion
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration in the root zone for maximum
uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to say it's like Goldilocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about finding the right porridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it comes to meal time for your
plants, we know there are many different
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients and delivery techniques
available to the cannabis cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of us even have our own secret
recipes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Despite that, one thing holds true for
every successful nutrient regimen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's directly connected to transpiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might seem like a stretched first,
but when you think about how mobile
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients are moved by the plant and
immobile nutrients are moved through the
[SPEAKER_02]: transpiration process, it becomes more
clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to maximize your plant's uptake
of immobile nutrients, you must maximize
[SPEAKER_02]: the movement of water through the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, the nutrients will never get
where they're supposed to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can collect some great information on
transpiration and plant nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, we can test the nutrients available
in the media and use that as a baseline
[SPEAKER_02]: for comparing leaf tissue analysis from
new growth and old growth on the same
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we discover immobile nutrients lacking
at any stage of growth, we can assume we
[SPEAKER_02]: miss an opportunity to maximize
transpiration and nutrient translocation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oxygen is another very important plant
influencer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know oxygen is something that your
plants give off during the process of
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthesis, but oxygen in the root
zone also plays a critical role in roots
[SPEAKER_02]: breathing, chemicals interacting,
and good microbes breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if the media becomes compacted or the
roots grow in an anaerobic condition,
[SPEAKER_02]: the roots will suffocate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chemical reactions will slow and your
plants growth will too.
[SPEAKER_02]: An anaerobic root zone is also a breeding
zone for pathogens that will negatively
[SPEAKER_02]: affect plant health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oxygen, water, and temperature are all
interacting factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that cold water holds more oxygen,
but you don't want to put ice water on
[SPEAKER_02]: your roots, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about balancing this knowledge with
your media choice, room conditions,
[SPEAKER_02]: plant stage, and other factors to make
sure oxygen is allowed to function most
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oxygen also helps us create an environment
where good microbes thrive and pathogens
[SPEAKER_02]: don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are many different microbes on this
planet that directly influence cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: One example Rob mentioned earlier was the
botrytis that's all around us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Preventing conditions for it to take hold
involve appropriate dehumidification,
[SPEAKER_02]: integrated biological filtration,
airflow considerations, and proper staff
[SPEAKER_02]: training.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's also good microbes we should
think about managing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beneficial fungal colonies will thrive on
plants roots in an oxygenated environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Root zone fungus like rhizophagus
irregularis provide sugars to bacteria as
[SPEAKER_02]: a reward for making nutrients available in
the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds relatively simple, but managing
protozoa, nematodes, microarthropods,
[SPEAKER_02]: fungi, and bacteria can be a real
challenge when oxygen levels are low and
[SPEAKER_02]: fungal and bacterial pests begin to take
hold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, it's more about creating an
oxygenated rooting environment where good
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes can maximize nutrient uptake,
stimulate growth, and protect against
[SPEAKER_02]: pests and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good and bad microbes like bacteria,
virus, and fungus can be controlled if the
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriate environmental conditions are
maintained.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it comes to thinking about an IPM
strategy, every good IPM plan starts with
[SPEAKER_02]: cultural control, which prizes prevention
over attempted eradication.
[SPEAKER_02]: Filtering the air, creating right air
pressures, optimizing airflow
[SPEAKER_02]: considerations appropriately
dehumidifying, and maintaining conditions
[SPEAKER_02]: that are unsuitable for pests is cultural
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ability to precisely control your
cultivation environment limits IPM
[SPEAKER_02]: applications, limits labor hours,
and it gives you the ability to change
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions for a short period of time in
order to increase the efficacy of an IPM
[SPEAKER_02]: application.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, raising the humidity for a
certain IPM application to be more
[SPEAKER_02]: effective or dropping the humidity to
control a fungal spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, environmental considerations
are imperative to the success of any IPM
[SPEAKER_02]: plan and application strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And speaking of success, water management
is paramount to cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no life without water,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And Leonardo da Vinci said, water is the
driving force of all nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this quote because I've heard the
taxi cab water analogy before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water is the vehicle that picks up all the
nutrients and moves them around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water is the driving force for cannabis
plants, both internally and externally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water delivery must be treated to avoid
the development of pathogens like pythium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And temperature of the water must be
considered as it will have an impact on
[SPEAKER_02]: root zone temperature and oxygen holding
capabilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oxygenated water will help the root zone
grow and aid in beneficial microbe growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And appropriate water pressures will
maintain and maximize plant growth,
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient utilization, and phenotype
expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all know that water in the room is
humidity that needs to be managed
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriately in order to prevent things
like powder and mildew from destroying
[SPEAKER_02]: your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, we suggest you apply the
knowledge that you have about vapor
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure deficit and use water to maximize
your plant's expression and biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, let me toss it back to
Brian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse, Rob, excellent work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very nicely done.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, we'd like to answer some of
the questions that came in from you all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here at the top, one of our attendees
asked, is airflow different than HVAC?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's a really good
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think when you think about airflow
considerations for a room, sometimes we
[SPEAKER_02]: separate them from an integrated HVAC
approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it comes to conditioning the air
in the room and redelivering it to the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, they're tied together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically, I like to think about
airflow as breaking the boundary layer and
[SPEAKER_02]: recreating some outdoor environmental
conditions that put some subtle pressures
[SPEAKER_02]: on the plant and remind them that we are
Mother Nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to the bigger HVAC
conditioning aspect, it's about removing
[SPEAKER_02]: the water that doesn't need to be there
and controlling the environment in a way
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're filtering biological pathogens
and we're cleaning the system and that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're maintaining the temperature and
humidity set points in the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while I think they're both
interconnected, there's definitely a
[SPEAKER_02]: multitude of different approaches we take
with each one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure Rob can add something there,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, can you hear me, guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'd like to say to that is if
you're going to be looking at airflow
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of a room, most likely it's going
to be two separate systems that handle the
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioning of the air and the
dehumidifying of the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't rely on those systems to
get the air just where it needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: inside a very dense canopy inside the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were trying to do that,
you'd have ductwork everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, these rooms can be quite busy
and you're just going to need some way to
[SPEAKER_00]: get air into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from the room itself or in a
general cavity of the room out into the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopies in a way that's not going to
impede the ability of people to get around
[SPEAKER_00]: the room, get in between the rows,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, Jesse, everything you said was
correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're definitely very much
intertwined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: One follow up question related to airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is what are some good vertical upward
through the canopy airflow options as far
[SPEAKER_01]: as brand and style?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, shameless plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, oftentimes we don't see anything
that's being done inside the rack and the
[SPEAKER_00]: tray to bring airflow through the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're often sourcing these and
providing them ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we supply them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the most integrated system out
there is probably the vertical air
[SPEAKER_00]: solution system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that does a pretty good job now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the question was from the bottom
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, they only go from the top
down at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think there are a number of
options out on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reach out to us and we'd be happy
to tell you all about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And guys, just to piggyback on top of
that, I saw a quick question come in about
[SPEAKER_02]: the effect that delivering this air
directly to the stomata on the undersides
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plants, is that a potential
stressor?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this comes back to a couple of
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes back to data collection and real
world application.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, if we apply too much airflow
too fast, we can affect the stomata
[SPEAKER_02]: negatively.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get it to close.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can slow the plant's metabolic rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes to this airflow delivery,
it's really about making sure of two
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: That the air is the appropriate
temperature and humidity so it's
[SPEAKER_02]: conditioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also that the rate of airflow,
the actual velocity in which it's
[SPEAKER_02]: delivered to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think our study shows somewhere around a
meter per second.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be wrong on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've done some in-depth data and
studies just to get an idea of how much
[SPEAKER_02]: airflow we need to apply to that leaf
surface to positively affect the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: to break the boundary layer, and deliver
that CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without any stressors, without any leaf
curl, without any negative reactions to
[SPEAKER_02]: the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just key that that air is
conditioned and delivered at the right
[SPEAKER_02]: velocity to avoid that kind of stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully that's a little bit of insight
on that concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question I have here is does VPD
and transpiration continue as a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: process post harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Rob here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the transpiration process
does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The transpiration is that full cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water enters through the root system,
up to the stem, and then out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: stomata of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point when you've trimmed the
plants, you've harvested it, that process
[SPEAKER_00]: stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no more roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no more water going through the
stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to start seeing water leave
the plant through the stomata or through
[SPEAKER_00]: that particular membrane on the leaves
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very much VPD dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's not a VPD chart you would use or
find on the website I showed you before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's very much dependent on how much
humidity is in the room, the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: of the room, and the temperature and
moisture content of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two things will play off each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two, or sorry, four things of the
two subsets from the plant and the room
[SPEAKER_00]: those things will play off each other and
dramatically affect how quickly or how
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly that plant dries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And further, it'll affect the consistency
of the drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many times we see a harvest lose so
much value in the drying and curing
[SPEAKER_00]: process because it was dried
inconsistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crusty outside on the bud and a
really moist interior that's just perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: for pathogen growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that right there is going to strip
apart all the value you've put into that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sounds like a great segue into our
next webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: More to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you provide a recommendation for
maintaining soil temperature in large
[SPEAKER_01]: fabric beds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think what we're really talking
about here is understanding the process of
[SPEAKER_02]: breakdown in those beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm thinking and what I'm picturing
here is a no-till kind of approach where
[SPEAKER_02]: people are trying to maintain beds or even
just a soil recycling system where people
[SPEAKER_02]: are trying to sort of maintain the
temperatures in those beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously we know that there's a
pretty significant influence from the
[SPEAKER_02]: airflow and the temperature and humidity
set points, how they're going to impact
[SPEAKER_02]: that soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also think it's important to sort of
think about the chemical breakdown and the
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients that you're going with.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a soil-based program and you
have a lot of really good organic inputs
[SPEAKER_02]: that are continually breaking down and you
have a lot of microbial activity,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's going to be a good chance that you
have wonderful microclimates.
[SPEAKER_02]: This way we're talking about microclimates
in a good way in that soil structure that
[SPEAKER_02]: allow certain fungal and bacterial
colonies to thrive and spread their wings
[SPEAKER_02]: and sort of encapsulate those roots and
protect them from some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental threats.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think it's important to think about
water temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times we don't think about that
delivery temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we deliver water that's really cold
to a cold root zone when the lights are
[SPEAKER_02]: off, you know, it's cold on cold on cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we can deliver the water to the
root zone after the lights have come on,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have a little bit of warmth in that
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a little bit of process going on
in that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the water is warm enough but not
too warm, again, back to that Goldilocks
[SPEAKER_02]: porridge, we can use that to sort of
maintain the soil temperature or any media
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature for that matter as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully that provides a little insight
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brian, I'd like to add a little something
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back when we were doing work in the
mushroom industry, large soil beds were
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the de facto standard for growing
mushrooms inside of a cold, wet,
[SPEAKER_00]: dark room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so maintaining those bed temperatures
was pretty important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the methods they use there,
and I've seen some of this in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, people attempting it anyways,
would be to use basically piping,
[SPEAKER_00]: a coiled piping, a radiant floor type
system underneath the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put cool or hot water through it
and end up with a temperature control
[SPEAKER_00]: scheme that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also seen people attempt to use
phase change material, kind of novel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now's probably not the time to get into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've tried to see them use phase
change material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you how well it worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can find out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the person who asked the
question though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stephen, I see that your hand is up and
that you also have asked the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will try and ask your question here
shortly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have more questions or follow ups,
I can also bring you on live to chat with
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just let us know on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next question I'd like to ask is,
indoor agriculture is very energy
[SPEAKER_01]: intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some ways to be more efficient
with HVAC?
[SPEAKER_01]: And are there any sacrifices that are made
to plant performance as a result?
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, just threw me a soft one there,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Inspire, we've designed and built some
very efficient ways to dehumidify the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge is one of being able to use
the energy you're putting into the system
[SPEAKER_00]: in a novel way.
[SPEAKER_00]: In standard dehumidification systems,
they do that by using compressor energy to
[SPEAKER_00]: reheat the air after they've cooled it to
that temperature where you get all the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We and some other manufacturers in the
industry go a step further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will move the air from one spot to
the other inside the air handling unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sends, in essence, pre-cooling the
air before it hits the cooling coil and
[SPEAKER_00]: using that same room energy to reheat the
air back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And effectively, we get 30 to 50% less
compression.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other very, very sophisticated
ways, including desiccants, to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the energy efficiency of the whole growing
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond all that, making smart light
choices will probably help drive the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency of the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, we know that LED rooms,
which are much warmer, have a much easier
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to dehumidify that air.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using less compressor tonnage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those factors all combine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from one to the other, we can see
energy use 50% efficient building compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to a standard building, a legacy system
that was being built and designed,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess even today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually, we saw them mostly five years
ago or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope it answers the president's
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the second part would be, are there
any sacrifices that are made to plant
[SPEAKER_01]: performance as a result of the more energy
efficient process?
[SPEAKER_00]: There can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that has more to do with the choices
you make in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have systems that can
modulate and that can handle the cool
[SPEAKER_00]: times at night versus the hot times during
the day and those transitions in between,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the modulating equipment,
if you're not using it, that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to find the challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one thing to throw a dump truck at
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't have a really effective
gas pedal, either on a dump truck or an
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient Prius, then you're not going to
have a really good chance controlling
[SPEAKER_00]: those systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the sacrifice comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the plant health will really
suffer if you give those pests a place to
[SPEAKER_00]: thrive if you're not doing the right thing
for the root zone temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, got a question here from another
attendee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperature, humidity, and airflow
conditions can vary widely within a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there an ideal room size for optimal
quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: At what point does an increase in room
size jeopardize plant quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have any sort of at least general
ideas around room size?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I think that let me take a
stab at this, Rob, and you can follow
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think for the most part,
as we've all transitioned to larger scale
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation facilities, we've started to
sort of appreciate the smaller room size
[SPEAKER_02]: for isolation purposes and prevention of
spreads.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, if you accurately
and adequately understand your watering
[SPEAKER_02]: rate and you have an appropriate
mechanical system, you can have a much
[SPEAKER_02]: larger scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it really comes down to a couple of
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes down to working with your
engineer and really understanding the
[SPEAKER_02]: inputs and thoroughly vetting them and
appropriate planning.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also sort of comes down to CFD
modeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And computational fluid dynamics is
something that I wasn't too familiar with
[SPEAKER_02]: until I really started looking at these
larger scale rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't as simple as, hey,
we're going to put a fan every six feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: This rule of thumb for traditional legacy
growers was still applicable, but we
[SPEAKER_02]: needed to take those inputs and sort of
take them to a data-driven science level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by doing the modeling, we're usually
capable of determining how many air
[SPEAKER_02]: exchanges we're going to have per couple
of minutes or where that air is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: flow, the potentiality for dead spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a result, we can adjust our
mechanical influences and cultural control
[SPEAKER_02]: in that space to make sure that we are
controlling the space as a whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times, traditional techniques are
let's put up some HVAC, let's put in some
[SPEAKER_02]: pocket dehumidifiers, and let's blow air
all around the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what we're talking about is a
recipe for microclimates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And without the appropriate planning and
the appropriate data collection,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really hard to get all those things
on the same page and actually manage the
[SPEAKER_02]: envelope as a whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Rob, you have something you want to
add to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you basically stole my thunder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dare you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anecdotally, we see rooms 2,000 to 3,000
square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they might go one or two tier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen some four tier rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you said, Jesse, without
modeling, you can't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Modeling gives us a sheet that says,
what's the average dwell time of air
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of a room?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one thing to design a room with an
HVACD system that's going to do a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: number of air changes per hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even then, unless you can prove to me
that we've gone in, modeled the canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: like they do in the wind tunnels,
use those same formulas and applied them
[SPEAKER_00]: into the rows and the racks of the
cannabis themselves through the CFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to see it to believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, modeling has helped us for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Questions are coming in, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks very much for the level of
engagement here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question here from Eric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stutter saying, I do energy studies of
indoor cannabis facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've seen a lot of variety in how
much dehumidification is required during
[SPEAKER_01]: dark flower dark periods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does strain type have the most significant
impact on dark period transpiration?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that we catalog every room
that we design and go back to verify how
[SPEAKER_00]: much moisture is being taken out of it,
like you saw in that graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our slide, we can measure the
transpiration rate down to the minute,
[SPEAKER_00]: the instantaneous transpiration rate of
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have yet to catalog it by strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably going to be the next
thing we go and look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, our rooms are generally designed on
day one to handle a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't want to limit a grower or a
facility to a specific strain on day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then six months later, market
conditions change, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always advise using standard rules of
thumb and going just a little bit bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: than that for your room dehumidification
design.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said, I can't wait to go
back and look at that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully that answers your question,
Eric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got another question here from Jacob
Hickey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any fundamental strategies or
differences in maintaining the 10 cardinal
[SPEAKER_01]: parameters in rockwool substrate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that's a really good
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously that's an interesting
conversation for a parameter.
[SPEAKER_02]: But your media choice is definitely going
to have an impact on how you deal with it
[SPEAKER_02]: over the course of time and how your plant
grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think when you think about the 10
cardinal parameters, the importance is
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding the synergies and how they
all interact and how they work together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same thing goes for your media
choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, if you're using rockwool
media, we know that initially that
[SPEAKER_02]: rockwool media tends to have a very high
pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be very high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be somewhere around eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be even higher than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in understanding that and first
appropriately treating the rockwool to get
[SPEAKER_02]: to that right pH is a step that you need
to take because of your media choice in
[SPEAKER_02]: order to facilitate all those other
parameters interacting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The microbe growth, the appropriate water
retention, the right root growth that
[SPEAKER_02]: leads to plant vitality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same goes for every media choice
that you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all going to have slightly
different considerations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one might be something like using
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that cocoa has a tendency to
bind nitrogen over a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're recycling your media over
years, that's something very important to
[SPEAKER_02]: consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might actually have to add more
additional nitrogen to that product
[SPEAKER_02]: because you have a cocoa-based media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you start to mix medias and
build your own medias and build soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have all these other interacting
factors as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are buffers for success
through that mixture just by creating more
[SPEAKER_02]: inputs and more opportunities in the root
zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But absolutely, there will be an impact
because of your media choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of mentioned temperature as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a cloning environment, you have all
these little rockwool cubes sitting
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're blowing too much cold air
past the environment, they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: pick up that cold air.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be sitting there without
roots growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to dramatically impact
your ability to get roots quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you think about that and you raise
the environmental conditions and deliver
[SPEAKER_02]: warmer air to that root zone that's
oxygenated, that will have an impact on
[SPEAKER_02]: initiating root growth faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is probably a topic for a
much deeper dive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hopefully, that's a little bit of
insight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer is absolutely yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear a lot about brute force HVAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any other options to consider?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned the technologies before for
dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how to make a less energy intensive
growing operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of dehumidification
technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call them, in our products,
a coil run around loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an air to air heat exchanger
around the same cooling coil mechanism
[SPEAKER_00]: that we talked about before.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are liquid and dry deskin systems
that can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about brute force,
we're specifically talking about the use
[SPEAKER_00]: of a commercial air conditioner that takes
the room temperature and humidity air and
[SPEAKER_00]: brings it all the way down past that dew
point that's required to maintain the room
[SPEAKER_00]: condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that takes a lot of compressor energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compressor energy is 70% to 80% of most
air conditioning systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try and reduce that using that air to
air heat exchanger system or a coil run
[SPEAKER_00]: around loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also looked at dry and liquid
desikins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they might do a very good job,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frankly, we haven't found much luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's all about system design and
thoughtful approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ahead of time, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you backing on that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a region where outdoor temps can get
below negative 30 degrees Fahrenheit and
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity in the 20% range, will this
affect indoor conditions of an enclosed
[SPEAKER_01]: facility?
[SPEAKER_01]: And would concrete floors affect things as
well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you for sure that an unfilled,
we'll start with the second question.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, a concrete floor, we've seen it in
rooms contributing humidity into the
[SPEAKER_00]: space, almost 50% of what the plants were
doing at different times of the stages of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, especially if it's a problem in
drying rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to use a concrete
floor, your best chance to combat that and
[SPEAKER_00]: not have to overdehumidify moisture inside
your space that's not coming from your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is to seal it off, use an epoxy
seal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the rest of the room is sealed,
going back to the first part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: question, if the rest of the room is
sealed and it's sealed very well and the
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure is controlled appropriately,
then outside temperatures and humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: don't actually have that much of an
influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: That outside air that's being brought in
for ventilation purposes, if it's being
[SPEAKER_00]: brought in, and we recommend it should,
especially for pressurization and pathogen
[SPEAKER_00]: control and biosecurity, that air should
be treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's too dry, it should be
moisturized.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too hot, it should be cooled down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to bring in air into a room
that's not conditioned in any way,
[SPEAKER_00]: shape or form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have to manage that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an engineering equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, again,
we recommend sealing rooms so that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: the best pressure control possible,
if only for biosecurity reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That person can feel free to email me
afterwards and I'll do a much deeper dive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, sealing a room, we find in most
facilities we go into, we just don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: that much influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in the hottest desert areas of
ambient conditions, considering the rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves are rooms inside of facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't have a solar load and
there's very little thermal or humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: load inside the facility itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Rob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Circling back on the question of medium,
are there any specific issues that INSPIRE
[SPEAKER_01]: can address if an aeroponics system is
being utilized?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I think when you think about
aeroponics and the way that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: controlling the root zone, we don't have a
buffer other than water, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're delivering a fine aerated nutrient
mist to the root zone at periodic
[SPEAKER_02]: intervals and water is being delivered
through tubes and bucket systems that run
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes to understanding the
importance of that water temperature,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it lacks a buffer, we really need
to control the oxygen levels in water and
[SPEAKER_02]: dilution of that delivery mechanism.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when the water runs through the systems
and the pipes get hot and cold,
[SPEAKER_02]: those are going to have influences on the
water delivery in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in an aeroponic setting, it becomes of
critical importance to control the ambient
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures, to control the room temps
and make sure that you don't have dramatic
[SPEAKER_02]: spikes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can stabilize the delivery of that
water throughout the entire propagation
[SPEAKER_02]: period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like we have time for maybe one
more question here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Circling back on the concept of drying
rooms, which again, we'll take a much
[SPEAKER_01]: deeper dive on with our next webinar
session.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, have you found an
accurate way to estimate pounds per hour
[SPEAKER_01]: water loss with product in dry rooms on an
hourly basis based on product mass,
[SPEAKER_01]: volume, percent moisture content,
and or VPD, in turn being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: accurately size the dry room HVAC system
and control properly through the drying
[SPEAKER_01]: process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can take that one on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that yeah, that's what we
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like you saw in that graph with the
red and blue bars, we can watch product in
[SPEAKER_00]: a room lose water weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a certain pace based on the effective
temperature and humidity control of that
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting at the beginning, if we can
control the temperature and the humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: to the customer's desired requirements,
that means we are removing the moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: that's coming off of the plant,
off of the harvest, at a specified rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we use sensors that are accurate
enough and have verifiedness with weighed
[SPEAKER_00]: product in the field, weighed over time,
to know that our air conditioning system
[SPEAKER_00]: feeds back the moisture removal rate from
the product itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use our air conditioning system
controllers to tell the growers and the
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting team how much water is being
lost on a pound per hour basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, we know that water starts
at a certain moisture content and the
[SPEAKER_00]: customer typically wants a targeted
moisture content at the end of the drying
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do is we look at that difference
in pounds of water coming out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product and say, how many days do you want
that product removed?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many days do you want that weight
removed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually we end up with a number that's
seven to 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make it go faster than seven to 10
days by heating up the room, but you're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably going to do negative things to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can slow it down and really
essentially slow down the plant drying
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all things that we play with and
it all goes back to really good sensors on
[SPEAKER_00]: the equipment that's doing the
dehumidification and knowing from that
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly how that moisture loss is being
handled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terrific.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more question and we're going to have
to sign off here in respect of everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: For any of the questions that we didn't
answer, please feel free to reach out to
[SPEAKER_01]: us directly and we'd be happy to talk with
you more.
[SPEAKER_01]: The final question here is, do you think
recirculating molecular filtration
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment for odor mitigation has a
negative effect on live cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_01]: space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Say that one question one more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think recirculating molecular
filtration equipment such as activated
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon for odor mitigation has a negative
effect on the live cannabis in the space?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that we talked about VPD,
which is when we talked about it in this
[SPEAKER_00]: context, it was water vapor pressure
deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that there's also a vapor
pressure for other products inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, like the terpenes themselves,
that if you remove them, you may end up
[SPEAKER_00]: causing a deficit of the terpene in the
air, which would have a detrimental effect
[SPEAKER_00]: of the terpene on the plant, which is
going to evaporate into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how much carbon filtration do you
have to use inside of a room to drop the
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor pressure down of a terpene to affect
the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that most times
recirculated air isn't going through a
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filtration scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's only the air that's being
injected out of the room in the facilities
[SPEAKER_00]: we design that's going through carbon
filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer may or may not be yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think using carbon filters in your
recirculating airstream is necessarily a
[SPEAKER_00]: good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pressure drops are high.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of other things that are
really going to impact your bottom line in
[SPEAKER_00]: a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I'd answer that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I did answer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the person can reach out to me if
they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesse, do you have anything to add?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think that was really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when it comes to recirculating,
it's better to make a really good stab at
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to do it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then necessarily think about the minor
implications that you might have for that
[SPEAKER_02]: recirculated air.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that stale and stagnant air is
going to be a health issue for people and
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and the like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like you mentioned, as far as an
integrated system, it's probably looking
[SPEAKER_02]: more like some sort of capture filter,
like a MERV 13, followed by some sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: secondary treatment, whether that's UV or
photocatalytic oxidation or something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, in order to make that recirculation
path make sense for a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The replacement on those carbon filters
can be really tricky as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might run them for a couple of cycles
and then not know if they're full and not
[SPEAKER_02]: know if you need to throw them away and
maybe not be able to accurately determine
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my concerns with carbon as well,
but I think you touched on that,
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really just use it as the exhaust odor
mitigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do some pre-filter before that for the
integrated room system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, everybody, looks like our time
is up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to thank you all again for
spending the last hour with us,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we look forward to having you
participate in future events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you all have a great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
Thanks, everybody.
