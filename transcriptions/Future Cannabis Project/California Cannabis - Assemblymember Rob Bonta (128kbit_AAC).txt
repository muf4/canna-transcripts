[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just share a little bit of a look
back, a reflection on the current state of
[SPEAKER_04]: our cannabis laws and regulation,
and then talk about what the future might
[SPEAKER_04]: hold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, my name is Rob Bonta.
[SPEAKER_04]: I serve in the California State Assembly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I represent Oakland, Alameda, and San
Leandro.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm probably most known for having Max
Michelonis in my office.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's Max?
[SPEAKER_04]: Max is here somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Max.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, this is the man who wrote the
MCR essay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And spent thousands of hours in meetings,
you know, working it out with
[SPEAKER_04]: stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like we've come a long way in a
short period of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're still not where we need to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think there has been a new mood and
a new openness among California state
[SPEAKER_04]: legislators to address cannabis policy
like any other policy issue that affects
[SPEAKER_04]: our residents, that affects the people of
California, affects our businesses,
[SPEAKER_04]: our patients, our environment,
our health and safety.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is good because when we were
working on this issue back in,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was 2014 in the fall,
and then throughout 2015, that was not the
[SPEAKER_04]: case.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a lot of legislators who,
this is a bit of an exaggeration,
[SPEAKER_04]: but not really.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I would say, hey, I have this
cannabis bill I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to have your support.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to explain it to you and let you
know what it does, how it's good for
[SPEAKER_04]: California, how it's good for the
environment, how it's good for patients,
[SPEAKER_04]: how it's good for safety.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they would almost put their fingers in
a cross and back up slowly and say,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's the cannabis bill?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a no on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just any mention of cannabis
seemed bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because it carried the stigma,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, through our work, and I say our
because this has been very much a team
[SPEAKER_04]: effort between a number of legislators who
sort of lifted up the original MCR SA
[SPEAKER_04]: work, it was Assemblymember Joan Sawyer,
Assemblymembers Wood, Assemblymember
[SPEAKER_04]: Cooley, and a bipartisan group,
Assemblymember Lackey, who worked on this
[SPEAKER_04]: together with myself to really do
something groundbreaking, to do something
[SPEAKER_04]: that hadn't been done in 20 years,
to provide this regulatory regime in the
[SPEAKER_04]: state of California for medical cannabis
that we hadn't had since the passage of
[SPEAKER_04]: the Compassionate Use Act.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this had been something that had been
tried.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't for lack of trying, it had been
tried multiple times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it had failed multiple times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the reasons that I think we
were able to succeed was because we set
[SPEAKER_04]: about to address this in a different way,
rather than have one coalition of
[SPEAKER_04]: stakeholders on one side that had
traditionally been together, largely the
[SPEAKER_04]: League of California Cities and public
safety folks on one side and have sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: our patient advocates and labor and
industry on the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we decided to work together and invite
a big table and say anyone who's
[SPEAKER_04]: interested in making our cannabis policy
better, stronger, more effective,
[SPEAKER_04]: working out the kinks and doing something
historic, you're welcome to come to this
[SPEAKER_04]: table and put your best ideas forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they will be considered.
[SPEAKER_04]: They might not always be implemented or
included in the final piece of law,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they will be considered.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where MACS came in.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where someone else you may know in
the cannabis world who's now working,
[SPEAKER_04]: who was on my staff at the time,
Anchi So, came into play.
[SPEAKER_04]: They both worked hours and hours listening
to everyone and tried to get the best
[SPEAKER_04]: piece of legislation possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we slowly made progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: We kept moving past hurdles where in the
past legislation had fallen down and
[SPEAKER_04]: failed and either failed in committee or
gotten held.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we finally got on the verge of
the governor's desk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when you're close to the
governor's desk, that's when he gets
[SPEAKER_04]: engaged.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he started looking more closely at the
legislation, had his staff get involved,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they had some ideas that they wanted
to include as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we were able to have a discussion
with the governor's office.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in 2015, we got the MCRSA passed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was exciting because it had never
been done before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was exciting because it had been
done in a way that had never been done
[SPEAKER_04]: before with a coalition working together
side by side.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that group of legislators and
stakeholders I think continued to be
[SPEAKER_04]: committed to the approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the approach drove the
results and allowed us to do something
[SPEAKER_04]: unprecedented.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we want to continue to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we felt that we made a significant
contribution to medical cannabis policy in
[SPEAKER_04]: the state of California.
[SPEAKER_04]: We knew it wasn't perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you do something that big,
it's impossible to get it right,
[SPEAKER_04]: just right to get it perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to have unintended
consequences.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to have components that are
intended to do one thing but don't
[SPEAKER_04]: accomplish that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There will be some blind spots that get
revealed where you expected it to do
[SPEAKER_04]: something but something else kind of
squeezed out the side.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you've got to be committed to the
ongoing work to fix those challenges.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a big part of that is you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you're the experts.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how the law impacts you,
impacts businesses, patients, the
[SPEAKER_04]: environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that feedback loop is critical to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of legislators say, we want to
hear from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we really want to hear from you to
share with us what's needed next in the
[SPEAKER_04]: next iteration to, you know, move towards
perfection of our cannabis policy in the
[SPEAKER_04]: state of California.
[SPEAKER_04]: I came at this from a certain perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was chair of the Assembly Health
Committee at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been on the Assembly Health Committee
my entire time in the legislature.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw this as an important issue for
patients, that voters, for whom voters had
[SPEAKER_04]: approved access to cannabis as medicine,
and I wanted to make sure that that was
[SPEAKER_04]: high quality medicine, that it was tested,
that it was reliable, that those with
[SPEAKER_04]: compromised immune systems weren't put at
risk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also came at it as a representative
from Oakland who, as you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: there are many pioneering cannabis leaders
from my city.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I wanted to work with others to try
to get the right policy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, this wasn't something that
when I ran for legislature back in 2012,
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I would be working on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm proud and glad I have, but really it
relies on being, the next policy
[SPEAKER_04]: components rely on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so fast forward one year from fall of
2015 and fall of 2016.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in literally a year, we get the MCRSA
passed and then we get Prop 64 passed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so where a year before we didn't have
any medical cannabis regulations and adult
[SPEAKER_04]: use cannabis was not legal, now both are
in effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's a lot of movement in a short
period of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Prop 64 was based on the MCRSA,
but it had some noted departures from our
[SPEAKER_04]: work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I supported Prop 64 as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, definitely I do have pride
of ownership, but not that much pride.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was fine with the overall approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think Prop 64 brought a lot of
people behind it, whether it be,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, patient advocates or those in
the industry themselves, or social justice
[SPEAKER_04]: folks, criminal justice reform folks,
folks who believe that what it was,
[SPEAKER_04]: that the war on drugs was a failure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it needed to be fixed and addressed
and there needed to be some changes going
[SPEAKER_04]: forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it brought a lot of libertarian folks
who thought that the government shouldn't
[SPEAKER_04]: be deciding whether or not you can use
adult use cannabis since you're an adult.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the election showed that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The numbers were strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was 57% throughout the state of
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now we have adult use passed as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've been trying to roll out the
regulations every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been working with the Bureau.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been always trying to improve and
strengthen and build on the work that we
[SPEAKER_04]: got done.
[SPEAKER_04]: With MCRSA and Prop 64, I have a bill
that's right now on the governor's desk
[SPEAKER_04]: that would help speed up the process for
expungements and reductions in cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: crimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the panel beforehand was talking
about that and other issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, my view is this is a
substantive right that was given by Prop
[SPEAKER_04]: 64.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people of California voted by a super
majority that not only going forward,
[SPEAKER_04]: will cannabis be legal, but that it has a
retroactive impact and it should be able
[SPEAKER_04]: to, it should change your criminal record.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that conviction that had been haunting
you and chasing you and following you
[SPEAKER_04]: around and making it difficult to get
housing and making it difficult to get a
[SPEAKER_04]: job, you should no longer have to deal
with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the process is burdensome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's confusing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's costly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time consuming.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of folks aren't taking advantage
of it because of those reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they need to take a day off from
work and go to court and file papers and
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe have a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they need to even know that the right
is theirs.
[SPEAKER_04]: That it's something that they enjoy and
they can pursue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is somewhere where
government should be able to step in.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is sort of a classic good government
role where the right is already,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's already been decided that individuals
deserve this right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now make it so.
[SPEAKER_04]: And use the power of government.
[SPEAKER_04]: Use the fact that the DOJ has a database
where they can search for all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: qualifying cannabis crimes and they can do
a data dump, literally, and provide it to
[SPEAKER_04]: the district attorneys who can have a
chance to review them and challenge them
[SPEAKER_04]: if they like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they don't, then these crimes
should be wiped or reduced.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that should all just be done by
operation of law.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the governor has a few more days to
sign this bill.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting nervous because he has until
the end of the month.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he hasn't done it yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think he sort of takes, he addresses
bills in sort of thematic groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so maybe he hasn't addressed all of
the cannabis bills yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm very hopeful for that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one is, it's a bill that got a lot of
support, including support from law
[SPEAKER_04]: enforcement folks and others.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's just, it's a bill that
will really help achieve social justice.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll show that government can work for
the people and it'll make people's lives
[SPEAKER_04]: better who are hurting because of these
bills.
[SPEAKER_04]: These convictions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm proud of that bill.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hope it gets signed by the governor
so I got my fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we also, I want to give a shout
out to Fiona Ma.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know she may have been here earlier or
may be coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've worked for a number of years
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, I'm a big supporter of hers.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's gonna be our next treasurer.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's forward thinking and open minded and
she embraces the cannabis industry and
[SPEAKER_04]: wants to create better solutions and make
the system work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she and I have been in particular a
team that's worked together and we wanted
[SPEAKER_04]: to do something that I thought was
practical and simple and we set about to
[SPEAKER_04]: do it last year, which was to take away
the 10% penalty on non-EFT tax payments
[SPEAKER_04]: because the cannabis industry can't pay
through electronic fund transfer given the
[SPEAKER_04]: federal overlay and the cash business or
the all cash nature of the business.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that bill actually, we tried again this
year and that bill is signed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the law.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no more 10% penalty for paying tax
payments in cash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that provides equity and fairness.
[SPEAKER_04]: It encourages our cannabis businesses to
pay their taxes, which is a good thing
[SPEAKER_04]: from the perspective of the government and
businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got that bill passed and we're
excited about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: One that I regret, we didn't get passed,
which I really feel was necessary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm open to seeing how we address it
going forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: But was the three year reduction in excise
taxes and a complete moratorium on the
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in a time of transformation right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: With laws going into effect in January of
this year and the new regime being
[SPEAKER_04]: implemented, we wanted to encourage as
many folks as possible to move from the
[SPEAKER_04]: black and gray market to the regulated
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what this whole proposition was,
the proposition of the MCRSA, the
[SPEAKER_04]: proposition of Proposition 64.
[SPEAKER_04]: It said, come out of the shadows,
come into the light, embrace a regulated
[SPEAKER_04]: marketplace where you follow all the
rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you do, you'll be a business just
like any other California business,
[SPEAKER_04]: creating good jobs, paying your taxes,
and being fully compliant with the law.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in order to do that, we need to make
sure that our businesses aren't undercut
[SPEAKER_04]: by the gray and black market, where
they're not paying their taxes,
[SPEAKER_04]: where they're undercutting based on cost
savings because of the cost of compliance
[SPEAKER_04]: that they're not following.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in order to do that for a temporary
period for three years, I thought it made
[SPEAKER_04]: sense to reduce the taxes, to invite and
encourage and spur along that migration
[SPEAKER_04]: from the black and gray market to the
regulated marketplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: But not all of my colleagues agreed,
and it's a legislature with multiple
[SPEAKER_04]: branches of government and multiple
members in the legislature, not a
[SPEAKER_04]: monarchy, and we weren't able to get that
done.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I was excited about was that was a
bipartisan effort.
[SPEAKER_04]: Assemblymember Tom Lackey was the
co-author along with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a good amount of support along the
way in committee, and it got held in
[SPEAKER_04]: appropriations on the assembly side.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe we try again on that,
or maybe we sharpen our pencils and roll
[SPEAKER_04]: up our sleeves and decide a better way to
do it, a more effective way to do it,
[SPEAKER_04]: but in the discussion part of this,
I'd love to hear what your thoughts are on
[SPEAKER_04]: that bill and what the future might hold.
[SPEAKER_04]: One other thing that the legislature
wasn't ready for yet was protection of
[SPEAKER_04]: medical patients in the workplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was ready for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it makes, it's common sense,
it's practical that a medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: patient, like any patient using medicine
should have their status as a medical
[SPEAKER_04]: patient protected, should be reasonably
accommodated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously we had some components in there
where in safety-sensitive jobs it wouldn't
[SPEAKER_04]: apply, and this is an area where the state
of California would not be the first to do
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other states have done it, including red
states, and so we need to catch up and we
[SPEAKER_04]: need to do better by our employees,
because right now the incentive is to not
[SPEAKER_04]: use cannabis and instead to use things
like opioids, which we know, we have a
[SPEAKER_04]: opioid epidemic, and that cannabis can be
a safer, healthier alternative.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what that tells me is that while we've
made progress, while we've moved the
[SPEAKER_04]: needle, while our trajectory is heading in
the right direction, we're not able to do
[SPEAKER_04]: everything that's necessary yet,
and I think sometimes it's incremental,
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes there's a time and a place for
each policy, and maybe this year wasn't
[SPEAKER_04]: the time for that, but maybe next year
will be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we have to continue our efforts,
and meanwhile, we're dealing with a
[SPEAKER_04]: federal administration that's tough on
cannabis, that makes it harder to make the
[SPEAKER_04]: progress that we need.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always thought that maybe with a
different president we'd have a
[SPEAKER_04]: rescheduling or a descheduling,
that we'd have more openness to what
[SPEAKER_04]: states are doing, and deference to states'
rights, more along the lines of the coal
[SPEAKER_04]: memo, but even more, instead of a
retraction of the coal memo, which is what
[SPEAKER_04]: we have, and an attorney general who is
hostile towards cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the federal overlay makes things
tougher, and the schedule one nature of
[SPEAKER_04]: the drug in the eyes of the federal
government makes it tough, and so does the
[SPEAKER_04]: fact that there's no banking.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes it very difficult for our
businesses to be successful and to thrive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for sure, choppy waters ahead,
challenges ahead, but my reflection is the
[SPEAKER_04]: appetite of the California legislature is
growing to be supportive, to be
[SPEAKER_04]: open-minded, to try to craft solutions,
to try to fix problems in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: space, to build on what we've done with a
lot of self-recognition that we didn't get
[SPEAKER_04]: it exactly right, that it's not perfect,
that it needs to be improved, and the way
[SPEAKER_04]: to improve it is through the input of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you literally telling me,
and Assemblymember Jones-Sawyer,
[SPEAKER_04]: and Assemblymember Wood, and Lackey,
and Cooley, what needs to be done next.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd love to have our discussion include
some of that, if you have some ideas about
[SPEAKER_04]: what California, who prides itself in
leading on so many things, and I think we
[SPEAKER_04]: are leading on cannabis, what else we need
to do to sort of cement that role as
[SPEAKER_04]: leaders in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to thank you for all that you
do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it hasn't always been easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: To be in the cannabis world, I think it's,
hopefully it's getting easier,
[SPEAKER_04]: although the regulated marketplace is not
something I guess you'd put the label easy
[SPEAKER_04]: on, but I feel it is necessary when we
want to support our good actors and bring
[SPEAKER_04]: as many people into the regulated
marketplace as possible, and sort of shed
[SPEAKER_04]: that stigma for good, and keep working and
building on creating a more perfect
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis policy in the state of
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that, I'll end my remarks and just
say thank you for the opportunity to be
[SPEAKER_04]: here with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for this State of Cannabis
Conference.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was here a couple years ago,
and it seems like it's growing,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we're always getting better thought
partners and engagement, and look forward
[SPEAKER_04]: to your questions and to our discussion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: The homeland security issue that happened
with the transportation company two weeks
[SPEAKER_07]: ago, did you hear about that?
[SPEAKER_07]: So Wild Rivers Transport was taking some
cash somewhere that it needed to go,
[SPEAKER_07]: and they got pulled over by CHP,
and then they got, they let them go,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then further down the road,
Homeland Security came and got them and
[SPEAKER_07]: took their cash.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now they've retained Matt Cuman,
and they're suing CHP.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you said that we've got some issues
federally.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you heard about this work around
with, Homeland Security apparently isn't
[SPEAKER_07]: held to Rohrbacher far, so there's some
money there to come and do some
[SPEAKER_07]: enforcement.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you heard about this?
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a bill that I think would have
helped with that, and this is where I need
[SPEAKER_04]: max back in my office.
[SPEAKER_04]: Assemblymember Jones-Sawyer, it was sort
of almost like a sanctuary state approach
[SPEAKER_04]: to cannabis, where in a place like
California, where we legalize medical and
[SPEAKER_04]: adult use cannabis, there would not be
that ability to sort of refer or tip off
[SPEAKER_04]: or communicate with the federal
government, because it's legal in the
[SPEAKER_04]: state of California, similar to what we've
done with our sanctuary state for our
[SPEAKER_04]: undocumented friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: and neighbors and immigrant residents.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe something like that would help
address something like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is something that,
while hard to hear, is not shocking from
[SPEAKER_04]: the federal administration, and it might
be something that is susceptible to a
[SPEAKER_04]: state fix, along the lines of the
Jones-Sawyer bill that I was working on
[SPEAKER_04]: with him last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I'd like you to address is,
I haven't heard much talk on, is our
[SPEAKER_01]: friends at the League of Cities sending
out a thing, you're gonna have to ban,
[SPEAKER_01]: or you're gonna lose your rights to
control it, and the state is gonna control
[SPEAKER_01]: it, and now some ungodly number of
municipalities and counties and so forth
[SPEAKER_01]: have complete bans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there something at the state level that
might go, I think we've learned that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: way, way easier to ban than to unban,
and now with 80% of the cities and
[SPEAKER_01]: counties having bans, how does the state
legislature look at that, and is there any
[SPEAKER_01]: help fix other than the regular thing of
changing hearts and minds?
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the key components of the CRSA that
allowed it to pass, and it was part of the
[SPEAKER_04]: grand deal and the grand bargain,
and then later it was adopted more or less
[SPEAKER_04]: by, Prop 64 was this idea of local
control, so the League of California
[SPEAKER_04]: Cities had traditionally been able to
oppose legislation that did not have
[SPEAKER_04]: strong local control components,
and those bills died, and so we believed
[SPEAKER_04]: that in putting the MCRSA together in
2015, we would not be able to get a bill
[SPEAKER_04]: passed and signed by the governor if it
didn't have a local control component,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think that's an absolutely accurate
assessment but it's not guesswork.
[SPEAKER_04]: The League would have gone strong opposed,
law enforcement would have gone strong
[SPEAKER_04]: opposed, and legislators would have
followed, so we would have had nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was also a component in there that
we had to fix when we came back in 2016,
[SPEAKER_04]: which was very unfortunate because it was
unintended, it got into the language,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it helped spur this sort of urgent
call out to locals to ban because they
[SPEAKER_04]: thought they were going to get preempted
by the state and the state was going to
[SPEAKER_04]: act for them if they didn't act,
and so that was unintended, that's part of
[SPEAKER_04]: the, when we do something this big,
you don't always get it right,
[SPEAKER_04]: and there's some imperfections,
that one had consequences, and when people
[SPEAKER_04]: decided to ban, it's hard to reverse,
it's better when you start from a place of
[SPEAKER_04]: no action and you can decide, of course,
either ban or adopt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what we might be able to do,
and so this is a huge issue, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We have don't use cannabis, we have state
licenses, but then we have a lot of places
[SPEAKER_04]: that are banning all or some of the supply
chain in the cannabis marketplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot are nervous about dispensaries,
maybe more okay with manufacturers or
[SPEAKER_04]: testers, maybe even cultivators,
but a little more worried about
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensaries, and so the full supply chain
in the marketplace that's needed is not
[SPEAKER_04]: robust enough, and so we've had a number
of roundtables to think about what the
[SPEAKER_04]: solution is to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thought I had was it's weird if a
locality, if the people have voted to have
[SPEAKER_04]: adult use cannabis, but their
representatives, their city council or
[SPEAKER_04]: their supervisors say we should have a
ban.
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems like a tension or a problem,
a conflict.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prop 64, to be fair, and MCRSA did say
that locals could ban, and so maybe that's
[SPEAKER_04]: the way that gets harmonized in the eyes
of those folks, but I think one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: things I had thought of was also having a
sort of model template for locals to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people get overwhelmed,
they're like I don't know anything about
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, I'm a city council member,
I came because I cared about public
[SPEAKER_04]: safety, or I cared about development
projects, or I cared about parks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis is new to me, it's just easier if
I just ban it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like some of my neighbors are kind of
worried about it, and I don't want to have
[SPEAKER_04]: to deal with them when I go to the
supermarket or the sidelines of the soccer
[SPEAKER_04]: field.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are all real examples for me when I
was in city council.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not being afraid, but seeing people in the
supermarket and on the sidelines of the
[SPEAKER_04]: soccer field, and so easier to ban,
but if they had something that said this
[SPEAKER_04]: is what the state proposes as a good
solution and a solid model template that
[SPEAKER_04]: you can adjust and tweak and make it work
for you, but it addresses some of the key
[SPEAKER_04]: issues, it highlights the key components
of what you might have, so that they can
[SPEAKER_04]: have a starting place, and they can work
with their city attorney and their city
[SPEAKER_04]: manager to get it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this idea of providing tools to locals
to help them get there, because I feel
[SPEAKER_04]: like they get overwhelmed, and I know that
there are some efforts, Max, this is a
[SPEAKER_04]: good example, this is the Max keynote,
but Max had been working with a number of
[SPEAKER_04]: locals on just that, getting into place a
regime that supported and had the right
[SPEAKER_04]: safeguards and guardrails around cannabis,
and maybe that's something that could be
[SPEAKER_04]: helpful as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're in a tough spot because it
requires reversal of bans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, if we had no position instead of a
ban position, it would have been easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I am open, and we've pulled together
some people, some of our thought leaders
[SPEAKER_04]: in cannabis policy in Sacramento to talk
about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't know that we've exactly figured it
out, but I think that's an area that needs
[SPEAKER_04]: to get addressed, and we need to do
something in the next legislative cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have thoughts or others have
thoughts, that's something, the problem is
[SPEAKER_04]: on our radar, the solution is not
something that we've arrived at yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, my name is Alfonso, I'm a content
producer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am looking to get a public service
announcement campaign where social equity
[SPEAKER_06]: and a more accessible industry for people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, is that something where you could
assist in directing me in getting some
[SPEAKER_06]: feedback and maybe getting those ideas to
certain areas like in Los Angeles,
[SPEAKER_06]: or up north, or down in those areas where
that message might be best received?
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy to talk to you further.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is a component that kind of
animates the whole cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: this idea of equity and social justice and
providing opportunity to particularly
[SPEAKER_04]: those communities that have been harmed by
the prior approach and policies towards
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis and we're working on things at
the state level to help address that on
[SPEAKER_04]: the regulatory side as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the Bureau and Lori Ajax is working
on some things, we've had some roundtables
[SPEAKER_04]: about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a bill that would provide $10
million to support equity coming from the
[SPEAKER_04]: state.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had ideas around incubators and sort
of this idea of a golden ticket.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go through an incubator and you
take certain steps, and you're from a
[SPEAKER_04]: disadvantaged community that had been
harmed in the past, you would be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: have more direct access to a license.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oakland's done a lot on equity,
maybe gone a little too far in some ways,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the spirit is right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm right in the heart of kind of this
equity discussion in Oakland and I'm happy
[SPEAKER_04]: to talk to you more about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, hi, Assemblymember Bonta.
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, thank you for all of the
work you've done.
[SPEAKER_08]: Max, of course, and all the other
legislators, it hasn't gone unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know where you played a role in this,
so thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So God, there's just so many fixes that
need to happen in policy and the
[SPEAKER_08]: regulation side and all of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So instead, I want to look a little into
the future and ask you what your thoughts
[SPEAKER_08]: are on public consumption.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have an issue even here at this event.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have issues everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have people out smoking tobacco,
right, and they can't smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: At a cannabis event.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not just here, it's anywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it sounds like a little bit of a
progressive policy, but by some token,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's working in Canada, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: In Canada, if you're a medical card
holder, you can smoke right on the street.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, people hopefully can be responsible
about it, but nevertheless, that is
[SPEAKER_08]: available and are you guys looking into
that at all?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that too far down the road or do you
think that California could eventually
[SPEAKER_08]: come around where we could somehow figure
out a safe way to have public consumption,
[SPEAKER_08]: despite the lounges that may open in
cities, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just for everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: For my crystal ball, if I looked into it
today, I'd say probably not next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's an iterative process where
you need to take one step and then take
[SPEAKER_04]: another step to get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Prop 64 did not allow for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so part of what voters just voted on
included not having the public consumption
[SPEAKER_04]: that you referred to.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have the Assemblymember Bill
Quirkbill, which allows for use in more
[SPEAKER_04]: areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, there's that local control
component if the local, if the city agrees
[SPEAKER_04]: on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think people need to see that use
can occur beyond sort of personal use in
[SPEAKER_04]: your home and can occur at certain events,
for special events, and see that the world
[SPEAKER_04]: keeps turning and the sky doesn't fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you do a little bit more and then
the same thing happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you go in one big step all the way
to public consumption, then the fear
[SPEAKER_04]: mongers come out and the horror stories
come out and I think it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's a few years away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for coming here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've raised so many important points.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to just raise two.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a long time cannabis patient,
I'm losing my patience with being charged
[SPEAKER_02]: an exorbitant syntax for a medicine that I
actually really need.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not do sales in the black,
buy product from the black market anymore,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm one of those people and I'm a
long, I'm a cannabis trade journalist in
[SPEAKER_02]: this industry, but I can't afford it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to be, I'm going to go back
to narcotics or black market or nothing or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm kind of so upset about it that I
may become a full-time consumer activist
[SPEAKER_02]: on this subject because the tax regime,
the patchwork, the layering on,
[SPEAKER_02]: affects the entire food chain and the
entire cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say that as a comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to ask you about what is
called an extinction event.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have used that term in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that California's cannabis
legacy is in great part tied up in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future of the NorCal region.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've spent a lot of time up there talking
to farmers, covering it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, when people talk about an
extinction event, it's like a really
[SPEAKER_02]: serious term.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm curious what goes through your
mind when you hear that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm also curious if you have a sense
of where the legislature in general is at
[SPEAKER_02]: with the idea that this entire region may
go through what is being called an
[SPEAKER_02]: extinction event or what BDS Analytics
says will be three extinction events.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm curious what you think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also what the solutions are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe there was just a bill that would
have allowed farmers markets that wound up
[SPEAKER_02]: in suspense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there seem to be solutions that
will help those farmers, help that region,
[SPEAKER_02]: help the future of this state and
California's legacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two great points.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me take the first one first.
[SPEAKER_04]: First about medical patients and taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of where my heart has always
been in this discussion is with patients
[SPEAKER_04]: and with someone dealing with chronic pain
or a child dealing with seizures and
[SPEAKER_04]: making sure that they have access to the
medicine that helps them and makes them
[SPEAKER_04]: feel better and addresses their symptoms
and their challenges.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so to the extent that we have a tax
regime that makes it difficult for those
[SPEAKER_04]: patients to receive the medicine they
need, I'm very open-minded to making
[SPEAKER_04]: changes and taking action that can help
ensure that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a sales tax exemption for
card holders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's something, but it's not a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the extinction event, that worries
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's disturbing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes me anxious.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not something that we ever wanted
or intended.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's true, but the fact
that it's being discussed is a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we always wanted folks who had been
long time members of the industry who
[SPEAKER_04]: operated in the gray spaces because
California hadn't yet regulated or made it
[SPEAKER_04]: lawful to be able to migrate to the
regulated marketplace, to the lawful
[SPEAKER_04]: marketplace, to be able to embrace that
marketplace and be a successful
[SPEAKER_04]: participant in it for many years to come.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was always the idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the intent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the mom and pops, the small farms,
the growers that had been there for
[SPEAKER_04]: multi-generations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the fact that we're dealing with
that makes me want to talk to you more and
[SPEAKER_04]: figure out what we can do to avoid it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll stay afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you my card.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the time when we're preparing
our legislative package.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the time when we're actively
soliciting input and ideas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we introduce our bills early next
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to learn more from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe related to the extinction concept.
[SPEAKER_03]: If banking is not available, typically
what goes on is those businesses with
[SPEAKER_03]: larger resources and larger contacts are
able to get by and small businesses
[SPEAKER_03]: without banking just disappear and get
crushed.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some discussion this morning
about banking, the only way, most likely
[SPEAKER_03]: way that gets resolved in California is
that the federal issue has to get
[SPEAKER_03]: resolved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's pretty much no way forward
other than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if you agree, if you think
there are any other pathways to resolving,
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly for small business people in
California, to get banking support and be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to use banks in development of a
business which is required.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if the federal fix is the
only fix.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for a long time I've said that's the
best way we're going to address this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have tried and scratched our heads
and put pen to paper and imagined and
[SPEAKER_04]: reimagined other possibilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Credit unions, I know soon to be treasurer
Fiona Ma's been working on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Current treasurer John Chung's been
working on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Senator Hertzberg and I had a bill working
on this this past year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm open to the possibility of a creative
fix to it, but I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the best way, the cleanest
way, most impactful way is for the federal
[SPEAKER_04]: government to act.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's not easy to hear right now
given the constitution of the federal
[SPEAKER_04]: government and who's sitting in those
decision-making seats.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it doesn't mean that that's what the
future holds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't mean that things might change
this November and they might change again
[SPEAKER_04]: in two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So real change could be two years away in
an ideal world, but that doesn't create
[SPEAKER_04]: any comfort right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've always felt that the federal
government has to act.
[SPEAKER_04]: To really make it clean and to provide the
protections that businesses deserve.
[SPEAKER_04]: Having said that, I don't know all the
answers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you or others that you're working
with have a proposal that you think can
[SPEAKER_04]: work in the state of California,
I'm all ears.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if that can provide relief to
businesses that need it faster,
[SPEAKER_04]: then I think we should try.
[SPEAKER_05]: State-owned public banking, what do you
think about doing a public bank for
[SPEAKER_05]: California, which I think would be a way
to circumvent the federal restrictions in
[SPEAKER_05]: terms of getting banking and banking
cannabis businesses, cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think about the idea of doing
a California statewide public bank?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the statewide bank idea is a good
one generally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's tricky.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's South Dakota or North
Dakota.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think folks point to North Dakota.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot smaller, a lot different than
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even if we had a bank that allowed
cannabis proceeds and revenue to be banked
[SPEAKER_04]: in at a state bank, does it get FDIC
insurance?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the state provides something similar
in terms of that sort of insurance or
[SPEAKER_04]: guarantee.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then is it susceptible to a federal
raid in saying these are all, the federal
[SPEAKER_04]: government, in our eyes, this is all
criminal enterprise.
[SPEAKER_04]: The state of California, you might be a
state of California bank, but those
[SPEAKER_04]: revenues are, in our eyes, criminal
enterprise.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're gonna raid it and take it and
it's gonna be subject to forfeiture.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's something that this
president would love the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_04]: do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe there's ways to protect it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe there's ways around it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The state bank idea has come up many
times.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that Max has spent some
time analyzing and looking at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Others are as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's a way to do it from a policy
perspective, then I think, again,
[SPEAKER_04]: we should try.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think politically it's really difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest of the banking industry gets
really nervous when the idea of a state
[SPEAKER_04]: bank gets brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just curious if there's been any
talk or anybody's approached you around
[SPEAKER_00]: helping with some legislation around the
annual fees with BCC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at like $100,000 annual fee
once annual licenses become issued,
[SPEAKER_00]: which could be some time, which could move
into the next legislative session.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that, yes, you gotta recover
costs because of implementation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this first year, I mean,
there's some talk that it will come down
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not gonna cost that much to
continue regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But $100,000 annually is an unbelievable
amount of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if we do over $2.5 million a year,
as we do, it's still just a very huge
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of money annually to be paying an
agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you pay that for a liquor license,
but you can sell that liquor license in
[SPEAKER_00]: ten years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we need legislation to help
operators make that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious if you've heard of
anything or if you would support that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've definitely heard of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we were talking about taxes and sort
of this three-year moratorium on the
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation tax and the reduction in the
excise tax, part of the conversation
[SPEAKER_04]: included why not help with the licensing
fees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are very burdensome as well,
and maybe some relief there could help.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that's an area where we can
explore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe because the tax approach didn't work
this year, maybe the licensing fee
[SPEAKER_04]: approach could work next year with some
reduction, some relief to our businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm open to it, and I think that that's an
area that we should explore and see if we
[SPEAKER_04]: can make it work to help our responsible,
compliant businesses be successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it.
