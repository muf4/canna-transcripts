[SPEAKER_01]: Because I gotta catch it playing,
but you guys just finished a presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're obviously talking blue mats,
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to take it away?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we just finished this presentation
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's been quite the weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Peter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been great hanging out this weekend
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to clip him in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just finished this presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really like a joint
presentation between the three of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is Cooper Didier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think he's been on the show yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's Upaya Garden Solutions on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is Izzy Becker.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's also with us too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all actually work together at
Sustainable Village.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think Izzy's been on one of these
shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it was this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a different one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the three of us were co-workers and
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we spent a lot of time hanging out and
talking about irrigation and soil
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much to the chagrin of our significant
others and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, far more than we probably should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of it's had to do with the blue
mat irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of excited to sit with you guys
and talk about it in this format.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what we just did in this moment,
in this presentation we did, we just did a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole presentation on how to measure soil
moisture, how to use that data to
[SPEAKER_02]: influence irrigation events, and then how
to actually use moisture sensors like
[SPEAKER_02]: tensiometers to control actual irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of the gist of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can kind of go into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We basically talk about tensiometers.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are these things, Izzy?
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, a tensiometer is one of the
simplest and most accurate ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still widely used in most research
laboratories to this day and in most
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural irrigation controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, it's a ceramic tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a body that has water in it and it's
a vacuum gauge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil is constantly in a state of vacuum or
water in soil because it likes to stick to
[SPEAKER_00]: itself and stick to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always pulling on itself and
pulling on the soil and it makes this
[SPEAKER_00]: vacuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more water there is, the weaker the
vacuum because there's more of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The less water there is, the stronger the
vacuum because there's less of it and it
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of gets really tightly stuck and is
really pulling on itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is measuring, it's called water
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as opposed to measuring volumetric
water content, which is the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: water in the pore spaces, it is measuring
the availability of water to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A way that I've often seen these described
in the university setting is it's a dummy
[SPEAKER_00]: root.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially what this experiences is
what a root experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever that vacuum is, let's say 50
millibars, the plant has to exert an equal
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of force to get the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that vacuum is stronger than the
plant can pull on, it can't get any water,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if there's water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the amount of water isn't
really as important as how much work the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has to do to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what a tensiometer is
measuring.
[SPEAKER_02]: There, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are wonderkins.
[SPEAKER_04]: YouTube famous.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other part is we talk about
tensiometers and we've been talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: how to get them to control irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course that leads us to blue mats.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did a whole chunk of the
presentation on blue mats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like it's important and could
be really useful to people that might be
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing this to talk about the aspects of
blue mat irrigation that we did today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because part of what we called it,
we were like, this is advanced blue mat
[SPEAKER_02]: education or like the blue mat
masterclass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I mean, you know, over at
sustainable village, we've got this
[SPEAKER_02]: office, we've got like R and D spaces
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all have like home facilities where we
do work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And test for things and experiment and
play around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over the last year, like Hooper came
to work, when were you here?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about a year ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right first week of February, last 2022.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you came to work with us in February
too, but you've been in the industry for a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've been using blue mats for a
couple of years before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, this is how we get our
employees.
[SPEAKER_04]: Michael turned me on, pitched me back in
2018 or something like that maybe before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like all the other people,
kind of like the light bulb goes off and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're like, well, that sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: A moisture sensing valve and the plants
water themselves, I'm in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, then you get some and
you play with them and you start the
[SPEAKER_04]: process of trying to figure them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, yeah, I've been here for a year
and I think we've made some really big
[SPEAKER_04]: strides.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the understanding of the product,
how to use it, and how to get really,
[SPEAKER_04]: really good results.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I want to say about blue mats is
it's a very common experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also was using blue mats a lot longer
than I worked here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine showed me them in
college.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was running around watering a bunch of
different plants in different locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all my friends and partners were
always mad at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, this will save your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't use them for years after
volume, but eventually I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did do exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He described.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the thing that most people who
use blue mats is they get them and they
[SPEAKER_00]: love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's there's a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a process of sort of like
it's like an art and a science.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sort of have to learn how to feel
them, how to fiddle with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that we've really been
trying to approach is how do we make this
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible to everybody and anybody with
little to no learning curve and no need to
[SPEAKER_00]: run through trials and errors to actually
have a lot of success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to do that, we've really been
working at R&D, developing SOPs and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: things to make the process easier for
everybody and accessible to anyone who
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to use them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the process really started for me
by taking one apart and seeing how simple
[SPEAKER_04]: it really is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just kind of applying how you want to
show the parts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just a ceramic tip on a tube,
just like this tensiometer here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Has a diaphragm that this vacuum created
here is able to act on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the rest of this cap is
adjustable and you can set a moisture
[SPEAKER_04]: level how far how much vacuum needs to be
pulled before it will turn on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, once I sort of got a look at
how simple it was, it really kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: started the journey to to kind of realize
getting to the bottom of all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this thing, there's only so much
that can happen here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not very complicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's all the other things and how you
use and apply them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny, too, how we kind of came
to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really was like you in particular
that really cracked the code on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with a lot of support from this
one as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like this summer, this guy Eckhart
came to this house and they're like the
[SPEAKER_02]: owners of blue masks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that Austria is we don't make these
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We import these from Austria.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he came and he kind of gave us they do
things different way differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all geared towards really,
really simple applications, household
[SPEAKER_02]: gardens and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The shit we do with them is so much
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he gave us a couple of little
interesting you made a few interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: comments about how some people dial in
carrots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really got interest.
[SPEAKER_04]: He talked about people in Germany and
hotels dialing thousands of cares,
[SPEAKER_04]: pre setting them and and stick in their
fancy house plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were landscaping our our jaws
dropped and we were like, wait,
[SPEAKER_04]: pre setting a carrot.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to not have to be, you know,
fussing and hitting, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: hit that desired moisture level first
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and the key to that turns out to be,
you know, keeping this diaphragm at
[SPEAKER_00]: setting this diaphragm at rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I think is is
really funny to watch Cooper work on these
[SPEAKER_00]: types of things is he always grabs it with
his hands and he's sort of like rubbing it
[SPEAKER_00]: and moving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the real thing was they were
like, OK, we're setting these carrots in a
[SPEAKER_00]: glass of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when the light bulb switch and
like, oh, you're setting it at zero action
[SPEAKER_00]: on the diaphragm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Cooper was just sort of like
holding it in his hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see him like grabbing it and like
moving his hands all over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he just set it without the bottom
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he was like, wait a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not you can't have less action
than no action.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so by action, we mean like
on this rubber part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, yeah, on this, this thing,
this I mean, I don't know if you see it
[SPEAKER_02]: here, but this pushes in and it's
basically as the soil is drying out,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's creating a vacuum on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's sucking this valve down,
sucking this little pinch point down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's tension.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we set the thing without any of
that pressure, we can get consistency from
[SPEAKER_02]: carrot to carrot to carrot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's precise and exact because it's all
set to atmospheric pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's important we just jump
right in and like show this technique
[SPEAKER_02]: right kind of the beginning of this this
talk here, because this is what we want
[SPEAKER_02]: people to know about.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want people to know how to do this
because every time someone has flooded a
[SPEAKER_02]: bed or flooded a pot, like there's only a
handful of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's about five things that could have
gone wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we've done over the last year has
been like, what are those five things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here are precise troubleshooting tips for
all those different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's basically, I think we're
really close to just being completely
[SPEAKER_02]: covered on all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're, I think we're, I think
we're going to like release something on
[SPEAKER_00]: the website about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the six, ways are of avoiding
flooding, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How to not fuck up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is it's a, I'm very guilty of it
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really like I'm a terrible Baker
because I hate perfectly following every
[SPEAKER_00]: instruction.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it feels arbitrary, Austrians are not
arbitrary people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that is in the instructions is
there for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many reasons I thought they
weren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there has never been one part of the
instructions that we didn't find was
[SPEAKER_00]: actually very important once figuring out
why.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's just do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how do we dial in carrots now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what is the best practice for dialing
in a carrot?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the way we would do it now is just
to gather all your tops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've taken the bottoms off,
the bottoms go into a bucket of water and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're just sitting there soaking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we're going to, in your system,
tee off and attach and pressurize the
[SPEAKER_04]: system and start to attach these.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're kind of talking about,
you know, basically you can set up a
[SPEAKER_02]: little rig, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you take the pressure reducer that
you're actually going to be using for your
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, cause they, there's some
variation with those pressure reducers,
[SPEAKER_02]: FYI.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not all like exactly 15 mil,
15 PSI.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing, we don't let them,
we don't, we test them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't let them in the warehouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a little bit anyways, just use the same
pressure reducer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that you're going to be using in that
particular room, you set it up,
[SPEAKER_02]: run some like eight mil tubing off of it,
put an eight millimeter by three
[SPEAKER_02]: millimeter tee on that and a valve at each
end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just have this little chunk of,
of a, I usually pick, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, I usually pick you to the first
pot or the first bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'll do is like, if you've already
run out all your tubing, you pick the very
[SPEAKER_00]: first pot, there's going to be a tee
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just disconnect the tubing and add a
little piece of tubing with a valve right
[SPEAKER_00]: after it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're describing two different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like one, you can either, you can either
build out all your supply line and then
[SPEAKER_02]: just run it off that, which actually
probably the best way to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, or if you just want to do it
like standing, you know, like next to the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the hose bit bib or wherever your water
comes in, you could just, you could build
[SPEAKER_02]: a little rig yourself with the pressure
reducer and a short piece of, of a tubing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you love your back is basically the
answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it like do it somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's somewhere to it's comfortable to sit
for.
[SPEAKER_04]: It may be easier to do it one way or the
other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but the important part is to be on the
pressure of your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one at a time and yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then one at a time, take these caps,
find the hanging drip and then close it
[SPEAKER_04]: one or two triangles, depending on what do
you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Find the hanging drip.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the hanging drip is the point where
water flows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water's gushing out, just shooting out in
the street.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've just got water coming out and you'll
close it and it will start to slow that
[SPEAKER_04]: stream until eventually you'll find the
point where it stops and you can catch a
[SPEAKER_04]: little droplet on the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know that a little bit more open
that droplet grows and falls off a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit more close.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've, you found that point where the
exact point comes out of the edge of the
[SPEAKER_02]: tube and hangs there and does not fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the hanging drip.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's going to be, you know,
very precise point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Funny story.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever try to like, we've done these
things in Spanish language, trying to get
[SPEAKER_02]: the right translation for hanging drip is
tricky.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anybody out there that's, you know,
fluent Spanish that has a really good
[SPEAKER_02]: description of hanging drip, I'd love to
hear what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once you found that point, you then
make your adjustment closed from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: One or two triangles, depending on your
system's backend pressure, which we've now
[SPEAKER_04]: have a graph that'll give you a target.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll know starting off, whether you
want to let's shoot for one or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's pick one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we're at 15 PSI.
[SPEAKER_04]: At 15 PSI, you're going to go two
triangles close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where will that take you?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's going to take you to a hundred
M bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where does one take you?
[SPEAKER_04]: One's going to take you to 50 M bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where does zero take you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Zero is zero.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hanging drip is going to be full runoff
that more than likely at 15 PSI,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to have water coming out of
that pot.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at 15 PSI with, if we dial that back
two triangles, like, which is in a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: the instructions up to this point,
you dial that back two triangles at 15
[SPEAKER_02]: PSI, that is going to put a really,
in basic in like high porosity soils,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to put you right at a hundred
millibars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, if the backend pressure is two
PSI, like on a gravity system,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to put you at about 150
millibars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a line between those two
points, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 PSI, a hundred millibars, two PSI,
150 millibars.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a direct line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that line graph is accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anywhere between that, if we're looking
at seven PSI, we're going to be at like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what do we say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a hundred and twenty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A hundred and twenty five.
[SPEAKER_04]: A hundred and twenty millibars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's this direct correlation between
the backend pressure and the moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: level of the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, once you've chosen, once you
know where you want to go on that,
[SPEAKER_04]: then you can take this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The water will be shut off at that point
through the kit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can lock it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now this will always be set in your
system to that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what would you recommend them doing it
before they actually lock it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is something I do and I
recommend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, it's a really helpful tool
to take a Sharpie and mark on the top of
[SPEAKER_04]: the cap against this.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like a fin here on the kit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that tells you where the settings at.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you mark with the Sharpie where
that setting is, now you'll know if,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you turn around and turn back,
you know that you set it and then it's
[SPEAKER_04]: right at the same in case you bump it and
then you can lock it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that'll just show you later when you
take this cap off, you'll know whether you
[SPEAKER_04]: accidentally just bumped it or moved it
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can still find that same point.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the locking cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just like, yeah, these are on
the website or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like these little plastic caps.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I guess we got a few of them
sitting here, but, you know, they snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been around for a while,
but we just, people don't use them as
[SPEAKER_02]: much.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just snap onto that and locks it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means that like when you're,
you know, you can't bump it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, whatever, like a squirrel
comes into your greenhouse or your chop
[SPEAKER_02]: and drop and cover drop or your employee
walks up and tries to mess with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're not going to be able to,
because it's all set and dialed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now that cap, that now that it's
locked, set, this thing, you can just,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's at 15 PSI, that's a hundred
millibars every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put, you can put one, you can put
a nine inch base on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put a five inch base on it,
whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's still going to produce that same
moisture level.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, where the tip is, where this tip
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, like between rounds,
you can take this off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You set these off to the side,
you put your bottoms in a bucket of water
[SPEAKER_02]: and store them, but that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can, you can dial six of these like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can dial 60, you can dial 600,
you can dial 6,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this, the idea of doing like a
thousand carrots in a thousand pots
[SPEAKER_02]: previously, it's not like we haven't done
it, but it's kind of, it was kind of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, there's definitely going to be some
funny things going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I don't, I don't have any problem with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's the same thing from pot to pot
to pot to pot, complete consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's crazy that we've like hit this
and then come through this journey and
[SPEAKER_02]: found that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other things to keep
consistency is once this is set and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know that the setting on the blue mats is
exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only a couple other factors that
can now affect the blue mat and where that
[SPEAKER_00]: setting lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess one last little thing I want
to put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I often like doing is actually
marking the hanging drip and two triangles
[SPEAKER_00]: with a little marker, because you never
want to open it past the hanging drip
[SPEAKER_00]: ever, or you're guaranteed to flood
because it's now open, which is a concept
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think is, I've had to explain a lot
of times to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, if you only ever closed it two
triangles back past hanging drip,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you opened it two triangles,
trying to get it wetter, you are now open.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no longer closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you opened a ball valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will never turn off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like you'll never go drier than two
triangles and you'll never go wetter than
[SPEAKER_00]: the hanging drip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I often like to draw those two lines
because you always know you're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: between those two points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from there, then the only thing that's
affecting... Let's just do it step by
[SPEAKER_00]: step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after this, this is set.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've now got all these here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got all these in a bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just put them together underwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I like to do is just take my
thumb and rub this little area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Massage those three holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get any little air bubbles out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really matter if there's like
tiny little air bubbles in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry about the pipette.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just use your thumb to just put to push it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found over time that while it does have
an effect, it's a small enough one that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not important.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just put these together
underwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now you've got a bucket with
these all put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take them back over to your
system, which hopefully has all the tubing
[SPEAKER_00]: laid out or do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just connect them in place
and they're already set.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just want to make sure that that soil
as well as it's evenly watered and not
[SPEAKER_04]: hydrophobic.
Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's jump into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a couple of other little
troubleshooting things of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: how do I screw up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's some of the ways you might
screw up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry pockets and peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry pockets and peat.
[SPEAKER_02]: No hydrophobic peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of times that people have
reached out and they're like, my blue
[SPEAKER_00]: mat's acting weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just won't turn off or it won't turn on
and the whole bed's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always just tell them to start checking
their moisture meter around those areas or
[SPEAKER_00]: even just feeling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very common for it to just be
wildly different moisture readings all
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can just feel that there's these
dry pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because when it gets really dry,
it gets hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to re-wet it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure everyone's had it where their
soil is really dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're watering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks wet, but you lift up like a
centimeter of it and it's still as dry as
[SPEAKER_00]: can be underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's literally coming at the bottom of
the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's re-wetting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with soil beds, that's really tough
because you can't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't visually look in the bed and
make sure that it's all wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just using surfactants, mixing it up
beforehand, just never letting it go dry
[SPEAKER_00]: ideally with something like a blue mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just anything like that will really help
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be consistent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or when you're filling your bed,
not filling it to the top before you start
[SPEAKER_04]: to moisten that soil can be helpful as
well, just to be putting in a six inch
[SPEAKER_04]: layer and getting that wet and then
putting in another six inch layer and
[SPEAKER_04]: getting that wet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because getting an 18 inch bed
consistently wet from that just doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to try to do it with your
blue mat system.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I see a lot of people do is put a
bunch of dry peat-based soil in a pot and
[SPEAKER_02]: they set up their blue mats and they just
want to crank them open and try to get the
[SPEAKER_02]: blue soak to put enough water down on the
bed to hydrate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will take weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can harm your blue soak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to use a regular garden hose or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like Cooper's saying, you layer it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody that's rehydrated soil in pots has
probably learned this through trial and
[SPEAKER_02]: error.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in case you haven't, learn from our
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go through, put six inches of soil down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take your garden hose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit it hard with water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a lot of water in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another six inches in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stack it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And be mixing it and making sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mixing and watering at the same time is
very effective.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's less of a pain in the ass than
chasing it for the next month or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in a big bed, like in like a four
foot wide, even like a four by eight or
[SPEAKER_02]: like a four by 20 bed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two hundred or a hundred.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beds going out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There can be dry pockets that exist there
for months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might describe it as the number one
problem that most people can face with
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil because I've been living in
soil for a long time and I always would
[SPEAKER_00]: run into these weird random issues in the
past when I was doing hand watering where
[SPEAKER_00]: everything would be amazing and all of a
sudden stuff's really weird and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started to realize over time if I
just left that bed for too long and it got
[SPEAKER_00]: super dry and then I came back in and
watered it, I could never get it right
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think being able to keep consistent
moisture in living soil beds might
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigate what, at least for me,
has been the most common problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people are afraid of like compaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of people think that like
loose fluffiness when they first fill a
[SPEAKER_04]: bed is like good and they want that level
of aeration.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just don't think anything wants that
level of variation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well a plant is the acre itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to compact that kind of
soil as long as it's moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least in a short time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you're like dumping crazy amounts
of water from like five feet up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for months and months and
months.
[SPEAKER_02]: The compaction issues are when it becomes
hydrophobic and it's like a brick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't get the water to penetrate
inside of it because it's actually
[SPEAKER_02]: repelling water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perlite makes that not happen also.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's perlite in there it will resist
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think people shouldn't be afraid of,
you know, you don't want to leach any of
[SPEAKER_04]: your, you know, amendments out or whatever
or any of your nutrition away.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think anything short of that is good
to that first time get that media as,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, as wet and compact as you kind
of can.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna help make that system operate
properly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And consistently for much longer and a lot
easier, faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that then, Kim, takes us to
the next thing, which is really important,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a tight seal around the blue mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue mat is a physical tool,
which means it's not sensor, it's not like
[SPEAKER_00]: an electronic sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water has to get to the cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the analog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally analog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mechanical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what that means is if there's not
tight soil around the sensor, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: like really up against it, the water is
not gonna wick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is the less of what,
the less media that's up against it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the slower it's going to react.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water will still wick and find
equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always does.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's no longer gonna happen at these
favorable speeds where the system's really
[SPEAKER_00]: reactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like having a single piece of
perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think some people think having like
just like a piece of pumice against your
[SPEAKER_00]: tensiometer is gonna make the thing flood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are more reliable than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it will do is make that sensor
less accurate than the rest of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've always done is just taken some
of my soil mix and just removed any big,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if you've got big pumice,
anything like that, I'll just take like a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple gallon pot, fill it up with soil
mix, pick anything big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little tiny chunks don't really matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like doing the same soil mix just
so it remains the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing with peat is if that pocket
of peat goes hydrophobic, now you've
[SPEAKER_00]: really got a hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's unlikely because you're
putting such a, you know, like I always
[SPEAKER_02]: take it, take it and you like jam it in
there and make a hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you take like a handful of that
loose, like pure cocoa repeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You throw it in there and then you stick
the carrot in and that creates this like
[SPEAKER_02]: very thin, like sheath.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of that pure mix around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just have like nice, solid,
like consistent mounting of the carrot tip
[SPEAKER_02]: into the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I just want to like say
though is it's like, I wouldn't be afraid
[SPEAKER_00]: of like, if you've got pro mix,
I run my carrot in 50% perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It mixes and it's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not little bits that matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's those really big, coarse chunks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never personally run into that
problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't either.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a real thing though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I've always done to kind of
ensure like this thing seeded well is
[SPEAKER_04]: don't be afraid to water around it once to
get like that smaller particle size.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just firm in like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just as a side note, like on products
like this, like these come in like 48 inch
[SPEAKER_02]: ones, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're using like orchards and things
where they want to know like what is the
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture level four feet down in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are soils that are like clay and
rock and like all kinds of, who knows
[SPEAKER_02]: what's down in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like you're burrowing into the
earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they use an auger drill and they drill
down four feet with like a, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a big, like big ass drill bit on like
a, on a hand drill, pull out a column and
[SPEAKER_02]: then they, and then they take that and
they make a slurry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take that stuff and they mix it in a
bucket of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make mud out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make a mud out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you pour that slurry back down
into the hole and then you jam this thing
[SPEAKER_02]: down in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's completely coated in that mud and
that'll dry out over time, but it'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like setting it in cement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to, it's going to make us like
a really firm connection to that,
[SPEAKER_02]: to that tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I like to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about the tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I've seen also that's
really interesting about the, the blue,
[SPEAKER_00]: the low tension version of the aerometer
tips and also blue mat 10 similar tips is
[SPEAKER_00]: the more porous, the ceramic, the more
reactive it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are tuned for low tension soils,
meaning that they can move water in and
[SPEAKER_00]: out really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very sensitive instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so now we've gone through it
step by step.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, first thing you're, you're
setting your care on the caps,
[SPEAKER_00]: no action on the diaphragm that's in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all set the same because they're
at the same set point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, putting them in your carrots,
putting them in, making sure there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: really good seal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing that's really important,
this is the other way to affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: setting of a blue mat is where the water
comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this sort of leads into any system
where you're relying on sensors to
[SPEAKER_00]: automate, which really is the future of
most systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems at this point, you need
consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a carrot with the tubing
this far out, that water is going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: down to here really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to shut it off really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have the water coming out over
here, now it has to spread out from this
[SPEAKER_00]: far away point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to shut off much slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I like to describe it is that
the setting on the blue mat decides when
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing turns on and off technically,
but the water where it's coming out
[SPEAKER_00]: decides how quickly it turns off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might turn off when the tip here is
always going to turn off, let's say that
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 millibars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the water is coming out way over
here, this area of your pot or bed might
[SPEAKER_00]: be really wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time it actually gets to the blue
mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be really cognizant of
setting all your blue mats with the water
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out at the same point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with water distribution being very
even, manifolds are one way we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that, if you want to talk about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, the manifolds are like,
they're a layout.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, you know, water comes through one
of these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, your caps dialed,
they're buried, soil dries out,
[SPEAKER_02]: dries out the tip, creates a vacuum,
opens the valve, and then water is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to flow through, you know, through this
tube and start dripping out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's going to go into a series of
distribution drippers, or it's going to go
[SPEAKER_02]: into some sort of water distribution
array.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more often than not, in large
container applications, we're doing that
[SPEAKER_02]: with some sort of soaker hose,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one kind of soaker hose in
particular, which we call blue soak,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is basically, it's like a Tyvek
soaker hose that operates at, it gives,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really cool because you know,
the reason we use that is because it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: product that gives uniform water
distribution over long distances at
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely low pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're talking like, like sub one
PSI, we can get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And any other kind of like drip tape or
whatever, and we've been through this and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, we just like haven't dialed it
in, we haven't found it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like anything with drip emitters in it,
it's like, we were looking at like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you need like seven to 10 PSI to hit
uniform distribution throughout that
[SPEAKER_02]: tubing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, you know, that's the reason
we're using, that's why we've gone with
[SPEAKER_02]: this blue soak material and had it
manufactured and done this thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: is because we can get that uniform
distribution at really, really low
[SPEAKER_02]: pressures, which are the pressure ranges
that we're operating on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really special product in its own
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just as cool as blue mats are,
because you can really gravity irrigate
[SPEAKER_00]: huge areas of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, how I first found sustainable
village, not just blue mats, ironically,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know I was buying them from
sustainable village, because when I first
[SPEAKER_00]: bought them, I just thought it was blue
mats, but is using blue soak over like
[SPEAKER_00]: these really long distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was trying to irrigate for like
permaculture reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, just really actually super cool
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that is, there's, there is some ways
to apply that to like large acreage
[SPEAKER_02]: applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like one thing we do is like, we do these
really cool, large scale permaculture
[SPEAKER_02]: installations.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of like super wealthy people
around Boulder County, where we live that
[SPEAKER_02]: want to have these like beautiful hobby
farms and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we work, there's some great
permaculture designers in the area and we
[SPEAKER_02]: work hand in hand with them to do the
irrigation portions of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's like a fun,
lucky for me, part of this job and this
[SPEAKER_02]: role we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: But definitely that's a side point.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we do on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess back to the final point of
it is when you're doing water
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution, make sure it's all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have manifolds or laying out in
your beds, make sure they're all laid out
[SPEAKER_00]: the exact same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you place your blue mats,
place your blue mats all in exactly the
[SPEAKER_00]: same place in relation to, to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've sort of landed on three to four
inches away from the soaker table.
[SPEAKER_00]: The short one we like three, the longer
one you can do more like four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instructions generally say three because
it's sort of one number that works for
[SPEAKER_00]: both very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can play around with it a little
bit, but be careful because if you move it
[SPEAKER_00]: too far away from the tape, no matter what
the blue mat set to, you can still
[SPEAKER_00]: overwater the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that understanding the water
release and the sensor as a pair really
[SPEAKER_00]: helps you understand like how they
actually work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I guess now we're getting to the
pressure, which is the final bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is the fun part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is, this is, this is where it
gets really kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the real like masterclass part of
it is that, so now that we have this
[SPEAKER_02]: chart, right, we have like at 15 PSI,
it's in two hanging drips here at a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred millibars and at two PSI at two
hanging drips here on 150, 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's now you have this like continuous,
like it's not even a curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically a straight line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what happens is if we're able to
adjust the pressure, the backend pressure
[SPEAKER_02]: on a preset carrot that's already set in a
bed, in a pot, operating, irrigating,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can very precisely manipulate the
moisture level of the soil, not just in
[SPEAKER_02]: one pop, but like uniformly from,
for every container in the whole,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the whole room or greenhouse or field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can bring that moisture level down
consistently by adjusting the backend
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure and like, or up, or up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially we are now in total control of
soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the past, the way we blue mats have
always sort of been set is you set them to
[SPEAKER_00]: one point and you leave them there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which works really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's like the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It adapts the microclimates adapts the
rainy days and cloudy days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sunny days and big plants and little
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's sort of, yeah, the promise of
the system and why it's so special.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now we can move them through plant
stages with different watering
[SPEAKER_04]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just at a friend's house and,
and I was explaining to him, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: with a, with pressure set, he can,
he can go ahead and transplant into his
[SPEAKER_04]: veg containers and run a certain pressure
and be wetter during veg and then move
[SPEAKER_04]: into his flower room, set at a different
pressure, never having to touch the
[SPEAKER_04]: carrots and just by moving from the one
pressure zone into the other pressure
[SPEAKER_04]: zone, deliver a different moisture level
to those same plants without ever having
[SPEAKER_04]: to touch the sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the key thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think one of the biggest barriers
to blue mats at scale before this,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in hydro and any type of
thing, just like, you know, many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many, many carrots in small pots has been,
if you want to change the moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: content, you have to change the dial on
every single one of them, which it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with like 10 carrots,
it takes you two or three minutes with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 50, it's a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of a sudden you get into
thousands of carrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be spending a whole day changing
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every one you set is a part where an
employee can set them off by a triangle or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you can affect the setting on all
the blue mats that are tied to that
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure reducer in your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with these really high flow rates,
we can tie many, many blue mats to a
[SPEAKER_00]: single reducer from one point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can SOP what that, what that
pressure is to then deliver those moisture
[SPEAKER_04]: levels that you, that you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can say, Hey, we're running those
beds at 12 PSI and you'll be delivering a
[SPEAKER_04]: certain moisture level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can say on these beds over here,
we're going to be at eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be a dryer setting across
that whole zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's really cool opportunity for
different applications and ways to use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really exciting to be,
see, you know, it's, I think we're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to pretty rapidly be implementing these
systems and getting to see the results.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it's really, it's a good time to
be into blue mats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one thing that I think is really
interesting that has been making me think
[SPEAKER_00]: about this a lot is one of the biggest
difficulties that multi-state operators
[SPEAKER_00]: face is getting the same product out of
facilities that are in different states or
[SPEAKER_00]: even different locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have one up in the mountain,
like in Colorado, you've got plains,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got mountains, you've got deserts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have two facilities that are only
an hour apart and they're completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different climate zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that does affect even an indoor
facility and definitely a greenhouse and
[SPEAKER_00]: most definitely outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what that means is everywhere that
you're growing is going to have these
[SPEAKER_00]: different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes it really hard to get the
product consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that about setting tensiometers,
letting them control your pots is they
[SPEAKER_00]: make the moisture in the pot exactly the
same pot to pot, no matter what the HVAC
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, no matter what conditions
you're under, everything might change.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have like the greatest,
you know, windstorm or the sun is 120
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the moisture content will not
change in those pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it allows you to create more
consistent conditions between multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, and SOP and cultivars and their
likes and dislikes and things to the
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunity to really, really control soil
moisture level on a level down to within
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 millibars of a target.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, in the world of irrigation
control, it's not something that's managed
[SPEAKER_00]: to be done before.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, so I don't know if you guys,
I mean, you guys know about this,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like there's, there, you know,
in the world of drip irrigation,
[SPEAKER_02]: right, there's like maybe five major
manufacturers and they're all like really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have like, you have Netafim and
Rivulus and Iritech and Jane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now Jane and Rivulus are the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Rivulus bought Jane, except for
their India operations or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, you know, you got these,
you got a few big manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's a ton of like Chinese
companies that, you know, don't
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily have names anybody would
recognize.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these main manufacturers, they're all
the same parts, all the same pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, and they're great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like drip irrigation is far from a water
conservation point of view.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's energy issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: That go alongside of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from water conservation point of view,
it's a really wonderful technology,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're still limited in their ability
to control their events based on real time
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture level, soil moisture level data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of blows my mind that there
hasn't been more research because these
[SPEAKER_02]: are multi-billion dollar industries that
they haven't put more into this or done
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really aren't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're, like the stuff we're doing is
like sitting right on the cutting edge of
[SPEAKER_02]: like the most hyper efficient watering
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not, I mean, it's like,
yeah, everybody likes to talk about how
[SPEAKER_02]: cool they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, it, it really is like
what's happening here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it blows my mind that we're the ones
doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've always been really popular in
urban agriculture, I would say,
[SPEAKER_00]: like gardening, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, my whole house is like a giant
garden basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use them in everything, but it opens
up a whole new realm of possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, yeah, basically any container
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's like a 50, 60 year old
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the answer to your question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the blue mats that we're using
now, they work really effectively because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're so sensitive in container growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's where we really like to see
this particular product go into.
[SPEAKER_02]: So raised beds, pots, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely some sort of like native like
soil applications, but it's, it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: using like, like more beefy, heavy duty
tensiometers that actually control
[SPEAKER_02]: electrical switches because that's what
you really, you kind of do need that to
[SPEAKER_02]: run scale, to run at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, when I say scale,
I'm talking like hundreds of acres,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the flow rates, the pressures that
are involved in that, it's like heavy
[SPEAKER_02]: duty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all engineered.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, we mess around in that world.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do, we do projects that big,
but it's, it's just not as honed in as
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd think it would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of those things that you look
at, like whatever, like climate change,
[SPEAKER_02]: the world's falling apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if we like smart people don't like
step up and fix things, we're all fucked,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I think is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like this is something that I think
needs more like resources in the areas,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like, and just, and just energy
put into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's starting to coming from
just one, it's one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like one thing among many,
like how do we produce electricity and how
[SPEAKER_02]: do we do all this other stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, you know, like how do we
conserve water and use water to like as
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiently as possible?
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be really exciting to think that
like, you know, weed growing, cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: dudes playing around with blue mats could
maybe make an effect on some of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the thing is they always have.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing about cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like cannabis growers have always
been the most advanced gardeners in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they've always had the money and the
resources and the time and the space and
[SPEAKER_02]: the scale, like the smaller scale that
they're working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you know, it's of course like,
remember Izzy back in the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: if somebody was like making $4,000 a
pound, it did what, it's not that hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow a pound of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and you make $4,000 for it and if
you do that a lot, you have a big pile of
[SPEAKER_02]: money and you have a lot of money to play
with and you can really test things and do
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And chase funny ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and like, chase funny ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the cutting edge of like M&D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chaos to like try this experimental
product that they've never heard of
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how we kind of got started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we, you know, we got more
experience and they got more experience
[SPEAKER_02]: and everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's like weed world's not $4,000 a
pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're like, you know, a 10th of that is in
so a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the point is like, you know,
you have to get efficient to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cannabis producers, especially like
under black market conditions,
[SPEAKER_02]: like pushed a lot of boundaries that gave
that I get a lot of data to us and to
[SPEAKER_02]: other people and to other technologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I mean, that's just,
they were the best funded gardeners for a
[SPEAKER_02]: long time and had money to burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so cool stuff happened as a result.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to think of LED lighting as a
really good example of that just because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, working in, I've worked in this
really state of the art greenhouse at CU
[SPEAKER_00]: Boulder and everything was like super,
super, super state of the art,
[SPEAKER_00]: except for the lights were all HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had these like unbelievably expensive
systems in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of my friends growing in their
weed closet, like growing in their closets
[SPEAKER_00]: had like far more advanced lights than
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This multi-million dollar funded,
you know, university research center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, people don't catch on
until a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you compare that to like an onion
farmer or like, you know, like corn
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers, like they're like, their margins
are just like razor thin.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got to do everything as cheaply as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not taking risks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not doing things to really push
the envelope unless they're getting some
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of federal funding to do an
experiment, which that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, greenhouse is where
you see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've been finding a bunch of
tensiometer research from like the 80s and
[SPEAKER_00]: 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not like a novel concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like people haven't been doing it
in a research setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just.
It.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never really been adopted like into
scale, which is really interesting because
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been finding all these reports from
decades and decades ago about 120 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: water saving, 66 percent increases on
efficiency in tomato greenhouses where
[SPEAKER_00]: these things have always been there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're not starting at like flood
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're starting at a highly efficient,
highly efficient irrigation, highly
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people don't realize how much of the
irrigation in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least, is still flood irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think really it has to get done by
necessity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see a lot of like these Austrian
products and these products coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their labor prices are so high that
they've always had to sort of lead an
[SPEAKER_00]: automation because they can't afford to
pay all these people with these high labor
[SPEAKER_00]: rates, where the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: is always sort of like brute force.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and rely on like cheap labor pools
from like, you know, marginalized
[SPEAKER_02]: populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, you know, getting getting
really good tools can make like a big
[SPEAKER_00]: impact, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long story short, and we're seeing like a
lot of cool movement in that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing, I guess, just to talk on the
applications that you can do with moving
[SPEAKER_00]: the moisture contents around with
pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I know it's a buzzword,
but I'm just talking about crop searing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crop searing to me is just targeted
irrigation events.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a thing for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Came out of the tomato world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the concept of using certain
moisture contents at certain times as a
[SPEAKER_00]: way of enacting stress on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because crop searing is not just about
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about all the factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But water is a really common way of doing
it to influence certain plant responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, in a really simplistic way
of looking at it, veg is like hot and
[SPEAKER_00]: humid, lots of irrigation events,
much wetter soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower, you might want to start
influencing the plant with some stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not to say you make your plants
grow in these like stress conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of like you're introducing them
to the concept that there is scarcity in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a plant that's only ever gotten like
the perfect conditions all the time is
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of just like it's a spoiled child.
[SPEAKER_00]: It thinks there's unlimited resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like you don't give them the
resources, but it's like taking that kid
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have that doesn't realize
everything you're doing for them and like
[SPEAKER_00]: just giving them like a taste that there
is a difficult world out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's one thing that's really cool
with these blue mats is it's a really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really effective way of crop steering or
being the ability to move these moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: contents around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the one thing with a lot of
steering is it's targeted drybacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're purposely drying out your
media, the problem is if not everything's
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the same and you're in your
moisture in your containers, then you
[SPEAKER_00]: might dry a lot of them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to dry them as far as you
possibly can before things get rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens if they're not all the
same?
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a fair number of those might
actually get pushed over the point where
[SPEAKER_00]: now they're really getting messed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this forces the moisture content to
stay static where you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like, oh, I've pushed it to
this dryness level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm moving it wet again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might still be irrigating the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just irrigating more and less to hold
that moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know you're going to stay at 150 as
long as you're at 150.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you're going to stay at 50 as
long as you're at 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows you to move things back
and forth, knowing things are staying the
[SPEAKER_00]: same for every single pot, which has been
for me the biggest problem with steering
[SPEAKER_00]: is that people can't get accurate enough
information to actually often do this
[SPEAKER_00]: without paying humongous amounts of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing I really like doing at this
company is helping people gain access to
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with lower cost, easier to adopt
solutions, and helping small farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really good example of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one being everyone's paying all
these money for Netaflexes and systems
[SPEAKER_00]: that treat runoff, whereas diplomats don't
create runoffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than paying $300,000 for a
system and another $200,000 for a
[SPEAKER_00]: consultant, you can pay the same amount as
a normal irrigation system and achieve the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay a lot less than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, I think this is really what
we wanted to cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the points.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to belabor it too much,
but these are the new things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we really want people that have ever
had problems with blue mats to call us and
[SPEAKER_02]: fix them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's not a question that I'm
afraid to get.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all the same questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's always the same questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we have the right answers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think anybody call us up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're there sitting in an office 9 to 5
talking about blue mats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally like us in an office with
warehouse in the back full of blue mat
[SPEAKER_02]: parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're either talking about blue mats
with each other or we're answering calls
[SPEAKER_02]: or designing systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're trying to get it right for
everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is your team right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's a bunch of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's about 20 other people too behind
the scenes that are helping out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is who you're going to interface
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Uriah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Uriah might answer the phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uriah will definitely answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Joe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll get Joe on the phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe Cousin Joe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cousin Joe.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, this has been a great
weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we've got to say shout out to
Grassroots in Thailand for putting on one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the best conferences I've been to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been so awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they really took care of everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been a bunch of these and this is
really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's been amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thanks guys.
Thanks.
