[SPEAKER_04]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in this new age where we're all
focused on adult use.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all focused on licensing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all focused on getting property and
getting ourselves together so that we have
[SPEAKER_04]: a business going forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: What seems to be happening is that medical
has kind of lost a little bit of oomph.
[SPEAKER_04]: People have sort of forgotten about it,
except for the small group of people that
[SPEAKER_04]: really want to focus only on medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to hear from some of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a general rule around this industry,
it really seems like everyone's focusing
[SPEAKER_04]: on adult use.
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand there's good money
potentially attached to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can't forget that at the end of the
day, this was about our patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is about helping people.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is about the technology that's
happening and the developments that are
[SPEAKER_04]: happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wanted to shine a light on that
tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me introduce them to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob Rosenheck right here on the end is the
founder of Lord Jones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is anybody in the room familiar with the
brand Lord Jones?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not, you definitely should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have incredible product.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to learn about it tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have incredible packaging,
which we will also talk about tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just really, really spectacular.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob's just an excellent guy full of so
much knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so excited to have you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Rob.
[SPEAKER_04]: This man here, Dr. Jeff Chen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you go by doctor?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff Chen is a remarkable man as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's incredibly knowledgeable as it comes
to medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has a group called the UCLA Cannabinoid
Affinity Group, which I want to hear a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit more about.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the reasons that I've asked Jeff to
be a part of this is because when I first
[SPEAKER_04]: heard him speak, I realized that here was
a man who could take what is pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: scientific and can get a little confusing
if you're really not up to speed on the
[SPEAKER_04]: science of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: He could break it down into really
digestible bits that the average person
[SPEAKER_04]: can understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I find that very exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Jeff, for being here tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the first thing I want to do is
just give them each a minute to talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: themselves and what they do and why this
is important to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, why don't you start with us?
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up in New York on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved to California in 2000 and became a
medical marijuana patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd always been a cannabis user and a
cannabis enthusiast.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I arrived in California, I was
fascinated that you could become a medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana patient and use cannabis
legally.
[SPEAKER_02]: My knowledge of cannabis at that time was
extremely limited.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's smoked cannabis and I knew what that
did.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I didn't know what an edible was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know what a topical was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know what sativa was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know what THC or CBD were.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were all new concepts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would go to the dispensary and I would
try products and it was a little bit like
[SPEAKER_02]: Russian roulette.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have this incredible experience
with something and you might have this
[SPEAKER_02]: really terrible experience with something.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people here have had a terrible
experience with something?
[SPEAKER_02]: My background, I've done a lot of
different things in my career,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I was a chemistry major and I also
went to art school and I ran a marketing
[SPEAKER_02]: agency and we worked with food companies
and personal care companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: About four years ago, we decided we wanted
to create a cannabis brand that would
[SPEAKER_02]: address all of the things that we didn't
see in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted something that was high-end,
quality, transparent, safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to explain to people what they
were getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to demystify cannabis and make
it user-friendly and something that you
[SPEAKER_02]: could aspire to.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were lots of people who were
catering to the stoner stereotypes
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with Bob Marley and Jerry
Garcia and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those people have played a critical role
in the legalization movement, but there
[SPEAKER_02]: was a lot of that already out there and
there wasn't stuff that would maybe appeal
[SPEAKER_02]: to a soccer mom or somebody who would shop
at Whole Foods or people who cared about
[SPEAKER_02]: the quality of ingredients and wanted to
understand what they were consuming.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the idea behind Lord Jones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff, you want to tell us a little bit
about you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up born and raised in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: About four years ago, I was a medical
student at UCLA when I saw the CNN
[SPEAKER_00]: documentary by Sanjay Gupta.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mind was opened to how cannabinoids
might be useful in epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was really profound for me was me,
having grown up in a progressive state
[SPEAKER_00]: like California that had medical marijuana
since 1995, being a medical student at a
[SPEAKER_00]: progressive institution like UCLA.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you asked me the uses of cannabis,
I would have said pain, sleep,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more I dug, the more I'm uncovering
really interesting properties,
[SPEAKER_00]: the anti-tumor properties,
anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going around UCLA talking to
anybody that will listen to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: being like, why aren't we doing research
with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you care about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other medical students, physicians had the
same reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's useful for pain and sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't really know about all the
other layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I knew that by the time that
the average citizen or the average
[SPEAKER_00]: scientist or doctor, by the time they
learned about this organically,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might not be for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I dedicated myself to the
cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also around this time that I
entered the MBA portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was part of a dual degree MD MBA program
at UCLA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you're trying to train
physicians to run hospitals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using my training now to accelerate
cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earlier this year, I got a little bit of
seed money from UCLA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I created the Cannabinoid Affinity Group,
which is a loosely organized interest
[SPEAKER_00]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a symposium at 420 on UCLA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was a few of us that were
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started off with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we got enough traction and interest
from that, this actually happened about
[SPEAKER_00]: two months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a quarter million dollars from UCLA
to start the UCLA Cannabis Research
[SPEAKER_00]: Initiative, which I'm the director of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be something going
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is to be one of the world's
leading research centers focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still in our infancy right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our website looks horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a splash page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't judge us for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting our stuff together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hypothesis that I want to test through
rigorous research is the idea that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis could be a safe, cheap,
effective treatment for a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: ailments.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, I think this
conversation extends far beyond cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of calling it a gateway drug,
I think you could call it a gateway herb
[SPEAKER_00]: for how it changes the way that we look at
and utilize certain compounds that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: found in food or plants that might not be
useful to be commercialized by a
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical company because it's
unpatentable.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a profit standpoint, it's not very
viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is 100 to 1,000 times larger of a
market in America than ginkgo biloba or
[SPEAKER_00]: echinacea.
[SPEAKER_00]: For once, there actually is enough money
in this pool that if we can siphon away a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, that we can actually do
research that's never been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that these other herbal
products don't have uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just there's never been research
money for it now or interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: For cannabis, there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 100 to 1,000 times larger than the
market for any other botanical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my interest in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I think it's profound.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dedicating my career for the
foreseeable future for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's certainly worth giving him a hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to try to apply for any of
the tax revenue that's going to come in
[SPEAKER_04]: from Alma?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's $10 million a year to the UC
system to study the impacts of
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's pretty broad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be studying criminal justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be studying the economic
impacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, a part of that question will
also be the health benefits, specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: the therapeutic uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine from a priority standpoint,
most of that money is going to go towards
[SPEAKER_00]: criminal justice, studying the youth to
see if they're using more economic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think a lot of that $10 million is
going to go towards a therapeutic use of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, we're looking at
other ways that we can get money for this
[SPEAKER_00]: type of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in saying that UC San Diego was
the officially designated school that was
[SPEAKER_04]: going to get $2 million a year from the
tax revenue that comes in from the Adult
[SPEAKER_04]: Use Act.
[SPEAKER_04]: UC Irvine just decided to create a
research program.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're trying to apply for a
portion of that money.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, UCLA is behind you on this,
so to speak?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave us the money to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an official program.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually moved into my office a few
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an official program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't done any sort of press release,
press launch yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll come a few months down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that I approach this is,
at my heart, I'm an entrepreneur,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't want to necessarily approach
it the way that an academic or a lifelong
[SPEAKER_00]: researcher might approach it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really trying to think, how do we make
this sexy?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get people to care?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get people to donate to this
research?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get people to support it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's kind of a different philosophy
that I'm taking than UC San Diego might or
[SPEAKER_00]: UC Irvine might.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's great, and certainly keep us
posted because we are here to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, and I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least some of us are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay, let's start with Rob.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, you and I have talked a little bit
about health and wellness as it relates to
[SPEAKER_04]: medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally can say for myself that
cannabis use for me has been almost
[SPEAKER_04]: exclusively for wellness.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to talk to you about that a
little bit and see how you feel that that
[SPEAKER_04]: connects to the medical side of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually had a pseudo little mini
argument on one of the talk shows that I
[SPEAKER_04]: did while I was on the campaign about
whether or not cannabis is medicine or
[SPEAKER_04]: whether it's wellness.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, for me, I go with the
wellness part, but of course, it's
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the guy I was talking to was like,
no, it's only medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, well, it's medicine to me
and it's wellness.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your take on all of that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, our view is that it's all a continuum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, these terms, medicine, wellness,
adult use, recreational use, getting high,
[SPEAKER_02]: it being a euphoria, a sentiment,
a sacrament, these are all words.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you look back at the history of
cannabis, cannabis was first used about
[SPEAKER_02]: 10,000 years ago to create rope.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then about 8,000 years ago,
it was developed into textiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then about 6,000 years ago,
it was first turned into paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And about 4,000 years ago, it was first
used as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm jumping around a bit, but the word
medicine is, you might have tried this on
[SPEAKER_02]: your colleague, cannabis is a schedule one
narcotic under the Controlled Substance
[SPEAKER_02]: Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that defines
something that's a schedule one narcotic
[SPEAKER_02]: is that it has no medical value.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, legally, technically, in the United
States, it's not a medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, again, those words are arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just labels that we put onto
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: About 4,000 years ago, the Chinese first
used cannabis as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it moved into Persia and it moved
into India and it proliferated around the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for centuries, for centuries,
cannabis was used in virtually every
[SPEAKER_02]: culture across the world as a raw material
for industrial use to make rope.
[SPEAKER_02]: And textiles and paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was used as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was used as a euphoria.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Historically, it's been all those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way you use it engenders a label.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, when we're talking about medical
versus adult use, and I'm going to try to
[SPEAKER_04]: stay away from the word recreational.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may come out of my mouth a little bit,
but I think, I feel like we've been
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about this a while and adult use
just feels a little bit better to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: But either way, we're talking about
medical versus adult use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's look at your products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your products, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do you put them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, again, personally, I would connect
our products to the way someone uses them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also brand marketers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're experts on consumer behavior.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, just philosophically, as a marketer,
I don't want to tell someone how to use
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to help them use whatever it is
they're buying for the best use in their
[SPEAKER_02]: life, just generally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, somebody who uses an edible to go see
a concert because it's going to expand,
[SPEAKER_02]: accentuate, enhance their experience,
that's recreational or adult use or
[SPEAKER_02]: they're using it as a euphoria.
[SPEAKER_02]: But somebody who unfortunately has a
neurological disease or AIDS or cancer or
[SPEAKER_02]: neuropathy or autoimmune disease or goes
to the gym and has sore muscles,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're using it for some kind of medical
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Health and wellness is another just term.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's really a gradation as far as I'm
concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you pull a muscle at the gym and you
use a cannabis infused topical to relieve
[SPEAKER_02]: it, you can go to the pharmacy and buy
ibuprofen for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an over-the-counter remedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have nutraceuticals and dietary
supplements.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are those?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, these are just terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody who is sick, who uses it for pain
relief or to relieve their nausea or to
[SPEAKER_02]: help them sleep or to stimulate their
appetite if they can't eat, it sounds like
[SPEAKER_02]: a medicine to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we try to educate consumers about the
many uses for cannabis, help them make
[SPEAKER_02]: smart choices, choose good products,
that are well manufactured with quality
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredients for the particular need they
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to educate consumers and patients
and we don't really see it as it's this or
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff, from your perspective, how do we or
should we be looking at medical products
[SPEAKER_04]: and adult use products differently?
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we expect something different from
medical products than we should from adult
[SPEAKER_04]: use products going forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at other states where the products
are sold alongside each other in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: stores, I wonder, and I'm not sure about
this, but I wonder if often you're
[SPEAKER_00]: basically taking the same products and
it's just all marketing and branding and
[SPEAKER_00]: positioning whether to put a more
aesthetically appealing label on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it might be more medical product
versus not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the other layer that I often think
about is there's lots of companies who
[SPEAKER_00]: create formulations that they kind of try
to target at different medical conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I wonder how much of that is just
the branding and the packaging and that
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual formulation itself isn't very
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I'm not super familiar in
this part of the policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct me if I'm wrong, but the way I
understand in California is they're likely
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be sold side by side,
but if you're purchasing medical products,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't pay the tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't pay the 10% board of
equalization tax, but everybody will pay
[SPEAKER_04]: the 15% excise tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to your original question,
I think there's always going to be people
[SPEAKER_00]: who will position their products for
medical and whether or not it is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: a better product, that's going to be a
completely different black box that we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess related to that then is what would
make a product more medical than
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly the delivery route is going to
determine a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, combustion, fire, not a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's carcinogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of stuff you're exposing
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vaporization traditionally isn't seen as a
medical delivery route, at least in
[SPEAKER_00]: Western medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could change for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because cannabinoids are poorly
absorbed, and there's a lot of variability
[SPEAKER_00]: in how they're absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's inter-user variability,
so between different people who we assume
[SPEAKER_00]: should absorb it roughly the same rates,
you see differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what you've just eaten before
or after, that's going to affect how you
[SPEAKER_00]: absorb it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect this is why for Marinol,
you had a lot of people who did not find
[SPEAKER_00]: it, had very adverse reactions to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because between human subjects,
between patients, one dose that might work
[SPEAKER_00]: for somebody, if you start somebody else
on that dose, it might be too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on if they just, for instance,
had a meal and they took it, they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to absorb more versus on an empty stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now suddenly, what dosage used to work for
them now is suddenly making them,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's too much for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect that's a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To help you conceptualize this,
GW Pharmaceuticals, when they created
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativex, which is the one-to-one THC to
CBD product, there's a reason that they do
[SPEAKER_00]: an oral mucosal spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason you spray it in the back
of your mouth, and they didn't just put it
[SPEAKER_00]: in a pill form.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because they quickly realized that
if you're orally ingesting cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really hard to predict how much is
absorbed and how quickly it's absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it varies in between people,
and it varies on what else is with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about edible products,
how you create the edible product is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to dramatically affect how quickly you
absorb and how much you absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start thinking about, from that
standpoint, you can't really just
[SPEAKER_00]: transition recreational products over to
medical, because depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: complexes the cannabinoids sit in,
whether it's a brownie versus a lollipop
[SPEAKER_00]: versus a beverage,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it's the same, even though
you're only administering maybe 10
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams of THC, if it's in a beverage
versus a cookie versus a lollipop,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to have dramatic differences
in how quickly and how much they absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that standpoint, you definitely are
going to have to create a dichotomy with
[SPEAKER_00]: how you think about these products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that something that you are going to be
spending time researching?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like that to be a focus of our
research, but as many of you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are precluded from using any cannabis
products in our research that doesn't come
[SPEAKER_00]: from the federal government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Theoretically, actually, you just gave me
a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that we could do is we could get
cannabis from the federal government and
[SPEAKER_00]: then get approval to prepare it
differently into different formats,
[SPEAKER_00]: a beverage versus an edible, and then
administer that to subjects in our study.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, that data would actually have
more, we call it external validity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have more real-world relevance.
[SPEAKER_00]: To what's happening in the cannabis
sector, because a lot of the official
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis research on America, it's been
done with rolled cigarettes of cannabis of
[SPEAKER_00]: potency that's maybe five to seven percent
potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't been doing controlled studies
on dabs or extracts or edibles or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else, really, aside from rolled
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some studies where they did
vaporization, they used like literally a
[SPEAKER_00]: volcano.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is done at UC San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used a volcano and they showed that
vaporization was a legitimate way to use
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was actually a pretty cool study that
got approved and was done at UC San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: All with federal budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, the federal government does
not fund therapeutic research.
[SPEAKER_00]: The money that UC San Diego has been using
actually came from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's been funding the research at UC San
Diego for the last 15 years was money from
[SPEAKER_00]: the state of California that was earmarked
for cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually just ran out of that money a
year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, now they have a pipeline of $2
million after Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a pipeline of $2 million a year
to keep doing what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're studying things like driving
impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you measure driving impairment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, you don't want people on the
road that are stoned out of their minds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you also don't want to give people
DUIs who are using it for legitimate
[SPEAKER_00]: medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a high tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a very complicated
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like the answer is some sort of a
driving simulator, an app, that you give
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody on the roadside because blood
levels, saliva levels, they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: correlate with actual impairment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably something we could talk
about all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, I want to talk to you a little bit
about anti-anxiety meds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've talked a little bit about this and
something that you feel is pretty close to
[SPEAKER_04]: your heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been some studies that cannabis is
maybe starting to be able to replace some
[SPEAKER_04]: of the anti-anxiety meds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell us a little bit more about
that and what your thoughts are on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's anxious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a human condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff can do studies, double-blind,
placebo-controlled studies, but most
[SPEAKER_02]: people, if they smoke a joint,
they just empirically know it alleviates
[SPEAKER_02]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about taking away pill
bottles that are on people's tables.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the Lord Jones brand, but we operate
a collective called Hollywood Hills
[SPEAKER_02]: Wellness.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have hundreds and hundreds of members
and we have dozens and dozens,
[SPEAKER_02]: if not more, members who have a very
similar experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: They suffer chronic anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've taken every SSRI imaginable.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have adverse side effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something has led them to cannabis,
a friend, a relative, just trial and
[SPEAKER_02]: error.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are not people who use a lot of
cannabis recreationally or for adult use
[SPEAKER_02]: or to get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually, most of them,
quite reluctant and sheepish about trying
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They join the collective and we give them
different varieties of cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_02]: universally, they report that they've been
transformed, reborn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm my new self.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those things you kind of read about
when Prozac was first introduced,
[SPEAKER_02]: that and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dozens of testimonials of people who said,
I've thrown my pills away and I use
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and I feel better and there are
fewer side effects and it's more natural
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's been our experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't really know where we were going
when we decided to enter the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was form a collective.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a pretty pedestrian view of we're
gonna help people get high and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: make better products and we're gonna label
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of where we started.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had no idea about anxiety as an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had no idea about pain relief as an
issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can tell you all kinds of stories that
we learn from our patients every week.
[SPEAKER_02]: This woman was given one of our topicals
as a gag gift by one of her friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a joke at a dinner party and
gave it to her and every night before she
[SPEAKER_02]: would go to bed, she'd use some hand cream
to make her skin soft.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she put our bottle on her bedside table
and started to use our lotion instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever she was using and she noticed
after two weeks, her nails, her cuticles,
[SPEAKER_02]: stopped chipping and they were stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know if she realized she had
weak nails and she used up the bottle and
[SPEAKER_02]: then two weeks later, her nails started to
chip again and she called us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you've studied this,
Jeff, but we had no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cuticle health that strengthens nails
and we started to tell people about it and
[SPEAKER_02]: that happens time and again.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have friends who are stylists to the
celebrities and one of the women who works
[SPEAKER_02]: in our office hates wearing high heels and
went to a wedding and she took our lotion
[SPEAKER_02]: and rubbed it on her heels before she went
to the wedding and she came back and she
[SPEAKER_02]: said, look, I put this on my feet before I
went to the wedding and I didn't have any
[SPEAKER_02]: pain in my high heels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm crippled when I come home from a
wedding.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started to give it to these stylists
and we were written up in Billboard and
[SPEAKER_02]: Hollywood Reporter and our lotion was used
at the Golden Globes and the Oscars for
[SPEAKER_02]: all the celebrities' feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: The point is people like Jeff,
we need to understand the true potential
[SPEAKER_02]: of cannabis as a medicine because we don't
know what it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we be expecting a Lord Jones foot
balm any day now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Heel balm?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that note, I think there's a lot of
amazing anecdotal evidence out there and
[SPEAKER_00]: that actually helps scientists know what
to focus in on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not for the parents who had started
using CBD for the epileptic children,
[SPEAKER_00]: the researchers would have never gotten on
board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the people at GW
Pharmaceuticals, CBD for Epilepsy was not
[SPEAKER_00]: in their product pipeline as of 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started getting some emails from
parents who were like, you guys developed
[SPEAKER_00]: this THC CBD drug called Sativex for
multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why aren't you doing CBD for Epilepsy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't you seen the videos?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, what videos?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a pharma company who was informed
by the anecdotal evidence of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the anecdotal evidence is
valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there needs to be a centralized
way that we can collect all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: anecdotal evidence and really be able to,
if the number of participants in this
[SPEAKER_00]: study is large enough that we can start
teasing apart the signal from the noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a Sensi-Chu was partnered
with Stanford.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were able to distribute a survey to
about 1,000 cannabis patients to gather
[SPEAKER_00]: their responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, how do we get 100,000 respondents
to fill out a survey and help us
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what it's useful for so then we
can take what limited resources we have
[SPEAKER_00]: and hone in on those use cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a caveat to all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The caveat is that there is such a thing
as the placebo effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so you guys understand this.
[SPEAKER_00]: For cannabis, the placebo effect is
actually higher than it would be for
[SPEAKER_00]: something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because going into it, cannabis
already has this reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going in, expectations are already more
heightened than if I just gave you
[SPEAKER_00]: something and said, it's a Chinese herb,
try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I tell you it's cannabis,
you already have this preconceived notion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to make the placebo effect
stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is, when you take
cannabis, you actually feel different.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least for THC, it's psychoactive and
you feel different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to enhance the placebo effect
more than if I gave you a sugar pill,
[SPEAKER_00]: told you it was going to help you,
but you didn't feel very different
[SPEAKER_00]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be like, no, I think my sleep's
still pretty bad or my pain's still pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cannabis, because you feel the
psychoactivity, that's going to enhance
[SPEAKER_00]: the placebo effect even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just to say that we should take
everything with a grain of salt,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think the anecdotal data is very
valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the topic of being a substitute for
pharmaceutical drugs, we see this in the
[SPEAKER_00]: literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a study came out recently that
showed about a $200 million reduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: annual Medicare spending because baby
boomers are starting to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They attributed this directly to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the other question then, at least for
the issue of anxiety and benzos,
[SPEAKER_00]: we do also hear anecdotally that some
people smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have increased anxiety and paranoia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect that it obviously has something
to do with dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, at a low dosage,
THC has anti-anxiety properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a high dosage, it has pro-anxiety
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: This leads me to my next point,
which is that more is not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is true for a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's especially true for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you an example, CBD is an
anti-inflammatory, but there are mice
[SPEAKER_00]: studies that show, if you give too little
CBD, it's not going to have good
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatory properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give a moderate dose, it's going to
have anti-inflammatory properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you give too much CBD, the
anti-inflammatory properties go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we find that sweet spot?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of what hopefully our research
can show as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: More is not necessarily better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that's very
counterintuitive to the American way of
[SPEAKER_00]: doing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: For cannabinoids, it's also very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: More is not necessarily better.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually very interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially for people who build up
tolerance, you might want to continue to
[SPEAKER_04]: take more and more and more, but actually,
it's not going to really do anything for
[SPEAKER_04]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, your bodies make endocannabinoids,
but when you flood your body with external
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, your body is going to
decrease the amount of endogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that it's making.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a feedback system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically says, here's the level of
cannabinoids I want to be at, and when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: here, I bring it back up, but if you flood
the body with external cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: like heavy, daily cannabinoids,
your body is going to say, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's plenty of cannabinoids out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to make as much as my own,
and it's also going to decrease the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabinoid receptors out there because
it's saying, these cannabinoid receptors
[SPEAKER_00]: are being overstimulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to decrease the amount
of receptors out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The endocannabinoid system is very
complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you start thinking about what are all
the unintended side effects and
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences, so another reason why more
is not necessarily better.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really interesting, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I would say that gives a round of
applause for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about consistency.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about consistency, and from
both of your perspectives, do we need to
[SPEAKER_04]: be looking at consistency on the medical
side aiding different than we're looking
[SPEAKER_04]: at consistency with adult-use product?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we know that there's going to be
pretty stringent testing criteria and
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we look forward into the
consistency issue?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know that for years,
that's been one of the biggest problems
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's still a plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end of the day, it's still a plant,
so it can't be exactly the same every
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the difference between a
pharmaceutical and a nutraceutical in this
[SPEAKER_04]: case.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do either of you want to go first,
maybe Jeff, about consistency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first glance, obviously, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical needs to be more consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have someone who is reliant on this
for their pain relief, for their sleep,
[SPEAKER_00]: and fluctuations in their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suddenly, they went and bought this item.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few weeks later, they went back,
bought the same item from the same
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer, and now suddenly they have
to take more or it's not benefiting their
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because you're dealing with a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the same clone, the same genetics,
slightly different environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, you're going to change what's
going on with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you standardize to just THC,
there's hundreds of other compounds in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other point that I want to make is
that even though these other compounds
[SPEAKER_00]: might not be particularly abundant,
these cannabinoids are distinct molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might need 10 milligrams of THC to
have a certain physiologic effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for this other random cannabinoid X,
maybe you only need 0.1 milligrams for it
[SPEAKER_00]: to exert its anti-inflammatory properties
or its anti-pain properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because these other constituents in
cannabis are present in very minor
[SPEAKER_00]: quantities does not mean that they're
insignificant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you standardize to THC or
standardize to CBD, there's all these
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, there's all these other
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it gets even more complicated when
you start thinking of them having
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that they can have interactions
with one another is a term called
[SPEAKER_00]: allosteric regulation, which is where,
let's say I have a cannabinoid receptor
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have this other cannabinoid that
might not directly bind to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's going to affect how this receptor
binds to THC, or it'll affect how this
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor binds to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you start looking at all the
permutations of all these combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets mind-boggling, which is why it's
so hard to develop pharmaceutical drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: out of botanicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, I would say that,
yes, we need stricter standards for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how to get there,
though, without being a multi-billion
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar pharmaceutical company.
[SPEAKER_00]: GW Pharmaceuticals, they make their drugs
out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow the plant in the UK,
but they grow it under incredibly sterile,
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly rigorous conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they can get the plant to be
99.9% consistent each time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when they throw it into their
extractor with the same settings,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get something that is pretty close
to consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other area that you guys might want to
look towards the future in, and
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding how this might shape out in
America, is look at Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Canada first legalized medical,
they didn't let you just start willy-nilly
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people had to put in tens of
millions of dollars into state-of-the-art,
[SPEAKER_00]: sterile, rigorously controlled growing
environments to be able to produce the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants the same every single batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that going to look if the federal
government, because we think it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be stepwise, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll legalize medical federally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the feds legalize medical, are they
going to make you put in that same
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure, the same $30 million to
get a grow facility up?
[SPEAKER_00]: For you guys to think long term as to how
this is going to shape up, maybe look
[SPEAKER_00]: towards Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be a model that we adopt here
in the US.
[SPEAKER_04]: Part of this whole topic of medical too
and separating it out from adult use is in
[SPEAKER_04]: the packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something that you're really
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of curious to see what you think.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, one question that's been
brought up, which is, are you listing all
[SPEAKER_04]: your ingredients in your, not just your
cannabinoids, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: How are people doing that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're saying, oh, this is going to
be great for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's healthy, but then you start looking
at the rest of the ingredients and it's
[SPEAKER_04]: really crap, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The one question would be about packaging
and really being very transparent with
[SPEAKER_04]: your packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other part would be, is are we going
to continue to probably have a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: white label product that people just buy
and then repackage and slap a brand on it
[SPEAKER_04]: and put it out in the store?
[SPEAKER_04]: How can we distinguish between all that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are really good and complicated
questions and I think they're even
[SPEAKER_02]: broader, which is how is the marijuana
industry going to evolve in the US?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's larger than just labeling,
packaging, medical versus adult use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spend a bunch of time thinking about the
future of cannabis as a product in the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will it be taken over by pharmaceutical
companies?
[SPEAKER_02]: The pharmaceutical lobby is the most
powerful lobby, except possibly the
[SPEAKER_02]: petroleum lobby in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's determined to be a medicine,
all again, I think all these things are
[SPEAKER_02]: totally arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's determined to be a medicine,
why shouldn't the pharmaceutical companies
[SPEAKER_02]: take it over?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a dietary supplement?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a nutraceutical?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it like alcohol?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a vice that should be controlled by
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
[SPEAKER_02]: Firearms and Cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a consumer product?
[SPEAKER_02]: Will Procter and Gamble and General Mills
take over the cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these are big questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I didn't really answer your
question, but I think the questions you
[SPEAKER_02]: brought up are really complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I believe everything should be
labeled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should things be... We just passed a
regulation in California saying that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't spray THC onto... There are a bunch
of companies that just go and they buy
[SPEAKER_02]: bulk crappy candy made with corn syrup and
artificial flavor and colors and then they
[SPEAKER_02]: spray it and our company weighed in in
Sacramento and thought that was not a good
[SPEAKER_02]: way to manufacture cannabis products,
[SPEAKER_02]: but white labeling, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have one company that makes edibles
and then six other companies slap a label
[SPEAKER_02]: on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we feel about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the answers to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to control our means of
production, create something that's super
[SPEAKER_02]: high quality, disclose the ingredients,
create great relationships with our
[SPEAKER_02]: customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're kind of old fashioned that way in
our approach, but you're bringing up a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of questions about what is cannabis and
how should it be regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Canada, they do treat it like a
medicine and the manufacturing is
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you go into a grow house,
it looks more like a biotech lab than a
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation center.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of benefits to that I think
as far as safety goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of consumer choice up
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have edibles and topicals yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They only have flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the answers to all these
questions, but they're really important
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to chime in for a sec, in terms of
the labeling and ingredients and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's more something that will be handled
at the regulatory level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost out of our hands as to how
that will be handled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll likely be mandated if you list all
ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white labeling aspect, it happens so
much in just everyday life that it's bound
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure every day you go to the grocery
store, even on the same day, you might buy
[SPEAKER_00]: two different things that literally are
just the same cereal that got white
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you buy at Trader Joe's is
white labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything at Trader Joe's is white
labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go to companies that go, I like this,
and they put their label on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can expect it to happen in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the issue of, again, looking towards
the future, maybe there's a few things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you might want to use as food for
thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain naturally occurring
things that currently are sold as
[SPEAKER_00]: nutraceuticals that also have a
pharmaceutical version.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, you can go buy fish oil as a
nutraceutical or food supplement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also get prescription strength,
like omega fatty acids that are
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetically created that are much more
expensive and are arguably more pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some people that are always going
to buy the fish oil, and there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: people that want to go after whatever is
the pure version.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of cost, it might be more
expensive to make something that's that
[SPEAKER_00]: medical grade, but if insurance reimburses
for it, that's also going to change
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might desire and believe in the
natural form, but hey, if your insurance
[SPEAKER_00]: is suddenly paying for one and not the
other, you might be like, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I'll let my doctor prescribe and
I'll pick it up at the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be clear, the pharmaceutical industry
in the United States is no different than
[SPEAKER_02]: the consumer packaged goods industry when
it comes to consumer marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you watch MSNBC at night, it's all
wall-to-wall ads.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was something that was illegal a
generation ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, a generation ago, you would go to
your doctor and consult with your doctor,
[SPEAKER_02]: and your doctor would say, you need this
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd say, what does it do?
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd say, it's going to help you with
this, and they'd prescribe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you watch television, and you go into
your doctor and say, oh shit, I need
[SPEAKER_02]: Viagra, or I need a vilifier.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of merchandising and
marketing in the pharmaceutical world too,
[SPEAKER_02]: which just again, just makes it more
complex.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had brought up a question to both of you
earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we got here, being that we're in
West Hollywood, who was on the forefront
[SPEAKER_04]: in the 80s of the HIV AIDS syndromes,
shall we say, and medical marijuana was a
[SPEAKER_04]: really big help.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do either of you have any thoughts on that
or any just contribution to that whole
[SPEAKER_04]: story?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's still a treatment,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Medical cannabis is still a treatment for
HIV.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you see any development happening in
that area?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you see any kind of forward movement,
or are we still stuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: HIV, AIDS, and cancer too, in our
experience, our patients use it not so
[SPEAKER_02]: much to treat HIV, AIDS, and cancer,
but to mitigate the side effects of the
[SPEAKER_02]: treatments of HIV and cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both cancer and AIDS medication,
the antiviral drugs, they do a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They cause people to become sick,
lose their appetite, become nauseous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people have problems sleeping,
and obviously, they create great pain and
[SPEAKER_02]: discomfort.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis can help alleviate most of those
symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why most people that come to us are
using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there's a whole lot of noise out
there about cannabis kills cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did read something recently about that
some of the cannabinoids may actually
[SPEAKER_02]: attack the AIDS virus in some way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm never gonna tell somebody who has
cancer, cannabis is gonna cure your
[SPEAKER_02]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no medical proof for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there is enough, where there's
smoke, there's fire, it's certainly,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna throw this over to Jeff,
a need to really scientifically
[SPEAKER_02]: investigate that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so on the topic of cannabis and HIV
or AIDS, you know, Marinol, synthetic THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: is FDA approved for anorexia, which is
weight loss, but specifically anorexia
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with AIDS, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of the first thing that
happened in the late 80s or the 90s,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have also been studies, actually
done also again at UC San Diego,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've done a great job looking
specifically at cannabis for neuropathic
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, nerve pain, from patients with AIDS,
and it looks positive for that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, all these things coalescing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's the other question is that
cannabinoids are anti-inflammatories,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is great if you have an,
maybe if you have an autoimmune condition,
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretically it might be able to help
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anti-inflammatories also suppress your
immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in that sense, we actually had,
they did a study on this I think at UC San
[SPEAKER_00]: Francisco, because the concern was if you
have AIDS, and you're using cannabis maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: to gain weight or to help with your
nausea, but the cannabis is suppressing
[SPEAKER_00]: your immune system even more so,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The AIDS virus is suppressing your immune
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's killing all your white blood cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the cannabis being an
anti-inflammatory, does it additionally
[SPEAKER_00]: immunosuppress you and make you
susceptible to all these infections?
[SPEAKER_00]: In AIDS, you don't die from the AIDS
virus, you die from infections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looked like the study that did that
showed that it did not measurably increase
[SPEAKER_00]: your risk for infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though cannabis is
anti-inflammatory, this was an
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatory, and people who have
AIDS, it wasn't further suppressing their
[SPEAKER_00]: immune system, which is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you added a last point about,
oh, like cancer, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean cannabinoids have anti-tumor
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've only been done in animal studies,
but they've been done across a wide
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of cancer cell types, brain,
lung, colon, skin, and many others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mechanisms are multifactorial,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that they have direct cancer
killing properties through a process
[SPEAKER_00]: called apoptosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when your cells become, at least let me
rephrase, in animal studies, when cells
[SPEAKER_00]: become cancerous, they actually increase
the expression of cannabinoid receptors
[SPEAKER_00]: generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when cannabinoids activate these
cannabinoid receptors, it actually
[SPEAKER_00]: triggers the cancer cell to kill itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cancer cell commits suicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a process called apoptosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabinoids do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids also can inhibit the cancer
cells from getting food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cancer cells need to nourish
themselves, especially if they're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they send out chemicals that tell your
blood vessels to come to the cancer cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the cancer cell is hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabinoids seem to also cut off that
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It prevents blood cells from getting to
the cancer cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, cancer cells need to spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it appears that cannabinoids are also
able to inhibit the spreading of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer cells, this process called
metastasis.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so through all these mechanisms,
cannabinoids are able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good news is, so bad news, it's only been
done in animal studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good news, they just did the first human
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a combination of THC and CBD for
glioblastoma multiform, like the most
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous, deadly form of brain cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a placebo randomized
controlled trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cannabinoids had significant
survival benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the people that got the cannabinoids,
83% of them had survival at one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The group that didn't get it, 53% were
alive at one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very preliminary study, very small study,
only about 10 people in each treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other caveat I want to add,
and then we'll wrap this up, not all
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer cells express cannabinoid
receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if your cancer cells aren't
expressing cannabinoid receptors,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're hitting them with cannabinoids,
you're not really going to do much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you might do is you might
suppress their immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our immune system also helps keep
cancers in check.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you can see where this gets very
complicated, very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is another instance where more is
not necessarily better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a caveat to keep in mind going
forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to wrap this part up,
and then we're going to take some
[SPEAKER_04]: questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just want to ask a simple question
to both of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I bet that everybody in this room,
if you're in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: you've gotten this question from someone
you know, which is, I'm sick, fill in the
[SPEAKER_04]: blank.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or my husband, wife, daughter,
friend, et cetera, is sick with something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fill in the blank.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're talking about cancer.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about fibromyalgia.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking about epilepsy and the
chronic pains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do I go?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do I just go get a vaporizer and call it a
day?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you as individuals and as people
in the industry recommend and say to
[SPEAKER_04]: people that come up to you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I know it happens to me all the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you respond to that, Rob?
[SPEAKER_04]: You get asked that a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're a product guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a tricky thing because I'm not a
doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also, we provide access to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a weird role.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call ourselves lay practitioners.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing we wanted, we'll rely on
what has helped patients that we've worked
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the big question we want to know is,
is this something that's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: treated with a topical or an ingestible?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it something that's systemic or is it
something that's local?
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes we'll offer a combination of
the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like migraines and menstrual pain are
two things where we might use a
[SPEAKER_02]: combination of an ingestible and a
topical.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, there's a lot of trial and
error in what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are basing what we do on anecdotal
evidence as practitioners.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not doctors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, if there's any question at
all, if we don't feel real comfortable,
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, we have lots of patients who use it
this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll tell them to go see a doctor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're not going to go out on a
limb and offer medical advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I can really comment very
much on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get asked all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, I don't really
even know what to tell them because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so many questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it work for that condition?
[SPEAKER_00]: What dosage do you take?
[SPEAKER_00]: What delivery format?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they start asking about what brand do
I use?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I even know what's in this brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there fertilizers?
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, often I can't really
tell them much at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had a better response for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's really not much I can tell
them at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, what I say is, don't replace it
with what the kind of traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: established Western medicine is giving
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't replace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to get caught up in the
miraculous stories that we hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would never recommend it as a
first-line treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, if you're using Western
medicine, and you're using these
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription pills, and you're not getting
relief, then at that point, if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider adding cannabis on top,
just understand the risks and the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And use it as what we call an adjunct,
an add-on, to see if it can enhance your
[SPEAKER_00]: overall response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll open up for questions later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's kind of what I tell them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's a tough question because none
of us really have answers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we are kind of considered the experts
right now these days because there really
[SPEAKER_04]: aren't a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is interesting to just talk about it
and say, what do you say?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I find for myself, when I get the
call, which I do all the time,
[SPEAKER_04]: unfortunately, a lot of what my time is
spent is just talking to them,
[SPEAKER_04]: just talking, just listening, talking,
maybe suggesting, hey, you maybe want to
[SPEAKER_04]: go take a look at some of these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: They might help you.
[SPEAKER_04]: They might not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't guarantee anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just almost like having some
information seems to give them a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit of peace.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that's ultimately what we
can be doing right now is saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, we can't guarantee anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's some things you could look at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's some things you should research.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's some things you can possibly try.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe they'll help.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've helped other people feel better
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a chance that it might help you
feel better too.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a chance it might not.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that as sort of just almost
like as an ear to just bend, I think
[SPEAKER_04]: that's where I've found myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's first of all thank Jeff Chen,
Rob Rosenheck.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been incredible, incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's any questions out there,
it's kind of hard to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to send one of these mics
around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when do you guys come or anybody
here?
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter, grab one of these microphones and
you guys can share.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a California attorney who's been
concerned about the future of medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at Washington,
where it's essentially folded,
[SPEAKER_01]: you look at Colorado, where adult use
market just utterly outstripping medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know that there's an answer to
this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't expect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This question is really for anyone in the
room who's got any good ideas,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether at the local level or the state
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that you think can be done to
protect medical and keep it alive,
[SPEAKER_01]: assuming you recognize it as something
that could be under threat.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can talk to you about from a state
perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Prop 215, which is our medical
marijuana laws here in California,
[SPEAKER_04]: it would take a constitutional amendment
to undo Prop 215.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the reasons that Prop 64 did
not go down that path because it was going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be extremely complicated to undo it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So rather than undo it, they folded in
some protections into Prop 64 for medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then subsequently, all that's moved
into now SB 94 and our regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how it's all going to ultimately shake
out, I don't think anybody knows at this
[SPEAKER_04]: point.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as of right now, this time,
our medical is still protected in
[SPEAKER_04]: California.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to say how that will go down.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing that happened in Washington was
that because the tax difference was so
[SPEAKER_04]: huge, there was no incentive for people to
go to adult use.
[SPEAKER_04]: So nobody was opening up adult use shops.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so everyone just stayed in the
medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they went, no, no, no, no,
no.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they kind of shut medical, folded it
into adult use purely because everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: was trying to avoid the taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have a better system here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We learned from that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at this point, medical is here to stay
for the time being.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot predict what will happen in five
years from now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we're safe for a little while
because of the fact that it would take a
[SPEAKER_04]: constitutional amendment to undo Prop 215.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about what I can contribute.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have something?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you look at, someone here was
saying how, you know, the economic
[SPEAKER_00]: interests, people tend to jump to adult
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the size of the health
care sector in America or the size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical industry in America and you
compare it to the size of the wine and
[SPEAKER_00]: beer market, you can see that there's a
lot more money in pharma than there is in
[SPEAKER_00]: selling, like, alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm not, again, not trying to say
that cannabis is alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people don't like that
comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would make the argument that from an
economic standpoint, there might actually
[SPEAKER_00]: even be more money servicing medical users
than there is in selling to an adult use
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the end of the day,
in an adult use market, you're battling
[SPEAKER_00]: over marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's got the sexier brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's got better distribution?
[SPEAKER_00]: But in medical, if you come up with a
formulation that actually works for a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain condition, you've cracked the code
on the terpenes and the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just stumbled across a billion dollar
formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potentially, maybe it's helping people
realize that there is a ton of money in
[SPEAKER_00]: medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just you maybe have to be more
patient in when the money's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas with adult use, you can kind of
jump in now, start building your brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for medical, really do putting that
fixed cost R&D development in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning, maybe not being super
profitable in the beginning, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really the back end is going into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, there's a path going forward
now for medical products derived from
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to get FDA approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to look this up if you're
remotely interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the botanical drug category
under the FDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only been around for the last four
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only two drugs have made it through that
FDA botanical drug category.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is a green tea extract for genital
warts called veragrin.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other is a Chinese herb for menstrual
hot flashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them are plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You extract the plant, put it in a pill,
and the FDA will give you clearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't patent the formula, but you can
have, you're the only one that's allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: to say that this formula was FDA approved
for genital warts or hot flashes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's a billion dollar drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can come across that formula and
you can stumble upon it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now what's even better, and there's
one last point I want to make about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's even better is a pharma company has
to spend a lot of time and money
[SPEAKER_00]: undergoing clinical trials for their
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now in cannabis, if you think
you have a formula that works,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can kind of just sell it to people
without having to spend a hundred million
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars on FDA clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can already kind of be testing your
formula in a sense without having to spend
[SPEAKER_00]: all that money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another thing that could be
valuable going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the only thing I really have to
add.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well first just a comment to your
question, which is that in my mind part of
[SPEAKER_03]: the gap between, well to fill in that gap
is really looking at education.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and what I mean by education isn't
patient education, but career technical
[SPEAKER_03]: ed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you go through the state board of
education and create a certified training
[SPEAKER_03]: that is career tech ed post-secondary on
something around cannabis and bud tending
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever it's going to be so that you
have people who are actually trained to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to be those kinds of patient
advocates, then that's going to fill in a
[SPEAKER_03]: piece of the market that's missing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because right now one of the issues is if
you're, especially if you're older or if
[SPEAKER_03]: you've never consumed cannabis in any way
and you walk into, well I'm in Oregon so
[SPEAKER_03]: we can walk in, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So for a rec and we walk in, what you're
going to get is people who can't answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be that you could ask a
question and your bud tender at the
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary would be able to see and say,
well this is a flower or this is a strain
[SPEAKER_03]: that's known for this or this is a product
that's good for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you've just got a bunch of
generally young people that don't really
[SPEAKER_03]: know anything that are not able to give
good information.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think a big piece is creating
through, and California has a really open
[SPEAKER_03]: state board of education in terms of
things that they'll approve, creating some
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of mechanism to get people in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one of the things I've been
thinking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question that's been kind of
burning for a long time around medical
[SPEAKER_03]: product in adult use, around labeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this piece of, so I go in and I see a
tincture and I say, I'm in the same place
[SPEAKER_03]: that has a tincture, a topical and a
flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the flower, the person can say to me,
it's this strain, it's got this person
[SPEAKER_03]: percentage, it's been lab tested and it's
got this percentage of THC and this
[SPEAKER_03]: percentage of CBD, da da da.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my tincture doesn't tell me what
strain it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it says it's a hybrid, maybe it says
it's sativa, maybe it says it's indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: My edible, maybe it says any of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know for myself medically that a lot
of what works for me is strain specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just curious your thoughts on how
do we get more of the products that
[SPEAKER_03]: especially as we're going into adult use,
how do we get, does it, in your opinion,
[SPEAKER_03]: does it matter for topicals and tinctures
to say this is a strain or is it,
[SPEAKER_03]: it doesn't matter because it's all shake
or it doesn't matter because it's all leaf
[SPEAKER_03]: or?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So strains, when you're talking about a
strain, first of all there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: strain confusion because there's a lot of
people who just call, they make up names
[SPEAKER_02]: or they'll take whatever they have and
call it Blue Dream or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you talk about a strain and best
practices are employed and you're actually
[SPEAKER_02]: getting that strain, the strain represents
a collection of cannabinoids and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this strain gives me this desired
effect because it has this much THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: this much CBD, these terpenes,
this profile, and assuming it's
[SPEAKER_02]: consistent, you're going to have this
consistent experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you extract cannabis oil or
some kind of concentrate from the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've disrupted its properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've disrupted its properties based
on how it was, primarily how it was
[SPEAKER_02]: extracted, how much heat, how much
pressure, and what kind of solvent is
[SPEAKER_02]: used.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could take the exact same flower
and extract it 10 different ways and get
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 totally different cannabinoid profiles
and terpene profiles in the extract that
[SPEAKER_02]: you got from the same flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that creates one complication there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I told you I'm selling you Blue
Dream as a strain that you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke and then I tell you here's a cookie
that has Blue Dream extract in it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really going to be dependent on how
it was extracted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you really, eventually what I'd
like to see, how I'd like to see the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry evolve is so that it's more
transparent, more labeling, and more
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer awareness so they understand,
oh, you know what, I like a strain that's
[SPEAKER_02]: high in CBN with limonene because that's
immutable regardless of what the plant's
[SPEAKER_02]: source is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the only way to really kind of predict
the desired effect of a topical or
[SPEAKER_02]: anything as a manufacturer product made
from concentrate is to understand which
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids and which combination and
terpenes and potencies are left in the
[SPEAKER_02]: final product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not an easy answer, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to add to that, I completely agree
with everything you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to move away from
strain names and move towards hard
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers, like here's the ratio that I like
of these certain terpenes or cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even if we settle, if you find that a
specific formulation works for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: then maybe that's the one that you're
going to go after.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what's going to happen is
companies will create 10 different
[SPEAKER_00]: formulations, and if they can consistently
make each one of those 10 formulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't really need to say that this
formulation is going to produce euphoria
[SPEAKER_00]: versus creativity versus sedation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just have to show that this is
formula A, and we make it consistently,
[SPEAKER_00]: and our users will eventually self-assort
to find the ones that they like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can crack that formula,
you're going to sell a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the same strain, first off,
like you said, the strain names are all
[SPEAKER_00]: messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's just making it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't trust anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The odds that Blue Dream in this store is
actually related to the Blue Dream in
[SPEAKER_00]: another store, it's very slim.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even the same strain, the same
genetics, batch to batch, they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you even mentioned with the sugar
leaves, depending on where you are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, the ratios are going to be
completely different depending on whether
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using the sugar leaves versus trim
versus flour at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus flour on the bottom, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're saying, I locked in to
this particular formulation from this
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, you're not going to be able to
find that consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to go likely to the
derivatives, the extracts, and then really
[SPEAKER_00]: honing in on if you can consistently
produce a formula that has the same amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of these 10 cannabinoids and these 10
terpenes, we're getting pretty close to
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's consistent, and then
people will naturally self-assort to what
[SPEAKER_00]: they like and what works for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we have lots of questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys are going to stick around.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm going to wrap this part of it,
and we're going to finish off this event.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these guys will hang out so you can
come ask questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I really just want to thank you both,
because this has been so wonderful to talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys are great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So please come up afterwards and talk to
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
