[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to Laurie Ajax before and I
was like, okay, well, let's talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to help with the regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to help with what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said some of these don't make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're based on the old school Nielsen's
ratings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that doesn't really work anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you and I have discussed
previously, like Nielsen rating is
[SPEAKER_00]: literally like you get a phone call,
hey Roger, did you watch Seinfeld last
[SPEAKER_00]: night?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long did you watch it for?
[SPEAKER_00]: How frequently did you watch it for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, it just doesn't exist in a
world where like digital media and digital
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is the way people market.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you enforce that?
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and that's actually a really
interesting way to get on what you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: are doing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So traffic routes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, why don't you give the good people
at home a little information about,
[SPEAKER_01]: about what you guys are doing at traffic
routes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So traffic routes, we are a digital ad
network.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you may or may not know,
advertising in cannabis is a challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because it's still federally legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, and there's a lot of unknowns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the traffic routes, the traditional
outlets such as Facebook, Google,
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, technically you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their guidelines and regulations are very
specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebook did just change some of that
though, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They changed their search criteria,
but not their advertising criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a misconception there and I
could touch on that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But simply because it's federally legal,
Facebook won't touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously Google won't touch it either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one question, I'll just answer it
now, that I get the most is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, what happens when it does go legal?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens if it goes federally,
you know, rack tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, DoubleClick all of a sudden be...
And the answer, nothing's going to change
[SPEAKER_00]: simply because those guys are too
interconnected with some of these bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: ad networks like DoubleClick, like Google,
and they're not going to risk losing one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bigger accounts like Ford or Chevy
or Tide or whoever, because they show a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis ad next to something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly to take out of this
is, cannabis isn't the only sector that
[SPEAKER_00]: Google and Facebook won't touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually other areas that are
federally legal that Google and Facebook
[SPEAKER_00]: will not touch.
Like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tobacco, alcohol, firearms, pharma,
nutraceuticals, adults, crypto.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of those polarizing topics where
you don't want to be seen to... You don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be associated with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to be associated with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in every single one of those,
as a single silo, industry is much bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: economy-wise than cannabis.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those people that think that once
cannabis goes federally legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: that Facebook and Google are going to open
up their arms, I'm not sure if that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be that easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so what makes traffic routes
different in that you're able to publish
[SPEAKER_01]: advertisement on non-cannabis sites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Valid question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is we work directly with the
sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe it or not, at the site level,
they're very open to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been able to connect with some of
the pretty significant big sites that are
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing ridiculous amount of users,
about 150, some of them 150 million unique
[SPEAKER_00]: users a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very open to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're open to the CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're open to a lot of these cannabis
products because it is the new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to an extent, if they're open to other
things, they're open to cannabis.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's from an advertising perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about from a content perspective?
[SPEAKER_01]: So are these bigger sites opening up to
cannabis content as well?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other question I get asked a lot
is, well, what about the age wall?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm advertising on a CNN, or I'm
advertising on a Newsweek, do they have to
[SPEAKER_00]: have an age wall?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's another misconception
that people have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The age wall isn't really on the content
sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CNN writes about cannabis all the
time, Newsweek as well, and some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: other bigger publications.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is no age wall because it is
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: The age wall comes into effect once you
click on that ad and you go to the product
[SPEAKER_00]: page.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the age wall needs to live,
and that's what needs to be enforced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's where you're really
entering the product phase, not at the
[SPEAKER_00]: content level.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no different than alcohol,
tobacco, these sort of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember years ago, I worked for Sky
Vodka and Campari and putting up those age
[SPEAKER_01]: walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those guys definitely, even though
there are limitations on where they can
[SPEAKER_01]: go, they can advertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do see advertisements for liquor
companies, for alcohol companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you get to the site,
that's where you have to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're collecting the age wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, let's be honest, January 1st,
1969, or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone puts in the bogus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this requirement that you have to
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no one pays any attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, yeah, sure, I'm over 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a liability situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Content site does not have to have age
wall, but a product side once you click
[SPEAKER_00]: from the site to the product is where the
content page and the age wall needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: live.
[SPEAKER_01]: We touch on a topic that you and I know
talk about quite a bit, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: education.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not so much that there are so
many things you can and can't do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the problem really more so is
people aren't educated and have clearly
[SPEAKER_01]: defined guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because every time I have a conversation
with somebody like you, you and I spend a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of time together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're both pretty well informed
about what the issues are and aren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have so many conversations with
other people where they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, you can't do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, well, actually,
you kind of can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to be very careful about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what's the solution there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we spend a lot of time educating
our clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, we were one of the first companies
to focus on being TCPA compliant so that
[SPEAKER_01]: we make sure that anyone who's receiving
our messaging has opted into it and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that and make sure they can opt out of it
whenever they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of other companies who came
before us weren't so focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of the nature of this
industry in that so many people would
[SPEAKER_01]: rather ask for forgiveness and permission.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's catching up with a lot of
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does come to education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you were at the panel last
week when we talked on education and what
[SPEAKER_00]: gluten-free was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave that example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that falls in line with what we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we take that as an example again and we
say, well, who's following a gluten-free
[SPEAKER_00]: diet now?
[SPEAKER_00]: And who was following a gluten-free diet
five years ago, 10 years ago?
[SPEAKER_00]: Five, 10 years ago, nobody knew what the
hell was gluten-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because of education and the marketing
behind the education, now it's becoming a
[SPEAKER_00]: standard of like, oh, I'm gluten-free or I
am this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's kind of where we are
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to set a standard not only within
the marketing guidelines, but really
[SPEAKER_00]: explain to people how that affects their
brand and how can that affect their
[SPEAKER_00]: overall performance as a brand in such a
gray industry, especially in the digital
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the digital side, it's even more
complex simply because obviously we both
[SPEAKER_00]: have internet at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if the internet is registered
under your fiance, your daughter,
[SPEAKER_00]: your aunt, your mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who that internet is registered to
under means nothing to who's behind that
[SPEAKER_00]: screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you register for your internet
provider, they don't ask you for age.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't ask you how many people are in
your household.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't ask you who's going to be using
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Social, name, and address, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from an advertising perspective,
it's really hard to be able to track age
[SPEAKER_00]: demographic on who's behind that screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do data overlays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you similar audiences,
but a one-to-one relation on who that is
[SPEAKER_00]: is nearly impossible unless something
changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You touched on branding and marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you and I, we spend a lot of time
talking about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's really, really
interesting what's happening right now and
[SPEAKER_01]: the emerging market, so the newly acquired
customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You spend a lot of time talking to
advertisers and publishers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we do the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for us, I think number one demographic
that we're looking at right now is maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: the Chardonnay mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: We spend a lot of time talking about the
senior community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are segments that need very
different kinds of advertising and
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't understand strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't understand strained names.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about effect-based marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is all this impacting the work that
you're doing right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the creative.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked on the creative the last panel
you were at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've taken a very different approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way I see our ad network is kind
of like an investment portfolio.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to have a very diverse portfolio
of sites, whether it's cannabis sites,
[SPEAKER_00]: mainstream sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mainstream, I mean soccer mom sites,
culture sites for men.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sports sites, tennis, golf, extreme sports
as well, snowboarding, skateboarding,
[SPEAKER_00]: video gaming, believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most interesting group of sites
that we started working with that reached
[SPEAKER_00]: out to us was this group of publishers
that have about 50 sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, OK, let's talk and let's see
what you guys have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they own crochet sites, knitting
sites, cooking sites, scrapbooking sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chardonnay mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chardonnay moms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those sites are doing very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's like the mom that is kind
of in the closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to kick that bottle of wine that
went from one glass to two glasses to a
[SPEAKER_00]: 750 milliliter bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, well, I'm going to drink
a bottle now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not going to be 750.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be 1.75.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still a bottle a night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're kind of dragging the next
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the modern consumer is not the
stigma that we're involved in and seen in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people want to believe
that you need to market to the stoner
[SPEAKER_01]: culture in this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And quite frankly, don't get me wrong,
there is a strong stoner component in what
[SPEAKER_01]: we've seen out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's an ever dwindling segment of the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an addition too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is why we touched a little bit on
effect-based marketing, which I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a trend that's happening right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Chardonnay mom doesn't care what
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: She doesn't care if it's Banana Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: She doesn't care if it's OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: She wants to know, is this going to make
me relax?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this going to make me sleep?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this going to make me focus?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this going to do for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like, again, going back to the
fact that you work with non-cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: sites, I feel like from that angle,
that really opens up a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're not talking about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not talking to a room full of
echoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking to a new audience you're
addressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even today, I think the stigma of
cannabis consumers is still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you and I both walked out of
our houses tomorrow morning and we knocked
[SPEAKER_00]: three doors to the right and three doors
to the left, every single one of them is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to deny that they're cannabis
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But behind closed doors, it might be a
different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that different story is simply because
of that stigma that they're afraid they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be categorized at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think through education,
through more normalization of products,
[SPEAKER_00]: that stigma is slowly being removed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see this now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you walk into, just as an example,
a MedMen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they very carefully curate their
brands that they have on display.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not seeing, we refer to it the
bongs and thongs era of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not seeing everything in green and
pot leaves on everything and Rasta this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all out the window.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you have brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, not to pick anyone out for any
reason, but like Select, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kiva comes to mind.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dosis comes to mind.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are brands that you look at and you
go, well, that's intriguing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not an intimidating package.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't say anything about a specific
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says very clearly on the front,
it says calm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Candescent does this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says calm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says connect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as someone who, I mean, I've been
consuming since I was 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 20 some years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, none of that stuff matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I'm talking to my mom, you know,
they have nowhere to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think in that situation,
my mom would be like, I need you to come
[SPEAKER_01]: to the store with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I'm going to do this, I need you
to come to the store with me and point
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people ask this to me all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you think your mom would go to the
store and order go for flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the top?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably go vape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go vape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or edible, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: She'd probably go edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which so many people make a mistake of
doing that as their first product that
[SPEAKER_01]: they try because they think it's safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a form factor they're familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really, oh man, you're walking a
fine line there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You overdo an edible and you're never
coming back.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, is that an opportunity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that an opportunity for education to
tell people, I know this seems like the
[SPEAKER_01]: way to go because it's something that is
familiar and it's a brownie or it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in reality, if you overdo it,
you know, you're going to have a bad
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have a bad night.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I ran actually at the CBD
Expo not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran into a gentleman that has CBD wine
and THC infused wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's funny you said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sarah McLaughlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has a line, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of the few that I've seen
that is both alcohol and THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's odd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because so many of the ones that I've seen
are just... You can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was illegal to do THC and
alcohol together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if this was something
that happened before all the deregulations
[SPEAKER_01]: went into place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, from what I've seen for the most
part, it's non-alcoholic beverages.
[SPEAKER_01]: That have THC or CBD added.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beverage is... We were at New West last
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think BDS gave a talk about trends in
the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the beverage segment is actually
growing like crazy right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's... I personally, I love an
infused beverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm dropping plugs,
but honestly, I'm not getting paid for any
[SPEAKER_01]: of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is it Sprig?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Sprig.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic product.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD infused sparkling water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're doing great stuff there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know in Colorado, Keef Cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, those guys are around longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keef Cola, I think, is very almost stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know what Keef is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what Keef is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Chardonnay mom doesn't know what
Keef is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that a lot of that is
changing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be really interested to see,
especially with what you guys are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming you've got analytics around
everything that you've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have so much data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's probably why we get along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can nerd out about that all day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any sort of trends that you're
seeing that you want to talk about?
Anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think CBD right now is doing really
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just hands down, especially
online, because it's a product that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can advertise, you can sell, and you can
monetize.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see a return immediately on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll stop you there for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious, again, just to maybe have a
polarizing conversation about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rico and I, we spent a lot of time talking
about who's an opportunist in this space
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's a good actor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's an opportunist?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's just trying to make a quick buck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of all the CBD companies that you're
seeing, what percentage do you think are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually selling what they say they're
selling?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or how much of it is a placebo effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to say because there's so many
of those that are being white labeled that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hard to see and track who's at the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's at the top, and whose product is it
really?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just been relabeled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing a little bit of research,
actually, is a smart thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of CBD companies
that are doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more good actors than bad actors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in general, I think education,
once again, you have to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be overwhelming because there's so
many damn products out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's nothing that can't be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's testing just like anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting some samples, trying the products,
see how they work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every person's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, I'm one of those people that I can
consume all the CBD in the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I barely feel any effect off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My fiance, on the other hand, she loves
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If she has a bit of anxiety, a little CBD
goes a long way for her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Helps her take the edge off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a great, not to use an
overplayed term, it's a great gateway drug
[SPEAKER_01]: to get people involved in the cannabis
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've seen so many people who even
have some difficulty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives them a little bit of pause to
even try the CBD thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's difficult to overstate how
non-psychoactive it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You truly don't get any... Nothing.
Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people are still very hesitant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad has had all kinds of surgeries,
knees, shoulders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally open back surgery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Significant stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a drinker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously never consumed anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the trade shows, I got some CBD
patches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one-to-one and then the THC that are
one-to-one as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave him a CBD one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to get you hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give it a try for your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave it to him on a Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: By Saturday morning, he was asking me for
more.
Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is, but it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, here, try the THC one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, this one even works better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a topical situation where it
doesn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good way to get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you're not ingesting it,
I feel like people are more open to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Open to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what they think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that perception, if I smoke,
I'm going to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I take something, it's going to go
systemic and it's going to affect me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's topical, it's topical only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's funny is, how many of those people
who are hesitating but were willing to go
[SPEAKER_01]: try a topical solution, do you think
they've ever looked at the ingredient list
[SPEAKER_01]: on any other topical they've ever put on
themselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know the first thing that goes
into one of those topicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's probably worse ingredients in
there than CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were talking about trends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked about CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I think it's because it's the one
that's safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you said, it's a very easy entry
point to the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a non-aggressive, non-you don't
need to know too much of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains or different products or different
types to be able to understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very simple product to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's a pill or just a swab or a
texture or whatever it is, it's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the trend side, the CBDs are doing
really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beverages, as we talked about,
I'm seeing more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sticking with the trends, I think it
comes down to the brands that are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: well are not just packaging it as get as
high as you can product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important to understand because
that in itself will attract that soccer
[SPEAKER_00]: mom, that professional woman, that
professional man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the audience that has the money
to spend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember this when we first started
Baker about four and a half years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember being in Colorado and I had one
of our guys come home with his roommate
[SPEAKER_01]: who had just come home from the cannabis
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was excited because he had this
headband OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, it's 35% TAT.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, whoa, count me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want no part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back then it really was a,
and I've since dubbed this in
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations I've had, this prohibition
mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want the biggest bang for your buck.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm going to go out and spend 50 bucks
on an eighth, it better be strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's only in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't think it applies to
tobacco or alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: But think about alcohol during alcohol
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: You weren't going out and buying beers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were going out, you were buying
whiskey.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were buying gin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were getting your biggest bang for
your buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there wasn't in prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in prohibition, which we're just
kind of coming out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what we've seen is we've seen a
migration of all of a sudden, for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I see something that's 15% TAT,
I'm like, that's real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be able to actually consume
this for a little bit socially with other
[SPEAKER_01]: people, function, and move on with my day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That brings us back to branding where we
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's a topic that I
love talking about right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the industry is progressing,
I think product differentiation is so,
[SPEAKER_01]: so difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it used to be, well, I mean,
the old school was lows, mids,
[SPEAKER_01]: highs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, I think, gone the way of the
dodo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still have shops that sell that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, again, you don't
find really, you don't find brick wheat
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's selling brick wheat anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wheat from the 70s when it had seeds
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So product differentiation based purely on
quality is very, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's taking its place is brand
differentiation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Identifying, are you selling to the
Chardonnay mom?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you selling to the senior citizen
community?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you selling to athletes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Marvin Washington, we spent a lot of time
with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's selling Isodile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isodile Sport, actually.
Sport.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those guys are very focused on the
athletes community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I saw, we were at an event
recently with five former NBA players
[SPEAKER_01]: where they're pitching the value of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Al Harrington just launched Viola
Extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, all of this, let me be wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're all great products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you remove all the branding from
all those products and put them side by
[SPEAKER_01]: side, it'd be very difficult to figure
out, to know which one's which because the
[SPEAKER_01]: products are all high quality and so
similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So brand differentiation is really,
in my mind, where things are going
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting to see more marketing
professionals enter this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting to see fewer people trying
to go for mass market appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: More people go for that very focused
segment of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure you're seeing a lot of that
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the niche marketing, it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't get me wrong, I love my cannabis
sites that they're working with us and I
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of these brands, like we talked
earlier, don't want to advertise on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis sites because they do want to go
after that very particular niche audience
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not a cannabis consumer currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone wants that newly acquired
consumers and then to retain them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And retain them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be like, I want you to be loyal to my
brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hooked you onto my brand and now I'm
going to do everything I can do to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure you don't leave my brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all image.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's room for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, whether it's the sports,
whether it's a soccer mom, whether it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: professional businessman, it doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a product to be able to tailor to
each individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that market segment is growing
significantly from different aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just recently had a consulting call with
this vaporizer company that was working
[SPEAKER_00]: with us and they solely wanted to
advertise on cannabis sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the vaporizer is like, I don't know,
$250.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comes to beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely high end market.
[SPEAKER_00]: High end market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, it's not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, okay, well, let's let's jump on
a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's figure out what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be more happy to help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, why are you only
targeting cannabis sites?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, well, that's our that's our
consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that was your consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you need to be broader.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then start cutting the fat on the
marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start getting some analytics back
on what's actually converting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you I'll give you some credit on
your account.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to we're going to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to target investment sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went for investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went for mainstream like news and
media, kind of higher end websites where
[SPEAKER_00]: more professional people attend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure enough, within 10 days, we increased
his ROI by about 200 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, not surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that brand marketing folks
focusing on a specific segment is working
[SPEAKER_01]: so well for people right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, I think, you know,
if there's anything I've been seeing as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as from a career wise trend,
what's hot right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, I mean, a lot of people ask me
how they can get involved in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first thing I tell them is you
don't have to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not you're not a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know nearly as much as these
guys have been doing it for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to get a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to be a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do it in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think the biggest influx right
now that I'm seeing is marketers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think marketers are realizing that the
time has finally come to where the
[SPEAKER_01]: maturity in the cannabis industry is where
it has to be to where you can go in and
[SPEAKER_01]: help people understand why spending 10,
50, 100 thousand dollars, if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: MedMen, millions of dollars on marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you're going to get that
newly acquired customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are actually getting a lot of the
mainstream marketing companies reach out
[SPEAKER_00]: to us, connect with us and say,
hey, I know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got clients and these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of in the same line where
some of these bigger cannabis brands are
[SPEAKER_00]: going for the bigger mainstream
advertising agencies instead of going with
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis agencies for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the mainstream agencies,
media buying and marketing agencies are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming directly to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then those agencies that are mainstream
are like, well, we don't know where to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis traffic or where we source it and
eventually end up on our desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's work together so you guys can be our
cannabis arm to the digital advertising
[SPEAKER_00]: space, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question always comes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, we can't do it through
Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do it through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in that sense, sometimes Google and us
share the same sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's room for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think just, just being able to access
non-cannabis sites through your platform
[SPEAKER_01]: is a huge value add.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also something that's really easy
to demonstrate to people how that is a
[SPEAKER_01]: value add.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you can advertise on Buzzfeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can advertise on this site,
on this site, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people just, again, the lack of
education, they didn't know they could do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good example was a music site that we
started working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to jump on a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got on the phone with their operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it all the way up to their COO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a rap site, pretty big rap site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, well, we're not sure
about advertising cannabis on our site.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, well, we are not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you listened to the lyrics of the
music that you're pushing on your site?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of like, that was,
that's exactly what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on your site right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on your video page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm literally going to do just round
robin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to click a video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he almost guaranteed you that you
were already promoting cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption through the videos that you're
showing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, duh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's funny about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's like that scene in Half Baked
came, you know, it came to life,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Samson and like Mr. Nice Guy.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's actually happening,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, you have people dropping Jungle
Boys in songs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have people dropping Brass Knuckles in
songs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's this weird situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never thought I'd see that happen in my
lifetime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a brave new world.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of exciting stuff happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're, we're in for a pretty
exciting next few years as things kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: settle and progress and settle down in a
good way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, good talking to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Till next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Till next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
