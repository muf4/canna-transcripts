[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, this is Windy City
Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I'm a new grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: First let's get that out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a medical patient based out of
Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recently changed the law to allow
medical grow and so I got my license to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that and so that's what this garden is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a caretaker garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I'm helping another medical patient
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see what we got cooking in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just doing some little maintenance on
these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we'll walk you through the
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to have five plants actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a problem with root aphids earlier
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd started off in this bed and out of
the five plants that we put in the bed,
[SPEAKER_00]: the root aphids killed everything but two
of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up treating with nematodes and
Dr. Zymes treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we ended up clearing the beds and we
still were able to save two of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the remnants of one and I'll get
into why it's like that in just a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to lay any bets as to why
that's what we've got left of a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: submit your answers now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this was the other plant that we
had in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an Acapulco Gold and we had pulled
it out of the bed, put it into new soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: treated all the soil with nematodes and
Dr. Zymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got rid of, we got past the aphids
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up until this week, we actually had a
full, the biggest bush that we had was
[SPEAKER_00]: this one right here and it came out,
I mean, we had stake marks all the way out
[SPEAKER_00]: to here, which is about four feet off the
bed, maybe three feet off the bed and had
[SPEAKER_00]: full trellis systems on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was going to be, I mean, I don't know a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my first season, but it was going
to be in the pounds yieldage for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're working with now though is four
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are critical plants from seed
stockers based out of Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three of those are clones of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is an Acapulco Gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, this is what we've got for our
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that was right here was actually a
bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so not surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that gives anybody else any more tips,
well, I guess I'll just say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant ended up herming and yeah,
so we had to cut it because it started to
[SPEAKER_00]: seed itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been doing some inspection on
these plants to see if they've been seeded
[SPEAKER_00]: at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them look like they might've
gotten touched with pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said to look for brown,
brown pistol hairs, which would indicate
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are definitely some on some of
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully the damage was somewhat
contained, but it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing in an organic super soil out
here with a lot of down to earth
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really love the shape of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are 15 gallon containers with,
you know, blood meal, kelp meal,
[SPEAKER_00]: langbenite, seabird guano, alfalfa meal,
insect frass, all sorts of amendments
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, they're doing pretty well,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started transitioning to flower on
these three plants at the very beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: of August.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very surprised to see how far along
they got at the very beginning of August.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one, this Acapulco Gold,
I think because it's got that deep sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: nature to it, it's waiting for things to
get closer probably to the 11 and 11 hour
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see how much later it takes until
she really starts to flower up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's what we're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four of the five plants that we had
started with about halfway through the
[SPEAKER_00]: season, we had killed three, we had lost
three that were also bag seed actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it turns out that was
probably for the best because that bag
[SPEAKER_00]: seed was a was a herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So had some hermaphroditic tendencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, in terms of pest management,
since we got past the root aphids,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've just been deploying beneficial
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were using neem up until flower,
but then I saw the talk with Scott
[SPEAKER_00]: Scamnes, Scott Scamnes, I'm getting sure
I'm butchering his name, where he talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about how the azorachnum and neem oil was
a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cut that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went basically right to beneficial
insects at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got ladybugs, we've got green
lacewings, which you can see down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got trichogamma, trichogramma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parasitic wasps and assassin bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've kind of got a full assortment of
beneficial insects that are in here right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully that protects us from
caterpillars and any other would be passed
[SPEAKER_00]: until we can finish the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so this is again, this is a
caretaker outdoor patch that I'm helping
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in just a second, I'll show you my
indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics, critical from seed stalkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acapulco gold from Barney's farm,
critical from seed stalkers, critical from
[SPEAKER_00]: seed stalkers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just clones of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are all the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't, you know, that I picked out a
particularly good phenom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was literally my first time growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you Google where to get
seeds and you order some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really like that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that I'm like a little further
into it, I wish that I had gotten maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: better, you know, quote unquote,
American, better American genetics or
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's maybe more aligned with
where I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe like breeders out of Michigan would
have been maybe a good place to go or
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in terms of finishing dates and all
that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also stuff that's well suited for,
you know, an October that can get wet or
[SPEAKER_00]: or cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But didn't know about that at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't do enough research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of just ordered seeds and and off we
went.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, next season, I think I'm
going to go in with a better plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this has been a really fun learning
and I guess pun, not intended growing
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, in Illinois, we're legally
allowed to grow five plants with a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we're down to the four,
sadly, because we lost this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a yeah, it was a hermit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just beware of bag seed, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test it out before you run it full time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully it didn't get too much to
the rest of our crop because those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be useless, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, here's the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if you have any questions and
I'll show you the indoor in just a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll take you into the cave in just a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I figured that we might start out here
so that we can talk about sort of what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: growing all organically using a lot of
down to earth amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see what I got working with
here is some neem seed meal, gypsum for
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got just an all purpose 444,
which is a blend of all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some humic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is azomite right here, which is for
micronutrients, from what I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's langbenite, which is a high
potassium source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some alfalfa meal, blood meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sea bird guano.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crab meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then some combination of all of these are
in what was in the outdoor and what's in
[SPEAKER_00]: the indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for a system where I would
basically build the soil and then all I
[SPEAKER_00]: would have to do is add teas and water
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty well the direction that
I've gone in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been fairly easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing in three gallon bags for most
of my stuff, at least on the indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outdoor is obviously bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 15 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're doing occasional earthworm
casting teas along with, this is recharge
[SPEAKER_00]: from real growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So infusing our microbiology and microbes
into the soil to regulate pH so I can just
[SPEAKER_00]: water in regular water in between those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also adding in occasionally
epsom salts and silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual bags of these live over at the
outdoor, which is why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way that the law works is kind of
silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only have five plants per
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even per medical patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have two medical patients that
live under the same room, you still only
[SPEAKER_00]: have five plants total in the house,
which is just like, doesn't make any sense
[SPEAKER_00]: to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like a poorly written law.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Michigan you can have 12
recreationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just don't understand why,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in any event, the law changed in
January, officially on the first of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the recreational law, they included
the provision for home grow for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what inspired me to get to grow
my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what led me down the rabbit
hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really I got started after getting my
card.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got started in March and basically
started acquiring all of this stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: doing research on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We popped bag seed and then I ordered the
other plants and we'll talk about that in
[SPEAKER_00]: just a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under here I've got my water, which is
basically just tap water that I'm aerating
[SPEAKER_00]: the chlorine out of using these air pumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've got this bigger air pump for
making compost teas while actually
[SPEAKER_00]: earthworm casting teas with recharge to
inoculate the soil with, along with some
[SPEAKER_00]: macronutrients and some micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'll throw in some calcium and some,
and some azomite, along with some
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus and potassium for, and I'll try
to make it, you know, I don't have,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a microscope to really see
what I'm getting into it, but what I
[SPEAKER_00]: understand, and maybe this is like,
you know, bro science, maybe it's not,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that if you use earthworm castings and
you, and you go for more than 24 hours in
[SPEAKER_00]: a compost tea, you wind up with a more
fungally dominated compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally speaking, you know, fungally
dominated compost teas are good for,
[SPEAKER_00]: for flowering cycle, which is what we're
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these plants that are in here,
here's the two by four tent that I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, started this in March.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've just been trying to acquire
equipment over the, the course of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pandemic, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some auto flowers that I started
86 days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they've been fine,
but they're finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, if you don't get everything
right and veg, and then you flip into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower and everything's not right,
like you, your yield is going to suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your potency will probably suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I just don't know that it's the
most, in one way it's efficient because
[SPEAKER_00]: you could do a perpetual cycle of auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would start to cost a lot and seed,
but from a home growers perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's one method that you
could do once you get your system dialed
[SPEAKER_00]: in so that you're really good and that
you're not wasting any moment of veg or
[SPEAKER_00]: any moment of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you need to be really dialed in
to work with auto flowers successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the future, I'm going to work
with photo periods just because there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more grace to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit more of like,
if you mess up, you know, you still have
[SPEAKER_00]: time to like correct mistakes in veg
before you flip into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the critical plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the mother of the plants that are
out in the outdoor right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty nice growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, this is the first seed that I popped
and I decided that it was time to throw it
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause next time on the flip of this tent,
what I really want to do is I really want
[SPEAKER_00]: to do a proper Fino hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a pack of 14 seeds that I,
that I'm going to be running once
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is clear out of this tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's four plants in this tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, this one is going to be,
this is the mother plant for those other
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just going to try and grow as
much nice bud on this as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to do a little maintenance,
forgive me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this one is a clone of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want to do is I just want to
kiss it with pollen and a couple of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bud sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that I can make my own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to use the hermaphrodite
pollen from the other scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually got a different pollen that
I'm going to use and I'll show you that in
[SPEAKER_00]: a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meantime, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two gorilla glue autos going
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's these two critical plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got some pollen going in the
next tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, almost going in the next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my two by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me close this up real nice and tight
so that I can be very intentional about
[SPEAKER_00]: where the pollen gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so sorry about the blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm just acquiring equipment and
trying to make it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a night terror OG plant from Royal
Dankness out of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I popped a couple of seeds and I ended
up finding this male in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is cool because it's got a lot of
characteristics that I like on a female.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way that this is stacking out
and I really want to use the pollen from
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is in the same room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, so maybe that's a big mistake is to
have it in the same room, even in two
[SPEAKER_00]: different tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is sealed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell with zip ties on all of the
outside things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully there's nothing leaking out
of this except for when I open the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, hopefully we're not
exposing things too long to the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, and the other tent is fully
sealed every time that this gets open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the Blurple White, I'm sorry about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see I got some boys in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get the pollen out of this
and I'm going to just kiss a couple of the
[SPEAKER_00]: colas on the plant that I have going with
the idea that then I've just gotten set
[SPEAKER_00]: with my own seed for some amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know, seed's not cheap and I'm
not a cheap guy and I don't want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this a cheap way, but I'm also so
interested in the character.
[SPEAKER_00]: Characteristics of breeding and like what
you might get and you know, I'm a guy who
[SPEAKER_00]: likes to like just take projects and run
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to give this a shot and see
if we can make something work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's all I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter, let me know if you need me to
record anything else and I'll be happy to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk ad nauseam about what my thoughts on
growing and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have a good day.
