[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start by smoking your flower however
you prefer to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that would be rolling a joint,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That would.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Andy, we left the papers in the
crutches over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Andy, you had one job to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: One job to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the ashtray clean though.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the funny thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been smoking cannabis all morning in
preparation of smoking cannabis all
[SPEAKER_01]: afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh, that would just be shameful.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love tools and utensils.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have had such a collection of different
papers, pipes, and bongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I worked at the dive shop,
I used to make bongs and pipes out of old
[SPEAKER_01]: scuba equipment because I'd sit in this
shed all day long waiting to fill scuba
[SPEAKER_01]: tanks for the Puerto Rican lobster
fishermen on St. Croix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be out there all day long just
sitting there smoking joints and working
[SPEAKER_01]: on scuba equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I'd have leftover parts,
I'd see how to make a smoking tool out of
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: That and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did these leftover parts come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, get the regulator.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you have so many snorkels?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd put the regulator all back together
and have three springs and a screw left.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were extra parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've already got some of the
Durban ready to go ground up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of our favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Durban poison is what people think of when
they think of a sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's originally from Durban,
South Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has been grown in our family and
friends of cultivators for well over 20
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my absolute favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smell is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is what like when Mel Frank
talks about, like, I missed that original
[SPEAKER_04]: Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't get it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the 2017 Durban.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is one of those things when you
talk to old school smokers and you open a
[SPEAKER_01]: jar of this, you can just see the smile on
their face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their eyes melt and they're just like all
happy memories.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people think of that happy giggly
stuff they used to get way back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day, we always light up a spliff of the
Durban and, you know, people, it brings
[SPEAKER_01]: back memories.
[SPEAKER_02]: High in the terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terpinaline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is what gives it that classic Durban
smell too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unmistakable Durban.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an early Durban, so it's got a
little bit of a shorter flowering period.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, we've been growing it in Sonoma
County for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're really trying to develop our own
Appalachian and terroir.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to see how this varies from
everybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be like, I know you want
Durban South Africa, but fuck you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be amazing in Sonoma too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, well, French wines made their
way to Sonoma.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were like, no, we pretty much do
everything just as good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you drinking a lot of NorCal wines?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love Sonoma County wines.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me some favorite red and white.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where we live up in Sevastopol,
we love Mary Edwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's an old school winemaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one of the top in the country,
male or female.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does solid Pinot Noir.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sauvignon Blanc is one of my favorite
whites I drink right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I prefer reds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Pinot Noirs are amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice fruit-driven Sonoma County Pinot
Noir.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, she just crushes it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Martinelli right down the street
is Helen Turley's.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's the winemaker there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she does high alcohol Zinfandel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just really like, same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Old school female winemakers that are just
crushing it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the cannabis industry, you know,
so many of the important people in the
[SPEAKER_02]: country right now are women.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like Shannon Cameron's wife,
our CEO, is just paving the way for
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations and licenses and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: While you guys are smoking weed,
she's reading through all the regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's on the hemp advisory board for
Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's also one of the founders of the
Women's Cannabis Business Development.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is just a rock star.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen anybody be able to just
grab ahold of a project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Deal with all the administrative shit that
I have no interest in dealing with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And policy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And employees.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And managing the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And build out a construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every little detail there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the position we are because of
Shannon's attention to detail and just
[SPEAKER_01]: being a rock star animal and everything
she does.
[SPEAKER_01]: She spent 20 years as a project manager in
telecom and running massive projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've built a restaurant together and
ran that together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've rebuilt a sailboat together and
sailed that down the coast and lived on it
[SPEAKER_01]: for almost two years together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's just an amazing person to work
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to keep up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, she really makes me,
pushes me to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Jody, I think you have that same
relationship with your hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why don't you tell us about your hands?
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep up.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jody too, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: She treats me right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we just have such an amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way you can do this alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no way that anybody who was a
small farmer and producer in the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning, there's no way anybody can do
this without a team and without a family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why this is community.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all trying to rally together to
survive this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes Jody and Andy and everybody
else on our team.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have fantastic people that,
you know, we have to hire the best,
[SPEAKER_01]: the brightest and the smartest to run with
things that we never imagined we'd have to
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to be a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Valedictorian.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Durbin that you said has been like
between family and friends for like 20
[SPEAKER_04]: something years, is that kind of like the
hero cultivar of your land?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you had to pick one that you want
Fiddler's Greens to be known for,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a tricky question because we do
different things for our Durbin flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: for our heritage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of those classic heirloom
strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We absolutely want to be known for the
Durbin, especially to carry on the
[SPEAKER_01]: tradition.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some great people who started this
before us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a real honor to continue to be
growing this because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we weren't first by any stretch of the
imagination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just want to show respect to the
people who got us here and brought us
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you talk about any of them and what
they taught you?
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that taught us, the people who
taught me to cultivate, this was the
[SPEAKER_01]: primary strain we grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started out, you know, lugging dirt
and trimming and washing pots and being
[SPEAKER_01]: the grunt labor for these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, all of us, all of us learned,
you know, working for these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they they were just really
neat people who are traveling colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we met, we all met in the Caribbean
over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we run into each other everywhere we
go in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was not a part of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys have a couple of years on me,
believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're part of that now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I am in it now.
[SPEAKER_05]: The hands in the dirt part.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, metaphorically, one could say
Santana is a lot of mud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's amazing people that are still
trying to survive, you know, the new
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation era.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we just want to make sure
that everybody survives that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to make sure that the people
who started this and got us here with
[SPEAKER_01]: this, that they get recognition and,
you know, that they are given a place to
[SPEAKER_01]: carry on in this industry, because it's
been so drastic, you know, the regulations
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's difficult to survive.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just went, yeah, I just went to both
that OC normal meeting where that guy,
[SPEAKER_05]: he started off talking about those growing
practices, but the rest was talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: the laws and what they're trying to do and
and essentially how they're trying to
[SPEAKER_05]: survive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's you can see kind of a
difference between them and the LBCA.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they both do separate cool things like
LBCA.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have like a guarantee hire process,
essentially, where like anyone who like
[SPEAKER_05]: they want to like set up something where
they have like a they run people through a
[SPEAKER_05]: program and they kind of get certified and
it's not an official certification.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no actual but essentially you
recognize in anywhere throughout Long
[SPEAKER_05]: Beach, any club, they're prepared to hire
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have systems in place to to
protect the community and to give people,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, more incentive because when
you're when you're bringing things to a
[SPEAKER_05]: city council meeting, you know,
you need to have positive and pros to to
[SPEAKER_05]: beyond just this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to keep going to the city council
meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to go to the Board of Supervisors
meetings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to call and write because these
regulations aren't the end all be all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the camel's nose under the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to keep showing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to keep fighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to change the regulations so that
they make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most of these people that wrote
the regulations have no idea what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have no idea how the cannabis
business operates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're they're writing rules blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But every time that we contact them and we
try to work with them, we're getting good
[SPEAKER_01]: reception.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we need to you know, yeah,
we need the angry activism.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also need to meet meet people where
their understanding is and guide them
[SPEAKER_01]: along into the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're pioneers for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if it was easy, everybody would
be doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we never answered your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're asking what we would want to be
known for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other one that we would want to be
known for is our ACDC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually having the tincture here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ACDC is a high CBD flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stands for alternative cannabinoid
dietary consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: The alternative cannabinoid refers to CBD
versus THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the dietary consumption meant that it
was indicated to be taken orally or
[SPEAKER_01]: ingested as a whole flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ACDC is traditionally a fairly
difficult plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty spindly and it flops around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've been growing it for many years
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really likes where we are in Sonoma
County.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gotten it to, you know, the it's
really thriving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're hoping the longer we grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you have something like that,
are you still trying to kind of gently
[SPEAKER_04]: breed it in a direction or are you like,
this is perfect as is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I just need to get it consistently
like where every flowering plant is like
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: You try and take care of the soil
differently, better every year also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that the plant, you find out where it
thrives in the ecosystem and then try to
[SPEAKER_02]: foster that ecosystem around.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's addressing this iteration of
that plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you like, I'm happy with where ACDC is
or are you trying to breed it in some sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of direction to express itself slightly
differently?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we're there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still, you know, everybody's still
learning on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a new farm that we're
regenerating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four years ago, it was almost a used car
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a 12 junk cars everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: The place was destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've been rehabilitating and
cleaning up this place, but it was the one
[SPEAKER_01]: place that we found that we could get
permitted to cultivate on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're rehabbing this farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had this golden ridge soil,
which was basically inert.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've been working with compost and to
get it to a point where you felt
[SPEAKER_04]: comfortable planting because you plant in
the soil, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So what'd you need to do from junk yard to
feeling confident about planting that in
[SPEAKER_04]: the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're lucky that in the space that we
cleared for cultivation was a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of ways from where most of the junk cars
were.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was where our parking is and things
like that, that there was a bunch of junk
[SPEAKER_01]: cars that got hauled away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we'd stick a shovel in the
ground, we'd find a box of forks or it was
[SPEAKER_01]: odd restaurant things or a radiator,
a little hotel room service, salt and
[SPEAKER_01]: pepper shakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found them forever while we were
cleaning all that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we basically accumulated all the junk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But where our cultivation space is,
which we're only allowed to 10,000 square
[SPEAKER_01]: feet, it's fairly fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't much anything else,
but it's this golden ridge soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: which basically has nothing in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've been working with hugelkultur
and we're slowly working ourselves towards
[SPEAKER_01]: a no till and a closed loop system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But every year we plant cover crops and
then we chop and drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We add compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: We create our own compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: What cover crops are you growing for what
kind of minerals or nutrient?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure on the minerals and nutrients
that we're specifically trying to work on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, that's one of the things
that's tough about what we're doing now is
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get to spend time on the farm
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the guys that I learned from,
the guys that I look up to as cultivators
[SPEAKER_01]: are now in charge of our cultivation team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the only way I get to follow up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody on our family.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our all of our cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really look up to them and they know so
much more than I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's gone so much further than where
we started.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about some of the things that
you've learned from them along the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so what you're asking what we just
did with the ACDC two years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: we threw them in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grew them the best we could.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they tested a 20 to one CB to THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they all went and took classes on
biodynamics, permaculture, and they dug
[SPEAKER_02]: hugel beds, you know, dead oak boughs,
compost, grass clippings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put the plants on top of that with
earthworm tubes and create living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So less water, more biodynamics working
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next year it tested a 30 to one CB
to THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the way that they've all been
working together, trying to figure out the
[SPEAKER_02]: new practices, try to build the soil so
that each year the plants are hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: better example of themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually wondering if we keep going,
how long if it'll take to, I think we said
[SPEAKER_01]: this before, if you keep growing a strain
in the same place over and over and over
[SPEAKER_01]: again and take it back to seed or
regenerate it so it gets that memory of
[SPEAKER_01]: that place, how long before we create it
back to another land race?
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a new place.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a new place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Snowa Durbin, there it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I assume you have like mothers on site and
you're doing your own clippings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you're not buying from nurseries.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like you're essentially your own
breeder and nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have our own nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order for us to keep everything we've
had trouble finding people that we wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to work with that we felt could do things
as well as we could.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because of that, we do our own
nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do our own manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do our own processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do our own distribution and we do
everything education first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everybody and everybody,
our team, whether you're a cultivator or
[SPEAKER_01]: whether you work in processing,
we all go around and do each other's jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we all know what each other has to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys went up and spent their time
working on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've also spent time working on the
manufacturing and production line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, all sorts of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grass is always greener on the other side
of the fence in this world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all of a sudden traffic is sounding
fun again when it was 100 degrees on
[SPEAKER_02]: Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys were digging holes out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, traffic sounds awesome right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last three years in a row, the hottest
days of the year have been when we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wait, the Tuesday after Meadowlands?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was vicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our garden went in that day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was driving past Santa Cruz and Salinas
and it was like 110.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was brutal.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were digging holes like, no,
no, I have stuff to do inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does that do to the plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been hardening the plants off for
quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've been outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plants really, I mean,
that's the terroir.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're going to get naturally
because we're so close to the coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to have hot days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have cold nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have fog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just what we produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's going to affect the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to show different expressions
based on how that plant lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have high winds up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the Petaluma wind gap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the Durban and the ACDC both seem
to really love.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a harsher condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we go full term too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not trying to rush a finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: We let the plants go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we won the grow off last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was white Tahoe cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we put it in these hugel beds and did
compost teas and pretty much just let the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant tell us what it needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we pretty much left it alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these ladies are not host plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to listen to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've really got to watch and pay
attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're learning as we go all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who's been a cultivator has made
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lesson is just not to make the same
mistakes twice or learn to notice ahead of
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then setting up your system so you
don't have to plant lots of beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, get beneficial insects,
create a very biodiverse area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're mixing cannabis and you said
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all sorts of different plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're going to do clovers over to
keep it at different heights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love using Cosmos.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're beautiful flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sunflowers, I love those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Catnip's a great one to have as a
companion plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course with the traditional
herbs, we do basil and thyme and rosemary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know why?
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously some attract the right insects,
push off the wrong insects.
[SPEAKER_04]: Others, when they die, they have good
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're learning as we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just trying to create a lot of
biodiversity out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along the fence line, we're planting the
three sisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing corn, squash, and beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: The corn does a good job of screening
aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we like the biodiversity of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also plant our food and vegetables
around there, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to create a closed loose
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: So take the ACDC.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's expression of itself as flower,
which is here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then also you're pushing it in
different directions, meaning from flower
[SPEAKER_04]: to tincture, from flower to other types of
products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So talk about how a specific cultivar
expresses itself as it's extracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we don't really do an extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most important thing is what we do is
a long, slow cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow the best flower in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you rush it out the door,
it's not going to have time to mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do things like you can fresh
freeze it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to retain the brightness,
that freshness.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a young tequila that hasn't been
aged.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very zingy and poppy and green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can flash freeze it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can extract from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to get some wonderful
live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or something that's going to be very
bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cannabis is like wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's almost the opposite of what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the opposite of what we do,
is we want a long, slow cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we dry it very slowly in specific
humidity and temperature conditions,
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we want the plant to do is slowly
allow the chlorophyll and things like that
[SPEAKER_01]: to degrade and the terpenes to express
themselves fully and oxidize just a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to continue to change and
grow and grow in depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially if you cure it long enough
to where it becomes stable and you seal it
[SPEAKER_01]: off, you can get great expression of
terpenes that will change over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a tange kush that we aged for three
years that was just velvety and wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some Durban.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just smoked two different harvests of
Durban.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can tell that it gets that richer,
more full flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the next Durban.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you were saying about how we show
the expression of the ACDC, you used the
[SPEAKER_02]: word extraction and we don't do an
extraction, which is what makes us
[SPEAKER_02]: different from a lot of the companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry to insult you.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just how we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how Fiddler's Greens is different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's the cure and then there's like
the slow decarboxylation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to oxidize, oxidize a little
bit, but we don't want it to decarb a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: because a lot of like our ACDC and our
tincture lines, we work with raw
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to cure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that it expresses the right terpenes
and changes just enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we infuse it into organic olive
oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to have CBDA and THCA and CBGA
and the acidic cannabinoids in one line of
[SPEAKER_01]: our tinctures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we do decarboxylate for the other
line because all of the different
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and terpenes affect the body
differently and work with the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system differently between
raw, acidic and decarboxylated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Randomly, are you sourcing the olive oil
from like California, from Greece,
[SPEAKER_04]: from, are you learning about that part too
where like we have a preference for?
[SPEAKER_01]: We are really looking for local producers
and we're trying to talk, we're in talks
[SPEAKER_01]: with a couple of different local olive oil
producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the scary things is we have to
go through a lot of lab testing process
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the testing we have to do for
our final products.
[SPEAKER_01]: If any of the ingredients along the way
and olive oil, which one you've grown
[SPEAKER_04]: don't have to adhere to the same strict
standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even close to our standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not even close.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your cannabis is going to be clean,
but you fail because you're olive oil now,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is scary, you know, in a handmade,
you know, boutique product like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it seems like they're kind of like
Kraft NorCal olive farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the, and matching them with your
fine Kraft cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the bong has?
[SPEAKER_04]: Durbin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Durbin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought which year was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is 2018.
[SPEAKER_04]: How is the ACDC smoke?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going to do that next,
right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the jar up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's you said this version is now 30
to one where you originally were 24 to
[SPEAKER_04]: one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you think it's going to keep going?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like at some point it's going to be like,
all right, this is as maxed out on CBD as
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I think we want to have the
full, like the CBD is just one part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a single note.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, so that kind of gets to my question
is like, you're going to lose something
[SPEAKER_04]: else if you keep pushing the CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like when people push THC as far as
it can go, other people are now pushing
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD as far as this one goes to 11.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, that may not be the best
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and it's not something we're
intentionally trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're doing is trying to create a
great living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that we're going to create the
environment where the plant's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: want to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not doing anything specific to
alter the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have been working with the same
genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you pick which ones to turn into
moms, you are kind of selecting for
[SPEAKER_04]: something, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So what in, for example, the ACDC in the
last round of selection, do you kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: like, I like this characteristic that this
plant has versus all the other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been pretty consistent with for
several years growing this strain of ACDC
[SPEAKER_01]: and we've got it pretty well stabilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so generally it's just with the vigor
of the plant that we look at and we
[SPEAKER_01]: refresh our mothers quite frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: This year we're flowering out a bunch of
the mothers and we're also using it for
[SPEAKER_01]: our grow six big ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to, we're trying to encourage
anybody who wants to grow their six plants
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow six plants and then share with
somebody that can't grow or can't afford
[SPEAKER_01]: it or is zoned out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way we're just trying to teach
everybody to grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, get your hands in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you doing any tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_01]: We are looking into that where it's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all researching reading books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's, that's one of those things
that we have to research everything we're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just, you know, going,
this is the ACDC.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're back in school nonstop.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're not reading articles,
we're sharing articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to lectures.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go to community groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go to medical lectures to listen to the
doctors and the research, tell us what's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we ingest cannabis, we go and listen
to these amazing cultivators and old
[SPEAKER_01]: school people who've been doing it for
generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're trying to learn from everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love it that we get to do this out
in the open now that we get to talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody because for years we had to do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, unless you knew
somebody, nobody was going to share with
[SPEAKER_01]: you how they were growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I walked around for years with a
copy of Jorge with duct tape over the
[SPEAKER_01]: cover so I can read it in public.
[SPEAKER_02]: That tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know 30 to one CBD to THC right out of
the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just infused into all of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's our next cultivar and let's
compare these two.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's do, let's do the Silver OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Silver OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let you break this out and we're
going to use the Firefly two vaporizer and
[SPEAKER_01]: then we have the Firefly two plus.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why don't you tell us about the two and
the two plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are a great little vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do both flower and concentrate or
hash in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been learning how to use this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bit of a learning curve with all
of them, but this one's convection.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to talk about the flower,
Joe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is Silver OG from Spring Creek.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our Vanna White.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our friend Zelly grew this out in
Casaderos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually won third place in the Emerald
Cup in 2017.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Indica style like you read about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time we smoke this, it's exactly
what you're looking for at the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: night when you don't want to do anything
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sit down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to sit on the beach and watch
the derbys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh yeah, that sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like the derby where I want to get up
and clean my freaking house and shit like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that time and a place for both
of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is 26%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what Zelly does is he's done Korean
no-till.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 10 year living sale and he and his wife
have been working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: They feed the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't feed the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going to this place, their farm is
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just 100% biodynamic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They live totally off the grid up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're growing amazing cannabis in a
beautiful light depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a welder, so he's built their barns
out of containers and all these amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: structures in the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they live in an amazing year out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just grow delicious cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're lucky enough to have them in our
portfolio and represent somebody who's
[SPEAKER_02]: doing things the right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beyond organic, beyond biodynamic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the way it's supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Protecting from the sun to the ground and
doing it exactly the way it's supposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Introducing the right bugs, the right
ecosystem around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The farm is one of the coolest farms I've
ever been to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you guys ever done big lines of
cocaine with Jody?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's he like afterwards?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's Jody like after one Coca-Cola?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a cup of coffee?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is waking up in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never had a cup of coffee in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wake up like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm wondering what you would be like if
you did not smoke weed and you took
[SPEAKER_04]: something like coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we want to see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done a thousand volumes today to get
to here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm chilling out right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is me at half speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the one thing that we promised
him when he came to work with us full time
[SPEAKER_01]: was, you can have infinity weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Infinity cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultimate dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the Firefly 2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the 2 Plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got this one set for temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has an app that you put on your phone
so you can control the temperature with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you actually use the phone app?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to change the temperature because I
love flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And vaping flour you really get to taste
the terpenes and you get to taste the
[SPEAKER_01]: complexity of the flour without getting
the combustion in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also do concentrates and hash
out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can change the temperature if you
want to do the higher temperature for the
[SPEAKER_01]: hash around 480 is what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I do a lower one for the flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do you do for the flour
temperature wise?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to remember what I have it on
here for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think 280.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think 280.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds legit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So talk about when you this is what I like
is that this is flour you grew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But imagine this for the flour you grew.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're smoking the joint of that
versus this I know you touched on some of
[SPEAKER_04]: the differences but like what do you do
you like it as much in a different way?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like I like red and white wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like all one all the time or all
the other ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like do you like vaping your own flour
sometimes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to vape my own flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to vape other flours too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to smoke and vape it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to smoke and I used cannabis to
stop smoking tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I still enjoy the combustion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can detect different things when
you've combust the flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: You watch the way it burns.
[SPEAKER_01]: You listen to the way it burns.
[SPEAKER_01]: You smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see how the ash is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see how the ash holds together.
[SPEAKER_01]: To see well one the quality of the roll
but to the quality of the flour to hold a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice long ash that turns white.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can smell if somebody didn't you
know if it was grown indoors and they use
[SPEAKER_01]: newts if it wasn't flushed properly or if
there was something on the flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the same thing with the vape but
you get more of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more herbal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get the combustion with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have you know the hot ash and
you know it's got a good mouth feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you know really getting the
bouquet of the glass of wine before you
[SPEAKER_01]: take a sip.
[SPEAKER_04]: I view you at the end of a day of smoking
as like if a horse got its lips on a
[SPEAKER_04]: table.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like remember in a bachelor party.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys see the movie Bachelor Party.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah where the donkey starts eating all
like the tranquilizers like all the drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a new one on the market though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah this is they call it the Firefly Plus
and they change the airflow through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is nice but I feel like you have
to draw a little hard on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to pull a little more firmly with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one Jody and I have been using
this one for the last three days and we've
[SPEAKER_01]: been testing and sampling some of Frenchy
Canole's hash out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we do that out of this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Jody what are our thoughts on the
difference between the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the first time I've used this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've worked on getting this one dialed in
so I've been smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've never used the older one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is the Frenchy hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah this is some of Frenchy's hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is strawberry banana with a metal
lens when we got to do the hookah there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from whose farm do you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Jacob's farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Flower Days.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Frenchy did that with his flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: With Flower Days farm flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just touch the sides and the bowl
heats up there and just take a nice easy
[SPEAKER_01]: pull on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man that tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what's that tasting like for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that perfect hash flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it's just a little bit floral.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hash of shin I think or hash of
sheen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the terpene that they're equating it
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But beta.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Beta karyophylline?
[SPEAKER_01]: No beta mercine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beta mercine.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's aged in hash it converts to a
terpene hash of sheen which gives the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis or the hash that hash flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah it's super tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Spring Creek Silver OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch it bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this gives the bowl a stir.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a Frenchy Canoleata hookah set
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: A vaporizing hookah in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no less than half an ounce in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Twice a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just sit around like it was
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cameron said you won.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Jody won the hookah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turns out I like hash out of a hookah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frenchy and Lachlan and Bell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Bell is Frenchy's apprentice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to have and I wish I had done it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to have her and Frenchy sit down
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Master apprentice and just talk about like
from her perspective like what she learned
[SPEAKER_04]: from this guy over the course of she's
been with him for what two years?
[SPEAKER_04]: Five.
[SPEAKER_04]: Five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like a medieval apprentice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like do you know anybody who's like I've
been this person's apprentice for five
[SPEAKER_04]: years and I got three more to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh if that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean that's that's one of these things
is cannabis is like sailing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there's no end to the rabbit
holes of learning to go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get into the soil microbiome or
you can get into the curing or the hash
[SPEAKER_01]: making or the product making or now into
the distribution or the manufacture the
[SPEAKER_01]: processing the actual physically running
the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just so many things that you can
go down the rabbit holes but to see a
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship like that with you know
getting to learn from somebody and she's a
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing hash maker too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well didn't she spend this past year like
growing like I'm gonna learn to grow too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just smoked some of her cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah she was one of her buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just smoked some earlier like an hour
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah in our preparatory smoke session to
prep for the smoke session.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that the joint we smoked when we first
came in?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah that was Val's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think she made a lot of that hash to be
smoked at Meadowlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: From her own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah they did a badass team.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: They took good care of us up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's playing a long game.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like in 10 years I'm gonna be the
best hash maker in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah she's I see that absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wait so what was this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh the flower or the this is the Firefly
2?
[SPEAKER_04]: No no no which flower?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh it was this one right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Seacon Zellig's it says Spring Creek
Farm Silver OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm and that's French's hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to try that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah so you just touch the buttons on the
side and you'll see it flash green three
[SPEAKER_01]: times and once it stays solid green keep
touching the buttons and just inhale for
[SPEAKER_01]: 10-20 seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait it just disappeared though.
Wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah we've got to make sure it's still
green.
[SPEAKER_02]: We met Oakland yesterday at 7 a.m.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright wait so what am I?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's two pads on the side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinch those two pads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it'll flash three times and when
it stays green like that keep holding the
[SPEAKER_01]: buttons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything there's stuff in there
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's still right that should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see if we need to add some more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah let's put some more.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's give you a fresh one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Zell tastes like more to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember at the grow off where he
just started ripping through everything
[SPEAKER_04]: and I was like we got like eight more
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: He wanted to do like each one on every
device and I was like no no no we have to
[SPEAKER_04]: taste every one of these and you're like
yeah that's cool too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I have another one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like no dude like we're gonna try them all
like oh yeah but that's really delicious.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just one more though.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just walked in I was I was extra fired
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you believe that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're doing prices right fired up.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: 54.
[SPEAKER_01]: 420 Drew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have any questions from the peanut
gallery?
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright well wait so we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: In an ideal world where do you guys see
the cannabis market heading in the future?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know not only for yourselves but for
the whole cannabis community and market
[SPEAKER_06]: itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: What would be an ideal way to handle some
of these bigger issues that are hitting
[SPEAKER_06]: the market?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know some of the stuff that be bugging
you that you've seen from the inside
[SPEAKER_06]: because you know you're dealing with the
taxes you're dealing with the crazy rates
[SPEAKER_06]: from the state.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're dealing with the regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're seeing you know what's really going
on.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just got heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideally this goes federally legal as soon
as possible and we can start getting
[SPEAKER_02]: people in other states medicine from
places that do it the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have so much cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have so much knowledge from all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have two totally different groups
who are a site for the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the massive Santa Barbara growers who
are growing way too much for California
[SPEAKER_04]: are like we need global we need national
slash global markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the craft growers who could like
L.A.
[SPEAKER_04]: shops you don't want our amazing sun grown
outdoor regenerative cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well fuck you because everybody else does.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to sell it to the rest of the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a global market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean there's going to be places like the
Virgin Islands they're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow you know their strains that are
special to there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know that we don't want to
homogenize the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want everybody to have their own unique
little space of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just need to treat it like share it
with everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows on trees you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah when we get our medicine of
people in the rest of the country I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: like we're five percent of the world's
population to take 70 percent of the
[SPEAKER_02]: pills.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like now you're not on Xanax anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not on Ambien, Zoloft, Prozoloft.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not taking Advil every morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: No that is the Silvero gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right it's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one I'm still figuring out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like we should have some Star Wars
music playing with this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll put the Mendo in this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the Sprint Creek.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guys farm was so unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like it is like everything in
perfect balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah the first time we tried this we were
on the beach and we just basically sat
[SPEAKER_02]: down like you know I don't want to work
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know before I just said that because I
have to go out to dinner with my wife and
[SPEAKER_04]: my baby in like two hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: No because the ACDC will help balance that
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it less high and more enjoyable
for everybody in the restaurant.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good for him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good for babies and puppies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the great things about CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The grinder slash joint filler.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a fun thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah it's got two different attachments on
it so you can either put the with the
[SPEAKER_01]: syringe function so you can go right into
a rolling paper or blunt or a cone and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can put the little cap in it and
fill that up and put it into your vape or
[SPEAKER_01]: load it into something else or your paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the fun thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that's a great time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love cannabis toys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny you build up so many
collections like and then when you move
[SPEAKER_01]: you wind up doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah this goes with the ghost so the ghost
vaporizer they use these little crucibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're little pots that you put the yeah
I guess you would call it a pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put the lid on it and this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah I need this one so like when you
travel.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has got some heft to it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a piece of hardware.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah it's as solid as it looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright I think we're ready to go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit the button in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait for it to buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let him try the ghost either.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all fun toys they have up north.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Press and hold that back button until it
vibrates once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep holding it and inhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah it feels like a hand grenade.
[SPEAKER_05]: This button.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah press and hold it and wait for it to
vibrate once and then keep holding it and
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Mendo breath.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like you have to crank up the heat
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah because I have one at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: I called them up and I was like how do you
like switch the temperatures and they
[SPEAKER_04]: explained it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're in charge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh you want me to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have to remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just experimenting with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me a.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like you hit the front three times
to do something right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hand me my phone over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pulled up the user manual.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah and then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're not controlling this from your
via your app on your phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah that's just talks about the battery.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why should I have super high news.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to figure the instructions out.
[SPEAKER_04]: How long does it take.
[SPEAKER_04]: And go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the temperature setting for dry
herb we should be two flashing amber LEDs
[SPEAKER_01]: as the default heat setting setting to
increase vapor intensity select one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: higher presets for lighter vapor reduced
to low indicated by one amber LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: The concentrate preset is indicated by
three flashing red LEDs and should not be
[SPEAKER_01]: used for herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back to my phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: So three flashing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's green flashing that's giving the
battery indication it says press and hold
[SPEAKER_01]: the mode button to display battery level
release then press and hold again to
[SPEAKER_02]: display the current heat setting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cameron I'm loving your focus right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm admiring it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was told there would be no math.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first time I noticed that
there was a pool down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was all misty out before.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's who knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to go that high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh damn it I think we had it but I went to
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need you now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on herb high.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you get into that mode where you
change the temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you press and hold this mode button
once and then release press and hold again
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the second time it'll show the
heat level and then you click on it to
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle through and with the three amber
lights it's the high setting for herb and
[SPEAKER_01]: so I think we should set our phasers for
high.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on three clicks to start it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One push here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the three clicks were to
change the temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it an old college try.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can taste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't get much vapor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah that's why you have to keep cranking
it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wait for the long buzz and go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The champion of the hookah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more longevity than anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not seeing a cloud but what was that
somebody told us if you see a big cloud
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like spinning your beer out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No we were told that it's what I was told
is you breathe it in naturally and you
[SPEAKER_02]: breathe it out naturally and that's going
to maximize the amount of cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: you're getting out of the smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holding it in is just creating it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I use that at home I never see vapor
but then I'm always like I'm really high
[SPEAKER_04]: right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it definitely works.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't really see vapor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: No it tastes great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was about to say I don't think I got
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it's so good that it's just pure air
coming up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just buzzing now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah it is going crazy but I do feel very
high.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does seem to have been effective.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to go back to my roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I carry with me everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the only way to smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that was the first thing I ever
smoked out of in like sixth grade or
[SPEAKER_04]: something.
[SPEAKER_04]: That and a protopite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the protopite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would always bend the poker and you
could never get it back into its holder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a disaster.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't clean that thing once a week
you would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah dugouts are the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've carried one of these for over 20
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I carry my bong wherever I go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really big pockets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we smoking under the baddie?
[SPEAKER_04]: The baddie is Durbin.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been hitting the Durbin.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been in and out of the lineup
tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some GG4.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's delicious.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right so what do we have if we go down
the line what do we have?
[SPEAKER_04]: Vanna White take it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: These both came from Yolo right from my
guys out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes we have a GG4 and a Mendo breath
from our friends in Yolo County.
[SPEAKER_02]: GG4 is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an indica style so this gets you nice
and nice and body high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only 16% so it doesn't make you
stupid so you can still get up and go do
[SPEAKER_02]: things because I don't particularly care
about indica or sativa so I try to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: doing everything in my life no matter what
I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mendo breath is a little more sativa
style though a little higher THC as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great uplifting makes you want to go run
around do things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah and then we smoked the Silver Creek
OG from Spring Creek OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spring Creek from Silver.
[SPEAKER_04]: Silver OG from Spring Creek Farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you pressed your own flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: For rosin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never done anything on a commercial
scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking to some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would love to do something a hundred
meter hash is what we call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the farms that we work with and all
the farms that are out there that grow and
[SPEAKER_01]: specialize in their own strain we would
love to see all of them make the top shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: hash from all of their flower and call it
the hundred meter hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we call it's the hash that
never makes it a hundred meters off the
[SPEAKER_01]: farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that's something that's that's
specialty craft right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that's going to set each
area apart is you know just like you hear
[SPEAKER_01]: Frenchy talk about the hash makers he's
met that they don't care about the strain
[SPEAKER_01]: they care about what valley it was grown
in what altitude it was grown in what were
[SPEAKER_01]: the weather condition where it was grown
and that determined the quality and the
[SPEAKER_01]: care of the aging and the the processing
of the plant how much care you take
[SPEAKER_01]: through it and how you don't rush it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to make a lot of really
special places pop forward and the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that really learn the craft.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well it's funny I asked Frenchy if like La
Creme right that what he considers to be
[SPEAKER_04]: the best out of like a hundred pound batch
does he keep it for himself still or does
[SPEAKER_04]: he put is he like I really want this just
for me but I have to put it into the
[SPEAKER_04]: market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he keeps it for himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: He keeps it for himself yeah he said I get
that that's my head stash for the year
[SPEAKER_02]: then I press it again you know there's
seven or eight times but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it sounds like he eats a ton of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to take the best stuff off of
the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to admit that's great I used when I
was in Amsterdam I used to put hash in my
[SPEAKER_01]: coffee every morning and that's how we'd
start the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hippie speedball.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have we missed anything?
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we do blue cheese?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have blue cheese?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are we going to do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah we didn't use your vape.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really have anything specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have white buffalo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we put that in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know can you put?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The puffco is badass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never did a bunch of dabs because I hate
the friggin torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like a crack ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was sure that I was going to make
some serious bodily harm on myself because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's just how things end.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know like I read this book for four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah the torch does that for me too but
that's one of the nice things about you
[SPEAKER_01]: know the vaporizers is the vaporizers you
can do good hash or concentrates and vape
[SPEAKER_01]: it not have to have the blowtorch.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why the puffco peak is so badass
because there's no friggin torch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow that's so nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that one's still the strawberry
banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even better.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start with that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do them both.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright so that's what we did on the
Firefly 2 Plus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this will be a different experience
than that for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah so just a little bit in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You push it twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it heats up for 20 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after 20 seconds it'll go green.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can start just pulling it
like a ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how simple that dab is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I got a blowtorch and shit and
fucking trying to kill everybody around
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I had a butane.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a butane?
[SPEAKER_04]: What it also does is it gives you the
ability to dab just like every four
[SPEAKER_04]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I bet you would do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It puts mind numbing dab hits at your
fingers hips at any instant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after about 20 seconds it beeps.
[SPEAKER_02]: After it beeps you push it twice and it
redoes another 20 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can do that up to four times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is yum.
[SPEAKER_01]: No blowtorch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Joe do you tell us the story of the
dude who that skull belonged to?
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you do to him?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from Thailand where they do not
care for cannabis yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I figured it would be a good place to
put your weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I brought it back for Cameron.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course he put his weed in the fucking
eyeballs and not in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was missing a little something.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so tasty.
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually tastes like strawberry
lemonade.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright well so compare the taste of the
same Frenchy hash out of the Firefly and
[SPEAKER_04]: the Puffco.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we'll have to try this again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I think we're gonna have to go back
and revisit.
[SPEAKER_01]: When doing a concentrate you need to give
it a few pulls to get it melted.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't quite get there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was weak.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah that's really tasty.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the Puffco.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had this thing in Pebble Beach.
It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you were hitting when you
took this selfie in front of Tiger Woods?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know he had joints too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure Tiger Woods just had his time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a similar concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Puffco felt more like a dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the crew tapping out?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try it.
[SPEAKER_05]: In some countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: These two buttons.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then hold it until it stays green.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll flash green a few times.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you gotta hold them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Up on the top we'll see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah right top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say give it like 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go away a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just buzzed again.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's green though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that feels more like a dab
experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Solid green you're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When this thing's really ripping it feels
like a full dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: This makes it a little bit more modest.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first time I hit this I was you know
annihilated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although this thing travels really well
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes in this little box and it's
perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know like when you put a little water
in it and you're like I don't have any
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: It couldn't be easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah you're not whipping out the tornado
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can sit there and you can bring it
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mergers is traveling with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't even know what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't decide which one I want to stick
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I walk with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always have a dugout on me but I walk
with one two or more of these at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: My bag I have to stop every now and then
and start pulling things around in joints
[SPEAKER_01]: and pre rolls and all different kinds of
smoking utensils and vape pens and
[SPEAKER_01]: cartridges and I love it because we all
share.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a we're always handing each
other a different vape pen or a cart to
[SPEAKER_01]: try or we find somebody who's doing
something really neat you know out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of nowhere and we grab a little bit
of their stuff and we share it out and get
[SPEAKER_01]: to all try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah it's hard to tell which one was
better than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They fucking both taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're fucking lucky as shit to be
smoking out of these two amazing utensils
[SPEAKER_02]: in a Frenchy cannoli's hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is about as lucky as it gets in my
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of the force they didn't tell you
about this job in high school.
[SPEAKER_04]: No kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis device product tester.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing what today where?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like car and driver recording.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually get to that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah we smoked so much of Frenchy's hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So delicious and like if you sit around
like look no one wants this tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay I'll just keep smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you keep your thumb over it so
the suction would stay and you're like
[SPEAKER_02]: nobody wants this tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Lachlan's already got two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bell's got two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well if they can't do any more like I have
to hold this here and I'm not gonna stand
[SPEAKER_02]: there with it and not smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden there was three of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like oh man respect you won.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit alright good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're given that opportunity to hang
out like that and smoke that koi thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that then it was like Frenchy's
rolling splits.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has the chillum like back to the puka.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole overall experience of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know to be with so many like-minded
cannolis professionals.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know like people have been grinding
and doing this for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll exchange ideas so freely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're saying it's so neat to be able
to talk about in the open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people are telling things that you
would never ever talked about to anyone
[SPEAKER_02]: else.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know three or four years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's hey man you've done this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay hey try this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know talk to this person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like no shit alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was such a cool thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to have Frenchy sharing his hash
with us and his team and you know everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing their own stuff into the place to
share.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know we had a really fun time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah it was like group therapy in the
woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously for all of us getting out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: No cell service just shut off and all of
this problem solving together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah man meeting people in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know we had tequila tasting at 3 a.m.
