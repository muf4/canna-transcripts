[SPEAKER_12]: So with that, I'm going to go ahead and
introduce myself and the panel.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Jen Hensley.
[SPEAKER_12]: I work for the Sierra Club.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've worked there for 22 years,
worked on a host of issues from water
[SPEAKER_12]: pollution to energy use.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm one of our lobbyists.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I worked in the Illinois State House
for many, many years, and then
[SPEAKER_12]: transitioned to working with our state
lobbyists all across the country.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you're working in a particular
state, chances are you're working with
[SPEAKER_12]: somebody from my team.
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're the folks talking about,
hey, what about water pollution?
[SPEAKER_12]: And hey, what about your energy use?
[SPEAKER_12]: So welcome.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going to kick off to Brian here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_10]: Brian Anderson.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm an architect in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Kay set me up pretty well.
[SPEAKER_10]: I practice in the cannabis space for six
years.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our firm is located in Cambridge,
and now recently, Fullerton, California.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we focus on energy issues.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've worked with the state of
Massachusetts in some of those
[SPEAKER_10]: behind-the-scenes round tables in giving
feedback to the state.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Molly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Molly Graham.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a senior program manager at the
Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance,
[SPEAKER_03]: where I focus on commercial building,
energy efficiency programs, market
[SPEAKER_03]: transformation initiatives, and most
recently, cannabis energy efficiency
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunities.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little bit newer to the cannabis
space.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been working on it for maybe about
the last two years, but have been deeply
[SPEAKER_03]: ingrained in energy efficiency for about
the last six.
[SPEAKER_03]: MIA is a membership-based organization.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my role is really just to bring
resources and best practices to our
[SPEAKER_03]: members in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's why I attend conferences
like these to learn and just bring
[SPEAKER_03]: information to the Midwest so people can
form utility energy efficiency programs
[SPEAKER_03]: and shape better policies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Molly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name's Michael Wheeler.
[SPEAKER_08]: And previously, I was an energy policy
professional.
[SPEAKER_08]: I spent the majority of my career working
partly in the private sector, for a large
[SPEAKER_08]: solar developer, and partly in the public
sector also.
[SPEAKER_08]: Private.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also working for California State Public
Utilities Commission designing energy
[SPEAKER_08]: efficiency programs for utilities here in
the state.
[SPEAKER_08]: The last three years, I've been a cannabis
policy professional.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this is actually my first energy
conference in three years.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm excited to be here and excited to see
these two issues come together finally.
[SPEAKER_08]: Looking forward to the conversation today.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: Derek Smith, Resource Innovation
Institute.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know a little bit about us,
so I'll just keep it focused on the policy
[SPEAKER_14]: dimension of what we do.
[SPEAKER_14]: Our role is really to make sure that as
policy comes to controlled environment ag,
[SPEAKER_14]: that the right people are around the table
to make sure that we have an inclusive
[SPEAKER_14]: dialogue that is capturing all the
interests and really thinking
[SPEAKER_14]: comprehensively about how we establish
good policy that will actually make sure
[SPEAKER_14]: that it has industry input and a
well-rounded approach so that all the
[SPEAKER_14]: market actors are considered in the
outcome.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, obviously that data can
help inform the right decisions and we
[SPEAKER_14]: have flexibility and innovation.
[SPEAKER_14]: And just again, as I said this morning,
like we want to make sure that if the
[SPEAKER_14]: focus is on carbon as an example,
then let's really make sure we talk about
[SPEAKER_14]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_14]: If the focus is on energy, great.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's be clear about that.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's focus on energy.
[SPEAKER_14]: But just make sure we're having the right
dialogue.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're setting up the right metrics because
this industry, this whole new thing has
[SPEAKER_14]: the opportunity to leapfrog if we get it
right from the very start of all of this.
[SPEAKER_14]: So unique opportunity and we're just
really thrilled to have you all here
[SPEAKER_14]: because obviously you are the type of
folks that will ensure a good outcome
[SPEAKER_14]: here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Please engage.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll just point you to the URL that's on
the bottom of the screen here.
[SPEAKER_14]: We are running a policy survey and we
will, we want you all to just do that as
[SPEAKER_14]: you want throughout this session.
[SPEAKER_14]: We will report the findings tomorrow as we
have, as we enter our conversation about
[SPEAKER_14]: energy codes and how they will affect
controlled environment ag.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you again.
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank you, Jen, for coming.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're going to dive right into some
questions that we talked about as a group.
[SPEAKER_12]: But then we're going to offer you plenty
of time to ask your own questions.
[SPEAKER_12]: So can I move to the slide, please?
[SPEAKER_12]: Brian, so this is your slide.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you kick us off with the current
discussions happening around canopy use?
[SPEAKER_10]: As an architect working in Massachusetts,
and I work nationally and internationally,
[SPEAKER_10]: this question came up on an online forum
and is something that I deal with in
[SPEAKER_10]: every, every project.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it has, there's some minutiae here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've got text I'll go through.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got some graphics here that,
you know, are maybe hard to read.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I want to take the chance to kind
of walk through them with you.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things about sort of being an
architect is that, you know, I'm in a room
[SPEAKER_10]: full of policy people, utility people and
scientists, engineers, architects tend to
[SPEAKER_10]: speculate on things.
[SPEAKER_10]: Much of what I do is not always
scientific.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not specifically rooted, but I'm
trying to balance the science,
[SPEAKER_10]: the policy, and in the case of cannabis,
workflow efficiency.
[SPEAKER_10]: How does work get done?
[SPEAKER_10]: How do we do every day what we're doing?
[SPEAKER_10]: And so these, I've got two slides here to
talk about, hopefully quickly.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's confusion on how, and I think this
can help, and I'm hoping it can help with
[SPEAKER_10]: your feedback.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do we define canopy gets in directly
to how we shape policy that affects energy
[SPEAKER_10]: use?
[SPEAKER_10]: So this confusion came about a few weeks
ago, maybe a month ago, or at least it
[SPEAKER_10]: came about as a forum that the confusion's
been there for a while.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's a definition on the top which
comes from our state law in Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_10]: 935 CMR 500.
[SPEAKER_10]: And below the line is a clarification
document that came out in January in which
[SPEAKER_10]: the definitions here now we're using
specific language.
[SPEAKER_10]: Specific language meaning new three and
four letter acronyms.
[SPEAKER_10]: Horticultural lighting power density.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we do get in some math here.
[SPEAKER_10]: We got numerators and denominators to
figure out horizontal lighting equipment
[SPEAKER_10]: and horizontal lighting square feet
divided gives you horizontal lighting
[SPEAKER_10]: power density.
[SPEAKER_10]: The confusion has come about as how do we
define canopy?
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I get back into why as an architect
I tend to speculate on things.
[SPEAKER_10]: I read codes all the time, and I have to
make proposals.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't always get to talk to the people
who wrote the code and understand what
[SPEAKER_10]: their intent was.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I always have to offer my opinion.
[SPEAKER_10]: I always have to sort of speculate on the
behalf of my customers how we're gonna
[SPEAKER_10]: move through this.
[SPEAKER_10]: So some of the confusion is here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Canopy maybe is here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Could be non-contiguous.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'll go from the top.
[SPEAKER_10]: Canopy is, Illinois is also dealing with
this.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want to give some perspective.
[SPEAKER_10]: Illinois has adopted the same law,
410 ILSF or whatever the law is they've
[SPEAKER_10]: adopted this.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is gonna come up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's, canopy is to be
calculated square feet measured using
[SPEAKER_10]: clearly identifiable boundaries of all
areas that will contain mature plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: So mature plants right there has led to
confusion at any point in time,
[SPEAKER_10]: including all of the spaces within the
boundaries.
[SPEAKER_10]: Canopy may be non-continuous.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can have lots of different rooms
containing canopy.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're non-contiguous.
[SPEAKER_10]: But each unique area included in the total
canopy calculations shall be separated by
[SPEAKER_10]: an identifiable boundary.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those boundaries may include interior
walls, shelves, greenhouse walls,
[SPEAKER_10]: hoop house walls, garden benches,
hedgerows.
[SPEAKER_10]: So lots of stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then this last sentence also has
caused some confusion.
[SPEAKER_10]: If mature plants are being cultivated
using a shelving system, then the surface
[SPEAKER_10]: area of each level shall be included in
the canopy calculation.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll let that sit.
[SPEAKER_10]: So then horticultural lighting equipment,
we know what that is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Any fixture that uses energy for the
cultivation of plants, so not your general
[SPEAKER_10]: lighting not your egress lights,
just the cultivation dedicated fixtures.
[SPEAKER_10]: At any stage of growth, so that includes
cloning, germination and cloning.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think these pieces helped me to
understand or formulate my speculation
[SPEAKER_10]: which I'll show in the second slide.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's important that, so these words that
I'm latching onto are interior walls.
[SPEAKER_10]: Interior walls are used to define the
space in which the plant grows.
[SPEAKER_10]: So in including horticultural lighting,
at any stage of plant growth, I think is
[SPEAKER_10]: also impactful to calculate and
understanding why mature plants,
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel, is lending confusion.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because in Massachusetts or in other
places, when using metric, the system for
[SPEAKER_10]: seed to sale, we don't put the collar on a
plant when it's under eight inches.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there's just waste of time.
[SPEAKER_10]: The plants are going to die.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've got a certain attrition rate.
[SPEAKER_10]: So a mature plant is defined as something
you can put a collar on for metric
[SPEAKER_10]: purposes after it reaches a certain level
of maturity.
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that is leading to confusion.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're not using that same eight inches
in the horticultural lighting power
[SPEAKER_10]: density equations.
[SPEAKER_10]: What we're using are typically then room
area.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're growing on a roll-top bench
in a traditional scenario with a light
[SPEAKER_10]: over it,
[SPEAKER_10]: then the area to be calculated,
so the denominator is your square feet,
[SPEAKER_10]: your horticulture lighting square footage,
would be the floor area of the room in
[SPEAKER_10]: which you're cultivating, including the
bench area.
[SPEAKER_10]: But not in addition to.
[SPEAKER_10]: You wouldn't add bench area to floor area.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'd calculate the bench area plus the
area around the bench.
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be your horticulture lighting
square footage.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're growing on a multi-tier,
then you would add the square footage of
[SPEAKER_10]: the bench above the first, second,
third, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_10]: You would take the lighting power of each
of the fixtures at each level,
[SPEAKER_10]: whether the interstitial and bench areas
or simply hanging from the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_10]: Those all become into your numerator.
[SPEAKER_10]: All of your square footages go into the
denominator.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I go back to say, well, if horticulture
lighting equipment must be all lighting
[SPEAKER_10]: equipment that uses energy at all stages
of growth, then it's unfair to pack all of
[SPEAKER_10]: the lighting in and not be able to use all
of the area in which plants are grown.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you take whether this is a veg or a
flower room plus a clone room,
[SPEAKER_10]: all of the areas, stock plants,
clone plants, vegetative and flower,
[SPEAKER_10]: all added together become your
horticulture lighting square footage.
[SPEAKER_10]: And all of the wattages added up from all
the rooms become your lighting equipment.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the interpretation.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a very different equation if you
don't count the square footage of the
[SPEAKER_10]: room.
[SPEAKER_10]: It becomes very difficult to, in some
cases, hit the 36 watts or, for smaller
[SPEAKER_10]: grows, 50 watts.
[SPEAKER_10]: We as a design office have done facilities
that have had high pressure sodium lights
[SPEAKER_10]: and still pass the 36 watts per square
foot.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's, say, 16,000 square foot of canopy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the essence of how our proposal
works.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm curious to hear feedback.
[SPEAKER_12]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_12]: But before we do that, before we start
asking questions, I'm going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just want to address Molly.
[SPEAKER_12]: You're part of the implementation that
Brian referred to in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_12]: And in 2019, they passed their new law
based on the Massachusetts law.
[SPEAKER_12]: What were some of the challenges that you
saw in developing that law?
[SPEAKER_12]: And what are some of the ongoing
challenges that you're facing in Illinois?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for those who aren't familiar,
the Illinois legislation included
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental components in the actual
legislation itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so those were the 36 watts per square
foot lighting power density from
[SPEAKER_03]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, that's for all facilities,
even though smaller grows have to comply
[SPEAKER_03]: with the 36 watts, unlike Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's an HVAC component that
was entirely new.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what that states is that for
facilities with 6,000 square feet of
[SPEAKER_03]: canopy or less, they can use a ductless
mini split to obtain heating and cooling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And anything larger than that needs to use
a variable refrigerant flow system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are two prescriptive requirements.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other option is or more energy
efficient equipment, which, as probably
[SPEAKER_03]: all of you know, that's very nebulous.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you define what is more energy
efficient than two pieces of equipment
[SPEAKER_03]: that have varying levels of efficiency?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the world that we're operating
in right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a challenge with implementing the
law in the beginning was it was well
[SPEAKER_03]: intended.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of stakeholders involved,
a lot of cooks in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone wanted to make sure that there
was a lot of focus on environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: considerations and making this one of the
greenest cannabis legislations across the
[SPEAKER_03]: country.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it got a little out of
control.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a fast moving freight train.
[SPEAKER_03]: The newly elected governor was putting
pressure on legislators to pass a bill
[SPEAKER_03]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it became like a monster bill,
700 pages, huge focus on social equity and
[SPEAKER_03]: justice, which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that means environmental components
were kind of thrown in secondary or
[SPEAKER_03]: tertiary with little room for any
revisions once they were put in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once those HVAC requirements that I
think are probably pretty problematic were
[SPEAKER_03]: included, we were unable to kind of amend
that language.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I've been told that there may be
an opportunity for a trailer bill in the
[SPEAKER_03]: future, right now that's kind of what
we're stuck with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was the development side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now as of January 1st, we are now
implementing that law.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Department of Agriculture is
actually the enforcement agency that is
[SPEAKER_03]: overseeing the cultivation side of
cannabis in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_03]: They released some emergency rules in
December.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were hoping that they were going to
clarify some of that nebulous language,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they just copied and pasted directly
from the legislation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's still a lot of questions on how
to meet these new efficiency standards
[SPEAKER_03]: that you have to in order to get a
license.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think some of the challenges can be seen
in just interpretation and the only
[SPEAKER_03]: interpretation that matters right now is
the Department of Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the one that's going to be
enforcing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So understanding how they interpret what
would meet that requirement is extremely
[SPEAKER_03]: important and we've yet to see what that
means.
[SPEAKER_03]: As well as what was the legislative intent
and how do we stay within that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Enforcement's going to be a big question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Department of Ag is not you know,
they're not experts on HVAC system design.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not lighting experts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how are they going to be
recognizing systems that are not a mini
[SPEAKER_03]: split or a VRF, but still are efficiently
designed and should qualify?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just helping them understand that it
shouldn't be a checkbox like, yes,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have a mini split or yes, you have a
VRF and if you don't have one of those
[SPEAKER_03]: two, then you shouldn't be awarded a
license.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's going to be a lot of systems that
will meet or exceed those efficiency
[SPEAKER_03]: levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've also put set a pretty high baseline
that takes some utility incentives off the
[SPEAKER_03]: table, which increases the cost to
participate in this market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is something that we're dealing
with right now is how do utilities
[SPEAKER_03]: understand if there's an opportunity to
offer some sort of equipment incentive
[SPEAKER_03]: given the high baselines that are set.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, I think this has been
mentioned so many times, but this policy
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't really align with the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see a lot of times policy makers are
creating policies that are well intended,
[SPEAKER_03]: but aren't necessarily taking the
industry's practice into consideration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's definitely the world that we're
living in right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, those are some of the challenges
that we're facing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look forward to hearing some of your
thoughts on how we can overcome them and
[SPEAKER_03]: how we can take kind of some lessons
learned into new states in the Midwest
[SPEAKER_03]: that might be considering legislation so
that we're not repeating some mistakes.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks, Valerie.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_12]: Michael, can you talk about some of the
structural market challenges emerging for
[SPEAKER_12]: growers and any lessons learned by the
industry to date?
[SPEAKER_12]: Can I have a new set of slides,
please?
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Jen.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll breeze through these three slides
for you all real quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as I mentioned, I started my career in
energy policy and then moved into cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: policy.
[SPEAKER_08]: The odd part of that story is that I
started in, I came over from solar
[SPEAKER_08]: development and I was interested in
selling renewable energy to cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: growers because, hey, you know,
you guys may want to lock in a cheap rate
[SPEAKER_08]: for clean energy and then shed any of the
criticism of being a high energy use
[SPEAKER_08]: producer.
[SPEAKER_08]: I ended up moving over to cannabis and now
I work primarily in sungrown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that aside, it struck me as I was
moving through the landscape of policy
[SPEAKER_08]: issues that one thing is certain,
and I'm going to probably divide the crowd
[SPEAKER_08]: here with this statement, but one thing is
certain is that at some point the federal
[SPEAKER_08]: government is going to legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when that happens, this industry will
get much, much bigger.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, it will look much, much different
when that happens because when you move
[SPEAKER_08]: from a system of 30 or 40 different
individual markets that must produce and
[SPEAKER_08]: consume all of the products within their
boundaries and you move into a capitalist
[SPEAKER_08]: economy where goods can move across state
boundaries efficiently based upon the cost
[SPEAKER_08]: of production, then you have an entirely
different market structure.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so what we're building towards today
with all of this conversation around
[SPEAKER_08]: energy and energy consumption from indoor
environments in states that either require
[SPEAKER_08]: indoor grow operations or that's all
that's going to work if, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: say Maine or other states where it's just
what's going to work.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you move into an environment where you
can start to import, cost becomes a key
[SPEAKER_08]: consideration and we start to see,
it's almost like a postcard from the past,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: From the good old days of the illicit
market when cannabis primarily is produced
[SPEAKER_08]: on the west coast in some of the massive
amounts of outdoor products or grow
[SPEAKER_08]: operations in California and Oregon and
Washington and moved eastward via
[SPEAKER_08]: underground distribution channels to your
neighborhood, I'll call them a retailer on
[SPEAKER_08]: the corner.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those traditional movements of cannabis
were kind of based on economics also.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so as you eliminate the boundaries and
you eliminate the barriers to commerce
[SPEAKER_08]: across these different markets,
you see a lot of what I say collision of
[SPEAKER_08]: investment, pre-existing investment in
grow infrastructure and the economics of
[SPEAKER_08]: moving products across state boundaries.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I'm going to set up for you is
sort of a thought exercise which is the
[SPEAKER_08]: federal government is going to legalize at
some point.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's in two years, maybe it's in
four years, maybe it's in six years,
[SPEAKER_08]: lots of investment is going to go into
grow environment infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what if you had the, you could either
live that future and just let the walls
[SPEAKER_08]: come down in the future or you could set
up a situation today where the same way
[SPEAKER_08]: that the federal government has allowed
states acting as policy laboratories to
[SPEAKER_08]: create their own cannabis marketplaces,
the federal government could equally allow
[SPEAKER_08]: states that have their own cannabis laws
to choose to enter into trading
[SPEAKER_08]: arrangements with each other and do
business with each other across state
[SPEAKER_08]: boundaries.
[SPEAKER_08]: They don't even have to be contiguous.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if that were an option, now put
yourself in the policymaker's position,
[SPEAKER_08]: you're an elected official, if you could
choose to allow to import with another
[SPEAKER_08]: state that already has established
cultivation, is it better to let,
[SPEAKER_08]: to insulate your state from that import
and let grow infrastructure and other
[SPEAKER_08]: business infrastructure receive
investments only to have it potentially
[SPEAKER_08]: crash in the future?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is it better to start your new cannabis
economy with some reasonable amount of
[SPEAKER_08]: imports coming from other states to help
even out supply and demand fluctuations
[SPEAKER_08]: and even get at some of these energy and
environmental considerations.
[SPEAKER_08]: So since this is an energy and
environmental crowd, I'm going to take the
[SPEAKER_08]: conversation in that direction.
[SPEAKER_08]: If we can just slip to the next slide
here.
[SPEAKER_08]: California, Oregon, and Washington are
three states that, like I said,
[SPEAKER_08]: primarily historically have been known for
their outdoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's no statement about better or
worse or anything like that, but it is
[SPEAKER_08]: cheaper.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's just agree that outdoor is a lot
cheaper to grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: The cost inputs are much lower.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in an environment where, you know,
the products that are being purchased by
[SPEAKER_08]: consumers are, I'd say, on average about
half manufactured products and half
[SPEAKER_08]: flower-based products, that means half of
the product base that's being sold in your
[SPEAKER_08]: state are agnostic as to the appearance of
the flower in the first place.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're just harvesting cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: And those harvested cannabinoids,
when those walls come down, are going to
[SPEAKER_08]: be purchased based on price.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so something to consider at the early
stages here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So with regard to the energy and
environmental angles here, if you're a
[SPEAKER_08]: state that does care a lot about energy
and environment, of your cultivation
[SPEAKER_08]: environments, and you had the option to
import, you could start to import
[SPEAKER_08]: sun-grown cannabis from states like
California or Oregon that would carry much
[SPEAKER_08]: less carbon footprints than even cannabis
that's grown indoors using, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: renewable energy, quite honestly.
[SPEAKER_08]: With regard to pesticides use,
pesticide use is important to a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: people as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And while I've seen it done before that,
you know, beneficial insects are used in
[SPEAKER_08]: indoor controlled environments,
that can be challenging if you're also
[SPEAKER_08]: using pesticides for other pests.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it also limits your, you know,
you're kind of not doing companion
[SPEAKER_08]: planting or any kind of regenerative
agriculture or any of those methods that
[SPEAKER_08]: sun-grown agriculture is better equipped
to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just gets back down to capitalism,
quite honestly, where the efficient
[SPEAKER_08]: movement of goods from areas of the
country or, frankly, the globe where they
[SPEAKER_08]: are produced most efficiently are also
those products that are rewarded with
[SPEAKER_08]: increased business.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a reason why we don't grow oranges
in Illinois, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because they just grow much better in
other places and that's where we get those
[SPEAKER_08]: oranges from.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can grow oranges there, but people
haven't made a business out of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that's sort of one of these
messages here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to avoid all the questions about what
about the federal government, the last
[SPEAKER_08]: slide speaks to some of the barriers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously, the same way that states
needed to hear from the federal government
[SPEAKER_08]: to feel comfortable about initiating their
own cannabis marketplace, there is a
[SPEAKER_08]: federal trigger to interstate commerce as
well.
[SPEAKER_08]: You do need to have either an attorney
general say, you know, in a memo,
[SPEAKER_08]: we're okay with this or Congress could
pass, what is it, HR 3546, which was
[SPEAKER_08]: authored by Representative Blumenauer from
the state of Oregon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those things do need to happen for
interstate commerce pre-descheduling to be
[SPEAKER_08]: a reality.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can, if that were the case,
move products across states that even
[SPEAKER_08]: don't have any legal market, say,
Idaho, for example, via rail.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're on the ground, you can always
transport it in the air as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are both federal, in federal
jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if they acquiesce, if they say,
yes, you may, then inherently,
[SPEAKER_08]: they're also identifying that you can do
it via one of those two methods as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the topic that I have to kind of
throw some shock and awe into the
[SPEAKER_08]: discussion of, you know, lighting
efficiency in Illinois and Massachusetts
[SPEAKER_08]: and other places is that in the future,
there very well may be a lot more commerce
[SPEAKER_08]: from other markets, not just internal to
the states.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Michael.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Derek, you've heard from your fellow
panelists about some of the challenges.
[SPEAKER_12]: As the industry continues to grow and
states adopt new regulations, how do you
[SPEAKER_12]: assess the success of policy and adapt a
flexible framework for future states and
[SPEAKER_12]: or in eventual adoption of policy at the
federal level?
[SPEAKER_14]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, this came up a little bit yesterday
in the Technical Advisory Council Summit.
[SPEAKER_14]: We had a policy discussion and we are
going to start a policy working group
[SPEAKER_14]: coming out of this conference to begin to
address these issues.
[SPEAKER_14]: But we have assembled a basic policy
template at Resource Innovation Institute
[SPEAKER_14]: that we have been peer reviewing.
[SPEAKER_14]: It includes the actual statutory language.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's essentially borrowing from states and
offering language and essentially just
[SPEAKER_14]: cataloging all the issues that need to be
considered.
[SPEAKER_14]: As you can hear, there's a lot of issues
that need to be considered, both at the
[SPEAKER_14]: macro level with a tremendous amount of
uncertainty as well as the micro level
[SPEAKER_14]: with, like, the nuance of language around
how you define certain things that will be
[SPEAKER_14]: key metrics that will govern all this.
[SPEAKER_14]: And all of this, obviously, is setting the
blueprint for not just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we're primarily talking about
cannabis, but policy builds on policy.
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is where it's starting.
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is all relevant to CEA.
[SPEAKER_14]: How canopy gets defined is relevant to the
way California will roll out their current
[SPEAKER_14]: codes that they're considering.
[SPEAKER_14]: So essentially, we're asking states
generally to think about these issues in
[SPEAKER_14]: three different categories based on where
they are in their evolution toward
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis legalization.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's pre-market considerations,
in-market considerations, and then sort of
[SPEAKER_14]: continuous improvement from there.
[SPEAKER_14]: So pre-market considerations, and I won't
go into any detail on these, but I'll just
[SPEAKER_14]: kind of throw these out there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we're all just trying to be
provocative and tee you up to ask us
[SPEAKER_14]: questions.
[SPEAKER_14]: So pre-market.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a state.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm thinking about regulating.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a little bit of uncertainty or
concern about energy and environmental
[SPEAKER_14]: issues.
[SPEAKER_14]: What should I do?
[SPEAKER_14]: What we would say, and this kind of
considers all of the input that we've
[SPEAKER_14]: provided so far, think first about how
much cultivation infrastructure you
[SPEAKER_14]: believe will be economically viable in
your state.
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to go all out and, you know,
invest in this market, and you believe
[SPEAKER_14]: that you can win.
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe a state like Vermont, which is
starting to do all this, which has some
[SPEAKER_14]: sort of historical association and brand
identification with cannabis, maybe they
[SPEAKER_14]: want to go real big.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll just go for it.
[SPEAKER_14]: They want to build a lot of
infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_14]: Other states, you know, we see Oklahoma
right now as an example.
[SPEAKER_14]: Unlimited licenses, basically,
you know, just like I guess you would
[SPEAKER_14]: think stereotypically of Oklahoma,
wild, wild west, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Like you can do anything you want there,
any size, anywhere, pretty much,
[SPEAKER_14]: right?
[SPEAKER_14]: But not very thoughtful, right,
about their long-term tax revenues,
[SPEAKER_14]: about the energy and environmental impact,
about the competitiveness, about much.
[SPEAKER_14]: But they're guns a blazing going for it,
and they're going to collect some
[SPEAKER_14]: short-term tax revenue for sure,
which will be great, I guess.
[SPEAKER_14]: But they might have a ton of stranded
assets in the real estate market,
[SPEAKER_14]: might actually depress the horticultural
lighting market because a secondary market
[SPEAKER_14]: for lighting systems, that were barely
used, now floods the market and actually
[SPEAKER_14]: depresses the, you know, primary market
pricing.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's a lot of things like that that
need to be thought, but nobody's really
[SPEAKER_14]: thinking, because everybody's moving so
quick, right, on so many issues,
[SPEAKER_14]: and there's so much pressure.
[SPEAKER_14]: The other point I'll make is, what are you
actually talking about, like I said
[SPEAKER_14]: earlier?
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you talking about energy or are you
talking about carbon?
[SPEAKER_14]: Totally different things, and as we heard
this morning from Brian, energy doesn't
[SPEAKER_14]: necessarily connect with carbon,
and increasingly it may not.
[SPEAKER_14]: So be really clear about what you're
thinking about.
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say, I would argue, don't ban any
method of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_14]: We see, for example, Illinois has billed
itself as the most environmental cannabis
[SPEAKER_14]: regulation, because they took
Massachusetts and added a few improvements
[SPEAKER_14]: in terms of efficiency, but they also
banned outdoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I don't know, most environmental,
I don't know that I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But also we see local jurisdictions doing
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here in California, you know, there was a
coordinated effort by the League of Cities
[SPEAKER_14]: to essentially ban cultivation,
and there were just a few jurisdictions
[SPEAKER_14]: that popped up and said, we're okay with
it.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you've got almost like the US,
like a little mini US situation happening
[SPEAKER_14]: in California.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not a really clear market.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then, you know, there's all these
bans, and a lot of that's just because it
[SPEAKER_14]: smells like weed, and now it's actually
even more in hemp, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: And we've got hemp everywhere,
and so everybody's freaking out,
[SPEAKER_14]: because, oh my god, it smells so horrible,
but I'll drive by this manure,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, operation, and this Purina dog
food thing in Denver, which is actually
[SPEAKER_14]: right by all the cultivation in Denver,
and it's, you know what, I'd rather smell
[SPEAKER_14]: weed.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know about you, terpenes,
good, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: But odor issues are totally, like terpenes
are in every CEA facility, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: So also set standards on lighting at
least, and we would argue, and
[SPEAKER_14]: Commissioner Doyle didn't emphasize this
in her presentation, but Massachusetts did
[SPEAKER_14]: evolve, so it was, they weren't only
thinking about 36 watts per square foot,
[SPEAKER_14]: and I hope that we had a little bit of
impression on that with Massachusetts
[SPEAKER_14]: Cannabis Energy Roundtable that we brought
together, included Brian, a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_14]: folks, to actually help the state think
about it differently than just watts per
square foot.
[SPEAKER_14]: Which is more of a commercial building
application of energy policy or energy
[SPEAKER_14]: code.
[SPEAKER_14]: But we know now that photon efficacy is
really what is driving efficiency,
[SPEAKER_14]: and can be paired with watts per square
foot, but needs to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: done thoughtfully.
[SPEAKER_14]: In market, collect more data, establish
continued savings targets over time,
[SPEAKER_14]: based on the data, to continue to drive
more efficiency.
[SPEAKER_14]: But most important, what we see and what
we hear is that every facility is
[SPEAKER_14]: different.
[SPEAKER_14]: Every cultivator's methods are different.
[SPEAKER_14]: There literally are no best practices.
[SPEAKER_14]: We just produced best practices on HVAC
and lighting, peer-reviewed, like I
[SPEAKER_14]: described to the tax summit yesterday.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the educational component is so
critical.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like you can't just throw a law out there
and expect people to comply.
[SPEAKER_14]: With so much pressure in the market,
just generally, and also so much confusion
[SPEAKER_14]: about different terms and whatnot,
it's going to be a mess.
[SPEAKER_14]: You need to provide education,
and we need to make sure that incentives
[SPEAKER_14]: are part of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_14]: And essentially what states are doing,
unlike California, is kind of writing
[SPEAKER_14]: codes without going through a code
proposal process that actually fully has,
[SPEAKER_14]: for example, here in California,
a three year review process where there's
[SPEAKER_14]: a ton of stakeholder engagement.
[SPEAKER_14]: Quick commercial, we have a California
code dialogue tonight, 6.30, you all
[SPEAKER_14]: should come.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody who's caring about California
codes, you should come.
[SPEAKER_14]: Grab drinks, grab food, come in,
eat.
[SPEAKER_14]: Really important.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll have a final code conversation
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_14]: But what's happening when these states
essentially create de facto codes on
[SPEAKER_14]: technology, is then it tells the
utilities, well, you can't, the utilities
[SPEAKER_14]: think they can't provide incentives.
[SPEAKER_14]: On that, because it sets a new baseline,
and they can only provide incentives on
[SPEAKER_14]: what is below that baseline.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because they get measured on cost
effectiveness of their incentives.
[SPEAKER_14]: But there is precedent that incentives can
be part of new code adoption, especially
[SPEAKER_14]: when the technology is not incumbent in
the market.
[SPEAKER_14]: And LED technology is not incumbent in
this market, it's increasing.
[SPEAKER_14]: But what we see, all over the place,
is that people don't know how to operate
[SPEAKER_14]: it efficiently.
[SPEAKER_14]: And they need support on how to address
HVAC and nutrient, water, and blah,
[SPEAKER_14]: blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Also promote renewables in tandem with
efficiency, which I think Massachusetts is
[SPEAKER_14]: clearly doing a good job in focusing on
also supporting recognition programs,
[SPEAKER_14]: and amplifying equity, and just making
sure that we're considering, if we're
[SPEAKER_14]: jacking up the upfront cost, and we don't
have financing available in this
[SPEAKER_14]: marketplace, and we're trying to also
encourage people of color who have been
[SPEAKER_14]: impacted by the war on drugs to benefit
from the new marketplace, then we need to
[SPEAKER_14]: actually think about how they can afford
this technology and have a competitive leg
[SPEAKER_14]: up.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's such a complex set of issues,
but we're excited to work with those of
[SPEAKER_14]: you that want to join our policy committee
and work with us to put more meat on the
[SPEAKER_14]: bones.
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate that term, but help us flesh this
out.
[SPEAKER_14]: God, oh my God, I just basically said the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: Weird, weird.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I guess I'm going to kick us off on
questions.
[SPEAKER_12]: John is going to be our faithful mic
runner.
[SPEAKER_12]: A few things, I guess I'll continue the
animal analogy.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm from the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a saying called, don't milk the
skinny cow.
[SPEAKER_12]: You all have been together for a few days.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you said something in multiple
spaces, and it's not a question,
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd encourage you to think about how to
turn that into a question.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we want everybody to walk away with
engaging in this space.
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you can, please ask a question
that'll help benefit all of you in the
[SPEAKER_12]: room.
[SPEAKER_12]: And with that, do I have a first question?
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so I have the pleasure of working
with both Derek and Michael Wheeler,
[SPEAKER_15]: and particularly with Michael,
at the California Cannabis Industry
[SPEAKER_15]: Association.
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've obviously been talking quite a
bit about interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I was wondering, has there been
more conversation about how we might deal
[SPEAKER_15]: with states that don't have state
regulation if we have to get cannabis from
[SPEAKER_15]: California to Ohio, and driving through
states that aren't regulated at all?
[SPEAKER_15]: And then also, any talk about the carbon
footprint of that transportation,
[SPEAKER_15]: and what that might look like?
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Lindsay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So great questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the great thing about cannabis is that
if you've got a ton of it, 2,000 pounds of
[SPEAKER_08]: it, you've got an awful lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the world of shipping things,
shipping and commerce, a ton just isn't
[SPEAKER_08]: that much.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I don't have exact figures about
the amount of carbon that you might see.
[SPEAKER_08]: But given the historical nature,
and that cannabis has been moving westward
[SPEAKER_08]: from the coastal states, the western
coastal states, to eastern coastal states
[SPEAKER_08]: for the last generation by truck,
and probably a beat-up old truck at that,
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we'll probably come out on the
plus side if we put it on rail.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about airplanes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Airplanes certainly create more carbon
likely than beat-up old trucks.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that analysis does need to be done.
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree, that analysis does need to be
done.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's worthwhile to say, I think that
probably, I would imagine that the
[SPEAKER_08]: cleanest and greenest way to do interstate
commerce is to have bulk products move,
[SPEAKER_08]: just biomass move across the states to
individual states for final packaging,
[SPEAKER_08]: for transformation into manufactured
products.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let those states that invested in the jobs
angle of pro-cannabis policies keep those
[SPEAKER_08]: jobs so that they've got those
manufacturing plants and they've got those
[SPEAKER_08]: good wage jobs in those states as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't need to take those away.
[SPEAKER_08]: As far as moving it though across state
lines, so that's sort of the, so I grew up
[SPEAKER_08]: when they were talking about moving
nuclear waste across state lines,
[SPEAKER_08]: and there would be protests, and you can't
move that through here, and we'll have
[SPEAKER_08]: local referendums and everything,
and at the end of the day, the federal
[SPEAKER_08]: government still said, it doesn't matter
what you think, we can still move it
[SPEAKER_08]: across state lines, because we're using
methods of transportation that are under
[SPEAKER_08]: federal jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that goes to the trains,
federal jurisdiction, and airways,
[SPEAKER_08]: federal jurisdiction, in a approval by the
federal government to allow interstate
[SPEAKER_08]: commerce, they would need to say,
and it's okay to use these forms of
[SPEAKER_08]: transportation because it's federally
controlled.
[SPEAKER_08]: You probably want more than that,
but that might be a beer conversation.
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess I wanted one of the, with regards
to carbon, in the standard operating
[SPEAKER_13]: procedure when you do use LEDs,
which you're recommending, they top the
[SPEAKER_13]: plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: We know we need the biomass along with
living soil to have microbes that also
[SPEAKER_13]: help with that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just curious how the group is looking
at not doing living soil and not having
[SPEAKER_13]: sunlight indoors to do that, to really
kind of mutate the plants and take away
[SPEAKER_13]: all the areas that carbon would be
involved.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the only other comment I have is
we do have a light source that does 11
[SPEAKER_13]: watts per square foot.
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we think that carbon should be a topic.
[SPEAKER_14]: Carbon should be consumed.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what we've considered.
[SPEAKER_14]: We are impacted by climate change.
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to get serious, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: We have an opportunity to have this
industry and the whole CEA industry be a
[SPEAKER_14]: beacon for sustainable enterprise.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that's what everybody in this
room is kind of wanting to happen,
[SPEAKER_14]: right?
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think we can figure this out.
[SPEAKER_14]: But farmers who are doing regenerative
soil practices and not using diesel
[SPEAKER_14]: generators and, you know, maybe even just
doing dry farming next to a riverbed
[SPEAKER_14]: should get credit for having very little
impact on the environment.
[SPEAKER_14]: Little confused by your always focus on
the sun when you have an indoor electric
[SPEAKER_14]: product, but I'll leave that to the side.
[SPEAKER_14]: But we need to be obviously focusing on
what has the least environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what we mean by environmental impact
needs to be defined.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was said earlier, but I'll repeat it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to change legislation that
prohibits outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to allow states to grow outdoors
and not force it all to be indoors.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's space for both.
[SPEAKER_10]: If we're doing distillate only,
great thing to do outside.
[SPEAKER_10]: If we're doing prize bud and prize flower,
that's a good reason to grow it indoors.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that would have a lot of effect on
the carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Lauren from Efficiency Vermont.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wondering how might we take
refrigerant choice, especially as we're
[SPEAKER_06]: looking into HVAC into consideration.
[SPEAKER_06]: In a lot of these cases like VRFs,
for example, there's high leakage rates in
[SPEAKER_06]: those systems and they're leaking things
like HFCs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in terms of carbon impacts,
that's really important and it's a really
[SPEAKER_06]: short scale that we have to kind of scale
up into things like natural refrigerants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm wondering if any of you have
thought about that or how might we be able
[SPEAKER_06]: to kind of edit our policies or look ahead
as we do more legalization type policy
[SPEAKER_06]: work to make sure we're taking that into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can take a first stab at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Illinois legislation was primarily
focused on energy and not carbon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so from that perspective, I don't
think that refrigerants were considered.
[SPEAKER_03]: There specifically isn't any sort of
requirement to use one sort of refrigerant
[SPEAKER_03]: over another.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is certainly something that I
think is important and needs to be
[SPEAKER_03]: considered.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as there's opportunities to amend
language or influence equipment
[SPEAKER_03]: purchasing, I think that that's something
that needs to be at the conversation when
[SPEAKER_03]: that's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thanks for bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just have a general comment about
specifying technology in statute,
[SPEAKER_14]: in particular, but rules.
[SPEAKER_14]: At this stage of the game, we don't really
know what's most efficient.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, that's what I hear from everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just think, again, flexibility,
allow for the market, get the metrics
[SPEAKER_14]: right, make sure we know what we're
talking about, and then understand through
[SPEAKER_14]: data where baselines are and what improved
performance can be.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then measure based on what you're
actually trying to achieve rather than
[SPEAKER_14]: just randomly throwing out technology and
randomly assigning orders to things that
[SPEAKER_14]: may actually not totally apply,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alexi Miller with New Buildings Institute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question for really any of you
that wants to take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to me that there may be room in
the policy space for labeling requirements
[SPEAKER_01]: so that the consumer or the final customer
at the point of sale can see what is the
[SPEAKER_01]: energy or carbon impact of this product
I'm buying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pounds of carbon per gram of flour,
pounds of carbon per gram of product in
[SPEAKER_01]: the cartridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what the metric is,
but there's probably something there that
[SPEAKER_01]: could be set up as a consistent market
differentiator that once you put a number
[SPEAKER_01]: on it, the consumer can see that,
can use it as part of their decision
[SPEAKER_01]: making, and acts as a potentially pretty
significant way for the growers to really
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of buckle down on this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to know what you think the room
is or where we think that might fit in
[SPEAKER_01]: policy as we are now and where we might
be.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's an area missing in cannabis
is consumer polling, customer polling,
[SPEAKER_10]: customer data.
[SPEAKER_10]: What does the customer want?
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to define our industry by how we
produce what the customer actually wants.
[SPEAKER_10]: If that can lead to energy policy,
I think it will.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think people will choose based on those.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think people will choose based on THC
level.
[SPEAKER_10]: If they don't really want an enormous THC
level, if they want a better terpene
[SPEAKER_10]: profile with very low THC, we need to know
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is a major piece of what's missing in
our industry is we don't have good
[SPEAKER_10]: consumer polling.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just jump in real quick and say that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's important and it's a little
ways off because the first thing is
[SPEAKER_08]: consumers are interested in understanding
what these cannabis products are going to
[SPEAKER_08]: do to them and whether it's the intended
effect that they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that we don't have a very good
way of communicating that quite yet
[SPEAKER_08]: either, given the variety of strains and
delivery methods and all of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say that one of the best ideas I
ever heard for a label with regards to
[SPEAKER_08]: carbon was to simply identify on their jar
or on your cartridge, what is the carbon
[SPEAKER_08]: equivalent in number of lighters,
BIC lighters, in the flower or product
[SPEAKER_08]: that's in your cartridge?
[SPEAKER_08]: And that that would be relatable to the
consumer because, as we all know,
[SPEAKER_08]: pounds of carbon just doesn't mean a lot
unless you know how to relate to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And most of those cannabis consumers can
relate to a lighter.
[SPEAKER_14]: So a little known fact about the origin of
our IIs is that one of my co-founders and
[SPEAKER_14]: I were sitting at a picnic table having
beers in Sisters Oregon thinking,
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, what are we going to do with our
careers?
[SPEAKER_14]: Cannabis things coming down the line.
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's create lead for wheat.
[SPEAKER_14]: That was literally what we thought about.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we realized you can't have a
label that means anything until you have
[SPEAKER_14]: standards.
[SPEAKER_14]: And you can have standards until you have
data.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's none of that in this industry.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've been focusing on data and knowing
that at some point when we get all the
[SPEAKER_14]: data right, that we could have the ability
to do exactly what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we are now running a bill in Oregon
that I hope gets passed and it's got a lot
[SPEAKER_14]: of support.
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's to essentially begin the process
of designing and piloting what a
[SPEAKER_14]: certification system would look like on
energy and water best practices and that
[SPEAKER_14]: would consider carbon and everything else
so that we can have the accounting
[SPEAKER_14]: framework all established and work our way
toward understanding what is the unit,
[SPEAKER_14]: the denominator, and figuring out how we
express this to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree the consumer doesn't care about
this right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a little bit of time in that
regard to get it right.
[SPEAKER_14]: But we also need to get it right ASAP to
do the good stuff that we want to do.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I hope consumers get there.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think it's also fraught with some
risk that people make claims about carbon
[SPEAKER_14]: neutrality or carbon whatever.
[SPEAKER_14]: So for example, I love regenerative
farmers.
[SPEAKER_14]: But some of them basically just say
because I'm sun grown, I am carbon
[SPEAKER_14]: neutral.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's not necessarily true.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we all know the agricultural sector is
a major contributor to climate change.
[SPEAKER_14]: So just because you're growing plants
outside doesn't mean you're carbon
[SPEAKER_14]: neutral.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we just need to have a thoughtful
dialogue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Nadia from Dr. Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: What about packaging?
[SPEAKER_05]: Packaging is insane around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And every time we have one of those damn
glass containers and we put it in the
[SPEAKER_05]: recycle bin, I think, God, why is there
not a recycle program like there is for my
[SPEAKER_05]: glass bottle of milk?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this being addressed in any way,
packaging?
[SPEAKER_02]: As of oh, can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as of January 1st, we now allow
packaging take back programs at
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it used to be thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the regulation that prohibited these
types of programs before was the no
[SPEAKER_02]: outside product can enter the facility,
even if it's your own product that already
[SPEAKER_02]: left the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really the intent of that is to
make sure that we're not getting black
[SPEAKER_02]: market product sold through legal retail
outlets.
[SPEAKER_02]: The intent there, we were never intending
to prohibit recycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this regulation change is basically
you can now bring back product packaging
[SPEAKER_02]: and also vape cartridges to any dispensary
that is participating in a take back
[SPEAKER_02]: program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't have to do anything special
to it if the intent is recycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: There can be trace amounts of product
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, traditional waste recyclers can now
accept vape cartridges to be recycled
[SPEAKER_02]: without any kind of special marijuana
handling license.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll just do a commercial for Caitlin's
session, which is up next with Lindsey and
[SPEAKER_14]: the state of Colorado is leading in a
number of different ways and the most
[SPEAKER_14]: mature market.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I appreciate the leadership very much.
[SPEAKER_14]: And packaging is a huge, huge issue.
[SPEAKER_14]: And government regulation is based a lot
of times in stigma and fear of the plant
[SPEAKER_14]: and just completely unrealistic situations
that are driving silly, silly regulations.
[SPEAKER_14]: And once again, we need data that we can
take back to the government and say,
[SPEAKER_14]: you're creating all this waste,
this amount of waste through your policies
[SPEAKER_14]: that you've set.
[SPEAKER_14]: And is that really what you want to be
doing?
[SPEAKER_14]: And I should just say for the rest of the
CEA world, you guys are all packaging and
[SPEAKER_14]: a lot of plastic as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we need to think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: One statement on the refrigerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned for tomorrow afternoon's
session.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be conversation on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I can answer that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question really starts off with the
commissioner's slide program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was mentioned again, this whole
idea on the electrification and renewable
[SPEAKER_00]: energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you guys view the regulation of
using renewable energy for facilities that
[SPEAKER_00]: consume so much where solar cannot
possibly placed on top of the building to
[SPEAKER_00]: cover it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got to be networked in through the
utility.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the anticipated outcome from a
regulation and policy point of view?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll wait in here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is exactly was my exact business
proposition to my old company was let's
[SPEAKER_08]: build acres and acres of solar and sell it
to the cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we built a green tariff program so
that your utility could let you opt into
[SPEAKER_08]: the program and you'd pay a couple cents
more a kilowatt hour.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I mean, it's feasible.
[SPEAKER_08]: States can do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not impossible.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you're operating on 100%
renewables.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: New renewables at that because that's one
of the keys, right, is not just recycling
[SPEAKER_08]: credits.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there is concern, I think the biggest
concern quite honestly came from that I've
[SPEAKER_08]: heard comes from grid operators who are
upgrading both distribution systems and
[SPEAKER_08]: transmission systems to handle these loads
and these interconnection points for
[SPEAKER_08]: generation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they may or may not be needed for the
long term.
[SPEAKER_08]: And who pays those costs of infrastructure
upgrade?
[SPEAKER_08]: And do they turn into stranded assets over
time?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or are they actually used for the 40-year
lifespan that they're projected to have?
[SPEAKER_08]: So those were some of the complicated
issues that we got into with this
[SPEAKER_08]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: It didn't get resolved.
[SPEAKER_08]: They still liked data centers better than
cannabis grow operations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think from a policy perspective,
if you're talking about utility scale
[SPEAKER_03]: renewables or onsite generation,
there needs to be a emphasis on efficiency
[SPEAKER_03]: being coupled with that renewable so that
you're not building for an increased
[SPEAKER_03]: capacity that you could be right sizing
that equipment and doing efficiency first
[SPEAKER_03]: and thinking about renewables as a
packaged policy mechanism to decrease
[SPEAKER_03]: carbon and energy waste from these types
of facilities.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'll add working in a state I have a
lot of work in Massachusetts and the
[SPEAKER_10]: kilowatt hour for electricity is fairly
high.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have a huge renewable opportunity
from our utilities there.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's growing, it's coming, but it's not
there yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so despite the sort of irony of
encouraging onsite power generation
[SPEAKER_10]: through fossil fuel, through gas
specifically, many of the choices that we
[SPEAKER_10]: have today are higher efficiency in terms
of production.
[SPEAKER_10]: The equipment that's available to do
onsite is higher efficiency than the
[SPEAKER_10]: gas-fired electrical plants that are
operating in a much lower efficiency.
[SPEAKER_10]: So while I would argue in general that we
should be buying our, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: we should be doing electrical facilities
fired by renewable resources, in the state
[SPEAKER_10]: of Mass, we don't have that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have renewable resources
providing us enough energy needed.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we do install gas-fired systems that
are converting gas to electricity onsite
[SPEAKER_10]: at a much higher efficiency rate than is
available.
[SPEAKER_10]: I fully understand that those systems have
a certain lifespan, just like the hot
[SPEAKER_10]: water heater in my house.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's only going to last eight years.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got to replace it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we will be replacing those gas-fired
systems with electric at a certain point
[SPEAKER_10]: right when the industry matches,
when there is available utilities provided
[SPEAKER_10]: with renewable sources.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Doug with Evergreen.
[SPEAKER_11]: As I see states consider bringing on
cannabis or horticulture lighting in
[SPEAKER_11]: general, it really surprised me that the
state got involved with a law versus a
[SPEAKER_11]: code.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're all used to lighting power
densities.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like in Oregon, new construction,
you have to meet a watts per square foot.
[SPEAKER_11]: And ag right now is exempt, but usually
when something, it catches up,
[SPEAKER_11]: like manufacturing used to be exempt,
and now there's an LPD.
[SPEAKER_11]: So as states bring this on, why wouldn't
they consider the energy codes,
[SPEAKER_11]: the state energy codes, versus law?
[SPEAKER_11]: And part of it is the license to enforce
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to get your opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the enforcement, one other thing,
the utility incentive programs help
[SPEAKER_11]: enforce the codes.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I would just say California did
think about codes when they created the
[SPEAKER_14]: cannabis law in that they established
targets for when they knew, when they knew
[SPEAKER_14]: that certain things would be required
based on, I think, based on the third year
[SPEAKER_14]: of the regulated market existing,
knowing that they would need to go through
[SPEAKER_14]: a three-year code cycle.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they thought about it,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we'll hear more tonight from Kyle
Booth and Tao Chow from California Energy
[SPEAKER_14]: Commission is here as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously states should be thinking about
this.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's just crazy.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's like they're blowing up a balloon and
knowing that it's going to pop and then
[SPEAKER_14]: waiting for it to pop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one thing also to take into
consideration is right now there is no
[SPEAKER_03]: code for agricultural buildings.
[SPEAKER_03]: So until that happens, does it make sense
to rely on the code, which is meant for
[SPEAKER_03]: human occupants versus plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you're being forced certain air
changes per hour that maybe don't make
[SPEAKER_03]: sense for a cannabis facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think until there's some sort of
agriculturally focused code, I don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: how you kind of deal with that in this
situation.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's part of my world is dealing with
code officials who only enforce codes for
[SPEAKER_10]: buildings for people and they have no idea
how to enforce codes in buildings for,
[SPEAKER_10]: in buildings for plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: One example of that is that greenhouses
are classified in the building code and
[SPEAKER_10]: the International Building Code is under
the U for utility is the definition of the
[SPEAKER_10]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you look up at a building code,
what you're building, so this building is
[SPEAKER_10]: what its occupancy type is.
[SPEAKER_10]: I started out designing indoor cultivation
facilities under the definition of U for
[SPEAKER_10]: utility and I realized that's not correct.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's F-1 is factory moderate hazard is the
correct definition and that brings with it
[SPEAKER_10]: energy efficiency requirements that are
required for factory, not for a utility.
[SPEAKER_10]: So utility building is literally a
greenhouse, but it's also the shed that
[SPEAKER_10]: the state highway department stores salt
in.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a utility building.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't need insulation.
[SPEAKER_10]: But in a factory with moderate hazard,
you need to take certain precautions.
[SPEAKER_10]: So using the code to define how we achieve
lighting power density, using the code to
[SPEAKER_10]: define how we achieve energy efficiency is
an effective way to use the code.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't want to venture beyond my
professional knowledge to say whether that
[SPEAKER_10]: should be in a policy, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Should that be at the state law?
[SPEAKER_10]: Should that be written at state law?
[SPEAKER_10]: I see in Illinois some difficulties there
with specifying mini splits in the law as
[SPEAKER_10]: opposed to using the code to define that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that there might be a little bit
of a motivational thought that might be
[SPEAKER_09]: helpful here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think one of the things that we tend to
forget about is that this process is
[SPEAKER_09]: inherently political.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the reason that a lot of the
situations that we find ourselves in exist
[SPEAKER_09]: is that the politicians have discovered
that cannabis control and cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: regulation is a really great way to fire
up supporters on both sides of the issue
[SPEAKER_09]: together.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you do that, what you do is you
promise each side everything that they
[SPEAKER_09]: want.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you harvest donations from those
sides, from both sides at the same time in
[SPEAKER_09]: order to further your political ambitions
on other unrelated items.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I caution us to think about all of
these codes and especially the
[SPEAKER_09]: prescriptive things that we're seeing come
up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the cost of compliance with these
things causes a lot of the growers that
[SPEAKER_09]: might not be fairly large to essentially
not be able to comply.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know what the carbon footprint
of a thousand lawyers is, but I'm sure
[SPEAKER_09]: that we're finding out.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_14]: While people are thinking about that,
I just would encourage everybody that
[SPEAKER_14]: Brian started this off with how important
the defining canopy is.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we all, not just cannabis,
like we all CEA folks should spend some
[SPEAKER_14]: energy on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's critically important.
[SPEAKER_14]: And regulators and policy experts who are
wanting to push forward on the outcome
[SPEAKER_14]: that we will have efficiency and low
carbon cultivation needs to weigh in on
[SPEAKER_14]: that as well, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to be engaged on this issue
because basically there's loopholes going
[SPEAKER_14]: on right now and it's all up to
interpretation.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we know that there are people in
Massachusetts and Illinois that are
[SPEAKER_14]: defining as broadly as possible the room
area, squeezing all the plants into one
[SPEAKER_14]: corner and still using HPS lighting.
[SPEAKER_14]: And because the denominator is the full
room, not where the plants are and not
[SPEAKER_14]: where the lighting is, obviously they're
still meeting their targets, but they
[SPEAKER_14]: didn't use a more efficient light source.
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, they might have increased the
HVAC load in the room.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we just don't know, but we need to
study that kind of loophole and close it
[SPEAKER_14]: again.
[SPEAKER_14]: What we're really promoting is energy
efficiency and low carbon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the things I wonder about is
we're talking about how much energy is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be used.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's market reports out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some that show wide range of
different types of data as far as saying
[SPEAKER_04]: it's gonna be this much versus this much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder, and maybe Molly, you're the best
person to answer this question,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the other utilities in the room,
how much of the utilities going in and
[SPEAKER_04]: collecting your own data specifically on
cannabis and CEA and doing a
[SPEAKER_04]: forward-looking, either ROI or
forward-looking analysis to say this is
[SPEAKER_04]: how many more plants we're going to have
to build in the future to meet this
[SPEAKER_04]: demand.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is how much we're going to have to
increase our infrastructure and what's the
[SPEAKER_04]: payback on that versus either offering
incentives now or starting to get involved
[SPEAKER_04]: in shaping this policy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that something that's being looked at?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can speak on behalf of some utilities in
the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I'm not a utility.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that it wasn't something that
was proactively being thought about before
[SPEAKER_03]: legislation occurred.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also think in Illinois, some utilities
are not worried about the potential
[SPEAKER_03]: additional energy load that's coming from
cannabis facilities in their territory.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that is an incorrect or
correct assumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: Based on lack of data, maybe they
shouldn't be worried.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would say that a lot of utilities
don't really understand yet what the
[SPEAKER_03]: energy load is.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the load profile of a cannabis
facility looks like, let alone what the
[SPEAKER_03]: average energy use is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though some of these customers have
existed in their territory for a little
[SPEAKER_03]: while, they're still just so unfamiliar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not really happening yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just piling on, because I used to be an
energy regulator for the state of
[SPEAKER_08]: California, and the utilities jump on both
sides of this issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes they're interested in new build,
because there's a rate of return attached
[SPEAKER_08]: to that, and sometimes they're really
aware of the rate payer cost of that new
[SPEAKER_08]: build, and they don't want to.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I found at least that generation,
because it can feed load growth anywhere,
[SPEAKER_08]: for the most part, is an easier thing for
utilities to justify, whereas local area
[SPEAKER_08]: upgrades, network upgrades, are harder for
them to justify, because it's uncertain
[SPEAKER_08]: whether that load growth is going to stay
certain for a longer period of time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Two cents.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think we have just a few 30 seconds
left.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything that the panel wants to close
with?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just throw something out there that I
know there's a state right now in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Midwest that is currently working on a
expanded medical bill and a recreational
[SPEAKER_03]: bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if anybody has any recommendations
or how we can be better taking some of
[SPEAKER_03]: these lessons learned and implementing it
in a new state without kind of stifling
[SPEAKER_03]: the industry or creating unintended
consequences, I am all ears.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you all for your participation.
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, sorry, Bern.
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I was just going to say that Derek and
I are both kind of wondering that there
[SPEAKER_10]: was no response to the slides on lighting
power density.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I was just completely off.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it just didn't work.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm just curious whether anybody had
any responses to that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess I was completely off.
Thank you for presenting it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.
[SPEAKER_12]: So thanks so much for your participation.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's much more engaging that way.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to confer with the panel.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the fabulous prize is a drink or a
mocktail or whatever your poison is at the
[SPEAKER_12]: end of the day.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll figure out who had the best
question.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll come find you and buy you a
drink.
[SPEAKER_12]: So thanks.
