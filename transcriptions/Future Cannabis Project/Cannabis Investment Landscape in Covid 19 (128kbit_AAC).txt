[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Cannabis Unfiltered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's guest is Nick Easley, the CEO of
3C, also the co-founder and managing
[SPEAKER_01]: director of Multiverse Capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, Nick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, good morning, Skip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for making the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got some exciting stuff today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk about investment
themes in COVID-19.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we dive in, Nick, let's hear
about your background.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a very interesting background
in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've been in it for almost a decade
and a half on the legal side, but
[SPEAKER_00]: originally from farming country in
Wisconsin, did four years in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States Air Force and got hurt in the
service, came out to Colorado for a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: place to recover and found medical
cannabis, got a medical card very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very early, back before any of the
commercial medical or adult use programs
[SPEAKER_00]: were even started.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then through that process,
2006 through 2009, 2008, I saw the first
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial business licenses actually
happening in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through that process helped a lot of
friends and caregivers start to make those
[SPEAKER_00]: first initial commercial cannabis
businesses that were licensed and
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated by the state of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through that, now we've gone up to 34
states that have some sort of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: program, 11 states that have adult use
programs, and over 21 countries that have
[SPEAKER_00]: some sort of international medical
cannabis regime.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also Canada and Uruguay that have
international adult use programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through this process, I've worked in
nearly 30 countries over 30 states with
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation companies, extraction
companies, packaging companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing, investment firms,
and have really seen all segments of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I look at the investment space,
cannabis by not being federally legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have this massive void of where you can
actually get capital for funding
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we work with small, medium,
large size companies in their fundraising
[SPEAKER_00]: pursuits, as well as structuring their
businesses to get business licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be it the operations or the ancillary
services and companies that service them,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've worked with this and been here for
almost 15 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Nick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll just touch for a second on
federal regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got an election coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biden chose Kamala.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not sure what's going to happen
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what are your thoughts either way on
cannabis federal regulation changing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the United States is a big
superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that the world really responds to
our movements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, when it comes to international drug
policy and reform, we're not the leaders
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's through the WHO, the World Health
Organization, and the UN, like the United
[SPEAKER_00]: Nations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're a Native American,
you probably wouldn't trust the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States government following certain
treaties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the treaties that we follow
for international drug policy are just
[SPEAKER_00]: that, like the single convention on
psychotropic substances from 1961 and 1971
[SPEAKER_00]: from the United Nations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before there's some sort of federal
legalization, I would more expect some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of federal decriminalization similar
to what Portugal did, in which many states
[SPEAKER_00]: and municipalities around the country have
already started for decriminalizing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical cannabis, being a disabled veteran
myself, is my forefront and really my
[SPEAKER_00]: passion, helping patients get access to
safe, quality, and affordable medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the United States, be it one
president or another, they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily have the power to just
legalize cannabis, be it medical or adult
[SPEAKER_00]: use, because it could put the United
States in jeopardy of certain
[SPEAKER_00]: international conventions, which allow for
pharmaceutical manufacturing, imports and
[SPEAKER_00]: exports of psychotropic substances,
which cannabis currently is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though Biden and his new VP,
Canada, and with Trump, neither one has a
[SPEAKER_00]: very strong position on cannabis,
nor a negative one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my thoughts, and at least when it comes
to federal legalization, our industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: so nation, it's not ready to be federally
legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do need decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need the war on drugs to stop and stop
putting people in jail for having a gram
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis and ruining their chances to
get student loans or jobs in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if they're using it for
medicinal reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really think that, depending on who
gets elected this next year, it really is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get the industry another four and
a half, five years to get it shit
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we as an industry, we're this
patchwork of different states,
[SPEAKER_00]: different rules, different laws,
where cannabis prices might be 600
[SPEAKER_00]: wholesale in Oregon, where there's massive
production, copious amounts of licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a state like Illinois,
where there's only 12 adult use producers
[SPEAKER_00]: currently until the next licenses are
awarded, where grams could be upwards of
[SPEAKER_00]: $20, $30 for a gram of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it wouldn't be very hard to move beef
jerky from one state where they have lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of cows to a state that wants to buy a
bunch of beef jerky that doesn't have many
[SPEAKER_00]: cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But currently based on federal
legalization and the lack thereof,
[SPEAKER_00]: interstate commerce isn't an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see this next four to five years
really as an opportunity for the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: in their own states and jurisdictions to
continue to create market share,
[SPEAKER_00]: develop new products, understand consumer
trends and get larger and larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when federal legalization or
decriminalization happens on a massive
[SPEAKER_00]: scale, from a medical standpoint or adult
use standpoint, the industry goes from
[SPEAKER_00]: being a patchwork hodgepodge of all these
thousands of companies all over doing
[SPEAKER_00]: different things into an industry that's
ready and primed for strategic M&A's,
[SPEAKER_00]: mergers and acquisitions, massive
companies going public on NASDAQ,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just crappy little startup penny
stocks in Canada, some of which have
[SPEAKER_00]: turned large.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's really the moment where if
Trump stays in power, we have another four
[SPEAKER_00]: years of the same thing, same shit,
different day, probably a lot worse,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least when it comes to things outside
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wouldn't expect more federal legal
intervention.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry is too big to fail at this
point where you have nearly 300,000 jobs
[SPEAKER_00]: created in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, I just saw for July just record
sales set almost $158 million in one month
[SPEAKER_00]: of adult use sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add up the medical sales, almost $200
million in revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nearly $7 million in sales a day
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the products, not for the
electricity, the buildings, the lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: the water, the fertigation, the packaging,
the legal, the consulting, on and on and
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the industry is growing so large,
but we do need to have some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: federal reform where the federal
government cannot continue to use funds
[SPEAKER_00]: against state legal and sanctions medical
or adult use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see other countries evolving with this
at the same time where Uruguay just
[SPEAKER_00]: approved exports, not just on a medical
standpoint, but they're trying to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out how to export adult use cannabis to
Canada and to other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see more countries looking to this
and more municipalities losing tax
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more even cities and counties
within states that are legal that have had
[SPEAKER_00]: moratorium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have hospitality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have hotels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have as many taxes coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're losing a lot of jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nearly 50 million people unemployed in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's this new industry that's regulated
that could be a new opportunity for tax
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue and job creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think many cities within legal states
are thinking that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already have 13 states that are pushing
ballot initiatives for this November to
[SPEAKER_00]: start to legalize the process,
be it for medical or to move for adult
[SPEAKER_00]: use, just like Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really optimistic for this next
amount of time regardless of which
[SPEAKER_00]: presidential candidate gets elected,
which hopefully Americans and voters make
[SPEAKER_00]: the right decision here, but it's not
going to impact our industry as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: others might think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a complex patchwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I agree, Nick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the number of processes at the
federal level for legalization would be
[SPEAKER_01]: immense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all the agencies, just the way
that it would have to go would take years
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one step at a time, I guess,
let's move to investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you think about investment then
with all of that on the horizon,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you favorable for distress type
assets?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like limited license opportunities
or cashflow companies?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's on your mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the coronavirus kind of caught us
off guard as a people, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: being in the United States and all over
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got people for the first time having
this like fear and also something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: unifying all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fear is the biggest danger when it
comes to the coronavirus right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: where people don't know what the fuck's
happening, what's going to be happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to lose my job?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going back to school?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much concern here that it
really causes deer in the headlights
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome, where be it companies,
be it operators, be it consumers have no
[SPEAKER_00]: idea what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulators as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the investment landscape, when you
think about it, last week, last year,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was almost 15 times more direct
investment in the week than there was last
[SPEAKER_00]: week this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So consumer spending patterns are down,
but cannabis sales stay up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know this plant is recession and
depression proof, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry, not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not federally legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have bankruptcy protections.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had no access to any of the SBA loans,
the PPP loans, the multi-trillion dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: in stimulus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our industries didn't qualify.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to investments now,
many companies that were growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: scaling on a normal trajectory,
lost access to even interested investors
[SPEAKER_00]: because those investors are like,
I have no idea what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole thing could go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much money has like come off the table
and many investors like they're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for quick liquidity or options to be able
to make quick moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the public companies are so
attractive when it comes to cannabis to
[SPEAKER_00]: many investors now, because they can
invest and pull out their money the next
[SPEAKER_00]: day, same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the cannabis industry for like
early stage companies thinking seed
[SPEAKER_00]: capital, series A, series B, series C,
series D, IPOs, it's not the normal
[SPEAKER_00]: trajectory right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole survive weather, the storm,
because this plant and the demand for it
[SPEAKER_00]: has existed for hundreds of thousands,
millions of years from our species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna stay around and the illicit
market is booming.
[SPEAKER_00]: The legal industry is booming,
but access to the cannabis capital to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: doors open is lacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of the things I'm liking now,
there are, like you said, many distressed
[SPEAKER_00]: assets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Companies that were doing great,
were not prepared for this pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: How could you be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking about social distancing,
thinking about online ordering,
[SPEAKER_00]: curbside pickup.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I maintain a staff of 200
cultivators and trimmers and massive
[SPEAKER_00]: operations on multi-acre facilities and
keep them spread apart when I normally
[SPEAKER_00]: would have them all at certain places in
the assembly line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the most valuable capital now
is for the companies that had proven track
[SPEAKER_00]: records, had positive EBITDAs,
have cash flows and need the capital to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay in business, be it ancillary or be it
the direct hands-on companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, there are still many licensing
opportunities available in new states and
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdictions, even in new countries for
new licenses for cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing, import, export,
distribution, genetics, R&D.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still opportunities and limited
licenses states and countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a state like Illinois, where there's
only going to be about 150 dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: for millions and millions of people
compared to Colorado, it's a massive
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity because it's so limited and
hard to get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, would I invest into a cultivation
operation in Oregon right now or Oklahoma
[SPEAKER_00]: or Washington or Colorado, where there's
thousands of these cultivators,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all like maggots in a bucket
fighting for market share.
[SPEAKER_00]: But limited licenses in New Jersey and in
the United States, where there's no
restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-Corona, Corona, post-Corona will
always be on the forefront of my interest
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a new opportunity to help a
team develop a successful business that
[SPEAKER_00]: then eventually big mergers and
acquisitions can happen from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what's really intriguing right now
are supply chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supply chains are broken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the United States for months
couldn't even figure out how to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: face covering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think about complicated ethanol
extraction equipment, O-rings,
[SPEAKER_00]: specific lighting filaments that are
needed for some of these cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of those went away when Corona
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting harder and harder to order
certain goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the things that are the common,
hate to say it, the picks and shovels in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry are not available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most picks, instead of being 10 bucks a
pick, are like $37 a pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: These blue jeans that were 20 bucks are
now 150.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are opportunities for domestic US
companies or companies in other
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdictions that can help to alleviate
the supply shortage concerns that can
[SPEAKER_00]: really corner markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few public companies,
I'm not going to mention names,
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been silently acquiring many of
the picks and shovel companies of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not talking here about Gavita and Advanced
Nutrients and different companies that do
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient lines and from Monsanto-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is specifically steel, benches,
greenhouses, lights, extraction equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the companies that see this
longer-term vision knowing that as the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry continues to produce,
we're still going to need greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging and analytical testing and all
of these other aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm thinking now distressed
assets, people that supply goods and
[SPEAKER_00]: services or companies that there's this
thing that happens with new companies like
[SPEAKER_00]: burnout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already after working for let's say three
to five years and scaling and taking
[SPEAKER_00]: market share and bashing after competitors
and going after lawsuits, normal
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, they get kind of burned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had normal company burnout on top of
pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people, they just want out and they
don't know where the exit is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't just go public.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy like 2018 to just sell
yourself on some concept to a Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: public company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of founders and
people that just, they're scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what the future holds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've built some good companies and they
just want out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw one in California yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine licenses on a parcel in the lowest
tax jurisdictions in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing the mass, this thing could almost do
a half a billion dollars in revenue in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're right at the process of needing to
pull the trigger, spend about 10 million
[SPEAKER_00]: to build this whole thing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for eight million bucks, they take a
full exit right now because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're homeschooling their kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got things going on at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that uncertainty leads to massive
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we say, when there's blood in the
water, that's when the sharks eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is the best time I've ever seen for
making very strategic and positive
[SPEAKER_00]: investments in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Nick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think of investments,
what are your no's?
[SPEAKER_01]: When do you walk or what signs do you see
where you just say, no, you're not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to take a look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as an investor, it's always what
you say no to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more important than what you say
yes to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in cannabis for years, it was just
like, I'm a cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be a billion dollar industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any company that isn't rooted in
reality, and specifically whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: company is or does, if you take that word
cannabis out and you look at it,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's not attractive from a normal
business standpoint, it's not attractive
[SPEAKER_00]: to me on a cannabis standpoint either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it's cannabis, it doesn't
make you unique anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what is your strategic advantage?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your unique thing that you do that
no one else does?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it protectable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it scalable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a possibility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a possible exit from it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of the companies, if it's a
hands-on company, like a plant touching
[SPEAKER_00]: company, a grower, a manufacturer,
an edibles maker, a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_00]: a delivery company, I always look at what
their jurisdiction is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the state?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the trajectory for that state for
adult use legalization?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how's the adult use legalization going?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the neighboring states?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many licenses did they issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the tax and costs in maintaining
that license?
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically with that management team,
do they know cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they know outside industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: They know outside industry, it's much more
important to me than just having some
[SPEAKER_00]: unique way of growing or this unique light
that tweaks this one little thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be forward-looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of the investment theses and pitches
that I see currently, it's for what the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry was in 2016 to 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: This new light, this new product is going
to double your yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like the industrialization of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the industry is going instead
of these small little mom and pop
[SPEAKER_00]: operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless them for making medicine for
people for years and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But their cost of goods is so high
compared to a scale large-scale company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not interested in small little
cabinets where you can grow weed under
[SPEAKER_00]: your counter or some small little hand
trim machine or this thing to make butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like what are large-scale cultivators
and operators going to be using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the industry going and how are
they going to position themselves from
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, even from different IP
companies, from intellectual property or
[SPEAKER_00]: the drug development, drug discovery
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The common mantra in our world when it
comes to domestic US companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is where we make our money,
one of the world's largest cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the international arena is what's
going to be long-term so much more
[SPEAKER_00]: profitable and probably where cannabis is
produced and imported to the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be it for medical purposes, adult use
purposes, bulk API like active
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical ingredient development.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the industry is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now we have to operate in these
small little markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's unique in its small market
share, it hasn't made any past mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're running their companies,
they don't have past recalls, operational
[SPEAKER_00]: problems, lawsuits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there has to be something unique at
this point because just being cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I watch out for, I hear a couple of
acronyms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear CBD, I'm out almost
instantaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great cannabinoid, one of hundreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you get CBG popping up,
CBN, all of these varieties of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that we barely even
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're just a wagon of CBD now in
2020, you're shit out of luck,
[SPEAKER_00]: friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not doing anything special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thousands of other companies are doing
this before you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulations keep on changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you already have market share
scale and something unique and quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do we even know that that product's
bonafide, tested, legal to sell in
[SPEAKER_00]: different markets?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's your bulk supply coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes you unique other than buying 55
gallon drums of this oil, putting it into
[SPEAKER_00]: a package with a label and hustling it and
just selling goods like it's Nike shoes?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some of the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The normal buzzword bandwagons,
we see far too many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have a license yet and
you're trying to go for a license and
[SPEAKER_00]: raise capital, no, that's probably one of
the hardest places to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But getting that license, getting that
valuation, that's what really makes
[SPEAKER_00]: something unique from a hands-on
standpoint as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's follow on to that with some talk
about diligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you think about investing,
then you've covered some items and what
[SPEAKER_01]: you just said.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how do you go through diligence and
how do you really validate these things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know obviously with early stage,
sometimes you're told things, sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't look.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know investors who lost billions of
dollars in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And diligence may have found that with
some skills and knowledge, but how do you
[SPEAKER_01]: go about it, Nick?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like they say, the numbers
don't lie and trust but verify.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're an existing company or if
there's an existing company that's raising
[SPEAKER_00]: capital, first thing, make some audited
financial statements, not you,
[SPEAKER_00]: a certified public accountant,
a controller, an outsourced CFO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really get your shit together on a
financial standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to know how much money did you
start with this company?
[SPEAKER_00]: How have you been using that capital?
[SPEAKER_00]: How have you redeployed that capital
strategically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then I'm thinking if I'm going to
trust you with my capital or my LP's
[SPEAKER_00]: capital, do you know what you're doing and
have you used the capital you had before
[SPEAKER_00]: strategically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, have you gotten all of your legal
due diligence ducks in a row?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the company formed correctly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Board consent, controls, stock options,
warrants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you really done to create the
infrastructure legally for the company?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it protected?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those things, they'll say,
oh, we filed for our patents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It better be part of your data room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're raising cap or one of the
things I look for right away, even in the
[SPEAKER_00]: initial conversations, have they put
together a data room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they have a business plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not like a 1980s business plan,
but I need to know 10 key things from that
[SPEAKER_00]: business plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have they just made a fancy pitch deck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just some guy that created some
video games that can pitch and sound good
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for money, but doesn't really
provide that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it provide good returns?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of charlatans, a lot of
fraudsters out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis, it came from not the most
legal place, so it didn't bring forth a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of really good quality people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to understand the metrics of
your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the due diligence, do they have the
licenses they say?
[SPEAKER_00]: So much of this is public record.
[SPEAKER_00]: How transparent are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are their other owners?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, audited financial statements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's their strategic capital deployment
plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if I say to them in a due diligence
column, what's your five year plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you see this company in five
years?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, geez, I haven't really thought about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out because you're supposed to use
this capital to get bigger, take more
[SPEAKER_00]: market share, be more impactful in a more
successful business.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know or have an idea or a
vision of where you're going to be in five
[SPEAKER_00]: years, how am I supposed to trust that
you're going to use my capital wisely
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also need to specifically know
what that due diligence based on their
[SPEAKER_00]: audited financial statements with their
cashflow trajectory plan of how are they
[SPEAKER_00]: going to deploy that capital?
[SPEAKER_00]: With this $5 million, we're going to use
$2.4 million to buy this, $1.25 to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our monthly burn rate, staffing,
payroll, marketing, branding, legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: tax, compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to see those line items that
they've budgeted out a plan for how to use
[SPEAKER_00]: someone else's money to make that company
grow, which many people just think,
[SPEAKER_00]: I need like, I don't know, three to five
million bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they say that in a due diligence
process, I'm not interested either because
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't know what they need,
who they are, how they're going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: this capital and what they want to become.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what you need to prove in
your due diligence and in your data room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gather all your documents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it easy for the investors to say yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them the things they're going to need
to review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to just be like, oh,
you need capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in some conversations and now we
start talking months and months back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everything's ready and in one place,
it's much easier to get to that yes or no
[SPEAKER_00]: decision, but they have to know
specifically how much they need,
[SPEAKER_00]: how they're going to raise it,
and what's the next stage of growth of
[SPEAKER_00]: that company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk global markets for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there global markets that you like
Nick, specific areas out in the world that
[SPEAKER_01]: countries or larger that you think are the
best opportunities?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you've got a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, over this last five years from
some, we went from the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: we started working in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the first opportunities then in
Denmark, in Germany, then Portugal,
[SPEAKER_00]: in South Africa, then Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Peru and then Sri Lanka.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of massive opportunities out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: People see this is a very powerful
medicinal plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very potential large scale
industry that already is on the illicit
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many countries are looking at it just like
states in the US for economic growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I think about the earth,
which sorry to the flat earthers out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but it's probably a round planet to
the best of our knowledge, but countries
[SPEAKER_00]: that are close to the equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a dioecious plant,
boy plant, girl plant, makes one crop a
[SPEAKER_00]: year, makes a bunch of baby seeds,
dies, grows the next year from those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: How and where can I grow an agricultural
plant, inexpensively, high-quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: and also that has certain pharmaceutical
compacts that's not a hard country to do
[SPEAKER_00]: business in?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would look first at which countries are
legalized on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted, patients need medicine in each
jurisdiction, but independent of Canada or
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States or Uruguay right now,
I'm talking the rest of the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each country is coming up with their own
program of importation or standards,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if they can cultivate or manufacture.
[SPEAKER_00]: International, it's not about vape pens
and beverages and edibles and topicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about bulk flour and bulk oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was dull and I'm thinking about doing
bananas, I'm probably not going to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of licenses in Denmark or some
islands in the English Channel to grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of bananas to ship them around the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think about this international
programs, I've really been excited about
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico for years, but I've seen what a
shit show it's become when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: their Supreme Court, the regulations,
Canadian public companies, meddling and
[SPEAKER_00]: messing it all up, combining adult use,
medical, hemp, all into one thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking that was going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also look at the countries, how have
they set up their laws and policies with
[SPEAKER_00]: the international narcotics control board?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they thinking about actually
producing in their country for their own
[SPEAKER_00]: constituents?
[SPEAKER_00]: And patients, and then how potentially
through that would they have an
[SPEAKER_00]: international export commodity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just let's grow some weed,
make some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense, Georgia, no offense,
Macedonia, no offense, Greece,
[SPEAKER_00]: no offense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those countries that did it in
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And God bless them for taking the moment
to try to legalize something that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal for far too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So internationally, I think, you know,
Mexico sounded exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Mexico will be a great place for
hemp in the future, great for adult use
[SPEAKER_00]: tourism in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not going to be an international medical
cannabis leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia, really good law at first,
kind of problematic processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of groups just thought,
oh, Colombia is perfect because it's near
[SPEAKER_00]: the equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you've got really high mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got these coastal sea places.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got past kind of narco terrorism.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got unstable governments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got shoot past president Arrive
like under house arrest right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kind of powder keg,
but I love Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been there many, many times,
helped with many of the licenses there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see massive opportunity in Colombia,
as well as in Peru, based on their
[SPEAKER_00]: anticipated license process, even though
it's already in the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many people are interested in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Brazil is going to be a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great for hemp in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But based on the coronavirus and some
other aspects, I'm not mentioning anything
[SPEAKER_00]: about corruption here right now,
but Brazil is going to have some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other ones that are some of my
favorite, the European Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, massive, kind of like the United
States when it comes to market share and
[SPEAKER_00]: economic opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cold as fuck in Europe in the winter
and kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a bunch of people close
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The land's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got angry people all over,
like not the place where you want to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: bananas year round either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you have some countries like
Spain and Portugal, with Portugal some
[SPEAKER_00]: really amicable laws and licenses that
could be an EU GMP producer of bulk API
[SPEAKER_00]: and flour and a possible like bridge for
other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think that there's a few secret
countries in Asia, not talking right now
[SPEAKER_00]: about China and their CBD plays and all of
that, or Thailand's medical program now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at Malaysia,
when you look at the Philippines,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you look at a couple of the other
countries where cannabis used to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you talk about it, you die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to like now being picks
countries, PIC-S might have some very
[SPEAKER_00]: unique economic opportunities with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia had some opportunities really
early on, their medical programs getting
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But equally, just like South Africa and
other places, the farther away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: equator with a photo period plant where
I'm trying to grow this year round,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I can have 12 hours of darkness,
12 hours of light induced flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think internationally, the countries
with the best regulations that are the
[SPEAKER_00]: least unstable with the best agricultural
climates and also favorable pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: laws and regulations that have not done
things to shit on the INCB, the
[SPEAKER_00]: international narcotics control board,
which keeps them in a high standing
[SPEAKER_00]: position for pharmaceutical drug
development, drug discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel, yeah, been awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Mishulam, years of research,
all of the medical licenses, what some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those countries have done, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the problems with tax,
political instability, not a member of the
[SPEAKER_00]: European Union.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain aspects where each country
kind of has its strengths and weaknesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, I'll never put all my eggs in
one basket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that long-term, it's going to
be a conglomeration of various countries,
[SPEAKER_00]: various companies within those countries
that are going to take the massive market
[SPEAKER_00]: share that'll get the massive
pharmaceutical exits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hence, Peru, Colombia, Portugal,
South Africa has a lot of promise,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of problems with coronavirus right
now as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The countries that can weather the storm,
because we've all been prepping for this
[SPEAKER_00]: UN vote that's supposed to happen and
keeps getting delayed from coronavirus or
[SPEAKER_00]: China and Russia kind of mess with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when the UN through the WHO and they
change their stance on this, or a
[SPEAKER_00]: potential de-schedule or rescheduling,
that's when international medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that happens, if you're trying to
get into a country, you're already too
[SPEAKER_00]: late.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at my stage, prospecting the best
opportunities in the best new markets to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the greatest good for the greatest
number, also knowing even if I'm in the
[SPEAKER_00]: best country with the best laws and the
best climate, shit happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Companies fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fraud, deceit, misappropriation of funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you've seen the movie Gold,
it's like you build this great thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got this gold mine that's going on,
you don't partner with the right homies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Government just takes away your license,
gives it to the bigger homies that are
[SPEAKER_00]: more homies with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw this yesterday with a property.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens time and time again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so knowing human nature, you've got to
really diversify your investment
[SPEAKER_00]: strategies if you're getting into
international medical cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: international adult use, which is
completely illegal, but of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: going to happen long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: But going in and just going out there and
prospecting and guessing, most investors
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't going to find the right
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: International has a huge long hold
position.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like I've got some short-term
cash flows, some medium-term like
[SPEAKER_00]: acquisitions and IP deals, and then a
public offering or an M&A long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all medium to long-term
investments.
[SPEAKER_00]: US is great for short, medium,
and long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go into the international arena
without the right guidance, be it in
[SPEAKER_00]: investments or be it on the business
operational side, you're most likely going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get burned like we've seen to countless
investors internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Nick.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have time, I think, for one more
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about investment vehicles now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the rage on Wall Street these days
are special purpose acquisition companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: SPACs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen some of these in cannabis pop
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, in the US, not possible yet,
but other countries like Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any thoughts on SPACs as vehicles or what
do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: How will those play a role in cannabis in
the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: SPACs are great and they've raised over $2
billion just sitting dry powder,
[SPEAKER_00]: just ready to go to war.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with most of the SPACs,
which there's been a few of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that their investment thesis and based
on the valuations and what they set their
[SPEAKER_00]: mandate that they would use that money
for, Corona happened and they thought it
[SPEAKER_00]: was here and now it's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of them are just sitting and
can't deploy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some very strategic special
purpose acquisition vehicles for either
[SPEAKER_00]: joining single-state operators where
you've got let's call it dispensaries in
[SPEAKER_00]: California, great state, 40 million plus
people, huge revenue, all broken down by
[SPEAKER_00]: municipalities and which cities are legal
or not and how many they allow,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that jazz.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there was a SPAC, for example,
it's like I'm going to take quarter
[SPEAKER_00]: billion dollars and roll up as many of
these single operators into one company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like there's 40 different gas
stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get them all and make them
all shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sort of acquisition vehicle now would
be incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many are desperate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coronavirus, we don't have, like I said,
the federal bankrupt protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's some very strategic
borderline predatory capital plays that
[SPEAKER_00]: can help out the operators, help out the
investors, help out the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So SPACs are one option.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's always the public
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're investing into public companies,
but who knows because 95% of what they say
[SPEAKER_00]: is complete fraud and lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all speculation like, oh,
this could happen, forward-looking
[SPEAKER_00]: statements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really hard to verify some of the
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, our stock portfolio side would be
like up like 40% when it comes to like
[SPEAKER_00]: what's actually happening now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can get burned very easily on
these public companies because especially
[SPEAKER_00]: the Canadian ones, there's such lack of
regulation and so much fraud and so much
[SPEAKER_00]: over oversaturation that a lot of them are
desperate right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the cannabis venture
funds, 70% of them have no idea what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were great at Goldman's, great with
Lehman Brothers, great with all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff they did in capital and wearing
pinstripe suits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they didn't understand the industry
and they got distracted by these shiny
[SPEAKER_00]: things and that's a great idea and have
lost hundreds of millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few other ones are doing pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that when you can find good fund
managers, even if it's small fee
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, they know the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works in other industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like for starting early stage
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So private venture funds I think are a
really good way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also manage a few of those and I think
that with the amount of opportunities that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have that need investment, real estate
investments for portfolio companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's almost a no-brainer not to go in this
alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other access, cannabis REITs, real estate
investment trusts, be it public or
[SPEAKER_00]: private, I think are phenomenal because
when you have cannabis operational
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, you've got the need for
property and lights and for litigation and
[SPEAKER_00]: rents and lease, all the tenant
improvements.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be financed through real estate
investments backed by the asset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What bill do you pay first every month?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your lease.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where your license is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you have to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their returns are positive and always
doing well, as long as it's the right
[SPEAKER_00]: types of buildings in the right states
with the right operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of companies got burned on investing
with the wrong ones of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's always direct private
placements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Private companies that need capital that
you hear about need a couple million
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars, healthy valuation, maybe get a
board seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, I don't put all my eggs
in one basket, putting all your
[SPEAKER_00]: investments into one company is very
dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's a baby little unicorn,
it can fall and break its leg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can get eaten by a wolf, trampled by a
guy in a buffalo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So diversifying those investments,
be it through a REIT, be it through,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're going to buy public stocks,
look at multiples.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's Cresco doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's GTI doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's Trulia doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much worrying about what MenMen's
doing anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe put some in a few of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good way to lose a lot of money
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with coronavirus, I have no idea how
the public markets are doing so well,
[SPEAKER_00]: but cannabis companies are starting to
thrive through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say like best bet, do your
homework, do your research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coronavirus has completely changed our
investment thesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of like, what's our hold position?
[SPEAKER_00]: What sort of companies meet our mandate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I've definitely shifted my
thesis a little to be adaptive in this
[SPEAKER_00]: time because there's so many companies
that are doing great things, making
[SPEAKER_00]: cashflow, growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't have that little extra gas
or that turbo to make the turbo diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: like soar and they're just chugging up the
hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of the private companies,
I think now need a couple extra gears to
[SPEAKER_00]: go a little faster, ramp things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Investors can probably get two or three
times more for their money right now in
[SPEAKER_00]: this next couple of months to the end of
the year, because this isn't going away
[SPEAKER_00]: anytime soon, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be around and we have to
weather the storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already done it for 15 plus years as
individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry, the plan's done it for
hundreds of years with the problems that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've thrown at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now is like really the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to be investing,
a lot of sectors are dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably investing into the Cheesecake
Factory or Dave and Buster's or Best Buy,
[SPEAKER_00]: not your best options right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole world is changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that's not changing is this is a
fucking amazing, amazing plant that we
[SPEAKER_00]: honor, love, protect and are caregivers of
and protect this as the industry grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The demand for this plant is only going to
rise.
[SPEAKER_00]: More jurisdictions will legalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better education will continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people will be consuming this
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have new innovations from it,
new supplies needed to produce it,
[SPEAKER_00]: to test it, to regulate it, to ensure it,
to tax it, all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's one bet that I'm comfortable
with, especially during a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: depressing pandemic, alcohol sales look at
what's happened way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not saying cannabis is just a vice
industry, but many people are using
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis right now therapeutically,
stuck at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get medicine for the people and this
industry, like I said, we're not going
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many companies are going to fall,
but it's going to be a time to build new
[SPEAKER_00]: empires.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a new time in that game where you
shake up the pieces again to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry was getting pretty
established.
[SPEAKER_00]: Players were getting bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing just earthquake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like, okay, what's going to
happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, the earthquake's not over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you're navigating the investment
space, the business opportunities,
[SPEAKER_00]: know that things are going to continue to
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But where you put those chits on the
board, you got to be out there with an
[SPEAKER_00]: umbrella singing in the rain right now and
not just standing there getting wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of companies are just standing
there getting wet and thinking like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this is going to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun's going to come up.
