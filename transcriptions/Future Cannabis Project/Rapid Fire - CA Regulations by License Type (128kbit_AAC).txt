[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do the rapid fire because
they think it's fun and Peter wants to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go through each license type and
what is the good, the bad, and the ugly
[SPEAKER_02]: that came from the permanent rigs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you want to start?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start at nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what's interesting about
nursery is that there's still these
[SPEAKER_01]: definitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to switch gears from nursery to
the situation that there's two definitions
[SPEAKER_01]: for immature plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you cannot get the Bureau of Cannabis
Control and the California Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Food and Agriculture to agree on what the
definition of an immature plant is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's this residual misunderstanding
of how tall it should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tell my clients, look for the
intent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the intent for you to sell the clone or
the immature plant to a consumer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is the intent for it to stay in the
upper part of the supply chain in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how you're going to assess
which definition you use because we just
[SPEAKER_02]: simply could not find consistency in
nursery.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that was a great one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, you want to do cultivation?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the premise diagram was the most
concerning for me that really screwed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people's existing premise
diagrams, existing local authorizations,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's going to be a big thing to
grapple with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether or not CDFA is going to be
open to this new form of local
[SPEAKER_02]: authorization versus an expressed local
permit, I think is going to either show to
[SPEAKER_02]: be promising and a conduit for most
operators to leverage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's not, it's going to be a real
big problem with reconfiguration,
[SPEAKER_02]: premise, moving things around,
loss of efficiency, loss of space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, from cultivation point of view,
that was one of the biggest things that I
[SPEAKER_02]: saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the other thing to talk about in
terms of cultivation license types,
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation licensees specifically,
is not necessarily the implications of the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the implication of under statutory
ability to issue temporary licenses,
[SPEAKER_01]: the rush, the super rush of applications
that happen up until the end of 2018 of
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody applying for temporary
authorizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be quite interesting to
see how many of those end up persevering
[SPEAKER_01]: and being able to file a sufficient amount
of documents, be able to be eligible for
[SPEAKER_01]: those provisional license types.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that many of these applications
were prospective at best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would, in this context, buyer beware
if you're an investor into what purports
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a fully licensed state compliant
cultivation operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have a pathway to provisional,
let alone annual.
[SPEAKER_01]: This might have been, frankly,
a waste of time on the part of the state
[SPEAKER_01]: licensing authorities to process all of
these aspirational temporary applications
[SPEAKER_01]: at the cultivation level.
[SPEAKER_02]: One little important practice tip,
too, that I've noticed is that a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: operators, especially when putting SOPs in
place, which is what protects you from
[SPEAKER_02]: enforcement actions and also helps to
draft corrective actions, is that it is
[SPEAKER_02]: important to note that regulators did not
feel like they needed to put statutory
[SPEAKER_02]: language into the regulations because it's
hardwired in by statute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this little thing, and we're jumping
around, but this was important because we
[SPEAKER_02]: saw a bunch of billboards around.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we drove up to do this live taping
today, they do not have permit numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know why in the regulations it says
nowhere in that advertising section that
[SPEAKER_02]: you need to have your license number on
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because it is in the business and
professions code in the statute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says you must have at minimum your
license number.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means it must be on every billboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: That means when you do your social media,
it needs to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It lives synonymous with your logo.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I like to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your logo and your license number should
be like a united front, and anywhere one
[SPEAKER_02]: is, the other one likely will need to be
if you are doing advertisements.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to be looking at the statutory
requirements as well as the regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anything that the regulations
reference, such as the Outdoor Advertising
[SPEAKER_02]: Act or the Poison Prevention Act or
anything else, you need to go down the
[SPEAKER_02]: rabbit hole and read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are not just responsible for cannabis
compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are responsible for compliance across
the continuum of anything that touches
[SPEAKER_02]: your business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just like a universal point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you want that license number to be
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hardwired in statute.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were doing an advertisement and you
are so that new language that came into
[SPEAKER_02]: the BCC that says an act omission or
failure of any advertising or marketing
[SPEAKER_02]: company that you hire is the act omission
or failure of the licensee.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you hire an advertising company to
go out and market for you, I hope that
[SPEAKER_02]: they have audience compilation data that
shows that 71.6 percent and don't ask me
[SPEAKER_02]: how they came up with 71.6 percent,
but that 71.6 percent of the audience
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to be viewing this
advertisement is over the age of 21.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's your responsibility to keep that
data on you on site with you and in your
[SPEAKER_02]: record keeping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they only tell you what audience
compilation data is not.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't tell you what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to rely and pay that forward
in any agreement that you have with these
[SPEAKER_02]: social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same as with your employees like
we saw with the labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go back and look at that,
any act omission or failure of the
[SPEAKER_02]: employee is the act omission or failure of
your licensee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at Sequoia Labs, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, well, it was the employee we
didn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is your responsibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you are just as culpable as anybody
making those determinations and decisions
[SPEAKER_02]: at your business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those, I think, are important takeaways
from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a manufacturer's ad that we saw
on the way here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still need your manufacturer's
temporary license number.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a delicious cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that it's a delicious cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you still got to be compliant with
your advertising.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put a sticker on it, just like with
packaging and labeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regulatory whiplash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you pre-July one or post-July one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want CRP on the retailer's bags?
[SPEAKER_02]: And my point of fact is don't take in
product after May, June, July that you may
[SPEAKER_02]: not sell out of because there is no more
grace period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come Jan 1 of 2020, CRP at the product
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think that you're going to go
all the way... CRP and resealable CRP.
[SPEAKER_02]: And resealable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think you're going to go all the
way to December, not putting CRP on your
[SPEAKER_02]: products, buyer beware.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be buyer beware of the retailer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beware of the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That may be defective product coming back
to you that needs to be replaced.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where is the agency's giveth?
[SPEAKER_02]: They giveth a little bit every time with a
poison pill.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's up to you to make the business
decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much is it going to cost me to do it
quickly versus how much is it going to
[SPEAKER_02]: cost me to phase it in?
[SPEAKER_02]: And from the retailer's perspective,
are you going to allow for your store to
[SPEAKER_02]: carry both CRP at the product level that's
resealable or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: And are you going to invest in using your
CRP exit bags?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about another issue at the
manufacturing level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, there's not much to
talk about because the localities have not
[SPEAKER_01]: issued...
[SPEAKER_01]: Pamela was talking earlier before about
how the processor license type is quite
[SPEAKER_01]: often not understood at the local level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's one license type that's
absolutely not understood at the local
[SPEAKER_01]: level, and that's the shared license type
that has been available as of the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations emanated from the regulatory
authorities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it needs to be explicitly enabled in
local ordinance for that to be an approved
[SPEAKER_01]: license type.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what the shared manufacturing license
type, we're all familiar with,
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial kitchens whereby different
operators can come in for a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: hours, do what they need to do,
and then clean up after themselves and
[SPEAKER_01]: allow for another entrepreneur to come in
and share the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we don't have that anywhere in the
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yet again, it's the local authorities,
it's the local municipalities that are
[SPEAKER_01]: failing to understand what the state is
trying to implement and try to manifest a
[SPEAKER_01]: licensing structure that's reasonably
drafted and well thought through and
[SPEAKER_01]: provides licensing pathways for businesses
that are out there for struggling
[SPEAKER_01]: entrepreneurs, particularly, we know not
necessarily in the extraction space,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in the infused space.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's quite a lot of boutique food
producers that would love to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: add cannabis to their products and have a
difficult time finding a licensed premise.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are small businesses, each of which
would need to get a business license in
[SPEAKER_01]: the jurisdiction, each of which would be
paying a percentage of revenues back
[SPEAKER_01]: towards the local jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, each of which would be both
creating jobs and keeping that money
[SPEAKER_01]: circulating more locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is it that local authorities cannot
seem to implement the shared manufacturing
[SPEAKER_01]: license type?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a pickle.
[SPEAKER_02]: That gets into 5032B, but we don't really
have a whole bunch of time to talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That in and of itself is a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's important to understand that
DPH is a little bit more willing to have
[SPEAKER_02]: contract manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The issue becomes how you're going to get
that product to market, because that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what flips the switch to getting BCC
involved is the distributor.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it's going to come down to
contracting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's really working specifically
with an attorney to understand at what
[SPEAKER_02]: point do you want to be a financial
interested party?
[SPEAKER_02]: At what point are you an owner?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you detailing these SOPs?
[SPEAKER_02]: How much control does the brand actually
have?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, direction management or control.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are very specific terms and you have
to contract very specifically for them and
[SPEAKER_02]: to how you're going to grapple with that
as a brand that doesn't necessarily have a
[SPEAKER_02]: license.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that is a very high level cursory
review.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's such a nuanced topic that
you could be talking about it for an
[SPEAKER_02]: entire hour or longer to get into those
weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's one of the biggest issues I see
from the BCC's perspective that affects
[SPEAKER_02]: distributors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'd say the other interesting
aspect of discussing distribution over the
[SPEAKER_01]: last year versus this upcoming year is
while last year the requirement to afford
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of your shipping manifest as well as
provide documentation that the proper
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation tax and excise tax were
collected by the distributor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this year is when the rubber hits
the road in terms of real time engagement,
[SPEAKER_01]: not only sometimes with the requirement to
be uplinked to the BCC via a track and
[SPEAKER_01]: trace mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once that gets turned on, there's also
some local authorities that are also
[SPEAKER_01]: requiring participation in a track and
trace mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I think is also going to come into
the conversation regarding the tax relief
[SPEAKER_01]: bill that's been authored by
Assemblymember Bonta, my Assemblymember,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the second year in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did not make the persuasive case last
year that we needed tax relief and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately blocked in the assembly
appropriations committee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's been reintroduced this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think going into that tax relief
conversation, we're best suited to get
[SPEAKER_01]: that tax relief granted to us if we
behaved well last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be awfully difficult to ask
for tax relief if you weren't even
[SPEAKER_01]: following the rules that did exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't really know how that
conversation is going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the very least, we understood the
dynamic last year that it was deemed,
[SPEAKER_01]: quote, too expensive to be able to provide
relief last year by the chair of the
[SPEAKER_01]: assembly appropriations committee.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's been reappointed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the same sort of potential,
not roadblock, but gatekeeper to move
[SPEAKER_01]: forward with the tax relief bill this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully we can coordinate our
requests and coordinate our asks for
[SPEAKER_01]: relief for taxes and be able to say that,
listen, it's been too unreasonable to
[SPEAKER_01]: follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, we shouldn't say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's complex to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd say that's not necessarily related
to the distribution angle per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: That perpetuates throughout the supply
chain the tax relief issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just to sort of round out the
supply chain, obviously at the retail
[SPEAKER_01]: level, the greatest changes have occurred
for the delivery license types.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that delivery license type,
remember, was not initially in statute.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another one that was created
through the promulgation of regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses created through the regulatory
process, the rulemaking process even.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we have now is the ability for
dynamic delivery license models.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the ability for an expanded amount
of product to be carried around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most worryingly, on the part of some
localities that have chosen to ban,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have the ability for delivery services
to be able to deliver to places that are,
[SPEAKER_01]: quote, unquote, ban jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that going to work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the carrot or stick that's applied
in terms of the attribution of tax
[SPEAKER_01]: proceeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: And reasonableness, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Each locality that doesn't want delivery
can impose some amount of reasonable but
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy-handed regulation for those that
want to deliver into the cities to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is well within the city's ambit of
allowance of control over their
[SPEAKER_02]: jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that's not blocking or prohibiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there may be some cases that come out
from this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where on the continuum does that fall of
your reasonable regulation of making
[SPEAKER_02]: people identify themselves, ensuring that
you're collecting taxes?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of different ways to skin a
cat, as that saying goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're going to see these cities
try to exert as much control as they can
[SPEAKER_02]: because they were promised dual parallel
licensing ability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're sort of chipping away at
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's yet to be seen at what watershed
moment the localities are going to come in
[SPEAKER_02]: and really start to exert themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is going to be an aspect of how
well the retailers and the non-steer or
[SPEAKER_02]: front retailers respect this process and
assure that they're providing safe
[SPEAKER_02]: vehicles, that they're adhering to the new
requirements that you cannot use any form
[SPEAKER_02]: of your car to secure product,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not include coolers either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there have been incidents the day
after, the day after.
[SPEAKER_02]: Timing can be quite difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of which, I think we are out of
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we feeling?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we're out.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So come and hang out with us again,
preferably, I guess, on the 15th.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody buy your tickets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And come and we'll talk about more fun
issues like homogeny and the 10% variance
[SPEAKER_02]: that is going to be a big vexing issue in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody will agree with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be right back.
