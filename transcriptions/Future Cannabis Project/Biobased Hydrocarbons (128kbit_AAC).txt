[SPEAKER_01]: Our industrial life has led us,
the world's industry has led us to this
[SPEAKER_01]: place where we take fossil fuels,
we take fossil, you know, oil and natural
[SPEAKER_01]: gas, coal, oil and natural gas,
and we do things with them for industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's a linear conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We extract 400 million year old
hydrocarbons out of the earth,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we burn them, turn them into plastic,
any number of things, we destroy them,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we're destroying Mother Nature in
the extraction part, but then in the use
[SPEAKER_01]: part, we're putting that carbon in the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what doesn't end up in the ocean as
plastic ends up in the atmosphere as
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon dioxide, and that's what's choking
us right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can do the hydrocarbon management
without extracting it from the,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can do four month old or four year old
hydrocarbons from bio-based, biomethane,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we don't have to extract from 400
million years ago, we can produce the
[SPEAKER_01]: biocarbons that we need for our life here,
for billions of people living on this
[SPEAKER_01]: earth, and we can do that in a way that's
sustainable, more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's move in that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the conversations of recycling and the
conversations of hemp as an important
[SPEAKER_01]: biological source for these hydrocarbons,
that's the, these are the answers that get
[SPEAKER_01]: you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain that a little bit more?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you extract four year old
hydrocarbons?
[SPEAKER_01]: Through anaerobic digestion, but you can
also do it through gasification if you
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to, but essentially you make a
soup, you hire, you put biologicals in
[SPEAKER_01]: there from human waste to any kinds of
organic food trimmings.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a pure source of organics,
then you're gonna get three things out of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna get gases, you're gonna get
liquids, and you're gonna get solids.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gases are hydrocarbon gases,
and the trick is the hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all love hydrogen, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the first element, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we love hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here because of hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hydrogen, you're getting the
hydrogen from the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bugs, the little microbes are
consuming the organics in the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're giving you CH4, four Hs and
one C, one carbon, four hydrogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, we're lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're lucky that we can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an important element that we need
access to, and we're getting it almost for
[SPEAKER_01]: free from these microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a waste product, quote unquote,
that we use, things we used to throw away,
[SPEAKER_01]: or things that we can grow, and the
byproducts of some of these we can channel
[SPEAKER_01]: into the bioenergy conversation,
and this gets us out of the fossil fuel
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a one-for-one exchange for natural
gas, for fracking for natural gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get that renewable natural gas or
biomethane from today, so that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: 400 million years ago, four-year-old,
40-year-old tree, whatever it's gonna be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get biogases from that,
and with the same hydrocarbon gases,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can make plastics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can make the things that we use today
that we find convenient or helpful,
[SPEAKER_01]: a heart valve or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some good things for,
if you need to use plastics, there are
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons to use it, but it could be
bioplastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be from the fossil
fuels.
