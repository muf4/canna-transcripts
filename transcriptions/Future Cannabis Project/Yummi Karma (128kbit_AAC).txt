[SPEAKER_01]: We focus on edibles, topicals,
and tinctures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we are a little different than a lot
of people is that our target is women.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people ask us when we got into
the industry, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of people have this idea of
what a cannabis user looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to help change the face of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to help normalize the products,
especially with a lot of you being moms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to hit on three different
things that we want to talk about tonight
[SPEAKER_01]: that we thought was important.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them being that there was a gap in
the marketplace for women.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why we started Yomi Perma in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were kind of thinking of going in this
direction and our first women girl meeting
[SPEAKER_01]: Jasmine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you know who that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was the first one to stand up and say,
women please, let's make products for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a definite lack of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two years ago when I would walk into a
collective, I didn't really feel like a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the products spoke to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't really anything that jumped
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We shop a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have that feeling when I was in
the collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when we started focusing on women.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think about what does that mean,
it doesn't mean just making something
[SPEAKER_01]: pink.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were trying to approach it more in a
way of how do we create a product that
[SPEAKER_01]: fits into your lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be discreet, especially if you have
children.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that can be a, it's almost like a
shaming thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People cannot enjoy cannabis the way they
can wine, like different alcohols.
[SPEAKER_01]: That became a major focus for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it was our branding, our
packaging, the way we looked at doing
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the way our company runs,
we're very approachable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Patients feel very comfortable emailing us
all the time, asking us questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: We answer their questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't treat this as corporate America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though we're trying to fit into a
really traditional business model.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we're all really asking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want this industry to be just like any
other industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to treat it that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: The great thing about everyone in this
room, as far as cannabis is concerned,
[SPEAKER_04]: is we are different.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to embrace that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to be approachable.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to answer people's questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, women shop differently than men.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a little research.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're starting a business,
if you're going to do edibles or something
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to be sold in the
collectives, I highly recommend that you
[SPEAKER_01]: find someone that will let you sit in
their collective for a few hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch how the patients engage with the,
we used to call them bud tenders,
[SPEAKER_01]: but now they like to be called cannabis
consultants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true, it's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give you a demonstration of how men
shop and how women shop.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have samples here.
I'm a guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before she even finishes what this is,
they're already putting it in their mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They walk away, they're like, this is
great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't even told them what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: A woman comes up and she's like,
hi, what's your name?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, where are you from?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any children?
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know their whole life story.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know every single ingredient in the
product, how we made it, at what
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature, what time of day,
what day of the week, and everything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually women are more likely to be like,
okay, so how much do I take?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long is it going to take until it
kicks in?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much do I apply if it's topical?
[SPEAKER_01]: We started to realize that a lot of this
information wasn't on the packaging,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it wasn't being addressed,
and it wasn't being taught to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: consultants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really hard one to break.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will have them again one day when we
have cafes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That became a big part of how do we
address the products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this takes us into, they all lead
in together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compliance was something that was just
talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tracy pointed out a very good fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all have to be good players.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know if you look on your Instagram or
wherever, you can see people who seem to
[SPEAKER_01]: be in it for a quick buck, short term.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're definitely not trying to focus on
being around a long time from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as with compliance with what we've
done, including a lot of legal bills,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have like 10 lawyers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are things that you can start doing
that doesn't just include, which you
[SPEAKER_01]: should get a lawyer for this, but there's
other things you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things we did was we started
focusing on the Northern market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing against you guys down here in LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be easier down here than
getting into the club and up north if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're making any products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: San Francisco and Berkeley are way ahead
on regulations, whether it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging, the first time we walked in
with the product, we were doing soft
[SPEAKER_01]: bottles and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was actually chased out of a collective.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's not following a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was chased out of a collective by a
buyer because my packaging was- Not
[SPEAKER_01]: compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to have that effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although that collective did just call us
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're back.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are things you can start doing like,
for example, edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see a lot of products right now that
have pictures of the edible on the
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be legal in 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't waste the money into doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do side things instead if you
really want to show off your products.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, we do potato chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our bag, and if any of you guys want to
look at our products if you haven't seen
[SPEAKER_01]: them, it's like on Instagram, it's
yummikarma.com or yummikarma, Y-U-M-M-I.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't the most clever thing to do at the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that it's appealing,
but it is not child friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We make sure it's child resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I went off what I was going to say
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we just became one of the most
compliant edible companies in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: That has led to media attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, yummikarma, you're the most compliant
edible company in the state with your
[SPEAKER_04]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: How does it feel?
[SPEAKER_04]: That has gotten us so many collectives to
call us and say, I want to carry your
[SPEAKER_04]: product because you're responsible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a big investment, but it pays off.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to think about what you can
sell today.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to think about what you can sell
for five or 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if you want to sell your company
someday, what can you do to set yourself
[SPEAKER_04]: up for them?
[SPEAKER_04]: We are thinking of ourselves as down the
line.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not looking at today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that is what is set us apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Packaging is not cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do it, you want to make sure that
you're doing it for the long term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes back to the compliance
issue, we were fortunate enough to go back
[SPEAKER_01]: to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get the chance, it's an amazing
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: To see how the industry is unfolding
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made friends and had mentors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've ever heard of
Love's Oven, but they were the second
[SPEAKER_01]: edible manufacturing company to get their
license in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave us a tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shared a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing they kept saying was
over-compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over-compliance, over-compliance,
over-compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like Tracy said, people,
the officials, the city, everybody that's
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to figure this out is going to look
towards the good players.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to want to work with the
people setting the right example.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me tell you that you guys are
probably, the first meeting we went to,
[SPEAKER_04]: we heard someone stand up and say,
I have 10 lawyers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't believe it, but they really do.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have 10 lawyers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We looked and we were like, we have like
$5 in our bank account, so how are we
[SPEAKER_04]: going to manage that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you what, it doesn't cost a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go online, go to San Francisco or
Berkeley or any collective that you strive
[SPEAKER_04]: to be in, or if you're a grower,
anyone that you respect in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can even look on the county's website
up north.
[SPEAKER_04]: They literally will tell you, say this,
this, this, this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Berkeley Patients Group is a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They literally have like 20 pages of what
you have to do in order to get into their
[SPEAKER_01]: collective.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's against the lawyers, Lisa.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to put it in that list,
but it's a good starting ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can follow those guidelines,
and then if you're already at that point,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then give it to a lawyer to look over,
that saves you a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The compliance actually, like we said,
goes back to targeting women, targeting
[SPEAKER_01]: women who have children in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not having something that is appealing to
children, and our bags are now child
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other brands that we know,
like Mary Jane, I always get it wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss Mary Jane's too many.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've switched over too, so there's a
lot of us that are trying to be the good
[SPEAKER_01]: players in the industry, and that's what
we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I was reading up on Weed Week,
and in Colorado there's a backlash right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: 70% of the cities have banned commercial
cannabis, so you'll hear a lot in
[SPEAKER_01]: California, oh the vote's gonna happen,
we're gonna be good, it's gonna be legal,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's gonna be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not necessarily the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now everybody's watching,
and anybody who messes up could affect all
[SPEAKER_01]: of us, so we need to make sure that we're
all in this together to create a safe
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the great thing about our industry,
everyone's so friendly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are our competitors, but we don't
look at you like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all look at each other as friends,
and what can I do to help you?
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked about going to Los Alamos in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you call any company, I guarantee you,
they will give you a tour of their
[SPEAKER_04]: facility, they will give you advice in the
least, they will help you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, oh yeah, I met this person,
and I think that they can help you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all trying to, we are all on the
ground floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all can move up together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you guys are here,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that kinda leads us to branding
and marketing where we might get a little
[SPEAKER_01]: harsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you'll notice our products when
you were to see them, for instance,
[SPEAKER_01]: in an Instagram post, it's obvious what it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have big lettering, it's easy to read,
everything is laid out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell you how many times when I'm
looking through every morning because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: always checking to see who's new and who's
out there, I can't tell what it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first and foremost, remember,
when a patient walks into a collective,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're looking, and they have all of
these brands they could pick from,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to not only stand out,
but you want to make sure that your
[SPEAKER_01]: product is obvious, because a lot of
people are getting really into the look of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you can't put a picture of it,
because we would love to put, we actually
[SPEAKER_01]: had pictures on our bags originally,
and they were only, no, and they weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: even pictures of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, we do a sour cream and onion
chip.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a picture of an onion, like a
drawing, can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do that right now, and not in
San Francisco or Berkeley, though,
[SPEAKER_01]: but leading up to 2018, we're encouraging
other people, we see people come out with
[SPEAKER_01]: this awesome packaging, and you can tell
they've spent a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big portion of your budget,
trust me, and you don't want to get stuck
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure it works on the road,
and if you look at your packaging,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's great if it looks great when you're
just looking at it, but picture how it's
[SPEAKER_04]: going to look when you're in a sea of 500
products.
[SPEAKER_04]: How is it going to sit on the shelf?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it going to sit upright, or is it going
to lay down?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like our chips, for example, we had a toy
around with our, we get a bunch of holes
[SPEAKER_04]: in each one, and have a, how are patients,
right now, you care about how patients are
[SPEAKER_04]: going to look at your product,
and how it's going to stand out without
[SPEAKER_04]: being child-friendly, and there's a fine
line.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it can be difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little story on one of our mistakes
that we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always think it's good to share
something so that you guys don't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we started off Yummy Karma,
we actually had a different logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a Buddha, real original.
[SPEAKER_01]: We liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm half Japanese.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, this isn't offensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you're trying to grow a national
brand, or even go international,
[SPEAKER_01]: it could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other thing was, it just didn't
stand out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of people doing a Buddha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily we didn't have a generic name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yummy Karma, for some reason, people just
tend to remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we invested a lot into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't really, you know, we bought the
trade show stuff, we bought shirts,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we went to a show, and we were
like, oh, we're not the only ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a Buddha.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's a Buddha.
[SPEAKER_04]: All Buddhas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: My advice to you guys is you cannot get
attached to anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You make any logo, you have to be open to
hearing what the market tells you.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have ditched so many products that we
were like, this is the next best thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's on the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't fall in love with your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can after it makes you a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But until then, it's smart to listen to
the feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get defensive about things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people are, they're being brutally
honest, but that's kind of what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was painful to throw it all away.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were things that we ditched too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you have to remember, we got some of
this advice, that you are only as strong
[SPEAKER_04]: as your weakest product.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even if all of your other products are
flying off the shelves, and you have these
[SPEAKER_04]: screens that are doing really well,
the buyers of the clubs are going to
[SPEAKER_04]: remember the weakest ones, this is going
to be sitting there, and they're not going
[SPEAKER_04]: to reorder until that's gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was something that you have to
remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: You made a lot of products.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's not moving, move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the final thing, which this is the
side effects of my job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one other thing we wanted to talk
about is when it comes to branding,
[SPEAKER_04]: you have to know who you are better than
anyone else out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need an elevator pitch.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've heard that with TV and everything,
but you really do need to be able to,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you have someone in an elevator,
tell them what your brand is right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a phrase, have a one-liner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we are a California lifestyle brand
in Canada that determines women.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is our brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also for the generation that cannot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have kind of a younger audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're able to tell people exactly
what we are, we know who we are,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that makes it easier when we work with
anybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, we have a distribution
company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alex, if you're here, we love you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, all right, they're the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be biased.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the only other thing that I was
going to bring up, I can't remember what
[SPEAKER_01]: the other thing was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we were going to say that if you
have Kiana in your name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, but there's people in here that
do stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you're Tracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're Tracy.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to have a commercial brand
that really makes it, think about what's
[SPEAKER_04]: going to work that treat or joke.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have beer, you don't call it
beer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have a cannabis product,
don't call it Kiana something.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can right now, but in a few years,
it's going to not be a brand that maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: stands out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You reminded me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, before I forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, think about how you, if you're
starting a business, and I know this
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't speak to everyone, because not
everyone's doing kind of what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But think about where you're trying to
head in the next year, two years,
[SPEAKER_01]: three years down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you trying to create a boutique type
edible, where you're going to make
[SPEAKER_01]: something fresh every day, and you're
going to deliver it to the local
[SPEAKER_01]: collectives, and you're just going to
build a local presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: An example would be like Pete's Treats,
which is actually up north.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if any of you know who
that is, but they heavily blanketed the
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa Cruz area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't go anywhere without anybody
knowing about Pete's Treats, and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: able to do that because they can service
that small area.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're trying to service the whole
state, think shelf life, and think,
[SPEAKER_01]: will it melt?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the Central Valley where it's 100
degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank goodness we don't do chocolate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would not be successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but think about all these things,
because you'll think you have this great
[SPEAKER_01]: idea, but if you don't walk it through the
whole way from sourcing what you need,
[SPEAKER_01]: and looking at food prices all the way
through the distribution channels to the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said earlier, how is it going to
be packaged?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to melt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can it get squished?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have to be chilled the whole time?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to build an empire,
you have to make sure you can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: service all over the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all waiting for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the last thing is we want everyone
to have fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to approach every day because it
is always changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Tracy said, you have to come in with
a smile.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be passionate about what you
do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to come out to events like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys already made that amazing first
step.
[SPEAKER_04]: Round of applause for all of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you guys decide to use a strain or
flour or concentrate to make your edibles,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you research that to know that
you're getting the toughest quality that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I do this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you grow your own?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we don't grow our own.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely source it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, we actually don't focus so
much, and some people in the room are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to bloody disagree with this,
but we don't focus so much on whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a sativa or an indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly because when we process it and
apply it to like the chips or anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: we lose the turbines and so you're kind of
losing a lot of what determines it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually just work with a hybrid for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way we actually deal with the indica
sativa thing is we have a line of
[SPEAKER_01]: tinctures, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure most of you are familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a liquid form of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've developed a sleeve tincture,
which is called Dripped Away.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do instead is we focus on what we
combine it with.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one was actually developed for my
mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was on prescription sleeve pills for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: My little sister's in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: She can attest to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's scary when someone's taken sleeve
pills.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are incoherent sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we did is we worked with an herbalist
and we combined it with chamomile,
[SPEAKER_01]: lavender, melatonin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we actually used to market to
get the effects of what some people would
[SPEAKER_01]: want indica for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing for our lifted tincture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We market that as more of a daytime one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of the people on the shelf all
say sativa tincture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ours doesn't, but what we do instead is we
add natural cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We work with an herbalist to enhance the
THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did a line of edibles early on.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did it based on what I was using for my
medication.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really a low dose edible.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was interesting was when we went to
dispensaries, a lot of them were like,
[SPEAKER_06]: they'll never sell this because it's not
strong enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: We kind of stuck to our game and went and
said, oh, you've got to make it stronger,
[SPEAKER_06]: make it stronger, but we just felt that
not everybody wants to get whacked out.
[SPEAKER_06]: We left it like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We went to a conference about a year ago
to a bunch of attorneys.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were talking about edibles.
[SPEAKER_06]: They came with an attorney for Dixie
elixir.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were talking about microdosing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I was wondering if you were going to
say that word.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so funny that it's come around to
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So many people don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: These won't take the edge off.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how do you address that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually interesting because our
chips are considered low in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're only 50 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: So compared to sometimes you see like a
thousand milligrams at a bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually also goes back to like a lot
of the people we target are not looking to
[SPEAKER_01]: just pass out all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we consider a lot of our products
microdosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of our teachers are labeled on the
milliliter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can know exactly how much you're
getting per milliliter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do go on the low end, but we've
actually found that the clubs love the
[SPEAKER_01]: microdosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buds and Roses, which we're in now,
raves about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're seeing a lot of
professionals, women, elderly,
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are entering the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people, I'm sure most of you
or some of you have had the experience
[SPEAKER_01]: where you'll never have an edible again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, uh-huh, I did that
one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: My sister made brownies one time and I was
like, I'll never do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is, it's a dosage thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can eat a bag of chips and I'm
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't today, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious to know what dose were you
doing for years?
[SPEAKER_06]: What most people would call the light
weight.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for me to take the edge off five
milligrams and then I can kind of dose
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that you have hit the market at
the right time right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every collective we've gone into recently,
and I think Calix, our distribution
[SPEAKER_04]: company can probably tell you the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've told us that they're able to sell
our products better because they are
[SPEAKER_04]: microdosed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and they're clearly labeled.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not necessarily, you can have a
thousand milligrams in your package,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you need to let people know that there
are a hundred doses in there, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So as long as it's marked and they're able
to, you know, you can't have a square of
[SPEAKER_04]: chocolate that has five hundred milligrams
since they just nibble on the corner.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they're realistically
going to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll eat the whole thing, but so you need
to be able to have it in a form like our
[SPEAKER_04]: tinctures.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just easily take five milligrams
for a tincture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in our, in our package shows you how to
do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, and that's, and that's how
Colorado is doing it too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what we look at Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you explore independent sales teams
before the distribution company or what
[SPEAKER_07]: was the process behind hiring a
distribution company?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're really hands on to the point
where we don't think anyone can do it as
[SPEAKER_01]: we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was really hard, but we looked at
sales teams and actually Calix now is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to become like the pitch for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do sales and distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's such a beautiful pairing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come, they pick it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get to focus on what we do best,
which I highly recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only focus on the product and making it
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we let other people handle the sales,
the distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that doesn't say, you know,
we're backing them up on stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still do a lot of promotions and
certain things like that to supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would definitely find a good partner
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's doing what they do best because we
ran the numbers on doing our own sales
[SPEAKER_01]: team and distribution and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it honestly didn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not going to be able to have
2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to go through a
distributor because it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: required.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can cross check and they can test
your product before it gets on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's also a good thing to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't invest in a sales team right
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I kind of touched on earlier because
our process is that too, but it's also
[SPEAKER_01]: heated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're working with, along with other
companies who are researching,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually extracting the intrepids before
and then adding them back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now that hasn't been,
yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that right now is, unfortunately not
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, I have a question about distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: I work for a distribution company and I
find that a lot of people are really
[SPEAKER_03]: scared of me when I talk to them about
what I do or hesitant to get involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you as a vendor, how do you,
how did you reconcile that with yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: So who's scared?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying talking to vendors and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: The distribution company probably doesn't
like me that much because I'm on the phone
[SPEAKER_04]: with them all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But build a relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be able to build a
relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just like here, let me tell you
a quick story.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that goes to this, we went to a women
grow event and we met a woman who owns
[SPEAKER_04]: three very high profile collectives up
north.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we watched every single one walk up to
her and go, you have to carry our
[SPEAKER_04]: products, you have to carry our products.
[SPEAKER_04]: We walked up and we said, hi, how are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to have a drink?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we did that for a full year and we
just got into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we had some good times.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we had fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's about building relationships in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't just walk in with your pitch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that goes to a lot of things,
but truly in this business, everyone
[SPEAKER_04]: thinks they're an expert on cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Your next door neighbor, your cousin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so, and they may be,
but you need to walk in and have
[SPEAKER_04]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, rather than, and we just
talked about this, we get a lot of emails
[SPEAKER_04]: from a lot of distribution companies and a
lot of other vendors in their own right.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they started off with a pitch,
it goes to the trash man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we really truly don't have time to
take pitches.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it starts off and it says,
Hey, I read about you in the economist
[SPEAKER_04]: this month, or I saw you in high times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And wow, that was so great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all you have to do is do a quick
Google search, find out what they just
[SPEAKER_04]: spent and find out a little bit about
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us an introductory line or two,
and then say, Hey, I'd love to take five
[SPEAKER_04]: minutes of your time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Will you be at Women Grow LA this time?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rather than saying, Hey, can I schedule a
call with you?
[SPEAKER_04]: We really don't have time for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We honestly work around the clock.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in order to do that, meet us at Women
Grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I asked that question, I actually
forgot about the stack, but I definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: emailed you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take you out of my trash folder.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll reread it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm wondering how you advertise and
market.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you're marketing, but how do you do
that given the constrictions of this whole
[SPEAKER_08]: industry?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also like, are you finding that
you're kind of limited by using things
[SPEAKER_08]: like eMaps and you know, there's only
minimal access for people.
[SPEAKER_04]: My answer is easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's get creative.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't look at the restrictions.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been in boards, the economists,
we've been in all of the major players.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been on all sorts of media stations
because we don't view ourselves as a
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_04]: We view ourselves as a company.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we're all trying to do
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to just be normal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we sponsor things.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, we're sponsoring the Women
Grow Retreat in Lake Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many of you guys are going next month?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no one's going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys need to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That event will get you business.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're looking for vendors,
go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we basically, I write news releases,
and I don't send them to eMaps and Leafy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I send them to Fox News and CNN and MSNBC.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's how we've been successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: We send stuff to Forbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We send stuff to the economists.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they start writing about you and
the other people pick up.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do advertise in industry magazines,
which has been great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if Barley from MG Magazine is
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was one of the first people that we
advertised with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he really opened the door and
introduced us to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we get creative.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, yeah, because we
originally started going to the shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did like M-Fawn and Chalice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we realized, why are we here?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nobody that we're targeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few, but not that many.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes down to advertising,
you've got to, like she said, be creative,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's your social media or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we really realized was the
smartest thing, sorry, the smartest thing
[SPEAKER_01]: to do was to actually invest into the
people behind the counter and the
[SPEAKER_01]: collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's how many times you walk in
and you're like, I don't know what I want,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, this is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I don't take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we do is we create it,
and I'm going to call them Bud Dinner
[SPEAKER_01]: Buckets, because that's what they're
called.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we get into a new collective,
we give all of their Bud Tenders samples
[SPEAKER_01]: of our products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We come in, we'll buy them lunch,
we entertain them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when people love you, they want to
help you for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we realized that investing into the
people who are actually going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to your customer was really,
really smart.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least they think so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, is there an average industry markup
right now between your price and the price
[SPEAKER_06]: of dispensaries and chargers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it seems like they always double it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were told that you're supposed to do
2.3% markup if you're a collective,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm thinking that's by a city.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically anything that you sell for and
will sell, they double the price.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have some control depending on per
se what the product is, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really specialty, is celebrity selling it,
that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And milligrams really controls the price.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whenever you're making something,
just remember that people tend to look at
[SPEAKER_01]: the average industry right now is about a
dollar every 10 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, our chips go for $5
typically, which is actually a great price
[SPEAKER_01]: point, because it's kind of like a grab
and go thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that does play into whether or not like
what you can create.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, we've got a friend that
does dark chocolate and it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she has a very hard time doing the
micro dosing just because her price point
[SPEAKER_01]: is already so high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: How did you guys capitalize on this?
[SPEAKER_07]: How did you capitalize on this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Where'd you get your money?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Friends and family.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's typically the best way to go right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have two questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: The labs you test your shape or your
flowers from, where is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: And how much did your certified kitchen
cost you to put that in?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have multiple labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't work with just one because they
tend to have varying results.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually something that's been
difficult in our industry with edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Americans for Safe Access, I think,
recently did a lot of research on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And found that a lot of the machines that
they use for testing was never really made
[SPEAKER_01]: to be tested with like cooking matter or
potato chip matter in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it definitely skews the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously we test all of our base
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use SC labs, SD farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've used, I'm not thinking of the one up
north.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steve Hill, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we tend to work with multiple and we
cross check them because it just seems
[SPEAKER_01]: like the best thing to do right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your certified kitchen, how much did it
cost you to put that in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, certified kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the actual space came empty,
so that was cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: But putting it all in, you could spend
anywhere from 80 to $200,000 building up,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depends on your machinery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depends on what you need and how automated
you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We almost bought a chip bagging machine
for a quarter million dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank God we didn't do that because it was
really not that great when we saw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, really people catch things a lot
more than automation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were like, yeah, we'll just get this
machine and we'll just let it run all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still took just as many people to run
the machine as it did to do something that
[SPEAKER_01]: was more rudimentary for packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't get sold by salespeople on their
shiny machinery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very tempting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like super excited because you're
putting out like thousands and thousands
[SPEAKER_01]: of bags a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the actual facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've taken tours of manufacturing
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen it all run and now we know
exactly what pieces to get because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: costly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did buy one piece of machinery and it
doesn't work and it was very expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say also, we hired a former
FDA inspector to come through because they
[SPEAKER_04]: won't know current FDA inspectors going to
come through cannabis is going to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we hired somebody to come through,
set it all up for us and we paid him so
[SPEAKER_04]: that once we are able to run in a legal
manner or at least in a way that we're-
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same with manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hired people who worked at huge plants
to come through and say this is what you
[SPEAKER_04]: can't do and this is what you can't do
because we didn't want to wear a hair net.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing food and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the worst idea ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the best idea but it's like the worst
because you're dealing with the health
[SPEAKER_01]: department and food and all that and
you're trying to deal with the new like
[SPEAKER_01]: the compliance issues of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody in the ancillary business out
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're not supposed to do any more
of it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lawyers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do read everything they send us and
like Tracy said, it's constantly changing
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's scary when you're making decisions
about where you can get your permit or
[SPEAKER_01]: certain things because they can literally
pull the rug out in front of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know someone who I think might be in
the room but he got the license in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington and was totally ready to go and
then his county banned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically it's a lot of risk but it's
high risk, high reward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean just trying to stay on top of
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best thing you can do really is just
get good legal advice I would say and be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to have a lot of good lawyers if you
need some.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think her question was specifically
about the adult use initiative in
[SPEAKER_03]: November.
[SPEAKER_03]: How would that affect you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well by being one of the more compliant or
most compliant companies now in the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical, we're looking at what Colorado
did which is they only gave licenses to
[SPEAKER_01]: people who were doing recreational and had
that license or excuse me medical and had
[SPEAKER_01]: that license before they could get
recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main focus right now and if I
hopefully answered this right,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to get in the recreational
game make sure that you're around in 2018
[SPEAKER_01]: with the medicinal game because that's
who's gonna get their license first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, well let's give the two of them a
round of applause.
Thank you.
Thank you.
you you
