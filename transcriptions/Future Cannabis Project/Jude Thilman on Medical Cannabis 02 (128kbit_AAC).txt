[SPEAKER_00]: Recreation will find its own home and
medical has its own home and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: proper funding and infrastructure in place
to produce medical cannabis and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that are producing high-grade
products that are dosable and pure and
[SPEAKER_00]: repeatable and you know studies can be
done that the product can be delivered you
[SPEAKER_00]: know when it's proven successful you know
these are these are the steps that have to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen I agree Patrick but but I don't
think you can separate them well here's
[SPEAKER_00]: where it has to be is you know for example
right now the competition to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer's license is dominated by the
recreational market yeah right so how do
[SPEAKER_00]: how do how do people who want to make real
medicine who how do they get the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer's license when there's
already so much interest and so much money
[SPEAKER_00]: and so much value to those licenses well
this is what I think you can't separate
[SPEAKER_00]: them because we are what we do is we do in
the cities and counties that we work with
[SPEAKER_00]: we that's all that we do is we speak to
the city council and the county
[SPEAKER_00]: supervisors about separating them because
you have to understand the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between what would be a they don't
understand they don't know the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: they're they're they're falling for the
new stigma which is that they see all
[SPEAKER_00]: these people buying cannabis from a
dispensary under the under the guise of it
[SPEAKER_00]: being medical when they recognize it it's
clearly this is primarily a recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer and so there are our own culture
current culture is devaluing the
[SPEAKER_01]: credibility of the medical right this is
why in the arcade a conference which
[SPEAKER_01]: really gave a front-row seat to real
herbalists who've been doing this for ages
[SPEAKER_01]: and I said to them I don't know how we're
gonna operationalize that in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: policy or the economy of the market I I
have always argued politically speaking we
[SPEAKER_01]: got to keep them separate you're
absolutely right that's the tactic we have
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep them separate I know every
herbalist every true cannabis person worth
[SPEAKER_01]: their salt knows that it's all medical
it's all medical because people
[SPEAKER_01]: self-soothe and self-treat for all kinds
of reasons and it's not harmful to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: but if we if we if we make that if we try
to make that point that it's all medical
[SPEAKER_01]: don't do it then again we use them yes
it's too confusing you're right it's too
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing and we're playing with you know
it's a holistic lifestyle it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: between you and me in the microphone okay
my friend my friend who has had
[SPEAKER_00]: Parkinson's now for about ten years yeah
and has resisted cannabis for all ten
[SPEAKER_00]: years and I had it readily available for
him in the right forms and the right doses
[SPEAKER_00]: in the right methods of consumption and
everything in place but the state and he
[SPEAKER_00]: actually his mother produced cannabis
medicine when he was a child and when I
[SPEAKER_00]: first met him 40 years ago he used to have
this alcohol this black alcohol that he so
[SPEAKER_00]: that his mom has soaked the leaves in to
treat her arthritis and that point I was
[SPEAKER_00]: just becoming a cannabis grower and I kind
of thought that was BS it was a real
[SPEAKER_00]: remedy and it gave her everything that she
needed to treat her arthritis and to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a very normal life and so he saw that but
he was still afraid of it because he grew
[SPEAKER_00]: up with the other side being enforced you
know it's bad it's medicine is dangerous a
[SPEAKER_00]: dope you know it's also a Hispanic family
so I think he knew it was best to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: clear of it and so he did but most
recently he did finally decide that he
[SPEAKER_00]: would try CBD yes and I don't know that
and this was just like a week ago and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know that it has benefited him I
think he waited a lot longer than he
[SPEAKER_00]: should have for effective treatment and I
don't know if he's taking enough is he may
[SPEAKER_00]: need to so he'll tie trade up and see if
it if he keeps the keeps going who knows I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean people change their minds they they
try cannabis and it is or isn't for them
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes and that's okay but I couldn't
agree with you more though we have to as a
[SPEAKER_01]: political strategy we have to keep them
separate because otherwise we play right
[SPEAKER_00]: into everybody's prejudices yeah oh and
then what he said to me he says you know
[SPEAKER_00]: he says gosh you know now that I'm taking
the cannabis and he says now that I think
[SPEAKER_00]: about it everybody that he knows who he's
known throughout his life used cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: he's like they're all in better health
than the people who didn't use cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: gosh you know and I didn't even have to
you know okay yeah no it's absolutely true
[SPEAKER_00]: some truth to that you know I've seen that
I think maybe it lowers the stress level
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps the homeostasis yep or helps you
know create homeostasis yeah no I totally
[SPEAKER_00]: agree I totally agree it's it's but you
wind down with you know when you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: which we all do the difference between us
and like when they're they ended alcohol
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition was alcohol prohibition didn't
have decades and decades of disinformation
[SPEAKER_01]: campaign really you know we've got an
awful lot to overcome in terms of those
[SPEAKER_01]: embedded messages in people's minds yeah I
mean we all make jokes about what's the
[SPEAKER_01]: movie that you know for madness yeah I
mean we make jokes about that but that's
[SPEAKER_01]: only the extreme you know I've had
patients who actually believe that it is
[SPEAKER_01]: the devil's drug it's not a nerve it's a
drug that leads you directly to heroin and
[SPEAKER_01]: crack cocaine they believed it perfectly
so that stuff's not dead but I think
[SPEAKER_01]: what's far more pervasive is just this
fear just this fear because it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: embedded in us and that you know people
don't like the idea of losing control of
[SPEAKER_00]: their they think that they'll somehow come
unglued yeah but you come back together
[SPEAKER_01]: again right no it's true but I think
there's also the the disappointing you
[SPEAKER_01]: know it's every oppressed group racial
minorities women immigrants every
[SPEAKER_01]: oppressed people with disabilities every
oppressed group has a certain amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: internalized oppression and what we've
talked a lot about in the last four years
[SPEAKER_01]: in the activist cannabis community and
medicine okay is how much of those
[SPEAKER_01]: messages people have internalized and feel
bad about themselves and feel guilty and
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like they don't deserve to get the
honor and recognition that we think they
[SPEAKER_01]: really should have as members of a
cannabis community that produce the
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful medicine been beaten down for so
long they feel bad that's right a few of
[SPEAKER_00]: those yeah yeah so I am one of those
actually but I really try to you know
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke my way through yeah good for you
yeah where does it answer and light up
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly forget them you know focus on
what's important exactly so we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about social change after four decades of
probation that's not going to happen
[SPEAKER_01]: overnight this transition out of probation
is going to take years and years we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more young people on the planet and in
the United States and we have a very
[SPEAKER_00]: active social media they can they can move
information very quickly yeah and that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're they're already becoming
uncomfortable with the pharmaceuticals you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I know you know when we remember the
first time that I saw a pharmaceutical ad
[SPEAKER_00]: on TV and I haven't had a TV for 30 years
so I just catch moments you know sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be a year before or it's in a bar
or a restaurant but even restaurants
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't always have a TV in them no I
stopped watching TV so there were periods
[SPEAKER_00]: of years where I may not even have seen a
TV me too yeah all of a sudden I would see
[SPEAKER_00]: a TV commercial I would have a
pharmaceutical commercial suicide
[SPEAKER_00]: depression I'd usually be sitting with my
parents house yeah because that's where I
[SPEAKER_00]: would end up going to have dinner getting
stuck in front of a TV set and I couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: believe that they were watching this yeah
and not alarmed it was just I mean they
[SPEAKER_00]: click through those commercials just like
the other commercials that they remember
[SPEAKER_00]: to click through them but yeah and it's
just so the so the answer has always been
[SPEAKER_01]: and everybody says is education education
so I write an article where I try to take
[SPEAKER_01]: the science that we've learned a little
bit from the research studies the huge
[SPEAKER_01]: Oxford study about how THC reverses
amyloid plaques reverses Alzheimer's and
[SPEAKER_01]: dementia the sock study that from last
summer that substantiates the same thing
[SPEAKER_01]: and I said okay there's all these new
scientific studies that we didn't know
[SPEAKER_01]: about before I mean in 1860 Queen
Victoria's personal physician wrote in his
[SPEAKER_01]: diary using the hemp plant as they called
it back then for older people with
[SPEAKER_01]: softening of the brain as he put it has
every single time been a factor in
[SPEAKER_01]: reversing that softening of the brain it
works all the time so you know we're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting some modern statements of fact
about you know using people to treat so I
[SPEAKER_01]: was I wrote this article and it's in the
blog if you go to true farmer calm all my
[SPEAKER_01]: blogs are there it's like what if we
started earlier because all of the studies
[SPEAKER_01]: are being done with people who already
show signs of dementia what if we started
[SPEAKER_01]: micro dosing THC at age 50 and just did it
every day routinely don't you think we
[SPEAKER_01]: might prevent so this is I think where we
can start to bridge that gap you know and
[SPEAKER_01]: and and what that means is well on the
industry side what it means is we got to
[SPEAKER_01]: come to terms with micro dosing THC and
not using it as a get high herb and on the
[SPEAKER_01]: the medical practitioner side and the
patient side we've got to start looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: herbal medicine as a real choice for
people to be I want to tell you something
[SPEAKER_01]: about what I'm doing and I don't want you
to type this up on your computer so he
[SPEAKER_01]: takes his hands off the keyboard turn
sideways to be as a director of the clinic
[SPEAKER_01]: and Castro mission clinic in San Francisco
and I said I use CBD for my arthritis and
[SPEAKER_01]: he goes I think it should be in the water
you know so that change is happening but
[SPEAKER_00]: are they referring to THC and CBD for
reducing tumors or for reducing the
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms of chemotherapy they were talking
generally about using cannabis I mean some
[SPEAKER_01]: of them are doctors up my cat by cancer
patients who tell them they're gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: using THC oil to try to treat those
cannabis those tumors I had a 26 year old
[SPEAKER_01]: glioblastoma patient she had a fourth
stage she had this huge glioblastoma they
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway I could tell you so many stories
and we could go on and on and on but these
[SPEAKER_01]: are doctors who are recognizing the
effects why do we think we have this to
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce tumor and kill cancer reduce tumors
and kill cancer absolutely and and heal
[SPEAKER_01]: other disease I mean this this CME
conference I went to in Columbus Ohio a
[SPEAKER_01]: month ago this is all doctors and nurses
who are getting continuing medical
[SPEAKER_01]: education credits to learn about cannabis
as medicine wow is that a step forward or
[SPEAKER_01]: what I was sitting around a big table of
doctors and nurses who are asking me to
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of help help them understand what the
Ethan Rousseau's and the Dustin Sulox and
[SPEAKER_01]: all they were like big pretty high-end
stuff and and talking about how that has
[SPEAKER_01]: worked with my patients in practical
application and they're they're just like
[SPEAKER_01]: furious they're just furious that they
were not told a bit of this in nursing
[SPEAKER_01]: school or medical school yeah it's a sin
and a crime yeah it is so I don't know two
[SPEAKER_01]: steps forward three steps back I don't
know so Patrick we'll just keep doing what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing huh that's right that's
exactly right and doing the education I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: really passionate about the education you
you you you you you you
