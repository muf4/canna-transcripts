[SPEAKER_06]: Since we're talking about legalization,
and before I introduce the panel members,
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to say that I think we want to
have a working definition of legalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I talk about legalization,
and I'll ask the panelists to stick with
[SPEAKER_06]: me on this, I'm talking about the ability
of a human being in the state of
[SPEAKER_06]: California to use cannabis without any
fear of arrest or prosecution by the
[SPEAKER_06]: government.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm talking about about
legalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the second part of legalization,
which is a lot of what everyone's talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about and is here today, is how does that
look like in terms of creating the product
[SPEAKER_06]: and distributing the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when we talk about legalization,
we're fundamentally talking about no one
[SPEAKER_06]: should be arrested and prosecuted for
using this substance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Someone like Bruce Margolin has been
dedicated 40-some-odd years to defending
[SPEAKER_06]: people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the attorneys like myself and Bruce
are adamant that this has to end.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what legalization is,
and that's what we mean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, now, to my left, Dale Geringer has
been fighting that fight for 40 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fiona Maas joined this fight in the last
year or so and is on the Board of
[SPEAKER_06]: Equalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dale's at CalNormal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fiona's on the Board of Equalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's elected by 9.5 million people in
District 2, which goes from Santa Barbara,
[SPEAKER_06]: cuts the state in the middle, and goes all
the way up to the Oregon border.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she has been an outspoken advocate for
the state to get their SHIT together and
[SPEAKER_06]: make this work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm on film, I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeff Raber is a PhD, put together an
incredible business called Workshop,
[SPEAKER_06]: and law enforcement was very excited about
his business, too, and arrested and raided
[SPEAKER_06]: it a few months ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it was arrested,
but you might have been arrested.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so we're still here, you know,
it's like the end, you know, someone,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was Ken Cooley, was talking
about the end of World War II.
[SPEAKER_06]: The end of wars are nasty times,
you know, end of World War II,
[SPEAKER_06]: Japanese kamikaze pilots, the Germans at
the Battle of the Bulge.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they go in and they wreak havoc
because they're losing and they're
[SPEAKER_06]: vindictive.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to see more arrests,
more prosecution by state authorities over
[SPEAKER_06]: the next two years until this thing,
three years until this gets sorted out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So be careful out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, Jeff really learned
that the hard way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amanda Ryman is now the Marijuana Policy
Project Director.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your title now?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: She is running the Marijuana Policy
Alliance.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Marijuana Lawn Policy Project for the
Drug Policy Alliance.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Amanda has been an incredible ally on
the reform side.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we have industry folks here,
we have politicians, we have reform folks,
[SPEAKER_06]: and the reform of this whole cannabis
problem, it can't happen without
[SPEAKER_06]: activists, okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's how we present ourselves when
we're doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And finally, William Waldrop, another
member of the industry who has a company
[SPEAKER_06]: that's become very prominent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all of these panelists deserve a round
of applause, as all the audience does,
[SPEAKER_06]: for being there and stepping up and
fighting this fight.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to turn first and to Theodore.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to turn to Fiona and ask you,
Fiona, how do you think you can influence
[SPEAKER_06]: how the banking and tax issues that Tony
was talking about and that everyone in
[SPEAKER_06]: this room is struggling with, how can you
help influence and make this thing work
[SPEAKER_06]: for the state of California?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Matt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt and I met many years ago when I was
on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as Terrence Allen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were really talking about the
nightlife coalition, how to make San
[SPEAKER_04]: Francisco a little bit more hip and not
have, you know, the bars closed at 1 o
[SPEAKER_04]: 'clock and everybody out on the street,
you know, creating that situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, 10 plus years later
now we're working again on this issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to thank you for your advocacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sitting on the San Francisco Board of
Supervisors from 2002 to 2006,
[SPEAKER_04]: in San Francisco, like, we didn't really
talk about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it was more about how can patients
access it better.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we, you know, ensure that,
you know, that everybody, whoever needs
[SPEAKER_04]: it, can access it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then when I got elected to the Board of
Equalization in November, all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_04]: I represent the Emerald Triangle along
with Assemblymember Jim Wood.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Luke Brunner found me at Senator
McGuire's town hall and said, hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms. Ma, you know, you represent us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd like to come in and talk to you about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, okay, fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they came in, Matt and Terrence and
Luke, and they can talk to me about many
[SPEAKER_04]: of the issues that are facing this
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was honestly quite shocked.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not know all of these kind of
issues, you know, the raids and the
[SPEAKER_04]: banking and the transportation and just,
you know, tracking and all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we started, my office and I started
on kind of an eight month cannabis 101
[SPEAKER_04]: learning, listening tour just for
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to introduce my staff
who's been here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We go on every tour.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just got back from 12 meetings in 48
hours in Colorado yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I want to introduce Seth Dalton.
[SPEAKER_04]: He handles my agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as Tony said, this is agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Seth is the expert.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Tim Moreland.
[SPEAKER_04]: He handles my legislation in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Genevieve Japonda is based out of
my San Francisco office.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's my district director and handles all
my outreach.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so again, the one thing that I think
that impacts everyone in this industry is
[SPEAKER_04]: the lack of access to banks or credit
unions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't even imagine like every day,
every week having to go around and get
[SPEAKER_04]: cashier's checks to pay for employee
taxes, to have to go pay all of your bills
[SPEAKER_04]: one by one, you know, in cash or
utilities, your rents, your, I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: it is just maddening to me in that,
you know, cannot use an electronic
[SPEAKER_04]: transfer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot use a check.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet the IRS and the Franchise Tax Board,
they say no cash allowed, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So how are you supposed to pay your taxes?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we also found out at the Board of
Equalization that we used to have a no
[SPEAKER_04]: cash policy as well until we, you know,
are authorized to collect sales tax.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you collect sales tax from an
industry who cannot have a bank account?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this really started me on my kind
of passion to figure out how we can bank
[SPEAKER_04]: this industry because it is just maddening
that there is so much cash out there and
[SPEAKER_04]: the fact that you all can't access banking
just like normal Americans is really kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of un-American to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've been working on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously we've been pushing the federal
government.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there is a bill right now,
HR 2076, many of the legislators have
[SPEAKER_04]: signed on, but it's kind of stuck as we
all know.
[SPEAKER_04]: The federal government I don't think is
going to be dealing with this issue this
[SPEAKER_04]: year or next year is kind of the
consensus.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the meantime, you know, the coal memo
and the FinCEN guidelines came out and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's difficult for banks to bank this
industry, but it's not impossible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we just got back from Colorado and
there are six banks that are out,
[SPEAKER_04]: so to speak, that said, hey, we do want to
bank this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're working with software providers to
provide better due diligence in hopes that
[SPEAKER_04]: the regulators are going to allow them to
continue to bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think California banks and credit
unions, the community banks and credit
[SPEAKER_04]: unions should be looking into these
technology platforms to do more banking
[SPEAKER_04]: and to take on, you know, this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have an opportunity, you know,
passing the three bills that we passed at
[SPEAKER_04]: the legislature, you know, to see what we
can do also to try to, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: allow banking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Senator Wood also has a bill,
AB 1549, 1589, 1549 that he just put over
[SPEAKER_04]: the desk the last night of session,
which is going to look to create a state
[SPEAKER_04]: chartered credit union within the State
Board of Equalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we figure the State Board of
Equalization has been collecting taxes,
[SPEAKER_04]: sales taxes legally for the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, states are exempt,
I guess, from the money laundering laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we've been doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't we, you know, increase our
capabilities at the state level,
[SPEAKER_04]: at least provide the basic merchant
banking, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Paying your taxes, electronic transfers,
you know, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, Senator Wood and I are going to be
working very, very hard over the next four
[SPEAKER_04]: months.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we are going to go into official
committee hearings when the legislature
[SPEAKER_04]: comes back in January.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are things that we are doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything we can do to help to,
you know, any ideas that you all have,
[SPEAKER_04]: please let us know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are open.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you know, it's a big market.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna be a big market.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we legalize, there's enough room for
everyone in this market.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need more ideas, not less, so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Fiona.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and I have never, and I've
never, haven't spent time with Assemblyman
[SPEAKER_06]: Wood, but I've never met a politician that
I like so much as Fiona.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, she has got balls.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Genevieve is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Seth, Tim, please, she's not kidding when
she says come to talk to them.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been really great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone on the panel have any kind of
follow-up or comments about banking or
[SPEAKER_06]: taxes that they want to make?
[SPEAKER_06]: That driving point, because I'll keep
moving this along.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dale.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got AB 266, 243, 643.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is going to happen in November of
2016?
[SPEAKER_06]: The language will drop in the next two
weeks, we're told.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sooner.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sooner.
[SPEAKER_06]: One from Reform, California.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another one from another group.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe one.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's gonna happen?
[SPEAKER_06]: Does this bill that we saw, is that gonna
become relevant in the future or is the
[SPEAKER_06]: legalization initiative going to wipe out
all the medical cannabis regulations?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your view of how this is gonna play
out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should look at AB 266 as a
starting point for the next year to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the machinery going and to get people in
the industry involved with the various
[SPEAKER_00]: state agencies that they need to get
involved with and the various state
[SPEAKER_00]: agencies in position where they can
actually deal with the businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, of course, any initiative is
going to take effect on November 9th,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what you'll see is another sort of
broader kind of framework for general
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis legalization proposed that will
sort of fit like a large glove over AB 266
[SPEAKER_00]: and allow AB 266 to evolve into something
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's gonna be a lot more legislation
and a lot of regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalization is a long-term project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at Prop 215, that's been 20 years and
we're still working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be 20 years and more that
we're working on these regulations for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anybody else on the panel wanna just
sort of follow up on Dale's comments or
[SPEAKER_06]: any thoughts you've had about how this is
gonna play out?
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep telling everyone that I think that
once the initiative passes, that this set
[SPEAKER_06]: of bills, regardless of all the work and
time and energy that went into it,
[SPEAKER_06]: is going to become largely irrelevant and
that the key language that I plan to
[SPEAKER_06]: advise my clients on is the initiative
language and that I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: transitioning them, getting ready for that
as opposed to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: CalNormal, however, would advise everybody
in the industry to look seriously now at
[SPEAKER_00]: complying with AB 266.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanna be a step ahead of everybody
else, because people who are compliant
[SPEAKER_00]: with AB 266 are definitely gonna be at the
head of the line as we move beyond 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've certainly been telling
everybody, every grower and everybody with
[SPEAKER_00]: a bakery or other product services been
underground to at least get a BOE resale
[SPEAKER_00]: permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though you aren't liable for taxes,
get the permit so that you get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be very important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fiona.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we also have an expert, Michelle Peele
sticker from the BOE who can also help
[SPEAKER_04]: with the sales tax issue or register
anyone here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like in Colorado, the medicinal
dispensary owners and the people who are
[SPEAKER_04]: in the market already actually got first
dibs into legalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also saw that the tax for medical
cannabis patients in Colorado is 7% versus
[SPEAKER_06]: the adult use, or I use the word adult use
rather than recreational, is 31%,
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're seeing a huge, and gets back to
Tony's point about market distortions,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're seeing a huge number of people
still getting doctor's recommendations,
[SPEAKER_06]: going into the retail brick and mortar
places where you can both go as a patient
[SPEAKER_06]: or as just a consumer, but you'll pay more
taxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that does create some distortions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jeff Raber, you're a brave man.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're encountering the last gasps of a
dying regime.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we should all applaud you for standing
up in front and taking it and moving
[SPEAKER_06]: forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really, really want to acknowledge
that for you and for everyone else who's
[SPEAKER_06]: encountered law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have to really watch my language in
public about this, but it's really a
[SPEAKER_06]: tragedy what we're still seeing out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not ending.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not ending.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as a lawyer, I can promise you,
and Bruce and the other lawyers in the
[SPEAKER_06]: room will tell you, it's not ending.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not going to end until we finally
drive the last nail on the coffin.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have a statute in California called
the Health and Safety Code Section
[SPEAKER_06]: 11379.6, which says that you cannot,
through any method, chemically extract
[SPEAKER_06]: from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my chemists who I contact with tell me
that everything you do that to cannabis is
[SPEAKER_06]: chemical extraction, whether it's smoking
it, putting it in water, extracting it,
[SPEAKER_06]: using CO2 extraction, using butane
extraction, and that fundamentally what
[SPEAKER_06]: the legislation was trying to do with that
extraction statute was to prohibit
[SPEAKER_06]: dangerous activities.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bill that was just passed has a
license six and a license seven for
[SPEAKER_06]: manufacturing, which is really extraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: License six is for a non-volatile solvent.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can a solvent be non-volatile?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have a volat- Well,
it depends on your definition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is the whole problem that we have
with all of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me get right there with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then a type seven, which is the only
license type that was specifically shows
[SPEAKER_06]: in the statute is they're going to have
limitations to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't quite understand why they did
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe the assemblymen who are here can
explain that to us.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the type seven will be for volatile
solvents, which are like butane,
[SPEAKER_06]: and those will be allowed but limited.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going to happen to the extraction
industry as we move towards legalization?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where do you see this all going?
[SPEAKER_05]: It will get much more sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_05]: But where it will actually go and what
we're allowed to do depends on the
[SPEAKER_05]: definitions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for 20 years, we've had no definition
of what you're allowed to do in
[SPEAKER_05]: California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's created all the problems that
you see.
[SPEAKER_05]: And certainly we're kind of caught up in
that machine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the next step will be what is that
important definition of volatile?
[SPEAKER_05]: So as you ask many different chemists,
different terms may mean different things
[SPEAKER_05]: to different perspectives.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you have lawmakers who are not
educated in chemistry trying to set
[SPEAKER_05]: definitions, I often see cannabinoid
defined improperly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even cannabis may be defined improperly.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the key fundamental piece of any
legislation or any law, which is those
[SPEAKER_05]: definitions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So definitions such as independent,
or what a distributor could or couldn't
[SPEAKER_05]: do, what volatile means or doesn't mean,
or what really are going to be important
[SPEAKER_05]: pieces of the regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that will define who's doing which
part or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: So water, is that going to be volatile or
not volatile?
[SPEAKER_05]: Alcohol, alcohol is definitely volatile.
[SPEAKER_05]: So which types?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it set by boiling point?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a long definition of every type of
chemical?
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know what those things are yet
today, but that will definitely define
[SPEAKER_05]: who's allowed to do what.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think you will see a great deal of
scrutiny in terms of your methodologies,
[SPEAKER_05]: how your cleaning procedures are done,
your standard operating procedures,
[SPEAKER_05]: your building codes, your equipment being
certified by engineering stamps,
[SPEAKER_05]: and everything that a processor is going
to do is be highly, highly scrutinized in
[SPEAKER_05]: terms of safety, cleanliness, and
operating procedures.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it will move much towards GMP
production, good manufacturing practice,
[SPEAKER_05]: and most definitely will not be allowed to
be done in your backyard anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: My clients in Colorado have learned over
the years that they have to spend a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: money on lobbyists and people who can work
with the legislature and regulators.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you met with any of the legislators
or do you have a plan going forward to get
[SPEAKER_06]: involved in the regulatory rulemaking
process that, if the governor signs this
[SPEAKER_06]: bill, will then ensue?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully when he signs it, yes,
we will be involved.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done that in five different states so
far to help state regulators really
[SPEAKER_05]: understand their definitions, understand
what testing means, what manufacturing
[SPEAKER_05]: means, how this plant could be handled,
and I'm certainly very anxious to get
[SPEAKER_05]: involved in California to the greatest
possible extent that I can.
[SPEAKER_06]: William Waldrop also has a company that
does a lot of work in the cannabis sector.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you talk a little bit about where you
see issues such as product testing,
[SPEAKER_06]: consumer confidence, and even product
liability for product failure going
[SPEAKER_06]: forward in a legalization regime?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, doing some research, a number came
out in research, $11.4 billion,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that number is not the state or the
size of the California medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: market, even though no one knows what that
number is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually the five largest
pharmaceutical lawsuits for product
[SPEAKER_02]: liability.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that's just a staggering number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think about a guy that could
devastate an industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: And starting to read through the proposed
language for AB 266 and looking at how
[SPEAKER_02]: testing has now become an independent
body, there's been a lot of companies in
[SPEAKER_02]: the city of California today that do
internal testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have full labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do a great job on putting out great
product, but from a consumer's
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective, they want that independent.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want that third party to come in and
confirm that that product is satisfactory.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know what the potencies are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know that if it's an edible or an
extract, there's no residual solvents,
[SPEAKER_02]: or they know what the limits are and it's
below acceptable standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as the industry continues to mature and
kind of give you a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: background with what my company is,
we assist companies in multiple states
[SPEAKER_02]: through the legalization process,
as Matt said.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I, as a business owner,
stay legal?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I not get arrested?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I manage my cash?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I handle the complete vertical?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have clients in Maryland,
Oregon, have a now client in Hawaii,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is going to be a great place to go
visit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that client.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to go visit them a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to let the lawyers
assist them, according to the 18-person
[SPEAKER_06]: State Bar Committee that just issued an
opinion the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just can't form their company.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as it relates to testing going
forward, I mean, there's some conflicting
[SPEAKER_02]: language in AB 266, whether or not it's to
be, you know, can the cultivators or the
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturers go direct or does it have to
be managed by the distributor?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think as the assemblyman said,
you know, some of that cleanup language is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to come through.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, where is that process going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is it going to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have to look at it from an industry
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to look at it from a consumer
safety side, specifically with the
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational, hopefully right on the
corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the recreational market is going
to be looking at is this product safe?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we don't want a repeat of what
happened in Colorado end of last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I heard of the live well
scenario where, you know, some supposedly
[SPEAKER_02]: non-infused product was given away at a
trade show or at a local event.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and a number of people got sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they thought they were eating,
you know, non-infused candies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from a liability side, you know,
we're just starting to see some
[SPEAKER_02]: precedence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a business owner, the biggest
concern is, you know, we've acknowledged
[SPEAKER_02]: or the federal government has acknowledged
in the bankruptcy courts, you can't
[SPEAKER_02]: declare bankruptcy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens if you get sued?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, number one, you need to have great
insurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, you need to ensure that you're
doing everything you can do to communicate
[SPEAKER_02]: to your customer of, you know,
product issues, product liability issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not an attorney, so but basically,
we have enough in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the aspect would be is, you know,
making sure that you're communicating
[SPEAKER_02]: everything you need to do from a labeling
side, from a product side to your
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers so that you're protected.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a correction, I've actually put
clients in bankruptcy in this sector.
[SPEAKER_06]: So at least out in the Ninth Circuit,
we've done that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That may be different in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw opinion out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone have any comment on Will's
statements?
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just like to say whenever there's
a bad actor or a bad situation and there's
[SPEAKER_04]: media, that's when legislators get all
worked up because then we feel like we
[SPEAKER_04]: have to go fix it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I agree with you, like to the extent
that, you know, you're labeling,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're warning, you're policing yourself
to make sure that consumers aren't taking
[SPEAKER_04]: too much product.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I like the rookie cookie in
Colorado where they're actually educating
[SPEAKER_04]: folks firsthand, like if you don't know,
you're not ready, don't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those are kind of the things that will
keep, you know, the legislators and
[SPEAKER_04]: government out of this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would echo the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, all of regulations are really
about building a good label for consumer
[SPEAKER_05]: protection and information.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all the testing that's required is to
protect the consumers as well as
[SPEAKER_05]: understand your operational effectiveness
and efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not something that I should have
to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's something I want to do for my brand,
for my business, for all of those people
[SPEAKER_05]: that are going to be impacted by the
products and it's really a great sign of
[SPEAKER_05]: responsibility and something that everyone
should embrace and want to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a testing lab for five years,
no one wanted to do it because they
[SPEAKER_05]: thought they were going to be charging
themselves, you know, an extra cost.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it really is a good investment in your
business and it's a responsibility
[SPEAKER_05]: position that says, I care about those who
are going to be impacted by the products
[SPEAKER_05]: they're consuming.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's pretty clear based on
everything we've heard today so far that
[SPEAKER_06]: there will be people who will be able to
make the transition and people who won't.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, one of the statistics I like to
use is in 1902 there were 207 car
[SPEAKER_06]: companies in the United States.
[SPEAKER_06]: Eight years later, in 1910, there were
three.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think everyone is going to have to
learn a whole other level of
[SPEAKER_06]: professionalism and approaching this if
they're going to survive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Amanda, last but not least, and for sure
not last but not least, because Amanda
[SPEAKER_06]: Ryman and the Drug Policy Alliance have
worked, you know, I always say that the
[SPEAKER_06]: drug reform group like Dale and Amanda and
Drug Policy Alliance and other groups
[SPEAKER_06]: brought the ball down to the 10-yard line
and that it's probably that the business
[SPEAKER_06]: sector is going to bring it over the goal
line because of the money, resources that
[SPEAKER_06]: bring the Republicans into the discussion.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they've just done a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Amanda's Drug Policy Alliance and her
energy in doing reform work and,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, Prop 47 that Drug Policy
Alliance did, I mean, I can't glow enough
[SPEAKER_06]: about the Drug Policy Alliance and about
what the work you guys have done.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, really on the ground, really
really important work.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we are, Amanda.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're probably about to legalize
marijuana, the very thing that you have
[SPEAKER_06]: been working for.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, and there's going to be a
lot of work to be done in the next year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we all know it's going to get nasty
and dirty out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no question about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're all rolling up my sleeves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, we know we've talked about
the plans of what things we're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going to happen to your work after
legalization?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where will be your focus?
[SPEAKER_06]: What will the reformers and the folks
concerned with social justice issues,
[SPEAKER_06]: what will you be doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Retiring in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was at the Cannabis Business,
the Cannabis World Congress last week,
[SPEAKER_01]: also down here in Los Angeles,
and really remarking about how things have
[SPEAKER_01]: changed in just a very, very short amount
of time in terms of who attends these
[SPEAKER_01]: things, the type of booths you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there was a time when you would
come to these events and the booths were
[SPEAKER_01]: all either how to grow pot without anyone
knowing, how to pass a drug test,
[SPEAKER_01]: or hemp clothing and pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that was the booths at these
events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's really changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to take a step back for a
minute because, you know, a lot of what we
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about on this panel has to do with
that second part of that two-part
[SPEAKER_01]: definition of legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we focus on that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, because as you said, you know,
maybe that's what's going to bring us over
[SPEAKER_01]: the goal line, right, is this idea of the
actual industry that this will create.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the money that comes along with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there was a lot of marijuana
selling and purchasing and consuming going
[SPEAKER_01]: on in this state long before we ever even
had the idea that it could become a licit
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as we move now to this idea of
legalization, we have to think about how
[SPEAKER_01]: our history of drug prohibition and the
war on drugs is going to negatively impact
[SPEAKER_01]: this industry for certain individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that it's not okay for that not to be
part of the discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That always has to be part of the
discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I wanted to do here with my brief
time is share some information with you to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of let you know why it's really
important to advocate for things like not
[SPEAKER_01]: barring people with criminal histories
from getting into the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: By advocating for policies that are to
expunge records, let people out of jail,
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that they're not barred from
getting jobs, that they're not barred from
[SPEAKER_01]: getting housing, that their children
aren't being taken away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these are very serious issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's face it, they don't affect
everybody equally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And looking around the room, they don't
affect too many of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to make this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: DPA and the ACLU, we did a study looking
at who's getting in trouble for
[SPEAKER_01]: infractions, marijuana infractions in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we know in 2011, January 1st,
possession of less than an ounce became an
[SPEAKER_01]: infraction in California, punishable by up
to $100 fine, similar to a parking ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before this happened though, we still saw
racial disparities in who was getting
[SPEAKER_01]: trouble for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when possession was a misdemeanor,
we saw 6.6% of the population in
[SPEAKER_01]: California is African American.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make up 17% of the folks getting
misdemeanors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's before we even went to an
infraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we go to an infraction and we're
like, oh, well now it's just a parking
[SPEAKER_01]: ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's see if what Los Angeles did
with their infractions the first year that
[SPEAKER_01]: they had infractions on the record.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Los Angeles, African Americans make
up about 10% of the population and they
[SPEAKER_01]: receive 25% of the marijuana citations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when we go to a town like mine of
Oakland, which believe me, I'm an
[SPEAKER_01]: evangelist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Oakland to death.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say nothing but good things about
them, except that in Oakland, sorry,
[SPEAKER_01]: African Americans make up 25% of our
population and 76% of people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: getting citations for marijuana
possession.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even when you look at a place that you
feel is extremely cannabis friendly,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got a lot of people that are getting
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're seeing this discrimination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does this mean for the industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of you think back to when you
were 18, 19 years old, how many of you
[SPEAKER_01]: were in the job that you were going to do
for the rest of your life when you were 18
[SPEAKER_01]: or 19 years old and you were like,
this is my career forever and I'm settled?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of us, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the point is that when you're that age,
you're still trying to figure out who you
[SPEAKER_01]: are and what you want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't even really know what you
want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the kicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at the average age that
people are getting in trouble for
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana in California, it is not the
same across racial categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: For whites, infractions tend to be given
to people 34 years old or older.
[SPEAKER_01]: For people of color, blacks and Latinos,
it's 19 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are creating this awesome
industry with all of this opportunity and
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to be cutting out people that
before they're even old enough to buy a
[SPEAKER_01]: drink have been labeled persona non grata
in the new legalization industry of
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana and that is not okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while we can get really excited about
the industry and while we can utilize the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that it is bringing tax revenue,
which can go to schools and can go to
[SPEAKER_01]: after school programs and can go to the
kind of services we need to bolster
[SPEAKER_01]: communities that have been targeted by the
war on drugs, we have to make a special
[SPEAKER_01]: attempt to ask ourselves, how is this
going to impact the people who have been
[SPEAKER_01]: most impacted?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we should start from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because honestly, at the end of the day,
it's that first definition we have to take
[SPEAKER_01]: care of before we can ride off into the
sunset and pay attention to the second
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone want to comment on these issues?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Dale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let me follow up on plans after
2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I'm going to retire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be 70 next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal was to legalize marijuana in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have accomplished that hopefully by
November 9th, 2016 and I can relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: But normal is going to stay around because
normal is the national organization for
[SPEAKER_00]: the reform of marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the United States will not
have legal marijuana after 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as it's illegal elsewhere in
the United States, there's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: this great big black market demand that's
going to continue to drive the pirate
[SPEAKER_00]: growers here in California who have been
such a problem for our environment and
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dale, that's a really great point you
raise.
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens when we vote for legalization
in 2016 to the rest of the country?
[SPEAKER_06]: California, they say, leads the nation.
[SPEAKER_06]: We talk about so many things.
[SPEAKER_06]: The environmental issues here start here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it going to matter?
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it matter that we legalize in terms
of the rest of the country?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it will matter to the politics of the
rest of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was in Mexico and, in fact,
they were saying down there, if California
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizes, Mexico's got to legalize
because they're bordering on us.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think, Amanda?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, I think that the implications
for California legalizing are way more
[SPEAKER_01]: international than national.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everyone in the country thinks
we're crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we pass legalization, I don't see
other states being like, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: if California does it, we want to be like
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think it does create momentum.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's more about having an
economy as large as ours, having
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization when other countries smaller
than ours want to legalize but aren't able
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the single treaty on narcotic
drugs, which is going to be discussed next
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think for the very first time,
the discussion's going to be, do we just
[SPEAKER_01]: take marijuana out of the list of drugs
that countries aren't allowed to legalize?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that happens, which I think
California legalizing will be a big
[SPEAKER_01]: impetus for that, you're going to see
Mexico, Belize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, lots of countries that have wanted
to do this but haven't just because we've
[SPEAKER_01]: said no.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're the seventh or eighth largest
economy, and that's what you're saying
[SPEAKER_06]: matters.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fiona?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to add my office passed
me a little note asking to explain the
[SPEAKER_04]: difference between the initiative process
versus the legislative process.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're talking about legislative
process.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to give a shout out to
Hessekaya Allen and Jamie Kerr,
[SPEAKER_04]: who have been, you know, roaming the halls
in Sacramento, educating the elected
[SPEAKER_04]: officials, and they've been doing a great
job, as well as Matt and California
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis Voice.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when we pass legislation at the state
level, legislators can change the
[SPEAKER_04]: legislation at the state level.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if, you know, 266, you know,
we passed it, they don't think it's
[SPEAKER_04]: working, they can go back and they can
change it internally within the body.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we go to an initiative process,
once we pass it by initiative,
[SPEAKER_04]: the only way we can change it is to go
back to the voters.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a big difference between what
happens in Sacramento and what happens
[SPEAKER_04]: statewide, and that's why I think Matt's
saying, you know, depending on what's in
[SPEAKER_04]: the initiative, the initiative trumps what
happens at the state level.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the legislature could actually pass
legalization.
[SPEAKER_06]: We wouldn't have to go to a voter
initiative, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that how that works?
[SPEAKER_06]: Assemblyman Wood, you ready to take that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you just, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just do that, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is important that everybody weighs
in.
[SPEAKER_04]: With your legislators, you know,
with the initiative writers, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: op-eds, whatever it can be, because I'm
just telling you, you know, coming from
[SPEAKER_04]: San Francisco, I did not realize all the
issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I don't realize the issues,
forget about, like, everybody else that's,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, in public service.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to encourage everyone to do
as much as you can to go and befriend,
[SPEAKER_04]: offer your card, go and meet, you know,
offer, you know, ask them to come on a
[SPEAKER_04]: tour, because it has made a huge,
huge difference to, like, me, and my team
[SPEAKER_04]: in how we view this whole industry and
what we need to do as public servants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me turn now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's now September 26, 2025, 10 years from
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've legalized marijuana in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: What does that look like out here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone can give me a little... You know,
I've been through this before,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years ago, when we did Prop 215,
and I remember when it was coming down,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I knew it was going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew it was going to win, but I knew
that I had no idea at all what it was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be like the next day,
and I really did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the dust is still settling from
that meteor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I think there's no way to
speculate at this point what it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be like, but let's do concentrate on
November 2016 and take it one step at a
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone...
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Del, for the advice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is anyone... I like speculating.
[SPEAKER_06]: Forecasting has been essential for my
practice of law for the last 15 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: My clients want to say, well, what's going
to happen next?
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it going to look like?
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone have a... Well, I mean,
I hope we have a much bigger, broader,
[SPEAKER_05]: solid base of knowledge about cannabis,
how it can impact different people,
[SPEAKER_05]: how you can guide them to the right
products, because we know more about the
[SPEAKER_05]: plant and what it offers, people's
physiology and interaction with the plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: and how we can create professionalized,
standardized, reproducible products for
[SPEAKER_05]: those specific ailments in that fashion.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that they might even teach... Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: They might even teach what the
endocannabinoid system is in medical
[SPEAKER_06]: schools, which they don't do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Amanda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would like to see cannabis
regulated like alcohol, and what I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: when I say that is that I would like it to
be just as easy for me to go out with my
[SPEAKER_01]: friends and consume cannabis out in the
world as it is for me to consume alcohol
[SPEAKER_01]: out in the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That may take 10 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, go ahead, Will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do agree with her, Amanda.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if we look at 10 years from now,
we want to see the tipping point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I know we talked about
international, but we still got to think
[SPEAKER_02]: national and down and focus on what does
normal need to do nationally to get all of
[SPEAKER_02]: these states.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things we've seen from our
perspective is as new codes are coming
[SPEAKER_02]: out, you know, Colorado, Washington laid
down the foundation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now with Oregon and Maryland and other
states, you know, there's a lot of best
[SPEAKER_02]: practicing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fiona just went to Colorado and looked at
banking.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on there?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I think we're going to see is once
California's regs are done, whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: ABT, ABT 266 is the final one,
or the recreational regs that come
[SPEAKER_02]: following and the procedures that are
behind that, is other states now have a
[SPEAKER_02]: blueprint in which they can just pass and
roll in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they can keep their government
costs at a lower point, and they can
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately roll out and start recognizing
that tax revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, from 2025, I mean,
we really want to see interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if we really look at, I mean,
I'm right now originally from Southern
[SPEAKER_02]: California living in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look at indoor grows in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're tremendously costly operations,
and they're inefficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to be relying on that California
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can be shipped interstate,
you know, from Sami and Mendocino,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Humboldt County, the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we got to get to the point where
we see interstate commerce where we can
[SPEAKER_02]: keep efficiencies abroad and keep this
business going strong.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fiona, you had something or you want to?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, it's taken 20 years for us
to regulate 215, and even then I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: know what's really going to happen,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's, you know, just a framework,
but there's no details, and the devils are
[SPEAKER_04]: in the details.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would just encourage, you know,
all of you who have been operating in this
[SPEAKER_04]: sphere for the last 20 years and doing
what you think has been the right thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kudos for the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have not been reinventing the
wheel.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been using, like, standards that
have been used by the federal government,
[SPEAKER_04]: the state, the international community.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would hope that our legislature does
not go back and try to reinvent all the
[SPEAKER_04]: standards for all of the different,
you know, industries that are in here,
[SPEAKER_04]: because you guys have been using
established standards, and it's been
[SPEAKER_04]: working.
[SPEAKER_06]: And everyone just needs to step forward
and not be afraid to come and talk to the
[SPEAKER_06]: legislators who are very interested in
hearing more about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think maybe we have time for one or two
questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone have anything?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Mickey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, could you stand up?
[SPEAKER_06]: Mickey Norris has been an advocate for
cannabis legalization for, I think,
[SPEAKER_06]: 40 years now?
[SPEAKER_06]: 88.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as a dear friend with her husband,
Chris Conrad, and Chris has been
[SPEAKER_06]: testifying around the state trying to keep
a lot of our friends and colleagues out of
[SPEAKER_06]: jail.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so a real round of applause actually
to you and your husband.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a celebration beginning,
despite the war that's still out there and
[SPEAKER_06]: the skirmishing and the islands that they
described earlier that the, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's so much that people like you did
and Dale and Bruce, I mean, this is a real
[SPEAKER_06]: celebration.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're getting, we're winning, we're
winning.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just taking time to finish it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, your question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, to me, legalization isn't complete
until cannabis consumers enjoy all our
[SPEAKER_03]: equal rights, the same as everybody else
in society, including our, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: rights to have our family, a right to
work,
[SPEAKER_03]: to receive the benefits of society that
everybody else does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to see some protections in
initiatives or legislation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see that coming down?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, with legalization will hopefully
come the end of stigmatization that has
[SPEAKER_03]: perpetuated a prohibition and all the
harms that are associated with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to me, it's still a matter of civil
rights and we're not done yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not done until we have our civil
rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: One big thing that happens when you
legalize is that the odor of cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: no longer a probable cause to suspect a
crime, which is a huge change from where
[SPEAKER_00]: we are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big change for civil
liberties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I suspect that there's going to be
some advances for civil liberties,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least for medical patients forthcoming
in 2016, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I also spent six years in the
legislature before I turned out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the difference between, again,
the legislative process and the initiative
[SPEAKER_04]: process, in the legislative process,
you have 120 members who are trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: work together to try to come to some
common, usually a majority vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you go to the initiative process,
you can write anything you want in the
[SPEAKER_04]: initiative.
[SPEAKER_04]: Initiative writers can put anything they
want.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not subject to attorney general
review.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not subject to the legislative
process review.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of the good and the bad,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The bad is that you want to change it,
you have to go back to the ballot.
[SPEAKER_04]: The good is anyone can put anything they
want, like every day will be Fiona Ma's
[SPEAKER_04]: birthday and I have to get gifts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the voters pass it, then that would
be the law of the land, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the truth of the matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we really need to work, all of you need
to work with the initiative writers to put
[SPEAKER_04]: in all the things that you think the state
should be doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just a note, you can actually put in
an initiative that certain sections of it
[SPEAKER_06]: can be modified by the legislature.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you actually do have a little bit of a
middle ground there, which we hope to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions before we thank the
panelists for being with us today?
[SPEAKER_06]: One more question.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, yes?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Loud, please.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just speak up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know when it gets passed.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're talking about the 2016 initiative.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once it gets passed, we're probably not
going to be using the word dispensaries
[SPEAKER_06]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's sort of a medical term.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say brick and mortar.
[SPEAKER_06]: When will the first brick and mortar state
license receive a license?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we already have other
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be about the middle of 2018
earliest.
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends what's in the initiative as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to see, normally in
initiatives like this, and even with 266,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a regulatory rulemaking process
that can take a year, year and a half,
[SPEAKER_06]: depending on how well things, how fast the
government can move.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then once that is finished,
they'll issue the applications,
[SPEAKER_06]: they'll start reviewing them, and then
they'll be issuing them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think Dale's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometime if you pass it November 2016,
you're probably looking at 2018 before the
[SPEAKER_06]: first license would issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so Colorado, when they legalized,
it took them over a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the legislation said that you had
to get a local permit before you could get
[SPEAKER_04]: a state license.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then everyone kind of sat around
going, well, who's going to go first?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so finally, the state had to push and
say, okay, fine, we're going to give you a
[SPEAKER_04]: license.
[SPEAKER_04]: Assume you're going to get a local
license.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that process took a year,
even for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be.
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plan on two years.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank the panelists.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that everyone can give a round of
applause for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
