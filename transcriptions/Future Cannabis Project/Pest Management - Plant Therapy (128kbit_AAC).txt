[SPEAKER_01]: We ended up coming into an existing space
that was being used for cut flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of pests were here when we arrived
and ideally you want to get to the point
[SPEAKER_01]: where sprays become pretty much
unnecessary and that can be done as a
[SPEAKER_01]: combination of a handful of different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: First in my mind being cleanliness,
keeping everything, keeping your
[SPEAKER_01]: environment clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of the first step to that and
the health of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strong, healthy plants with high BRICS
levels don't tend to attract pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nutrition has an effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are specific triggers that will send
out signals basically for pests,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like ringing a dinner bell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can actually draw them in based on
what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they are here pre-existing and trying
to get rid of them, spraying becomes one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the options that you can consider
depending on the level of the outbreak,
[SPEAKER_01]: the conditions that you're working in,
and the choice of things to spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the reasons that the industry is
going to be subject to such strict
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations is the absence of those
regulations has led to the use of a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: things that are not safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ornamental, and you're seeing a lot of
people, especially this last year with
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the lawsuits that have been going
around, a lot of that surrounding the use
[SPEAKER_01]: of things that are not registered for this
particular use.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not registered to be used on
anything that's going to be consumed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are ornamental only.
[SPEAKER_01]: The choice of things to spray that are
safe for considering where the plant's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be and the plant's going to end
up being consumed, adding flame to that
[SPEAKER_01]: even changes the game once again because
introducing some of the stuff that is used
[SPEAKER_01]: and considered organic for fruit and berry
and stuff like that production,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you burn it, it changes the
consistency of it to where it can become
[SPEAKER_01]: harmful to human health, I guess,
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can become toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the choice of things to spray,
everything from horticultural oils to just
[SPEAKER_01]: straight poisons, I tend to gravitate
towards the horticultural oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have, in addition to whatever kill
rate the substance itself might have,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a smothering effect as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of mites and things like that can be
easily smothered.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put any sort of oil or anything on
powdery mildew, you'll see the powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew falls apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tend to lean towards things that are
a little bit more based on horticultural
[SPEAKER_01]: oils than chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: One example would be Lost Coast Plant
Therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been using this one for a few months
now, and it's been working very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to use, it's effective,
and it's non-toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's completely safe to be in contact with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to get all dressed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is peppermint and soybean oil,
primarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peppermint oil, soybean, citric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest challenge with a lot of these
things and how effective they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be is determined by coverage, how
efficient you're able to distribute this
[SPEAKER_01]: across the plant material or over the
plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like backpack sprayers,
can be really inefficient for even
[SPEAKER_01]: coverage in an enclosed space like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideal in my mind is to be able to use a
fog.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the ways that you can do that or
one of the ways you can get close to doing
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's still a little bit more of a
kind of hobbyist or gardener level,
[SPEAKER_01]: not necessarily a commercial level
solution, is these atomizers, which of
[SPEAKER_01]: course you see at all the hydro stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit more effective, I feel,
except for the spray is all coming out in
[SPEAKER_01]: a direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things are spitting out a stream,
a jet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really stay suspended long
enough for the air to kind of move that
[SPEAKER_01]: around and fog everything out.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a fogger, the idea would be that
you're kind of gassing everything almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your coverage ends up being a lot more
even and lighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go through a lot less material as
well, not have to spray anywhere near as
[SPEAKER_01]: much in order for it to be effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, I'd like to be able to wait till
the end of the day and come in and shut
[SPEAKER_01]: everything down and gas the whole house
and then come in in the morning,
[SPEAKER_01]: open it up and be using something that's
soft enough that you don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: have an issue with people walking right
back into the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Horticultural oils are kind of a nice soft
choice for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, this is basically just shooting
out in one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how it's already getting dark
underneath it?
[SPEAKER_00]: See how it's all dropping to the ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, right there, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have that spot directly underneath
where you're spraying where the majority
[SPEAKER_01]: of the material just kind of fell to the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see while I'm doing that that
it comes out just a little bit finer than
[SPEAKER_01]: about a backpack sprayer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But underneath where you're spraying,
you're seeing this whole wet spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all that material is getting shot out
but then the majority of it is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: coming to the ground really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideal would be to have all of that stuff
stay suspended to where the circulation,
[SPEAKER_01]: the air circulation can push that around
and we end up with coverage in spots that
[SPEAKER_01]: you wouldn't be able to hit directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of coming in and trying to get
up underneath a plant and spray the
[SPEAKER_01]: underside of every leaf, which is for your
coverage, for efficiency of the product
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using is a factor meaning you would
make it a lot more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the coverage is kind of the efficiency
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to be able to take that and put it in a
little bit finer particle to where our air
[SPEAKER_01]: circulation would push that stuff around
in here and stay suspended in the air for
[SPEAKER_01]: a while means that you would have a lot
more thorough coverage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so I was going to ask, does that
imply that a fogger creates finer
[SPEAKER_02]: particles than an atomizer can?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my understanding of them,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a fogger is producing a finer
particle that's able to stay suspended
[SPEAKER_01]: longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who's fogger do we want to try out?
[SPEAKER_01]: DRAM is the one that we've been looking at
the most right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make two products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make a pulse fog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which comes in two versions.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them lends itself to organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one is a little bit easier to
use with chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the cold fogger, which is based
on pressure.
