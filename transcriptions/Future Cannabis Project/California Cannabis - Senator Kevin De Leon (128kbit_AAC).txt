[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to say good morning to each and
every one of you, to the incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: organizers, the activists, the advocates,
the community members, the retailers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the distributors, the manufacturers,
the cultivators, to each and every one of
[SPEAKER_00]: you for bringing this together at this
very, very amazing event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you were to ask me perhaps 10
years ago that I'd be keynoting an address
[SPEAKER_00]: at the cannabis, at a cannabis conference
on a haunted ship, I would have asked you
[SPEAKER_00]: to give me some of what you were smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I thought that our former Attorney
General of the great state of California
[SPEAKER_00]: would be here also too, Mr. Bill Lockyer
in the house right over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's give it up for the Attorney General,
Bill Lockyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great businessman himself also too,
who understands the incredible benefits of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry for the great state
of California in the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are at a very critical time,
a very critical moment in our nation's
[SPEAKER_00]: history, where our essential human and
constitutional rights are at stake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's time that we double down on what
we believe, that the cannabis industry in
[SPEAKER_00]: California carries the bright green
promise of good, high wage paying jobs,
[SPEAKER_00]: a boost to our state budget and growth for
our local labor organizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, as we all know, as we've known
for a very long time, the federal law puts
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis on the list of narcotics right
next to heroin as well as cocaine on
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which to me, and to I know everybody on
this ship right now, and everyone across
[SPEAKER_00]: the state of California thinks is utterly
ridiculous and absurd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Considering how many states today have
actually legalized cannabis, either for
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal or recreational use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that total today is 29 states across
the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, cannabis accounts for more
than half of drug arrests in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I just want you to let that sink in
just for a moment, because in 2016 alone,
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2016 alone, there were more than
600,000 people charged with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: violations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, growing up in Logan Heights for those
who are from San Diego or who live in San
[SPEAKER_00]: Diego, I watched the impacts of the United
States' failed war on drugs unfold before
[SPEAKER_00]: my very own eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Families torn apart and a promising
futures that were cut short, as law
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement disproportionately arrested
poor people and poor people of color.
[SPEAKER_00]: For cannabis crimes, my neighbors,
my friends, even some of my family
[SPEAKER_00]: members, our nation's Kafka-esque federal
laws against this plant were the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: of an extremely toxic relationship between
communities like mine and law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is time that we put an end to this
unjust practice by electing real leaders
[SPEAKER_00]: at the federal level who are focused on
descheduling cannabis, as we know it
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we do want a government that will
truly improve the human condition for all
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals, regardless of who they are,
regardless of where they come from,
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of the hue of their skin,
regardless of which God they pray to or
[SPEAKER_00]: who they love, or yes, even their legal
status.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want a federal government that truly
improves the human condition for all
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals, the rest of the nation,
as well as our senior senator from
[SPEAKER_00]: California, should join California in
pushing for racial justice and demanding
[SPEAKER_00]: reforms to our country's broken cannabis
laws system, as we know it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we had a senator who was going to be
here today, and we had a conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier this morning, Senator Steve
Bradford.
[SPEAKER_00]: I affectionately call him Stevie B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has a measure that is sitting on
the governor's desk, which is Senate Bill
[SPEAKER_00]: 1294, which deals with the issues of
equity with regards to making sure those
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals who are caught up by the
unjust laws and by the scheduling,
[SPEAKER_00]: scheduling one of cannabis have a real
opportunity to be entrepreneurs themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a real opportunity to be
successful in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for those who may not know,
I've always been a strong supporter of
[SPEAKER_00]: green energy, and that energy being clean,
renewable energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California today, the governor signed
my law, which puts us on a 100 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway to clean energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the year 2045, we're the largest
economy on planet Earth that has legally
[SPEAKER_00]: mandated 100 percent clean energy for the
great state of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are moving the state, the fifth largest
economy in the world, towards a green
[SPEAKER_00]: energy space where we'll have high wage
jobs, renewable clean energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not just about green energy in
the clean energy space, but it's about
[SPEAKER_00]: green energy too in a new renewable space,
which is cannabis, as we know it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The twin pillars of an economy are the
fifth largest economy in the world today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the largest subnational in the
world to legalize cannabis, both medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as recreational use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're the largest economy in the world
to commit to decarbonize the grid by 100
[SPEAKER_00]: percent legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are going to be the twin pillars if
you will, of our economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to make sure that we're
inclusive, but we also need to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: gets its act together.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, we demonstrate to the rest
of the world that cannabis can be
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized in a just, safe, and profitable
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know we have a lot more work to do,
starting with working together to
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilize and strengthen this growing
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in a state like California,
where the rest of the country receives 70
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of our exports.
[SPEAKER_00]: For starters, we need to make sure that
existing small cannabis businesses are
[SPEAKER_00]: able to grow and flourish in their own
rights to avoid a hostile takeover of this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry by extremely very powerful
corporations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We must focus on building solid banking
infrastructure so business owners aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: forced to risk their lives every single
day carrying thousands, hundreds of
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of dollars in cash just to pay
their taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a Kafka novel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, we have legalized
constitutionally through POP 64 the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, many of your lives
are put at risk every single day because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the federal laws and we don't allow for
the banking to actually occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'll be your champion and your voice
in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Senate to put cannabis on track for
federal legalization so we can stabilize
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry and put people to work and I
will be your advocate here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as long as it is incorrectly
classified as a schedule one drug,
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry here in California won't be
able to stabilize or grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: For more than 20 years, our cannabis
industry has been forced to operate as we
[SPEAKER_00]: know in the shadows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prop 215, the Compassionate Caregiver Act
of 1996 hoped to change that by legalizing
[SPEAKER_00]: the medicinal use of cannabis in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the lack of local cooperation made
this, in fact, to some degree,
[SPEAKER_00]: a toothless law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with the passage of Prop 64,
the federal government is still
[SPEAKER_00]: threatening businesses who comply with
state law only to get caught in the vice
[SPEAKER_00]: grip of federal cannabis law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a Department of Justice headed up
by Jeff Sessions who has made it very
[SPEAKER_00]: clear that he will do everything within
his power to shut down the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there is a confluence of
intersectionality on the issue that we
[SPEAKER_00]: care deeply about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The right to breathe clean air into our
lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The right to drink clean water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The right for our families who have been
here 10, 15, 20, 25 years to be legalized
[SPEAKER_00]: in the greatest country in the world and
to not live in fear, live in the shadows
[SPEAKER_00]: not knowing if at four in the morning
there will be a hard knock at the door
[SPEAKER_00]: with ICE agents or young children feeling
the fear of anxiety, young children not
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing if their mothers or fathers are
going to pick them up after school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Oxnard yesterday at an elementary
school, fifth grade.
Fifth graders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fifth graders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these young boys and girls at this
school were incredibly precocious,
[SPEAKER_00]: so intelligent, so smart, with huge dreams
and aspirations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their parents, many of them, actually
picked strawberries in Oxnard in Ventura
[SPEAKER_00]: County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Citrus in Piru.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunkist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Limes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all talked about Donald Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to be respectful for any folks
here who may be supportive of Donald
[SPEAKER_00]: Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think there are any.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least any that will come out of the
closet today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said, these fifth graders
were so intuitive to what was happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: the country today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can say this, Republican or
Democrat, that I drive a lot of my,
[SPEAKER_00]: although I'm a former assembly member,
state senator today, just recently until
[SPEAKER_00]: just a few months ago, the leader of the
California State Senate, your state
[SPEAKER_00]: Senate, along with my good friend and
colleague, former pro tem himself,
[SPEAKER_00]: Bill Lockyer, it's a very small,
very illustrious club of only a handful of
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals, whoever held that title.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not as political as people think I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of sitting with political
consultants and sitting with pollsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watch and I watch constituents and the
people I care deeply about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on November 9th, 2016, the day after
the election, when you saw young kids as
[SPEAKER_00]: young as kindergarten age crying,
crying because who was elected as
[SPEAKER_00]: president?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recall any children of any
Republican crying when Barack Obama was
[SPEAKER_00]: elected president of the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I don't even recall any children
of any Democrat, no matter how liberal
[SPEAKER_00]: that Democrat activist may be,
crying when George W.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bush was elected to the presidency of the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to have children crying not from joy,
but actually from deep fear of who was
[SPEAKER_00]: about to possess the most powerful office
in the world and what it meant for them
[SPEAKER_00]: and their families, when you have young
children crying, that's what drives me in
[SPEAKER_00]: my decision making right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have a Department of Justice
that seeks to make sure that candidates
[SPEAKER_00]: and economists stays schedule one and
seeks to divide our families and to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that this industry does not grow and
is not successful, and we're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do banking, we're going to make sure you
stay in the most vulnerable position
[SPEAKER_00]: possible in terms of just cash only.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why we need the right leadership.
[SPEAKER_00]: The right leadership, like with my good
friend Reggie Jones-Sawyer right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: who will be one of your keynote speakers,
has been a great champion for all of you
[SPEAKER_00]: in our state capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks like Rob Bonta, who will be here
later on today, from Oaktown, from
[SPEAKER_00]: Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stevie Bradford, who couldn't be here
today, as well as Ricardo Lara,
[SPEAKER_00]: who couldn't be here today as well,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks like Roberto, Robert Garcia.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why elections are consequential.
[SPEAKER_00]: They matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me finish up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first quarter of this year alone,
cannabis brought into our California state
[SPEAKER_00]: budget, $60.9 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: My staff should have just rounded off and
said $70, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's $60.9 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we expect the excise tax to bring in
more than half a billion dollars by the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can invest these critical dollars in
improving our education system,
[SPEAKER_00]: expanding law enforcement resources,
and building an economy that works for all
[SPEAKER_00]: of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just for some, but for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're building here in California
could become a model for the rest of the
nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're cutting a path forward for other
states and our federal government to
[SPEAKER_00]: follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for real leadership.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll bring this industry out of the
shadows so we can get to work achieving
[SPEAKER_00]: the economic growth this industry
promises.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know that the status quo is not
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same old same old is not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: The status quo, in fact, is too dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a result of weak leadership in
Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say this, finally.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why, because passing 215,
medicinal use of cannabis, and passing
[SPEAKER_00]: Prop 64, recreational use of cannabis,
and everything else that we need to do in
[SPEAKER_00]: California, this is why we must remain
America's exceptional example.
[SPEAKER_00]: A beacon of hope and opportunity in a very
uncertain world that we're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow as Californians.
[SPEAKER_00]: One electoral aberration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reverse generations of progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the height of our historic diversity,
our scientific advancement, our economic
[SPEAKER_00]: output, and our sense of global
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our role, to advocate, to agitate,
to organize, to make sure that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: respected and that we're legitimized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we are a true pillar of the economy
of California so folks can come out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: shadows and they can grow their businesses
and be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have an inclusive, diverse economy
that benefits everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just those at the highest economic
strata, but actually improving the
[SPEAKER_00]: condition for all individuals regardless
of who they are and where they come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: To each and every one of you, I wish you
the very best today in a very successful,
[SPEAKER_00]: successful conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you engage in so many critical issues,
they're important to the vitality of this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, not just for California.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the rest of the nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as California goes, as you know,
the rest of the nation will follow,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, God bless each and every one of
you and have a wonderful conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
