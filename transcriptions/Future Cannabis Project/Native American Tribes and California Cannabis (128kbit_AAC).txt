[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to introduce our panelists.
[SPEAKER_06]: First, we have Chairwoman Tina
Braithwaite.
[SPEAKER_06]: She is joining us from the
Utu-Utu-Gwetu-Paiute Tribe, and she has
[SPEAKER_06]: been remarkable in working with Siinaka
and AB924, which we'll be speaking about
[SPEAKER_06]: this evening.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Dave Yalapando, who I visited some
years back.
[SPEAKER_06]: He was very kind in letting me visit his
facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's the executive director of the
Cannabis Regulatory Agency for the San
[SPEAKER_06]: Isabel Botanical Center.
[SPEAKER_06]: He also has another title for the gaming
commission.
[SPEAKER_06]: He has 35 years in law enforcement
experience that he brings to the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's also a published author.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ariel Clark, attorney with Clark Newberg.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clark Newberg, she's a founding partner.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have Maxi Galones.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's our guest of honor this evening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bill AB924 was brought to legislature by
Bonta, who he previously worked with as a
[SPEAKER_06]: member of the staff.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's staffed Prop 215 and has been,
no?
[SPEAKER_06]: Merce Macursa.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's staffed Merce Macursa, and has been
instrumental in drafting regulations
[SPEAKER_06]: himself.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's also a legislative advocate and a
dear, dear friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're so grateful to have you all here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to talk a little bit about why
we're discussing Native American cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the regulations as they stand,
it is required that tribes renounce
[SPEAKER_06]: sovereignty to be a part of our legal
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if you're aware of history in any
sense, you might feel a sentiment that
[SPEAKER_06]: that is a disrespectful request.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because sovereignty is very important for
all of us, and especially tribes.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I first saw this in the regulations,
I was very much dismayed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I spoke with everybody here and mentioned
that in writing a press release for our
[SPEAKER_06]: panel this evening, I started to look
through some of the issues that I've been
[SPEAKER_06]: following for a few years now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jurisdiction is a major issue in
addressing how we will facilitate
[SPEAKER_06]: operations for cannabis with tribes
outside of the state regulatory authority,
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's a difficult nuance.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also public law 280, which talks
about, again, who manages the jurisdiction
[SPEAKER_06]: in terms of federal law, local law,
tribal law.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are very complicated issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in a very simple context, we're going
to present to you this evening that you
[SPEAKER_06]: have a vested interest in supporting
Native American cannabis and tribes as
[SPEAKER_06]: being a part of this industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Potentially cultivating, doing lab
testing, distribution to our licensed
[SPEAKER_06]: retailers, and there are opportunities for
revenue for the state.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're also going to talk about what the
possibilities are for legislation,
[SPEAKER_06]: why AB 924 didn't work, and what kind of
solutions we can put in place,
[SPEAKER_06]: how we can affect policy to make changes
for the future.
[SPEAKER_06]: With that, I'm going to start just by
asking our panelists, if you all would
[SPEAKER_06]: each speak to this point, how do the
tribes feel about cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they ready for cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there tribes that maybe aren't ready
or feel apprehensive?
[SPEAKER_06]: As of right now, cannabis has been a part
of tribal industry in Washington since
[SPEAKER_06]: 2015.
[SPEAKER_06]: So California's had some time to look at
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: The tribes have had some time to look at
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: What has the initial response been,
and has it adapted over time?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll start with Chairwoman Tina
Braithwaite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Tina Braithwaite, and I am the
tribal leader of the Benton Paiute Tribe.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're 40 miles east of Mammoth Lakes up in
the Sierras.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have the first state recreational
dispensary on our tribal lands.
[SPEAKER_03]: We opened for 2017.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since we've opened, we have not had
any incidences on our tribal lands at all
[SPEAKER_03]: as far as our dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we first legalized and passed
cannabis on our tribal lands, we have out
[SPEAKER_03]: of 140 tribal members, we had five noes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were able to educate our people on the
positive sides of cannabis and what it's
[SPEAKER_03]: doing for not just our people,
but people across the nation, especially
[SPEAKER_03]: with the opioid crisis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, our government, they feed people
opioids every day and get them addicted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I believe that opioids are the entrance
drug and cannabis is the exit drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have approximately 15 elders on our
reservation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make a topical with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Through that topical, it has eliminated a
lot of their opioid use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I have elders from other
reservations that have been asking,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they come out to our dispensary,
they purchase their products, and they
[SPEAKER_03]: leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't had no issues with law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have our own regulatory body.
[SPEAKER_03]: They regulate us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I think they overregulate us.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we are in a better situation than you
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: No offense.
[SPEAKER_03]: California, who would have thought that
California would be behind Nevada when
[SPEAKER_03]: Nevada 10 years ago, you went to jail for
six months for internal possession.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now here we are, California was
supposed to be the leader in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're way behind Nevada.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, hopefully the state will
get to where they need to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've just, you know,
been doing our own thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We manufacture, we grow, we manufacture,
we have extraction, and we send out all of
[SPEAKER_03]: our products for testing to this nice
gentleman and his facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we make sure that our packaging,
we try to mirror the state as close as we
[SPEAKER_03]: can, you know, so that we don't have any
issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the state, they've been, the counties
have been real respectful.
[SPEAKER_03]: The states, they haven't been too good to
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they locked us out of the
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have no legal pathway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're forced to do a nation to nation
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We cannot sell into the California legal
market, which is, it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's awful because, you know, we have,
you know, we support our own people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we have, we're governments.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have, you know, our obligation to our
reservations, our people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, so we're just doing what we
need to do, and we're creating our own
[SPEAKER_03]: tribal market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I as well would like to thank,
thank you all for the invitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Courtney mentioned, I'm executive
director for the Tribal Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulatory Agency for the Ipe Nation of
Santa Isabel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tribe on 15,500 acres, about
980-some-odd members in East San Diego
[SPEAKER_00]: County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little town of Julian, Santa Isabel,
that's where we're at in rural San Diego
[SPEAKER_00]: County.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question was, what's the position of
tribes in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I also serve as executive director for the
California Native American Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Association, cnaca.us is our website,
if you'd like to visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 23 member tribes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the myth is that tribes across
the country, particularly in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: are rich off of gaming, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We make a lot of money off of gaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the tribes that are interested in
cannabis primarily are tribes that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: see risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't see revenues from gaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been marginalized into rural
areas, such as Bishop, such as Death
[SPEAKER_00]: Valley for Tim Bacicione, or rural San
Diego County as ours is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have gaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a casino.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a casino.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the chairman of the gaming
commission up until we closed it in
[SPEAKER_00]: February of 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the myth is that tribes make money off
of gaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just not the case for most of the
110 tribes in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Cnaca, we have 23 member tribes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only three of those tribes are gaming
tribes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're exploring cannabis,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an economic development opportunity
for tribes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most tribes that are interested in
cannabis, like Benton Paiute, like Santa
[SPEAKER_00]: Isabel, are not gaming tribes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not making money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not making money from a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Santa Isabel, we've been in this
business almost three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as the Wilkinson Memorandum came
out, the tribe took a look at its
[SPEAKER_00]: constitutional process, passed a law,
passed an ordinance, created a regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're now just south of $50 million of
non-tribal tenant money invested in
[SPEAKER_00]: developing our facility at Santa Isabel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have nine, we call them tenants,
nine enterprises, separate enterprises,
[SPEAKER_00]: non-tribal owned enterprises.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three of those are manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is an organic waste processor.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is a certified testing lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I heard you talking about testing
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We predate the state of California in
every single area of cannabis regulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: including laboratory testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said there was one lab?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, there's two.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one's at Santa Isabel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they can't get state licensed,
unfortunately, due to the bureaucracy here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the state and in transigence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's testing all the way through the
state's level three regulations that we
[SPEAKER_00]: adopted over a year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an organic waste processor for
cannabis waste, and the rest are
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, as we said, if all that
cultivation space were occupied with
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, we'd be looking at a quarter
million plants right now today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tribe has a substantial investment
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're regulating 24-7.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your Bureau of Cannabis Control,
how often are they at your property?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're there 24-7.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a regulatory staff that's there
right now because our facility's 24-7.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a 24-7 manned surveillance room,
manned surveillance room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just the server, the DVR servers,
but live people watching everything that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: BSIS certified security guards,
armed and unarmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our pesticide regulations, transportation
regulations, laboratory testing
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations, cannabis race regulations,
as I mentioned, pre-debt the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very serious about this,
as many other tribes in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unfortunate thing is when we get to
talking about AB 924, the state has thrown
[SPEAKER_00]: up a roadblock to tribal participation in
the California cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't a government lesson,
but let me tell you what sovereignty is to
[SPEAKER_00]: tribes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like asking a person to give up their
identity, who you are as a person,
[SPEAKER_00]: who you are as a people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want you to give that up and defer all
of your culture, all of your laws,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of your regulation, all of your
government to the state of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three political subdivisions
mentioned in the Constitution,
[SPEAKER_00]: the feds, the state, and tribes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says nothing about cities, it says
nothing about counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on par with the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state should be negotiating in a
respectful government-to-government basis
[SPEAKER_00]: for tribal participation in the cannabis
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me explain and answer your question
how serious tribes are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tina alluded to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're creating a tribe-to-tribe market.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Santa Isabel, we already have a
handful of tribes, very close to us and
[SPEAKER_00]: some far away, who want to be the
recipients of that manufactured and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivated product that we're now
producing on our reservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be selling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be selling it to
California citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Santa Isabel, as I mentioned,
we have a very robust regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: But imagine that there's a tribe out there
that says, you know what, who needs
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do anything we want on our
reservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: No pesticide testing, no laboratory
testing, no child proofing, no ingredient
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell, customers come to our reservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll sell you whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the state of California has
created by keeping tribes out of this
[SPEAKER_00]: market is a tribe-to-tribe market with
some robust regulation, like Benton Paiute
[SPEAKER_00]: or Santa Isabel, and possibly less than
robust regulation that actually puts
[SPEAKER_00]: California citizens at risk, those
consumers at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the state of California has
created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tribes aren't going to walk away from this
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in it too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too much money involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will be a tribe-to-tribe market.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, by the way, none of the revenues
generated from those transactions go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the state of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't participate in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that money comes to the tribe and
tell me that we aren't going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: offer our product a whole lot cheaper than
anyone else in the state of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're pretty serious about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Dave, you've covered a lot of
topics here.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chairwoman Braithwaite and I discussed
that with lab testing, we now have a
[SPEAKER_06]: blockade where in order to be testing with
a licensed facility in the state of
[SPEAKER_06]: California, you need to be a licensed
entity.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's some complications there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, they've found a solution by
testing at Santa Isabel Botanical Center.
[SPEAKER_06]: You also touched on how you're approaching
this in respect to the ability to
[SPEAKER_06]: distribute to the state market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now we have an institution where the
tribes are working together.
[SPEAKER_06]: What does that mean for the greater
enterprise that we have within the state
[SPEAKER_06]: of California?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are not complying with regulations,
you're creating your own regulations,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's something to be noted in fact that
historically, the federal government
[SPEAKER_06]: questions whether or not tribes could
govern themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: The gaming tribes showed that that was
definitely possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Santa Isabel Botanical Center has
shown itself to be regulating beyond what
[SPEAKER_06]: the state requires.
[SPEAKER_06]: In one instance, Dave and I discussed that
there was a dispensary in San Diego,
[SPEAKER_06]: a state licensed dispensary.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the inspectors came in and said,
every product on this shelf is failed
[SPEAKER_06]: compliance, except for this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It came from Santa Isabel Botanical
Center.
[SPEAKER_06]: The tribes are showing that not only can
they meet the needs, but they can also
[SPEAKER_06]: regulate beyond what is required for the
state.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also should address how we are
approaching this in terms of the money
[SPEAKER_06]: that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in Washington, for example,
this is going back to sovereign nations,
[SPEAKER_06]: creating a compact.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Washington, the state government and
the tribes came to an agreement and they
[SPEAKER_06]: said, okay, we don't necessarily want
people going to the tribe or the
[SPEAKER_06]: reservation and getting a deal,
because we're concerned about how that's
[SPEAKER_06]: going to affect the state market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they came to an agreement and they
said, okay, everybody's going to charge a
[SPEAKER_06]: tax.
[SPEAKER_06]: The state will charge this amount and the
tribes will charge on par, but the money
[SPEAKER_06]: that the tribes charge will go back to the
tribes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they're able to use that money to
support economic development, which is one
[SPEAKER_06]: of the reasons that we're talking about
this, because we'd like for the tribes to
[SPEAKER_06]: have that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that money, Chairwoman Braithwaite
and I discussed that she had proposed the
[SPEAKER_06]: possibility of a healthcare system for the
tribes where the descendants would have
[SPEAKER_06]: access to the healthcare system.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in addition, it would release a burden
on the state.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here in California, we have what some
would call a welfare state.
[SPEAKER_06]: So any opportunity to diminish that burden
would be welcomed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chairwoman Braithwaite, could you
potentially talk to us about what your
[SPEAKER_06]: challenges were there, what you proposed,
and then maybe Max can talk to us about
[SPEAKER_06]: what those issues are surrounding that and
why potentially that wasn't an avenue for
[SPEAKER_06]: us to take.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so in the beginning when we tried to
get that government to government
[SPEAKER_03]: consultation with the governor's office
and we were refused, we tried to create a
[SPEAKER_03]: program where the tribes would charge a
tax equal to the state and those taxes
[SPEAKER_03]: would go into a pot like the RSTF monies
and they would be used for healthcare.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hospitals in California, there's not one
Native American hospital in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: The IHS facilities, that's the Indian
Health Services.
[SPEAKER_03]: The federal government claims they have a
federal trust responsibility to the tribes
[SPEAKER_03]: for healthcare.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're 400 years from now where we'll
see our first Indian Health Services
[SPEAKER_03]: facility clinic, excuse me, health clinic
built in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were trying to, in the beginning,
create that healthcare system for all
[SPEAKER_03]: Native American people, whether you were
enrolled member of California or not,
[SPEAKER_03]: you could be Cherokee, you could be,
you know, Sioux, wherever, but if you
[SPEAKER_03]: could show that you were Native American
and you lived in California, you could go
[SPEAKER_03]: and be treated at these health facilities
for free.
[SPEAKER_03]: Healthcare, hospitals, mental health,
substance abuse, aftercare, which really
[SPEAKER_03]: lacks in this country.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no aftercare.
[SPEAKER_03]: Education, elders programs, youth
programs, and we were gonna try to create
[SPEAKER_03]: after, like a treat, not a treatment,
but like a halfway house type program for
[SPEAKER_03]: the Native American prisoners that come
out of the federal prisons.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could come in, they would be in a
transitional house for 90 days,
[SPEAKER_03]: get on their feet, get their birth
certificates there, get a driver's
[SPEAKER_03]: license, get a job.
[SPEAKER_03]: 90 days they would transition out,
you know, into their new, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: on their feet and on their way,
just to try to help, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: our Native American people.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that got killed in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: The state, you know, there was a lot of
kickback from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody wanted to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, who's gonna manage that
program?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there was like, how are we gonna
do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and then the state just,
you know, it just got pushed to the side.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if we could have created that
structure, how could the state have said
[SPEAKER_03]: no to us?
[SPEAKER_03]: We would have took a burden off of the
state financially, because every Native
[SPEAKER_03]: American in this state would have been
eligible, not to mention their
[SPEAKER_03]: descendants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, because right now,
if you're a descendant of a tribe and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not federally recognized,
you don't even qualify for education.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're just, you can apply for
grants, but they want you to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: federally recognized Native American.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we could have helped our own
people, you know, created our own
[SPEAKER_03]: healthcare system, but it got kicked out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's really unfortunate
that, you know, nobody really thought that
[SPEAKER_03]: that would be a positive thing for,
you know, a win-win for the tribes and the
[SPEAKER_03]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could just add one thing to what Tina
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so you understand where tribes are
at, tribes are some of the poorest
[SPEAKER_00]: communities in California with the highest
rates of unemployment.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our counterparts, Stuart Golson,
the chairman from Timbasha Shoshone,
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't miss any opportunity at the
legislature with meeting with the
[SPEAKER_00]: legislature around AB 924 to explain that
our community is so poor that we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: pass the hat just to bury our dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know from gaming, there's a thing
called per cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Per cap is where you take the revenues
from the tribe, you divide it up by tribal
[SPEAKER_00]: members, and each tribal member gets a
check.
[SPEAKER_00]: At San Isabel, when we structured our
statute, we put a prohibition on any per
[SPEAKER_00]: cap payments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single dime generated from cannabis
by the tribe went to tribal infrastructure
[SPEAKER_00]: and government services, much as Tina
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even my fines and penalties fund,
because we do fine our tenants when they
[SPEAKER_00]: violate the regs, goes to the tribes
general fund that's allocated for drug
[SPEAKER_00]: prevention and youth skill building
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that fine money even comes to the
regulatory agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes for tribal infrastructure.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started working on tribal cannabis and
worked primarily on tribal cannabis when I
[SPEAKER_02]: was working in the state legislature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been lobbying for a year and a half
now for K Street Consulting.
[SPEAKER_02]: K Street does have tribal clients,
as in casino tribes, as well as we have
[SPEAKER_02]: one tribal cannabis business that's on the
San Isabel territory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have those angles, but then from
going back to the beginning, working on
[SPEAKER_02]: the first tribal cannabis bill,
the one remarkable thing was that how
[SPEAKER_02]: divisive the issue was and how when we had
all these different stakeholders,
[SPEAKER_02]: we had the League of Cities, we had the
police chiefs, we had the United Food and
[SPEAKER_02]: Commercial Workers and the Teamsters,
the labor unions, we had CCIA,
[SPEAKER_02]: we had cow growers, we had whomever else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also all the county organizations,
the State Association of Counties,
[SPEAKER_02]: the rural counties, urban counties.
[SPEAKER_02]: This issue united everyone else like no
other issue and randomly united them in
[SPEAKER_02]: opposition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because every single other stakeholder saw
some way they would lose from allowing
[SPEAKER_02]: this to happen and integrating this into
the state marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fundamentally, the state and federal rules
and laws and jurisdictions are different
[SPEAKER_02]: on tribal land.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the non-candidate specific rules will
apply in different fashions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a brief example on labor laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is currently, I think, federal
litigation and stuff that's gone up to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Supreme Court, if I recall, over whether
you can go and organize workers on tribal
[SPEAKER_02]: land or to what degree they'd follow the
NLRB process for labor organizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's fundamentally a different creature
and it's fundamentally a different system
[SPEAKER_02]: of governance beyond cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of that, it's so incredibly
difficult to fit cannabis regulations into
[SPEAKER_02]: a tribal box or to fit tribal sovereignty
into a state cannabis regulations box.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I appreciate and admire about
what the chairwoman and what Sinaka has
[SPEAKER_02]: done is AB 924 really eliminated and
worked with all the opposition I listed
[SPEAKER_02]: before and bringing all of them,
if not some support, many neutral,
[SPEAKER_02]: and as close to not opposing as they
could.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they did a really admirable job
crafting that compromise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet it still got torn apart and it
still got rejected by the committees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And without really understanding the steps
and hard work that had gone into it,
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel it wasn't recognized.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing is that next year,
we have a new governor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a new legislature, some
legislative changes, but more so we have a
[SPEAKER_02]: new governor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am hopeful that the next
administration will be willing to engage
[SPEAKER_02]: more actively and thoroughly and early on
rectifying this tribal cannabis issue and
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to solve it and trying to go come
up with a compromise than the last one
[SPEAKER_02]: did.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when Ariel Clark started her career,
she'd intended to focus her efforts on
[SPEAKER_06]: tribal law.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some attorneys spend their whole lives
just completely focused on this one
[SPEAKER_06]: subject because it's quite complicated.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Ariel has been working with the
California Native American Cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: Association.
[SPEAKER_06]: She understands what some of these issues
are.
[SPEAKER_06]: She is Native American.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you speak to us about some of the
issues that we're facing in regards to
[SPEAKER_06]: Native American cannabis in the state of
California and what some of the issues are
[SPEAKER_06]: that we should address in creating a
pathway forward?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been focusing also on cannabis and
we work with a lot of growers and
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensary operators and lots of people
who are in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I also have a background in
Indian law and we work with tribes on
[SPEAKER_05]: developing their tribal cannabis programs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this intersection between tribes in
California and cannabis is one that I just
[SPEAKER_05]: want to take a moment to kind of talk
about what this looks like.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know that California is the fifth
largest economy in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nearly half of the cannabis market is in
California.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are 110 tribes in California and
thousands of acres are within the
[SPEAKER_05]: jurisdiction of California Indian tribes.
[SPEAKER_05]: These tribes have been here since the
beginning of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I talked with an elder, Larry Banegas,
who actually passed away a couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_05]: ago, who really was involved in cannabis
and healing for Native people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he told me that cannabis has been used
in California amongst the Native people
[SPEAKER_05]: for thousands and thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here I am, maybe, I don't know,
I started working with cannabis businesses
[SPEAKER_05]: in 2005 and encouraged all of my clients
to support regulations and pass a whole
[SPEAKER_05]: series of laws in California so that we
could have a regulated cannabis market
[SPEAKER_05]: and, by the way, grow cannabis on land and
sell cannabis on land that are,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm from Michigan, my tribe is in
Michigan, but that are on these people's
[SPEAKER_05]: lands.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the absolute outrageousness that
tribes in California do not have the
[SPEAKER_05]: opportunity to enter into the regulated
market and sell between tribes and the
[SPEAKER_05]: California cannabis, you know,
the larger commercial market, is
[SPEAKER_05]: completely outrageous.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other states have figured that out through
a compact model.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tribes clearly, I mean, listen to what
Dave has said, and Chairwoman Braithwaite
[SPEAKER_05]: as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tribes can clearly regulate themselves
incredibly well.
[SPEAKER_05]: We, and with these two and many other
people involved in SINACA's efforts and
[SPEAKER_05]: other folks, went, kindly went to the
state of California and said, look,
[SPEAKER_05]: we will, you know, here's a way that we
can work together on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that has been rejected.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also, I have to say, Max,
your statements about, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: this unifying issue, it's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw people, clients of mine who were
California cannabis operators,
[SPEAKER_05]: be deathly afraid of tribes getting into
cannabis because they looked at it like
[SPEAKER_05]: tribes will have some sort of edge on the
market or these operators that are on
[SPEAKER_05]: tribal land will have an edge and that's
unfair to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I'm looking at this guy and
thinking, you, you care about your
[SPEAKER_05]: stakeholders so much and you don't
understand, or let me, hopefully I can
[SPEAKER_05]: help educate you and help you understand
how this will benefit these communities
[SPEAKER_05]: where literally most people are at or
below the poverty level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, when do we decide that being
completely self-interested and money
[SPEAKER_05]: obsessed is something that is like maybe
not the move forward globally,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we've had these opportunities in
this state to create laws and rules and
[SPEAKER_05]: regulations and a culture, and this is
what's happening, is really abhorrent.
[SPEAKER_05]: So on that happy note, I really,
I just want to thank you Courtney so much
[SPEAKER_05]: and Peter so much and everybody for coming
here and paying attention to this issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess, I know I'm not really answering
the question, but I just, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: this is a, there is still an opportunity
to create some sort of change around this
[SPEAKER_05]: and I fully support tribes having,
you know, a little bit F California if
[SPEAKER_05]: people can't get it together and let the
tribes, I mean, not let, you will and
[SPEAKER_05]: excellent and I am cheering you on and so
are we all to have a very thriving
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis market, but let me also say this,
for our clients that are, we represent a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of legacy cannabis operators in
California and what an opportunity it
[SPEAKER_05]: would be to be able to, think about it,
only 15% of cities and counties are given
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis licenses so now I'm talking to
you guys who want to have, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you aren't already licensed or you want
to expand your footprint in California to
[SPEAKER_05]: have the opportunity to grow on tribal
land and these folks are, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're within their jurisdiction under
their very regulated whole tribal cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: program.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a massive opportunity when 85% of
the cities and counties in California,
[SPEAKER_05]: you guys don't give a shit about giving
cannabis licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have tribes that are, would be very
happy to open those doors, but we need to
[SPEAKER_05]: have an opportunity for those businesses
to sell into the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, when we think about sort of
how do we all win in situations,
[SPEAKER_05]: that is a nice thing to think about.
[SPEAKER_05]: With public safety, yes, with having
products that come to California consumers
[SPEAKER_05]: that are tested and well regulated,
but also opportunities for business people
[SPEAKER_05]: to potentially work with tribes and our
firm works with a number of tribes and
[SPEAKER_05]: developers and folks who are, anyway,
all in the tribal cannabis context.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a lot here, so thanks for
paying attention.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to raise a few moments
where it might be really lovely to go to
[SPEAKER_06]: the reservation and experience cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, healing is very important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Medicinal opportunities.
[SPEAKER_06]: Native Americans hold sacred the healing
medicine of plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm reading a book on Native American
plant medicine right now and it's
[SPEAKER_06]: something we don't all know about because
it is sacred.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't get to hear of all these matters.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also the opportunity to go to a
cannabis resort.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a team in South Dakota that
wanted to put together a resort and it was
[SPEAKER_06]: shut down by the local government.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here in California, we've had several
tribes that tried to create operations and
[SPEAKER_06]: were shut down over the course of the last
few years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're in a moment now where we're
trying to create a space where everybody
[SPEAKER_06]: is on common ground and is happy and
finding solutions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chairwoman Braithwaite would like to speak
to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I said earlier, we're 40 miles east
of Mammoth Lakes up by Mammoth Ski Resort
[SPEAKER_03]: and we are looking at doing a destination
resort, a cannabis friendly destination
[SPEAKER_03]: resort where you can come and get a
cannabis infused massage.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can maybe have some cannabis cuisine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe you can have a cup of cannabis
coffee with a THC infused edible.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just trying to get out there and do
some positive things around cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's all about education.
[SPEAKER_03]: That stigma of getting high and it's a
gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those days are gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just need to educate the public on the
medicinal side and the healing properties
[SPEAKER_03]: of cannabis, CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard your guys' issues about the
festivals and the consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have those issues on the
reservations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you guys want to do a music festival
and consume a little bit of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: by all means reach out to some of these
tribes because I'm sure they'll be open to
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: As an event producer, I will go ahead and
say yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to let everybody know when it
opens.
Absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now that we're all on board,
we all want to support Native American
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the solutions?
[SPEAKER_06]: What can we do now to create a space?
[SPEAKER_06]: We know there were some issues with AB
924.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not everybody could come to a good
agreement on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: There were some issues, some education
that needed to be happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, we needed more panels like this to
shine a light on Native American cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: and why we want it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are our next steps?
[SPEAKER_06]: How can we all come together?
[SPEAKER_06]: How can we convince everyone that this is
the avenue, this is the pathway?
[SPEAKER_06]: We can all work together.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not an infringement on the existing
owners and operators within California.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not an obstacle for those who wish to
license their entity.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an opportunity for all of us to
create a beautiful cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we get there?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are the next steps as of right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Max, you talked about next year we're
going to have a new government in place in
[SPEAKER_06]: regards to legislation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have some new players.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we send you there and tell them that we
want Native American cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: What are some of the issues that we can
address and how can we put everybody on
[SPEAKER_06]: the same line of offense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can send me there, but it's to
be determined what I can actually say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of that is something that we haven't
talked about as much in this discussion,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is there is all this industry
opposition or law enforcement or local
[SPEAKER_02]: government or all the other stakeholders
that weren't cannabis friendly or that
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't tribal cannabis friendly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other question though is how are we
getting on or working with the larger
[SPEAKER_02]: tribes and the large tribes, smaller tribe
interactions there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because my firm represents several larger
gaming tribes and for me to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: work on this issue requires me to not have
a conflict on this issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It requires me to educate and work with
those larger tribes so they recognize and
[SPEAKER_02]: appreciate and respect the work being done
and the goals of the smaller tribes that
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's part of the big question
for me and with this is the engagement
[SPEAKER_02]: with the larger tribes along with the
engagement of the Newsom administration.
[SPEAKER_02]: From some conversations I had with the
state licensing authorities, maybe it's
[SPEAKER_02]: too close, with the state licensing
authorities is that this rule and tribal
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis came from on high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an order from higher levels of
government than the state regulators to go
[SPEAKER_02]: and put in their regulations a waiver of
sovereign immunity, a pathway to licensure
[SPEAKER_02]: for tribes, which isn't really a pathway
because of the waiver and because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: local authorization requirements,
but that wasn't their choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have statutory explicit
authority to do that and ultimately we've
[SPEAKER_02]: got, ultimately a new administration can
give a new order and can go and change
[SPEAKER_02]: that conversation and so I think that is,
it's about a large tribe strategy,
[SPEAKER_02]: education strategy and a Newsom
administration strategy and I'm fairly
[SPEAKER_02]: confident it will be Gavin Newsom and not
Republican John Cox because of how
[SPEAKER_02]: democratic California is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ariel, would you like to speak to this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh no, I think Sinaka, so I'm involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly Sinaka has a seat at the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are gearing up at the end of the month
to renew our efforts to revive 924 or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know,
Sinaka member tribes, the 23 member tribes
[SPEAKER_00]: that backed 924 gave up a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of compromises on behalf
of the tribes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This woman, late night rants, what the
hell are we doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, beat up quite a bit, but the design
was tribes agreeing to come under the same
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory framework as any other entity
in the state of California without having
[SPEAKER_00]: to give up our civil regulatory authority
and our tribal sovereignty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pathway is convincing folks that a
consistent regulatory structure with the
[SPEAKER_00]: California cannabis consumer first and
foremost in thought is in everyone's best
[SPEAKER_00]: interests at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we first started the negotiations
with the state, our main goal was to
[SPEAKER_03]: preserve our sovereignty.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was never, nothing was gonna ever
take away our sovereignty because the way
[SPEAKER_03]: I explain our sovereignty is if the
governor of California wanted to waive the
[SPEAKER_03]: rights of every one of you people in the
audience, he could not do that without a
[SPEAKER_03]: vote of the people, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot waive your rights.
[SPEAKER_03]: He could not waive your rights in
California to Nevada and say, okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: California residents, you have no rights
now because I just waived them to Nevada.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how sovereignty is with tribes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are pure jurisdictions to the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not below the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not below the counties or the
cities.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are equal to the states.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are our own sovereign nations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for us to waive sovereign immunity was
not even at the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: We cannot, tribal leaders cannot just
waive our sovereign immunity with a
[SPEAKER_03]: signature.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be hung by my toes by my people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was never an option.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we tried to preserve our sovereignty
and our sovereign immunity at all costs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did try to make a deal with the state
saying that all sales on reservation,
[SPEAKER_03]: tribes would keep those taxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once our product leaves the reservation
and goes into the retail market,
[SPEAKER_03]: then those taxes will go to the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unlike Washington where if a product
leaves the reservation, well, if a product
[SPEAKER_03]: is sold on reservation, Washington state
keeps those taxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once the product leaves the
reservation and goes out into the retail
[SPEAKER_03]: market, those taxes go back to the tribes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were not trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were trying to be fair and allow
California to also get their tax money and
[SPEAKER_03]: the states and the counties will get their
tax money.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it never worked that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't gonna set bad precedent by
allowing the tribes to waive sovereign
[SPEAKER_03]: immunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did not agree to the state coming
into our tribal lands and taxing our
[SPEAKER_03]: non-tribal investors and those taxes going
back to the state because those taxes need
[SPEAKER_03]: to stay with the tribes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that happens in our sovereign
nations need to stay within our sovereign
[SPEAKER_03]: nations.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not setting bad precedents.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, I am the bad, the villain in all
of this because I said, no, we're not
[SPEAKER_03]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully the state, we can educate
them on tribal sovereignty that tribes are
[SPEAKER_03]: governments and that we ourselves have our
own people that we need to support.
[SPEAKER_03]: And through insurance and programs,
essential programs, substance abuse,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have all our own programs that we need
to support.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we could do those things,
we would take a big burden off the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would be self-sustaining.
[SPEAKER_03]: We wouldn't have to worry about all these
poor tribes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would support ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was real important to us to
maintain our integrity because at the end
[SPEAKER_03]: of the day when we die, that's all we have
is our name and our integrity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we start setting bad precedents in
Indian country, what does that say for our
[SPEAKER_03]: future generations?
[SPEAKER_03]: Every decision we make right now as a
tribal leader affects our future
[SPEAKER_03]: generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I waive sovereign immunity for
cannabis, the next thing I'm gonna be
[SPEAKER_03]: waiving sovereign immunity for this and
I'm gonna be waiving sovereign immunity
[SPEAKER_03]: for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not gonna have sovereign immunity
and we won't have a sovereign nation when
[SPEAKER_03]: my future generations are leading our
nations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why we said no.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that you're touching on something
and that's that there are matters here
[SPEAKER_06]: that are actually bigger than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis is bringing subject matter to our
cognition and saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: these are issues that have been here.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been here for a long time and
cannabis is giving us an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_06]: look at them and speak about them in
public and to the government.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it leads me to point out that the
climate for Native American cannabis and
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis in general at the federal level
has not been supportive.
[SPEAKER_06]: In December of 2014, we had the Wilkinson
memo and when I read it, I interpreted it
[SPEAKER_06]: to mean that given certain jurisdictional
concerns, tribes had sovereignty and they
[SPEAKER_06]: could cultivate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I called the governor's office and
spoke to their liaison for tribal affairs,
[SPEAKER_06]: I was told that they don't interpret it in
that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that to me was a little bit of a
trigger.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a little bit taken back by that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That what seems so simple to me and I have
studied law.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a political science major in
university.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not an attorney.
[SPEAKER_06]: All my best friends are attorneys,
but I'm not an attorney.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I'm interpreting it this way and it
seems very straightforward to me,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm surprised to hear that the governor's
office does not support that as an
[SPEAKER_06]: interpretation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't feel like the climate has been
very friendly to cannabis in general,
[SPEAKER_06]: but more so for tribal communities.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say to anyone that's watching,
for all of you that have taken the time to
[SPEAKER_06]: join us here this evening, please do your
part to support tribal cannabis and our
[SPEAKER_06]: ability to not only to purchase,
but also to distribute, to test,
[SPEAKER_06]: and to find a way for all of us to work
together so that we can have a greater
[SPEAKER_06]: industry of tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have probably a few minutes to take
some Q&A.
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we do, this is a very packed and
passionate conversation that we're having.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we talked in private, it would have
been much more dramatic.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're not witnessing that here today.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're really toning it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a very serious issue for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're grateful to have this platform to
speak to you all about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone have anything they'd like to
share before we introduce Q&A about how we
[SPEAKER_06]: can create a legal framework or create a
space to bring another bill to the table
[SPEAKER_06]: that succeeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now there's a bill, and it's a
federal bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called the S3032.
[SPEAKER_03]: Senator Elizabeth Warren is authoring this
bill, and it's called the States Act.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of people aren't aware of
this, but when the Wilkinson memo was
[SPEAKER_03]: rescinded, it didn't just affect the
tribes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It affected everybody across the nation
because it's federally illegal everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what this bill is going to do for not
just tribes but for everybody is if the
[SPEAKER_03]: state has legalized cannabis in their
respective states, then the federal
[SPEAKER_03]: government cannot come in and enforce.
[SPEAKER_03]: They cannot enforce, and that language
includes tribes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if that bill gets passed, the big
gaming tribes are going to climb down off
[SPEAKER_03]: their fence and they're going to dive into
some cannabis because right now
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody's fearing federal enforcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you guys can see your way to support
that bill, it's S3032.
[SPEAKER_03]: Elizabeth Warren is authoring it,
and I think it would be a good positive
[SPEAKER_03]: thing if we could get that passed.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to mention that in rescinding
the Wilkinson memo, Sessions rescinded the
[SPEAKER_06]: Wilkinson memo and the Cole memo.
[SPEAKER_06]: In doing so, he gave all the district
attorneys the opportunity to decide their
[SPEAKER_06]: own priorities for enforcement.
[SPEAKER_06]: So does anyone have anything they could
speak to in regards to your own U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: district attorney and what the climate is
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went up and spoke with the assistant
U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: attorney in Sacramento about three months
ago, and I was told by him that we are not
[SPEAKER_03]: on his high priority for enforcement list.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have a lot of bigger fish to fry
out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're looking at the bigger cultivators.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tribes aren't really, I mean,
we're on their radar.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're watching us.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as long as we do what we told them
that we were do and follow and regulate,
[SPEAKER_03]: self-regulate, we're testing, we're trying
to mirror and be respectful of the state,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though they weren't respectful to us,
we're still trying to keep that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we're testing, we're packaging,
you know, labeling, we're doing everything
[SPEAKER_03]: to mirror the state as close as we can.
[SPEAKER_03]: We promised we wouldn't take our product
out of state, you know, so we're being
[SPEAKER_03]: respectful in that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I mean, they're watching.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know what tribes are doing what.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, as long as, you know,
we do what we say we're going to do,
[SPEAKER_03]: because like I said, our word and our
integrity, you know, that's everything to
[SPEAKER_03]: us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, if I have, I asked him
when, you know, if you decide you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: come down and enforce on my reservation,
you don't need to come with your 50 guns
[SPEAKER_03]: and your officers are blazing,
just call me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll come back to Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have lunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll discuss it like adults.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, but don't come down there
trying to act bad ass because it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: not going to work for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so he was respectful in that
way.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to talk about enforcement,
Dave?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the three words, the watchwords that we
used for our enterprise in San,
[SPEAKER_00]: at San Isabel, collaborative, cautious and
conservative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: We moved very slowly and we have an
absolute open door policy when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: properly credentialed law enforcement,
state, local or federal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came from law enforcement 35 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent 20 years in the Bureau of Narcotic
Enforcement, probably targeting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, never mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Won't go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the folks, a lot of the law
enforcement folks in Southern California
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Southern District, where we're at
in San Diego, I know firsthand,
[SPEAKER_00]: they come up and visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had DEA agents, DA investigators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had the sheriff's lieutenant for
our local region there two days ago
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're team teaching a class at
Pechanga, a gaming class at Pechanga next
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not that big a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you stay within, if you're a tribe and
you stay within the envelope that the
[SPEAKER_00]: state has constructed, even though state
law doesn't apply on the reservation,
[SPEAKER_00]: we found that if our regulations,
if what we allow is consistent with what's
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed in the remainder of the state,
we're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far with our US attorney,
with our DA, with our sheriff and other
[SPEAKER_00]: law enforcement folks, it's just not an
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're yesterday's news.
[SPEAKER_06]: And with that, we can begin our Q&A.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anyone have any questions for the
panel?
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one here in the back.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll paraphrase your questions that
everybody can hear.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some tribes will span multiple states.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in regards to the question,
we might ask, how are you transporting
[SPEAKER_06]: across state lines?
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you potentially creating
distribution channels?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if your tribe goes into two states,
say California and Nevada, you can
[SPEAKER_03]: actually open operations in Nevada and in
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would have to get a compact through
Nevada.
[SPEAKER_03]: The governor has compacted with 27 tribes
of Nevada.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the lands in Nevada would fall under
the structure of Nevada.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, you could do
California, but why would you want to?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because California has no pathway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's legal in that part of the state
where part of your land is, then I would,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you were going to do that, I would do
the research to see what's the structure,
[SPEAKER_03]: what are the state laws, and how hard is
it to get either a license or your
[SPEAKER_03]: compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: With regard to transportation,
San Isabel, we have a prohibition on any
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis from San Isabel leaving the state
of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it can only go to a jurisdiction,
a dispensary or retail outlet that allows
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't even allow our cannabis to go
into local jurisdictions that prohibit
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: With regard to the multi-state tribes,
San Isabel consults for a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: tribes, tribes that are along the
California-Arizona border.
[SPEAKER_00]: Arizona is a no-cannabis state,
so our advice is establish your commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: enterprise within the state where it's
legal, not within the state where it is
[SPEAKER_00]: not legal, because you're bound to garner
the attention of the federal government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the state government, but rather the
federal government if you're operating in
[SPEAKER_00]: a state where it's prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the most progressive
states in terms of legislation for tribal
[SPEAKER_00]: communities, and is there anything that we
could learn from that in California?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Washington and Nevada, and our
advice would be do what they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Oregon, yeah, in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we have all these tribes across the
nation, what is the opportunity for them
[SPEAKER_06]: to be unified on, for example,
regulations?
[SPEAKER_06]: If the federal government of the United
States is going to, I think we all are on
[SPEAKER_06]: the same page here that it's going to
happen eventually.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're going to permit legal cannabis,
there's going to be statutes that are
[SPEAKER_06]: uniform.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anything that the tribes can do
as sovereign nations among themselves to
[SPEAKER_06]: create a unified platform in regards to
regulations, public safety, enforcement,
[SPEAKER_06]: distribution, all the issues that we're
facing here in California?
[SPEAKER_06]: And trying to create a legal framework.
[SPEAKER_03]: We formed the California Native American
Cannabis Association for California,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we also are in the process of creating
a tribal nations cannabis association for
[SPEAKER_03]: tribes across the nation so that we can
all be uniform, we can all help each
[SPEAKER_03]: other, set each other up with policies and
ordinances and regulations, and that way
[SPEAKER_03]: we're doing it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tribes want to just have the legal
pathway.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to do it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we're compliant with mirroring
the state as close as we can, packaging,
[SPEAKER_03]: testing, labeling, all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my vision is that if the federal
government makes this legal for tribes,
[SPEAKER_03]: that we can do a nation to nation network.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm growing and there's a tribe
across the nation that isn't a highly
[SPEAKER_03]: populated area where they don't want to
grow, that they can dispense.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know how easy it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put our dispensary up in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, it wasn't where it needed to
be, but it is now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I did what I call a pop-up dispensary,
and we were off and running.
[SPEAKER_03]: And within two weeks, our revenue was
generating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, we had issues as far as getting
products, but we did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where I see this going in the
future, is tribes creating that tribal
[SPEAKER_03]: network, nation to nation, trying to
support each other and help each other
[SPEAKER_03]: with the process so that we're doing it
all the right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I applaud the efforts of Sunaka on trying
to have the tribes work together and be
[SPEAKER_02]: uniform and have model ordinances and
such.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Sacramento, tribes agree on very
little.
[SPEAKER_02]: They agree on sovereignty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sovereignty is an overarching principle.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in some of the bills we've worked on,
which should not have been controversial,
[SPEAKER_02]: there has been one tribe is sponsoring a
water bill, for example, making a specific
[SPEAKER_02]: change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another tribe is concerned about a
precedent that could set or an
[SPEAKER_02]: infringement on sovereignty or how it
could go be litigated out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while I applaud the efforts to bring
people together, bring tribes together,
[SPEAKER_02]: from what we've seen on the ground,
it's very fractious and not unified in
[SPEAKER_02]: opinions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if this can be a way for them to be
in alignment, that would be applauded.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the implications for reservations
that allow cannabis when they have a
[SPEAKER_01]: police department or the tribal police
department or the tribal police officers
[SPEAKER_01]: who have dual certification, federal and
state, and federal certification
[SPEAKER_01]: complicates their duty to enforce federal
law?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was actually one of those federal
agents when I worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I mentioned, we consult,
San Isabel consults for tribes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our own police department.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not federally cross designated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an issue for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our advice to tribes that have dual
designated law enforcement officers that
[SPEAKER_00]: they preclude, prohibit, make sure that
those officers do not have anything to do
[SPEAKER_00]: physically with the cannabis enterprise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there isn't that conflict between
enforcement of federal law and the tribes
[SPEAKER_00]: statutory authority to conduct cannabis
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our advice is the rest of the
reservation, not any patrols or respond to
[SPEAKER_00]: calls for services within that cannabis
area.
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens if one of your transporters
gets pulled over by California Highway
[SPEAKER_06]: Patrol?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There again, and I'll answer the question,
but just by way of instruction of where
[SPEAKER_00]: the state is at, as I mentioned,
we have almost three years of experience
[SPEAKER_00]: regulating in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made at least a half a dozen
overtures to in person to the chief of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bureau of Cannabis Control, Lori Ajax,
who I knew when she was at ABC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, look, you guys are just getting
into this regulatory business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on down to San Isabel, have a
conversation with us, because I will tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you these cannabis operators, you guys,
are really creative about getting around
[SPEAKER_00]: the rules and finding those loopholes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm writing regulation almost every day to
plug up those, that innovation that you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys exhibit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have yet to have the state take me up
and come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although we have held classes,
we held a week long class for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: tribal cannabis regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a full room, but no one from the
state will come down and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation with us about regulating the
space, which is kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question was about transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a very thorough transportation
permitting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without boring you, it's about six,
seven pages long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have requirements for the driver,
requirements for the containers,
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements for the vehicle, verification
that the inventory, the shipment reaches
[SPEAKER_00]: its destination.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have had our transportations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm up to 16,000 transportations of
cannabis product from San Isabel in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been stopped by law enforcement,
CHP, local law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They show the transportation permits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single case, the officer said,
be on your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: No issues with law enforcement whatsoever
in the transportation of product.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in closing, I'm just going to go down
the line here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you can just give us just a brief
statement about what the ideal policy
[SPEAKER_06]: would look like for Native American
cannabis in the state of California.
[SPEAKER_06]: What would facilitate a greater cannabis
industry for Indian country and also
[SPEAKER_06]: appease the powers within the state
government?
[SPEAKER_06]: What does it look like?
[SPEAKER_06]: What is your wish list for this policy for
this next legislative session?
[SPEAKER_06]: Were it to be possible, what would you
like to see?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to see that legal pathway for
tribes to be able to enter into the legal
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis market with us tribes mirroring
the state as close as we can, being
[SPEAKER_03]: respectful of all of the regulations
without having to waive our sovereignty,
[SPEAKER_03]: number one, to be able to create our own
health care system for all native
Americans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Native American people in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be able to bring my tribe up to
where we are self-sustaining, where we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have to rely on the federal
government for anything ever except to
[SPEAKER_03]: have our self-governance body and to be
able to just live in harmony and do what
[SPEAKER_03]: we do because we are creating a great
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're doing it just like all the other
tribes want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to get into this market and be
self-sustaining and help their people
[SPEAKER_03]: create programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short and sweet for us, the opportunity to
play in a level playing field and
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent application of the rules,
whether it's on tribal lands or off tribal
[SPEAKER_00]: lands.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take a look at SINACA's website,
we have our guiding principles and our
[SPEAKER_00]: professional standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every one of the 23 tribes of SINACA has
committed to those guiding principles and
[SPEAKER_00]: professional standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tribes want to do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those that are serious about this business
want to do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we had that mutually respectful
relationship with the state of California
[SPEAKER_00]: and with operators off tribal lands,
then those few tribes that decide they can
[SPEAKER_00]: make a quick buck because they don't have
to create all of the regulatory structure
[SPEAKER_00]: because everything's on the reservation,
they'll be outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll invite them out of this
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I echo what both of you both said.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would just like to add that I think
it would be really wonderful to see a line
[SPEAKER_05]: of products cultivated and manufactured on
California tribal land.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're creating Appalachians for cannabis
grown in different areas in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it would be really cool to see
California native trade association,
[SPEAKER_05]: little like brandings, like little like
stamps and a very, yeah, a whole line of
[SPEAKER_05]: products from California tribal land.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be really amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're working on it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: In dispensaries all across California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I understand the question,
Courtney.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to answer the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say, you know, I'm not sure
if we talked about really there right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's language in the regulations that
says the tribes that businesses on tribal
[SPEAKER_02]: land can apply for a state license.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are the two biggest issues with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a number of issues with the two
biggest issues with that language.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is twofold.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, there's a waiver of sovereign
immunity as previously referenced,
[SPEAKER_02]: which goes too far, which was done without
consultation with tribes and which is
[SPEAKER_02]: asking for tribes to subsume themselves to
cities, to counties, to the state of
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very problematic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so while this is speaking
individually, completely for myself,
[SPEAKER_02]: it needs to be clear that the business as
opposed to the tribe, whether the business
[SPEAKER_02]: is waiving or choosing not to have a
sovereign defense placed as a business
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to the tribe as a whole and the
tribes regulatory functions and the tribes
[SPEAKER_02]: land use authority.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there isn't that distinction drawn
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that distinction could potentially in
my own personal view, potentially
[SPEAKER_02]: alleviate some of the conversations and
concerns.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that would be the case,
but that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second thing is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, the state only, the state
recognizes cities and counties as local
[SPEAKER_02]: governments.
[SPEAKER_02]: The language in the regulations
essentially say, if you want a tribal,
[SPEAKER_02]: a license from the state for cannabis on
tribal land, you need city or county
[SPEAKER_02]: approval for whatever surrounds that
tribe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those counties do not have zoning approval
or land use approval on the tribes,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the state is asking them to regulate
and to have that authority, which they do
[SPEAKER_02]: not have.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they try to do that, they would lose in
court because it violates, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that violence, the sovereignty,
the local control, the land use control of
[SPEAKER_02]: the tribes in a ridiculous fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'd like to do, what I'm working
on trying to do is explaining to the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulators and those above them,
just they thought they made a system that
[SPEAKER_02]: works, but it stinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it stinks because it doesn't respect
tribal land use authority and it asks for
[SPEAKER_02]: an overly broad waiver of sovereign
immunity that doesn't focus on the
[SPEAKER_02]: business aspects itself versus the tribe
as a whole.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just gonna piggyback off that and say
that, yeah, absolutely the tribe should
[SPEAKER_05]: have the ability to retain civil
regulatory jurisdiction and regulate
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have seen with one of the tribes that
we're working with, the surrounding county
[SPEAKER_05]: bans cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we went and spoke with the state,
the CDFA actually, about whether or what
[SPEAKER_05]: impact that may have, because from our
perspective, the tribe, of course,
[SPEAKER_05]: it doesn't matter that the county
surrounding it bans cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have no jurisdiction on tribal land.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were finally able to get some
reasonableness since well-established law
[SPEAKER_05]: says that counties have no jurisdiction on
tribal land.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are seeing some level of hello,
awake, and education around this issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope that you won't have to come up
against that because we've had that fight
[SPEAKER_05]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk in the next, I've got a
meeting next week.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: With that, I will thank our panelists,
each and every one of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that you've traveled far and wide
and gone through great lengths to be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been an honor to have you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to cover that word.
Thank you.
Thank you.
