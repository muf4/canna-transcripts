[SPEAKER_00]: So, I have this uh, Sheldon Black downstem
piece that has all these little holes in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you listen to the sounds,
see how loud it is and the water kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays up into my mouth?
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, when you put this thing in,
[SPEAKER_00]: suddenly, yeah, it's much more gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, anyway, we have some raised cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the uh, some ice cream cake that
John and Larry gave me up in Humboldt a
[SPEAKER_00]: few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so we got some raised cannabis
and I'm gonna bring back, if you remember,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Ember from around 2012, I think it
came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually talking about bringing this
back to the market, but with some upgraded
[SPEAKER_00]: functionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first thing is it only has one
temperature, which is really fucking hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wait for it to heat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll turn orange soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can feel you heating up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, anyway, instead of using a lighter,
and the only lighters I have are this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even have a normal, people keep
taking all my lighters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, instead of a lighter with,
uh, I'm sure Bix uses the finest butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, yeah, so you can see that heating up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right, so let's try this thing
with
[SPEAKER_00]: some, nice, that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, just gonna try it with some,
let's do some hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some Cali hash here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's glob you together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, that thing only lasts 90 seconds,
so let's be quick, quick, quick,
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a little one-hitter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so it's probably way too hot for
this, and I think that's one of
the...
[SPEAKER_00]: Water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course, we got the glob in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cool thing is that you don't even
really have to clean this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This stuff wipes, or comes right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so this has a ceramic tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently only has one temperature,
so what I'd like to hear is some ideas for
[SPEAKER_00]: various temperature settings that you'd
like to see if you're dabbing with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if your personal preferences,
and then other features and functionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think as an ergonomic replacement
for a lighter, oh, and so it has this
[SPEAKER_00]: little protective top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's, yeah, so even if it's hot,
you can put, I think this has aluminum in
[SPEAKER_00]: it, so it's not gonna burn anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this thing also turns off after 90
seconds, so if you get super high and pass
[SPEAKER_00]: out on the couch, it's not gonna be on
for, as you knock it over with your feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's the Ember.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the Sheldon Black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little holes in the bottom of the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hit that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, nevermind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you wanna take another hit,
and you're like, oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's light you back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the Jeopardy music.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I hit the Cali Hash,
and I hit the Flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I have two of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna play around with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, looking for feedback on what you
would like in a little ceramic tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides super long battery life,
nice ergonomic design, and variable
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I now gotta go pick up my
daughter at preschool.
So this
[SPEAKER_00]: is the Ember.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the Sheldon Black.
