[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're discussing the newly released
draft permanent regulations that are
[SPEAKER_00]: currently in a 15-day comment period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to start, just so I understand,
how many people here are retailers,
[SPEAKER_00]: are in the retail space?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how many are distributors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any distributors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivators in the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any testing labs here today?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manufacturers and people manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I know we have some POS
companies, some people who work for
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising and branding firms,
and then my compliance nerds in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will admit what I'd like to preface
by saying, one, that this isn't everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in the regs in the newly released
draft.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of is to help maybe focus your
attention on certain areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, there's some big hot button
issues that everybody's talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also some more granular,
interesting little tidbits that they put
[SPEAKER_00]: in there that also have consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of this is we're just going to
talk through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those changes, highlighting those
changes, the possible impacts,
[SPEAKER_00]: and hopefully give you some fuel or
inspiration to draft some meaningful
[SPEAKER_00]: public comment in this very short period
of time we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you guys commented on the last
set of regulations, actually submitted
[SPEAKER_00]: comments?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the interesting thing, on Friday,
October 19, these revised regulations were
[SPEAKER_00]: released.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have until Monday, November 5 at 5 PM
to submit comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's 12 more days from today.
[SPEAKER_00]: A special note for this round of comments
is that only comments addressing the newly
[SPEAKER_00]: proposed changes are accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't go back and still comment on
the old things that didn't change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really want to identify,
when you're looking at this new language,
[SPEAKER_00]: where a change happened, because that's
your crack to get in there and insert
[SPEAKER_00]: public comment on those aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can comment on the newly proposed
revisions, and you can also comment on the
[SPEAKER_00]: new documents and forms and other things
that are glorious that they've introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to not have this just be a
completely depressing experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to start with some positive
aspects that I gleaned from some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: changes that were good, that were good
wins that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the biggest ones, I think,
for the industry is going to be that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've changed the sequence of labeling
so that distribution can now label the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid content THC-CBD after final
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a manufacturer can submit their
packaged labeled product with everything
[SPEAKER_00]: except that cannabinoid content to a
distributor, and after receiving that
[SPEAKER_00]: certificate of analysis, then they can put
on the THC-CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been seeing the headlines that
one in five products is failing in
[SPEAKER_00]: California, everything's poison,
oh my god, 65% of those fails is because
[SPEAKER_00]: of label claims, is because the THC-CBD is
not coming within that 10% threshold,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so now we would hope that about 65% of
those remediation efforts will be
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminated and people will just be able to
label it after they get that final test
[SPEAKER_00]: result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another big one is that the BCC and the
Department of Public Health have agreed
[SPEAKER_00]: upon tinctures being a thing and being
allowed to be part of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've changed the rules around
alcohol content for tinctures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is now an allowable product
category, and they're actually in
[SPEAKER_00]: agreement, which is fantastic when that
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to SB311, we now have distributed
distributor transfers that are possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the test results hold and you can
distribute a tested product and transfer
[SPEAKER_00]: that between multiple distributors so you
don't have to test it with every single
[SPEAKER_00]: distributor that you happen to be working
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great win.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's expanded events locations thanks
to AB2020, so now it doesn't only have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be on a fairground with local
authorization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have pathways to have more public
events for retail and consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can now reject partial shipments.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was like, you know, maybe not a very
exciting one, but it was pretty great
[SPEAKER_00]: because they had it before that either you
had to accept the whole shipment or reject
[SPEAKER_00]: it if something was wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now if you get a shipment and some of
the product is damaged, you cannot accept
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a shipment and part of it is
not labeled correctly, you cannot accept
[SPEAKER_00]: that part of the shipment, and as a
retailer, you can take in the rest of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll help the supply chain a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edibles can be remediated through
repackaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you put in your batch of blueberry
chocolates and it hits over the limit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can actually repackage it so that you
can put as many would actually meet the
[SPEAKER_00]: requirement instead of having to destroy
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty great.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some higher action levels for the
category two solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of gives a little more wiggle
room there in the testing things,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's lots of new forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The BCC has all of these instructions that
they give on notifying them about this and
[SPEAKER_00]: notifying about that, but they never
really gave much methodology to notifying
[SPEAKER_00]: other than like send an email to info at
BCC and maybe somebody will see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of these forms have to do with
like the licensing procedures because they
[SPEAKER_07]: probably saw a whole gambit of quality and
presentation and form.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in a lot of ways, it's really good that
they're systematizing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be a lot easier going forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's going to be a lot more clarity.
[SPEAKER_07]: And even with the CEQA issue, Los Angeles
was a morass with CEQA because the process
[SPEAKER_07]: in LA has been so slow.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've now laid out clearly what
everyone's expected to give with respect
[SPEAKER_07]: to CEQA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those forms, like you mentioned in the
beginning, are part of the material that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can comment upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not covering the contents of those
forms in this presentation, but you would
[SPEAKER_00]: want to look at the content of those
forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's aspects of it that merit a
comment, you will want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and the greatest thing maybe is more
clarity?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we'll talk about the other things
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the biggest pieces that came
down is this expanded definition of
[SPEAKER_00]: ownership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprise!
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be an owner of a cannabis company
and not know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The language that was added in one section
is that any individual entitled to a share
[SPEAKER_00]: of at least 20% of the profits may be
considered an owner or is an owner.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is important because a lot of folks
were using passive involvement to claim
[SPEAKER_07]: that they weren't owners.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this is really going to affect a
lot of the large management groups out
[SPEAKER_07]: there who are managing multiple retail
chains.
[SPEAKER_07]: If a particular jurisdiction has a cap on
ownership per city.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many cases, I have included the
statement of reason that came from the
[SPEAKER_00]: BCC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes just because it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some of their statements of reasons
is one step up for them because we said
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or lots of times it's just like,
this is just additional clarity that's
[SPEAKER_00]: ruining your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of those you'll see, I included
like what was their reasoning in cases
[SPEAKER_00]: that they did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So extending upon that, this is one where
it starts to get really interesting in
[SPEAKER_00]: that designation of owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they put in this term any individual
who assumes responsibility for the
[SPEAKER_00]: license.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this can be somebody who's managing or
directing the business in exchange for a
[SPEAKER_00]: share of the profits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be somebody who assumes
responsibility for debts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be an individual who is determining
how a portion of the cannabis business is
[SPEAKER_00]: run, including non plant touching portions
of the commercial cannabis business,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as branding and marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an overreach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also an individual who's
determining what cannabis goods,
[SPEAKER_00]: the commercial cannabis business will
cultivate, manufacture, distribute,
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase or sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where it gets interesting in a
lot of the discussions that are happening
[SPEAKER_00]: because that can theoretically incorporate
a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there seems to be a discretionary
aspect of it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it keeps going, like when it's an
entity, they want to get down to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to have a t-shirt made that
just says until only individuals remain,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is going to be my new motto for the
cannabis industry itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just say, can we just take it back to
individuals?
[SPEAKER_07]: And anyone who's been going through the
licensing process has probably experienced
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had a couple of projects where we've
had to go up six or seven levels of
[SPEAKER_07]: corporate entities until they get to the
warm bodies.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Las Vegas casino style regulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: They ultimately want to know who's going
to be profiting with these businesses.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's the money going?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's along with the expansion of the
definition of ownership came the expansion
[SPEAKER_00]: of a definition of financial interest
holders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these were super surprising,
you know, that they go down to receiving a
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of the profits is employees who
are doing a profit share with their own
[SPEAKER_00]: company, landlords who have entered into
lease agreements, who are taking a piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of your company, consultants who have
taken a piece of your company,
[SPEAKER_00]: attorneys and accountants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who have taken a piece of your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of this to me is super exciting
because we're going to see all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting companies that have been
taking a piece of a lot of people's
[SPEAKER_00]: companies and they're going to have to be
disclosed as financial interest holders.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that shouldn't be surprising at all
because that's the guidance the state's
[SPEAKER_07]: been giving over the last nine months.
[SPEAKER_07]: When disclosing these financial interests,
you know, unambiguously, they gave us
[SPEAKER_07]: advice in writing over the phone that,
you know, if anyone's getting a percentage
[SPEAKER_07]: of the revenue if anyone's getting
percentage of the profits if anytime
[SPEAKER_07]: there's percentage based compensation,
that's like the red flag triggering that
[SPEAKER_07]: you're financially interested.
[SPEAKER_07]: State wants to know who you are as a
financially interested party.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not getting live scan, but the
state wants to know who's profiting from
[SPEAKER_07]: these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if even a salesperson who's
making a commission on sales is considered
[SPEAKER_00]: a financially interested party.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that commission you're getting or
that portion of the business exceeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 percent threshold back to surprise,
you're an owner because you're now
[SPEAKER_00]: profiting more than 20 percent based on
your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So conflating those two, when an institute
has that financial business, the bureau is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to decide in some cases they may
decide that you do fall under the owner,
[SPEAKER_00]: their definition of owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while there's different requirements as
Erin was saying of the disclosures you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do in terms of live scans and
whatnot as an owner and just being listed
[SPEAKER_00]: with your information and identifying
features as a financial interest holder,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's possible in disclosing those
financially interested parties that the
[SPEAKER_00]: bureau is going to review it and say,
actually, that person is an owner and
[SPEAKER_00]: shift that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing with the financially
interested parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to get down there to the flesh
and blood person until only individuals
[SPEAKER_00]: remain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be an entity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to know every person involved
with that entity, no matter how many
[SPEAKER_00]: layers the entity goes back.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just with anything throughout these
licensing process, you know, failing to
[SPEAKER_07]: disclose or having the appearance that
you're trying to hide something,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's usually going to be worse than what
you don't want to disclose if they think
[SPEAKER_07]: you're intentionally trying to deceive
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that understanding of seeing that
interest that they have in who where who's
[SPEAKER_00]: where's the money coming from,
who is involved, who are the parties,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe has a lot to do with the second
area of white hot panic, which is this
[SPEAKER_00]: white labeling issue that has come up,
which is the the the sentence all
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial cannabis activities shall be
conducted between licensees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that in the extension of this,
they get a lot more detailed on that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to be conducting
commercial cannabis activities on behalf
[SPEAKER_00]: of at the request of or with a contract
with anybody who is not licensed under
[SPEAKER_00]: this act.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this obviously brought a lot of fear up
for people because a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: people's models are based on white
labeling relationships with non licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: entities and brands that there's many
reasons for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the issue that we see is what and
this will kind of thread throughout is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have the industry, in my opinion,
is responding to large and sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: egregious operators who are operating
unlicensed under the protection of saying
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a non plant touching brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, I don't have to tell you who I
am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to get a license and I don't
have to be held to your advertising
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a lot of these cases, it seems like
an action on the bureau's part to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: nope, you want to be a cannabis brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to play by the rules of regulated
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is something we've seen a lot of
from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been a lot of celebrities who want
to attach themselves to Canada,
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis brands and the overarching
guidance from the state.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I'm not shocked by seeing it in
policy now is that they don't want
[SPEAKER_07]: unlicensed people engaging in commercial
cannabis activity.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't want licensees going beyond the
scope of their license and commercial
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis activity.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're really trying to rein in this
action.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I spent the last two days in
Anaheim with a lot of smart people who
[SPEAKER_00]: were, you know, discussing solutions for
this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, this is an area that
desperately needs some comment because I
[SPEAKER_00]: think in trying to take out one piece of
it, obviously, it's compromising the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that a lot of smaller businesses are
functioning in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we need to offer here and this
goes into how you craft a comment is a
[SPEAKER_00]: meaningful comment is the only thing that
the agencies have to respond to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just say, hey, you're ruining my
life and why don't we just deregulate
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, that wouldn't be considered a
meaningful comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to actually cite a specific
section, the specific regulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: state what the problem is and offer a
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So luckily, there's lots of smart people
working on that, but don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: depend on them to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should submit your own comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been everything suggested from
maybe they should invent a new license
[SPEAKER_00]: type that would cover brands and IP and
non plant touching aspects with 15 days
[SPEAKER_00]: and them up against the line of expiring
emergency regs are, you know, chances of
[SPEAKER_00]: that happening are slim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or as some eloquent people thought,
it might be as simple as the addition of
[SPEAKER_00]: some language saying that all of this is,
you know, this is fine and good,
[SPEAKER_00]: except in the cases in which the person is
a financial interest holder so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could extend that information in terms of
who is the person benefiting from this and
[SPEAKER_00]: that they want their name attached to it,
their information.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an interesting model in ABC Liquor
that could be a possible solution as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is AB 893 in 2015, sponsored by the
California Craft Brewers Association,
[SPEAKER_00]: created this thing called a beer brand
registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a beer brand registration was a
document that a brand would send even if
[SPEAKER_00]: they were contract manufacturing to say,
hey, we're a brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's here's what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can only dream of the day as cannabis
people that you could get something as
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet as this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you read what it is in the business
and professions code that all they have to
[SPEAKER_00]: do is register the band, the brand with
the department upon filing of the
[SPEAKER_00]: registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be sold without any further action
from the department.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have to wait for them to
say it's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just send in the letter and it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, this is an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are examples from the alcohol
industry of even for the brokerage issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: because some of that stuff of financial
interest holder and unlicensed parties
[SPEAKER_00]: goes into that broker model of the
middleman who is arranging deals and
[SPEAKER_00]: making that problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the wine industry, you have a wine
broker license, which is you register.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have your information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listed with the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a wine broker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting to look at Nevada's
model, where Nevada has the agent card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who's participating in any way in
the cannabis industry has an agent card.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get live scan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their information is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like this might be something
that would satisfy the state's interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing who are the players?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you live?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the money?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is the money?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are those are some of the
existing models we have to point to to
[SPEAKER_00]: say, hey, is that simple?
[SPEAKER_00]: And something like that could be something
like beer brand registration could be
[SPEAKER_00]: easier than the creation of a license
type, which is causes them panic and fear
[SPEAKER_00]: or something that may not satisfy their
needs of the information disclosure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're after.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another big topic was the technology
platform regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, in short form, we can see what
happened is that some unlicensed
[SPEAKER_00]: operators, advertisers, tech platforms
were doing very, very large scale
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses benefiting from the commercial
cannabis industry and sometimes the non
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial cannabis industry and claiming
that because they were not a licensee,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were outside of the domain of the
regulated sphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems that the bureau has come with
a very specific smackdown for some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those business models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this piece of regulating technology
platforms was another with was another big
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was their statement of reasons was
that the bureau has found that a number of
[SPEAKER_00]: bureau licensees engage in delivery
services that are facilitated by
[SPEAKER_00]: technology platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, use of such platforms has created
confusion in customers as to whether a
[SPEAKER_00]: bureau licensee is conducting the
commercial cannabis activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moreover, some technology platforms may
create the impression that they hold a
[SPEAKER_00]: bureau license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to clarify this and avoid this
condition, confusion, the bureau decided
[SPEAKER_00]: to throw down this section 54 15.1 shall
go down in infamy that a licensed retailer
[SPEAKER_00]: or micro business can't sell or transfer
goods through the use of an unlicensed
[SPEAKER_00]: third party intermediary business broker
or any other business entity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, you know, clarifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless, you know, there are things you
can use a platform, you can use tech
[SPEAKER_00]: technology, we're not having to be stone
age and go off the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the number one is clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The licensed retailer, licensed micro
business did not allow for the delivery of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis goods by the platform in the
delivery regulations delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be employees of the licensee.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one, you know, we got that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a nice one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The licensed retailer, licensed micro
business does not share in the profits of
[SPEAKER_00]: the sale of cannabis goods with the
technology platform service or provider or
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise provide for a percentage or
portion of those cannabis goods sales.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this shouldn't be surprising to the
extent we're still recognizing medical
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis, because a lot of these
commission based lead generation contracts
[SPEAKER_07]: in the medical community are just wholly
illegal with other health care providers.
[SPEAKER_07]: It should be, you know, in the health care
context, it's all done on like flat fee,
[SPEAKER_07]: fair market value arrangement,
not based on like per capita or percentage
[SPEAKER_07]: of the sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw a similar thing in the events
language when they did the event that no
[SPEAKER_00]: event coordinator can make a profit of the
sales off of their business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of kind of trying to create
these clear contracts where there's a fee
[SPEAKER_00]: to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same for everybody and not that
there's these individual profit sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: agreements.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is fun as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number three, so the licensed retailer
micro business can't advertise or market
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis goods in conjunction with the
technology platform service provider
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the technology platform and
shall ensure that the platform service
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't use their license number to
advertise on any advertising or marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: that primarily promotes the services of
the technology platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're driving around and you see
an ad just for a technology platform with
[SPEAKER_00]: no licensee attached or with a license
number attached that does not belong to
[SPEAKER_00]: that delivery platform, this is what
they're calling out and is problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the delivery platform cannot be the
predominant thing advertised over the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual licensed retailer who owns the
license number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is going to throw a wrench in a
lot of the billboards all over California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is nice as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the licensed retailer micro business
has to ensure that the following
[SPEAKER_00]: information is provided to the consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the product advertised for sale
discloses at a minimum the licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: retailers or micro businesses business
name and license number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're on said platform and you're
just buying products and you have no idea
[SPEAKER_00]: which store it's actually coming from,
what the state is saying is that that
[SPEAKER_00]: retailer, the actual retailer with a
license number supplying that product has
[SPEAKER_00]: to be visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, this 4A is important because
this actually is not just deliveries
[SPEAKER_00]: facilitated, it says any cannabis goods
advertised or offered for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this also would incorporate advertising
platforms that are advertising products
[SPEAKER_00]: without a licensee and license number
attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's no longer okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this B is interesting as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're placing an order through that
platform, you have to be aware of which
[SPEAKER_00]: retailer it's coming from and their
license number prior to buying the
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that you go through the whole
system and it's this blind process where
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on platform XYZ going through it and I
bought a product and then at the end when
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the receipt I'm like oh this
actually came from this dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to know before you buy the
product which dispensary is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: supplying that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well there's a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it is interesting in this case
because I highlighted at the top,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean where the onus is placed is
something that I like to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it's the licensed retailer
microbusiness has to ensure that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: visible enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes it interesting that you then
begin to question the fine legal minds of
[SPEAKER_00]: is it not the platform's responsibility to
make sure that information is visible or
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the retailer's responsibility to make
sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's more about consumer safety.
[SPEAKER_07]: So consumers know where they're getting
products from and if something bad happens
[SPEAKER_07]: with a product or if there's some other
non-compliance that's a threat to public
[SPEAKER_07]: health, the BCC has a record and they can
go up that trail to know where the product
[SPEAKER_07]: came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean and that's something I like to
remember is that as much as like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bureau of Cannabis Control is you know the
agency we're kind of most familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe in the industry that they're housed
under the Department of Consumer Affairs
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Department of Consumer Affairs
like you know reason for being is to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect consumers from deceptive or
misleading advertising and public safety
[SPEAKER_00]: in those aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of when you're going through the
statement of reasons one of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes up consistently with the BCC is
that there was confusion around this and
[SPEAKER_00]: when people are reporting how is this
person doing this they don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: license I don't understand I don't know
where this product came from that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're responding to is that visibility
on the consumer side of who am I getting
[SPEAKER_00]: this from where do I come from and
ultimately it's going to be important for
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry because when we move into you
know our litigious future and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with product liability consumer
reliability all of that information has to
[SPEAKER_00]: be apparent for the consumer of who did I
get this and where did it come from.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it goes back to their
overarching theme which is they don't want
[SPEAKER_07]: unlicensed people engaged in commercial
cannabis activity so it's really showing
[SPEAKER_07]: that these technology platforms aren't the
ones who are the licensed entities aren't
[SPEAKER_07]: the ones who are filling orders aren't the
ones who are delivering they're not doing
[SPEAKER_07]: commercial cannabis activity the onus is
to make sure it's clear to the public to
[SPEAKER_07]: the customer where they're getting a
product from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I mean like we said part of it
I think is the reaction of the agency from
[SPEAKER_00]: the response that they've had when they've
when they've made outreach and enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: efforts or requests of large technology
platforms that their response was well
[SPEAKER_00]: actually we're not under your purview so
have a nice day that they went let me get
[SPEAKER_00]: my pencil out and make that not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will always give diplomacy goes a
long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just maybe don't pick a street fight just
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and this is the last piece of that is
that even on the required sales invoices
[SPEAKER_00]: and receipts again that you have to
disclose that license retailer and the
[SPEAKER_07]: life already there in the delivery right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that's exactly that that was in
record keeping requirements anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just let's keep talking about delivery
because there's a few more things on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other aspect of delivery I didn't drop
the slide in here and but but one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that did stay is that you can
deliver to any municipality municipality
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not they have a ban.
[SPEAKER_00]: That piece is still in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state is hanging tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: They believe that it has you know that
access must be preserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see what happens with that what
the League of Cities response is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the DCC is sticking by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did make some alterations to what
we've been calling the dynamic piece of it
[SPEAKER_00]: which is that it had gone up in that
revision so that you could carry ten
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand dollars worth of product in a
delivery vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could drive around the block until you
got a call if you get if you got an order
[SPEAKER_00]: within half an hour while the rest of the
industry goes through extraordinary
[SPEAKER_00]: security measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lone delivery driver could make an order
in their trunk in the middle of a public
[SPEAKER_00]: road.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got some responses about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got some responses so they've scaled
it back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you can't have value in excess of
five thousand dollars at any time in a
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery vehicle and that the value of the
goods carried in the vehicle that was not
[SPEAKER_00]: received and processed by the licensee
prior to the delivery departing can exceed
[SPEAKER_00]: three thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty much you have to have if I'm
doing the math right because so many of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things hurt my brain you have to
have a two thousand dollar set of
[SPEAKER_00]: prepackaged orders to leave and you can
have three thousand dollars of additional
[SPEAKER_00]: inventory in the car as a delivery driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do multiple stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can leave with those two thousand
dollars of orders set and then continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: get orders on the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean look at this section carefully
there's still more record keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements and the inventory log
requirements and there's more finesse to
[SPEAKER_00]: how this has to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but this is the amount of retail cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the retail value of the products in
the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh dear what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another beautiful one is that a vehicle
used in the delivery can't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: markings or other indication on the
exterior of the vehicle that may indicate
[SPEAKER_00]: they're a delivery employee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not have been the best idea ever to
be like the Geek Squad driving around
[SPEAKER_00]: being like come over I got weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so they're saying pretty much please
don't drive around advertising your
[SPEAKER_00]: vehicle industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This part is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been some confusion around this
fully enclosed box was added to clarify
[SPEAKER_00]: that no portion of the enclosed box
container cage can be comprised of any
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the vehicle or the trailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also mirrored in distribution
vehicles because what was happening is
[SPEAKER_00]: people you know got a Sprinter van and
they dropped a cage in the back and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like it's a cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the state is clarifying for better or
for worse that the security on the inside
[SPEAKER_00]: of the vehicle has to be its own cage like
that it can't you can't be using the sides
[SPEAKER_00]: of the car or caging in the vehicle
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be a distinct fully enclosed
little lock box inside of your vehicle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't that make it easier for someone
who wants to steal this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has to be bolted to your vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean there's again read the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that it has to actually be bolted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but but it can't be that you just put
welding inside of you know the back of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you open the door they want that
secondary thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nobody just cuts through your door
opens the side door and there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a this is a new big record
keeping piece for delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some technology platforms that I know are
ready for this which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at all times you had to identify where
your drivers were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the BCC walked in and they go
where's all your drivers you had to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to pull it up and identify them on
GPS immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you also have to document the history
of all locations traveled to by a delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: employer why while they're delivering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want in that history that turn by
turn history of where they went and what
[SPEAKER_00]: they did and what their route was now
falls under that 90 day record keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're looking at your GPS you
know delivery platform technologies that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be your new question is do you
have turn by turn you know coordinates
[SPEAKER_00]: that are stored for 90 days for every
delivery driver and where they went and
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that helps with that dynamic piece as
well because again I mean so much of what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're up against is obviously like in an
industry such as this that is pervaded by
[SPEAKER_00]: so much stigma and fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way we get out of this is through
total transparency.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to know who it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where'd you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who did you talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were you wearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to know everything that we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is just another clarifying thing
and another record keeping requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this one so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while transportation by means of
aircraft watercraft drone rail human
[SPEAKER_00]: powered vehicle or unmanned vehicle is
prohibited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can now deliver to Catalina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so you know you can distribute to
Catalina.
[SPEAKER_00]: They threw that one in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be interesting because
obviously to go to Catalina you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: pass through either federal airspace or
federal water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also loving the fact that like
there is not a single auto ferry that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: to Catalina.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're trying to fulfill your
distribution requirements with a
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution vehicle and you can't put
your truck on a boat to take it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: island somebody's going to have to hand
carry which isn't allowed.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the VIN number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who leases that boat and does the Coast
Guard know who that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know it takes approximately like
20 years to get a vehicle like authorized
[SPEAKER_00]: on Catalina.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't like cars coming there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if there's an available
compliant distribution vehicle on Catalina
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm sure somebody will figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as I always say if the cannabis
industry is one thing it's wily and smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will find a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that they've given us permission we're
going to Catalina.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was another doozy for some brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure this came under the marketing
cannabis goods as alcoholic products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot do it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter if they have it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't advertise them as cannabis beer
or wine or vodka or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: A spirit wine or beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously this just this entire you know
businesses are decimated in this
[SPEAKER_00]: confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be interested in saying that you
know and this again comes under that
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer affairs part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The claim in this case is that it's a
matter of confusion and they don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers to be confused that this
non-alcoholized cannabis beer maybe is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually beer.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why some of them out there are
using terms like hoppy water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoppy water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sparkly water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean but that will also I imagine be
a matter of interpretation of you know
[SPEAKER_00]: again like when you were saying what are
what are these terms of knowing like how
[SPEAKER_00]: much confusion in it is like if it's a can
with a pop top and it has hops is that too
[SPEAKER_00]: close to beer for somebody or what is the
interest behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people are working on that
talking to the agencies because part of
[SPEAKER_00]: this process too is just getting more
clarity from the agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they afraid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's lobbying for what.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like how do we fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a lesson in kneecapping your
sales 101 which is some other additions
[SPEAKER_00]: that they made.
[SPEAKER_00]: This part has you know been of concern to
me for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously the state kind of put forth this
thing on the sale of non-cannabis goods in
[SPEAKER_00]: response to a lot of it was the CVD hemp
products and saying like no no no all you
[SPEAKER_00]: can sell is cannabis goods and cannabis
accessories in your shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've now expanded that to cannabis
goods cannabis accessories and branded in
[SPEAKER_00]: your own branded merchandise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if this is their intent but
it seems crazy to me that you can no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer sell Jack Herrera's The Emperor
Wears No Clothes in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot sell educational books about
cannabis in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't sell Nag Champa in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: This prohibition and this is just my
personal concern is that in an industry
[SPEAKER_00]: where on one hand now we're allowing
delivery to go to any municipality
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of a ban and then you have a
retailer who is only allowed to do
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis transactions period and cannot
enliven that retail experience with any
[SPEAKER_00]: other cultural commodity that they may
want to include in their store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't sell crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't sell art.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't sell records.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do anything except sell cannabis
cannabis accessories and your own branded
[SPEAKER_00]: promotional merchandise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to clarify a dab rig would be an
accessory because you use it to smoke but
[SPEAKER_04]: a book on cannabis would not be an
accessory.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can register as a cannabis accessory
but that is an area where I would
[SPEAKER_00]: desperately encourage comments and
clarifications from the agency because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not sure that there I think the intent is
one place but the fallout is another.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean obviously lots of operators segment
their space in their business so they have
[SPEAKER_00]: their cannabis space over here and then
they have a regular retail space over here
[SPEAKER_00]: because why would they pay taxes on
selling books and incense and stuff when
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have to within their license
premises.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is I mean obviously you guys know
there's so many beautiful amazing you know
[SPEAKER_00]: experience oriented dispensaries that sell
you know essential oils and others you
[SPEAKER_00]: know in other aspects that aren't
necessarily cannabis at all but encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: you to make the trip and go to this place.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also a tax strategy for retailers
because separate streams of revenues
[SPEAKER_07]: aren't counted for I-280E so a lot of
retailers have adopted holistic wellness
[SPEAKER_07]: shops within their retail space or another
you know type of business to have that
[SPEAKER_07]: separate revenue to make rent and other
things employees deductible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just you think this clause is a direct
reaction from this BC to people selling
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay so they're basically throwing the
baby out with the bath water just because
[SPEAKER_00]: they feel that one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because you can't sell hemp you also
can't sell Doritos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all gone you know and I think that's
a challenge especially as brick and mortar
[SPEAKER_00]: retailers work to distinguish themselves
as a destination in contrast to delivery
[SPEAKER_00]: models where it's more just transactionary
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's that question of why are
people going to make the trip ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: and that so much of that usually has to do
with the education the experience and the
[SPEAKER_00]: ancillary things that are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they also added some definitions one of
them is the promotional materials which
[SPEAKER_00]: you know is they had to add that for
clarity because distributors are allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: to transport them and retailers are it's
the one thing you're allowed to give away
[SPEAKER_00]: is promotional materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very limited definition it can
have no intrinsic or secondary value a
[SPEAKER_00]: battery is not a promotional material
lighter is not a promotional material it's
[SPEAKER_00]: literally the fliers and information that
goes with the product you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also because they love to insert
themselves in processes created a new
[SPEAKER_00]: definition for branded merchandise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is clothing hats pencils pins
keychains mugs water bottles beverage
[SPEAKER_00]: glasses notepads lanyards cannabis
accessories.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not that it other types of
merchandise approved by the bureau.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is this process now of approval
of having your branded merchandise that
[SPEAKER_00]: has to be approved by the bureau.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to challenge all of you to
troll the agency by making up the most
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous branded merchandise and
submitting it for approval every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can think of all sorts of crazy things I
want to propose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they outline this process for branded
merchandise approved for approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to sell something that is
not clothing hats pencils pins keychains
[SPEAKER_00]: mugs water bottles beverage glasses
notepads lanyards or cannabis accessories.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to receive written approval from
the bureau before you sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't start selling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this great idea start selling and
then send it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need that approval in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to send them a picture of the
item and get written approval and to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and I love their statement of reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: They clarify that the approval has to be
obtained in writing to avoid confusion
[SPEAKER_00]: about whether they approved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that is the definition of
Ouroboros like a snake eating its own
[SPEAKER_00]: tail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like so you know just in case you
thought there was anything you could
[SPEAKER_00]: advertise for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please just stop saying free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just eliminate it from your vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They doubled down more in the in the
readopt of the first proposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got this edition of the buy one get one
free free product with any donation and
[SPEAKER_00]: contest sweepstakes and raffles no go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they've included you shall not
advertise free cannabis goods or giveaways
[SPEAKER_00]: of any type of product including
non-cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you can't even say come to the
store and get a free t-shirt come to the
[SPEAKER_00]: store and get a free lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it but you can't say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well discount coupons I would say is not
buy one get one free.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you don't say buy one get one
free on the coupon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a free product with a donation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes but you will run into other issues
because there are other issues with
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising the price of an item as I
understand with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have to parse these with the rest
of the advertising regulations because
[SPEAKER_00]: there there was other specifics about
things that and a lot of this runs into
[SPEAKER_00]: because we like to keep it complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have to look at your local
ordinances for what advertising is like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's certain local ordinances that will
prohibit you from advertising price
[SPEAKER_00]: showing a picture of a cannabis plant like
there's certain things you cannot do in
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very restrictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again I would encourage everyone to try to
be as compliant as possible with
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising because if you look at models
like Nevada and they're incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: stringent advertising restrictions where
much like our branded merchandise here
[SPEAKER_00]: every single advertisement in Nevada has
to be approved by the bureau by the
[SPEAKER_00]: agency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't I mean I would imagine every
magazine is a quarterly because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know how they would have time to like be
like approve every single every single
[SPEAKER_00]: advertiser has a registered agent card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single advertiser has to be verified
as a licensed business so if and clearly
[SPEAKER_00]: from looking at the technology platform
language Lori Ajax got her hands on some
[SPEAKER_00]: of that Nevada regulation so if they just
keep going they're gonna get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising part and we might see more
stringency in those areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not put any language in about a
fee for those so we would hope that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporated in the licensing fees which
also went up you know so we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stop saying free.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no free samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always love to point out there's some
discrepancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of is like a deep dive because if
you're a Los Angeles person you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: BCC says you can't give free cannabis
goods to anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's been extended a little bit or
actually that that's you cannot provide
[SPEAKER_00]: free cannabis goods except for in the very
limited medical card scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Business and professions code says you
can't give away any amount of cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis products or any cannabis
accessories as part of a business
[SPEAKER_00]: promotion or commercial activity and Los
Angeles Department of Cannabis regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: says you cannot provide free samples of
any type including cannabis to anybody so
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not allowed to give anybody
anything in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot give away branded merchandise
that I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in LA free samples of any type
including cannabis goods
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a different story altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean an exit bag is now a mandatory
thing that you have to give everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that they consider that
branded merchandise but that would be an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting clarifying point to make with
them to say do you have to have those
[SPEAKER_00]: approved considering that it's something
walking out the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always I always think though from a
legal perspective I love this definition
[SPEAKER_00]: in the definitions of free cannabis goods
it says it means any amount of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: goods provided to any person without cost
or payment or exchange of any other thing
[SPEAKER_00]: of value.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting phrase to me of like
what is another thing of value because I
[SPEAKER_00]: would think that there may be an argument
somewhere that like getting somebody's
[SPEAKER_00]: email address is a thing of value from a
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having somebody join your you know
membership VIP program is a thing of
[SPEAKER_00]: value.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that anybody's really gone
down that road of arguing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's there and just remember that it's
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were if you were interested in
compassion or equity programs they added
[SPEAKER_00]: equity one word.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all the comments about compassionate
use obviously SB 829 the Wienerville
[SPEAKER_00]: passed in Senate wasn't signed by the
governor so we didn't get the tax relief
[SPEAKER_00]: for compassion programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bradfordville SB 1294 did get passed
and signed the California Cannabis Equity
[SPEAKER_00]: Act of 2018 which gives a fund to begin to
help to facilitate local programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean this is an area of interesting
confusion for me and implementation as
[SPEAKER_00]: well to say that in addition to the free
cannabis goods which is giving to the card
[SPEAKER_00]: holders in the city that a licensee may
donate cannabis goods in the use of
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment in compliance with any local
compassionate use equity or similar
[SPEAKER_00]: programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be that this is yet another
indication of where we need to work at the
[SPEAKER_00]: local level for having those compassion
programs and equity programs actually
[SPEAKER_00]: clarified and implemented since it does
seem to give us some sort of ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: interface and provide services to those
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So continuing how's everybody doing you
guys doing all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much I want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what time it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Back to the giving things out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when a distributor comes in we receive
an order and they will give some sample
[SPEAKER_08]: products.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we able to give those to management
for some of those samples?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean that's where it gets confusing
because they give you these free samples
[SPEAKER_08]: and is there a way that we need to write
down who they're going to?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean short answer no.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are manufacturing and distribution
companies that are getting or
[SPEAKER_00]: contemplating getting delivery licenses
retail delivery licenses so that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: compliantly deliver product to their own
staff because that's one of the areas
[SPEAKER_00]: because the state has felt so shackled by
this no free product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that the entire back end sales process
was something that was seemingly ignored.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are really difficult mechanisms that
people are going through in terms of those
[SPEAKER_00]: basic questions of sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does a manufacturer seeking a
distributor entice that distributor to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with them when they can't give them a
sample until it's gone all the way through
[SPEAKER_00]: the distribution chain and been approved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously everybody right now is doing
all of their crafty work arounds and
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking that they've managed this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my concern is that a lot of those work
arounds will be incredibly difficult once
[SPEAKER_00]: track and trace turns on because there's
not going to be a category for oh I gave
[SPEAKER_00]: it to my staff or what did I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those kind of fundamental aspects of
the supply chain, how business is done,
[SPEAKER_00]: how employees get educated about products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it would be preposterous in another
market to think that you go into a wine
[SPEAKER_00]: bar and you ask the wine guy what do you
recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not allowed to, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's read the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean obviously we're in a process of
baby steps.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in order to be compliant when those
samples come to us, what do we do with
[SPEAKER_08]: those?
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not supposed to come anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wouldn't come for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd come documented and billed and put
on your thing because you need paper for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's in the manifest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very interesting thing that I find,
and this is where some of the agencies are
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead of others, the CNETFA, the tax
agency, actually has a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptive tax scheme for a product that
is given to a retailer or buyer and
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed and never makes it to retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to recognize that that scenario
exists and they're like and this is how
[SPEAKER_00]: you deal with the taxes for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like many things, I mean in cannabis
in LA, the tax agency was way ahead of the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like absolutely, you can pay us
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, that's what people hire lawyers
and compliance people to do is to be like
[SPEAKER_00]: how do I map a compliant process that's
going to stand up to track and trace,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to satisfy the state's
requirements, and that can actually allow
[SPEAKER_00]: me to move things to the supply chain in
the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the concern that I have now and
then I'll keep moving through because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's more I want to say, but the
concern that I have now is, and not just
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm a compliance consultant,
but it's difficult for people to
[SPEAKER_00]: prioritize compliance when they're just
trying to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like where obviously everybody's just like
I'm just trying to keep the doors open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time to make sure that I'm
papering this process correctly or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as friendly as the agents may seem
when they come to check out your place,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be like these are not your
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have five years to levy penalties and
fines against things that you did day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tax agency has said they absolutely
will go back and audit year one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The record-keeping requirements for
cannabis companies went into effect back
[SPEAKER_00]: on January 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone that was feeling that they had
all this leeway because they're like oh
[SPEAKER_00]: well track and trace isn't on so I can do
that, I'm going to bring in this product,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they show up and they're like okay we
need to review your records audit for like
[SPEAKER_00]: for this year, the question is like what
position is that going to put you in and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll get to it at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see the cultivation department put
in their penalties for record-keeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: The operational penalty for working
without a license maxes out at $5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're operating without a license
it's a severe infraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously you can get your license for
whatever, but the fine is $5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the record-keeping section of
administrative failures, the max fine is
[SPEAKER_00]: $30,000 per instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are not kidding about
record-keeping and it sounds so boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the hardest thing in this moment to
convince people that this is something you
[SPEAKER_00]: should be thinking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just quickly, is it too late do you think
to request that change where the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: industry says look we get, you don't want
us to give consumers free samples,
[SPEAKER_04]: but can we have some pathway to the B2B?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's never too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The final regs aren't final.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is always going to be an evolving
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too late in terms of I think
everybody should comment on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be on record.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your voice should be heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a public record.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to document our existence and our
feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the glimmers of hope that a lot
of people are looking to as well is in
[SPEAKER_00]: November we're going to have a new
governor and we are going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: governor most likely that really supports
the cannabis industry and supports
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you have the option of where this
regulatory tweaking period will end.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't over by a long shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 70 bills that are going to be
introduced on cannabis in January or more
[SPEAKER_00]: probably by the time we get to January.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a huge amount of legislative
change that can happen as well and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the more master strokes that we
need is somebody to go in and really
[SPEAKER_00]: correct some of the things that were
caused in the drafting of MACRSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean anybody knows me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like one of my big pet peeves is like AMA
was an adult use bill with a 15% excise
[SPEAKER_00]: tax that got combined with a medical
program and put an adult excise tax on
[SPEAKER_00]: medical goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: How that happened I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that should be undone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of areas where people
are working to change those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing that I'll say is that
for this very moment we're sitting in
[SPEAKER_00]: right here these are not the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are still the proposed rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still have 12 days of comments a new
introduction of a draft.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's incredibly difficult I understand
as operators to be like what am I supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you're trying to make packaging
and they keep changing every aspect of it
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the next thing we'll cover really
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult to be that responsive but
it's also you know it's unfortunately the
[SPEAKER_00]: race that we're in is having to be that
nimble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may have seen that CRP is back sort
of not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they kind of entered this halfway thing
where so now prior to January 2020 it has
[SPEAKER_00]: to be tamper evident but it doesn't have
to be child resistant or resealable unless
[SPEAKER_00]: if you go to the Department of Public
Health where if it has multiple uses then
[SPEAKER_00]: it does have to be resealable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after then starting in 2020 it's
going to have to be that resealable tamper
[SPEAKER_00]: evident and child resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until that day the Department of Public
Health says you can meet those packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements through the use of an exit
bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of I was talking to somebody
from the Department of Public Health about
[SPEAKER_00]: this because it's almost like you know we
had the environmental argument of like oh
[SPEAKER_00]: my god it's too much packaging or the
industry is not ready and this is terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we have the oh my god I don't
want to do exit bags or why don't we just
[SPEAKER_00]: do it that way and now it seems they just
did all of it at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're going to have literally
literally all cannabis goods purchased by
[SPEAKER_00]: a consumer can't leave the premises unless
they're in an opaque exit package which
[SPEAKER_00]: prior to January 2020 has to be resealable
child resistant and opaque.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we find ourselves in the Kafkaesque
world in which child resistant packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be put in a child resistant
exit bag to leave the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of our worst feelers are being
realized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after 2020 you know you can have
tote bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and they did clarify that immature
plants and seeds don't have to be shoved
[SPEAKER_00]: into an exit bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please comment on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean anybody that was coming at this
from the I mean Peter the Future Campus
[SPEAKER_00]: Project had an event talking about the
becoming ecological disaster and lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: sense that it has that in a state where we
outlaw plastic bags and straws we're like
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're going to package the shit out of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that now and then honestly now that
the problem has been even duplicated like
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's difficult because that's what I
was talking about to the Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Health is the last thing I want is more
onus put on a retailer who has to have
[SPEAKER_00]: both tote bags and exit bags and be like
is this child resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know which one do I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So putting it all in exit bags fine but
but it's super messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of there's a big
packaging lobbies that are kind of drove
[SPEAKER_00]: this change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was going to be exit bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was going to be like you know what
we'll just do exit bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the packaging lobby was like we
need packaging you think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again this is one of the I had a great
conversation with the Department of Public
[SPEAKER_00]: Health about unfortunately we're up
against this timeline because the
[SPEAKER_00]: emergency regs are going to expire.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to have permanent regulations
and we're going to have to continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: work on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for the packaging at least from
the Department of Public Health there
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to be this kind of openness to this
is an area that's going to require more
[SPEAKER_00]: nuance than we have time for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a one size fits all solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pie in the sky fantasy I think the
first place for us to really pull back
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging is not going to be on edibles
because there's just too many freakish ly
[SPEAKER_00]: terrified people who think they're going
to eat a blueberry and jump off a balcony
[SPEAKER_00]: or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is in the flower market because the
flower is the part that's just insane to
[SPEAKER_00]: think that it's all being prepackaged in
this incredibly onerous tiny little
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the arguments that I've made to
the department is even in the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical model when you go to CVS
the big drug companies ship bulk powders
[SPEAKER_00]: and pills to CVS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pharmacist fills your prescription
and puts it in a little bottle and gives
[SPEAKER_00]: it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a tracked and traced process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we have track and trace I think
that is an area where we will be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate a huge swath of packaging
because once they have visibility on every
[SPEAKER_00]: single gram of cannabis that's moving
through the system there is no reason we
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot return to that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for years I've been talking to them
about when they think about products
[SPEAKER_00]: moving through the chain they're thinking
about beers and cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're thinking about things with
shelf lives and just standardized
[SPEAKER_00]: processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the case of flower I keep telling
them you need to think about a tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to think about how many people do
you want to touch your tomato before you
[SPEAKER_00]: get to eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you go to the grocery store you
don't just go up to the guy at the counter
[SPEAKER_00]: and be like I want a tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like to see the freaking tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like to go I like that apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an experience and again that's one
of the possible distinguishing things that
[SPEAKER_00]: would support brick and mortar retailers
and the ability to be like I want to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the store because I want to choose the
exact flower that I want to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they seem receptive to that but who
knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's something I think
that's an easy win because the other thing
[SPEAKER_00]: is from the public safety perspective if a
kid gets into a bag of flour and eats it
[SPEAKER_00]: who cares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like nothing's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well this is a big question that I have in
terms of where that liability lies because
[SPEAKER_00]: if they show up in your retail
establishment and you have improperly
[SPEAKER_00]: packaged labeled products on your shelf
they may seize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be like this is this is not
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of when we see you know they've
they've moved from the friendly like tear
[SPEAKER_00]: off sheet warning to like certified
letters now of like it notices to comply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've gone to like stern letter
writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think in January we will start to
see the actual levying of penalties and
[SPEAKER_00]: fines for some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the most egregious things that
they've actually done fines for so far has
[SPEAKER_00]: been when people don't allow you if you
don't let them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get a fine to be like no you
can't come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean this is why internal compliance
programs are so important because now that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've added this aspect of you can
reject a shipment if it's not packaged and
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled correctly it suggests to me that
some of that onus is going to be on the
[SPEAKER_00]: retailer because you never should have
taken it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't have accepted that product
if it's not labeled correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why everybody should have their
packaging and labeling checklist for when
[SPEAKER_00]: the product arrives you sit there and you
go through all of those labeling
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to add one thing to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have started doing it and they're a
little bit more than just stern letter
[SPEAKER_07]: writing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's like the one step you're like
this is your final warning before we bring
[SPEAKER_07]: disciplinary against you.
[SPEAKER_07]: They ask you to come up with a plan of
correction how you're going to address
[SPEAKER_07]: this and ensure it's not going to happen
again.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you fail to respond to them there
may be discipline.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're not satisfied with your
response there could be discipline.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not something to brush aside and
we've dealt with them already at this
[SPEAKER_07]: point a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know the one lesson is that an
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of
[SPEAKER_07]: pure because as soon as you get that
notice to comply in the mail you're going
[SPEAKER_07]: to be calling up your lawyer saying hey I
got this in the mail I need to respond to
[SPEAKER_07]: it and they're going to be asking you for
a $10,000 retainer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Start looking at these issues now before
the regulators are coming to your door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah it's a lot cheaper to work with me
than to have that moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing is they don't give you
a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those notices to comply say you have 15
days to inform us that this is fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just tell us how you're going to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 15 days to say it's done,
the product's gone, stuff is disposed,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is how I corrected it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and not just say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't just say like we did a training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have to document those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's all sorts of aspects of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I call this the CDP headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you notice in the CDPH
regulations the Department of Public
[SPEAKER_00]: Health manufacturing they were just
confusing as all get out because they did
[SPEAKER_00]: this awesome thing where instead of just
putting all the regulations in one place
[SPEAKER_00]: they put asterisks for the parts that
weren't changed and just didn't print them
[SPEAKER_00]: at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if it was added then it was in
blue and if it was removed it was in red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know you got all these calls of
people being like oh there's no more
[SPEAKER_00]: security requirements or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like no no you got to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So literally you had to have the old
version and the new version to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: what changed and then go back and
reference the parts that weren't changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first ask for them is could you
please just put it all in one document
[SPEAKER_00]: because that would be a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The packaging was the kind of one of the
biggest ones that's getting the most
[SPEAKER_00]: attention for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when 2020 kicks in there's going
to be all of these packaging requirements
[SPEAKER_00]: that kick in and even a new labeling piece
in 2020 which is if a package is not
[SPEAKER_00]: intended to be inhaled or the ones that
are intended to be inhaled and aren't or
[SPEAKER_00]: topicals and aren't child resistant after
opened it has to say this package is not
[SPEAKER_00]: child resistant after opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were worried about your labeling
real estate now you got one more line to
[SPEAKER_00]: stick in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did get a little more clear on the
definition of child resistance because
[SPEAKER_00]: people were just like is this baggy OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is a lot more clarity in
terms of what they are going to consider
[SPEAKER_00]: child resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved the addition that speaks so much
this one word that came in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: product quantity equality of homogeneity
because homogeneity is like the bane of
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evidently the testing labs are telling the
manufacturers you guys are not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: At homogeneity it's causing a lot of
problems and testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of indications that the
Department of Public Health is really
[SPEAKER_00]: drilling into those good manufacturing
processes and making sure that people
[SPEAKER_00]: really know how to make a food grade
consistent product and the master
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know they kind of inserted a little
more information about that homogeneity
[SPEAKER_00]: word coming up which is mitigating through
against the potential for adulteration
[SPEAKER_00]: through incorporation of correct amounts
of cannabinoid unintended ingredients
[SPEAKER_00]: hazards in the product quality plan
potential for misbranding through
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporation of ingredients not
identified on the label or the mislabeling
[SPEAKER_00]: of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't make a slide for that for this
but they now reference out to like the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal FDA regulations for ingredients
for how you mark artificial ingredients
[SPEAKER_00]: natural flavor these kind of aspects of
what are the federal requirements for
[SPEAKER_00]: disclosure of those ingredients because
you know people who are like it's cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and apples or you have to kind of get a
little more clear on a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all will see manufacturers out there
will soon be very familiar with the health
[SPEAKER_00]: and safety code if you're not already
they've added 21 references to the health
[SPEAKER_00]: and safety code now pointing out mostly it
was you know they articulated in their in
[SPEAKER_00]: their summary that it's they're revising
the good manufacturing processes to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide greater clarity to the process and
documentation required when making
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis products and really went deep on
on pointing to the health and safety code
[SPEAKER_00]: on 21 different points saying you need to
follow these guidelines for how to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: these requirements of good manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of it is in that 402 40 grounds
building and manufacturing premises
[SPEAKER_00]: section that's the section that has the
lion's share so this was a big one that a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people I know missed because it
seems simple but it's super lame in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've changed the language from business
days to calendar days in the case of
[SPEAKER_00]: things such as if you lose connectivity
with the track and trace system and the
[SPEAKER_00]: system goes down for a couple weeks and
you have to log everything is on paper and
[SPEAKER_00]: you still have those three days to insert
all your information those are now three
[SPEAKER_00]: calendar days not three business days so
if connectivity comes back up on a Friday
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be paying overtime for the
weekend for everybody to insert all of
[SPEAKER_00]: your documentation so in many cases and
especially I'm thinking about farmers up
[SPEAKER_00]: north these were tight timelines anyway of
having to report every change in
[SPEAKER_00]: disposition of your flowering into track
and trace within three days and now those
[SPEAKER_00]: three business days are three calendar
days so even something as small as that
[SPEAKER_00]: has a huge impact on these timelines a lot
of it is that that track and trace
[SPEAKER_00]: training now is required in five calendar
days of license issuance so if you get
[SPEAKER_00]: that license on a Friday two of your days
are done you know if you're not working
[SPEAKER_00]: through the weekend so it's it's really
critical yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not I mean it doesn't look like
they don't know if they had they did not
[SPEAKER_00]: add a definition of calendar day in which
are exempted from those calendar days so
[SPEAKER_00]: again if I may highlight a really simple
one for for commenting to say why why are
[SPEAKER_00]: you doing this the thing that I love and I
wanted to drop it in if I didn't have time
[SPEAKER_00]: is it there's a there's a in one of the
instances where it's the agency's onus to
[SPEAKER_00]: respond to something theirs is in business
days so the industry has to function on
[SPEAKER_00]: calendar days but the agencies get
business days so it does seem a little
[SPEAKER_00]: unfair what time is it I don't have a
clock okay okay I'm almost there I think
[SPEAKER_00]: so there's so much in cultivation there
was some other clarifications that were
[SPEAKER_00]: made one of the big ones was on areas that
cannot be shared by multiple licensees
[SPEAKER_00]: again people who have been doing licensee
licensing this may not come as a surprise
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's additional clarification was made
of that you cannot share these areas and
[SPEAKER_00]: then more clarity around shared areas that
have to be contiguous and and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: designation is for what's happening there
this has been something that many of us
[SPEAKER_00]: you know who have undergone the audits
from them have seen coming they added in
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation plan requirements assigned
attestation that says you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: contact the appropriate County
Agricultural Commission Commissioner
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding requirements for legal use of
pesticides this is when the CDFA has been
[SPEAKER_00]: coming with the County Ag Commissioner
they want to know do you have your
[SPEAKER_00]: applicator license in your operator ID so
all of the cultivators have to be going
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to get your you have to take a
class you got to read a book you got to do
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff you have to get your applicator
license in your operator ID and the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have now gone to put this into
signing an attestation to say you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it means that they I mean they're
seeing a lot of non-compliance in this
[SPEAKER_00]: area that people are dragging their heels
and not doing it and this is the one I was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about the importance of
record-keeping just to look at that
[SPEAKER_00]: section in the administrative actions on
record-keeping the licensee can be subject
[SPEAKER_00]: to a citation and fine which may be issued
as a notice of violation of up to $30,000
[SPEAKER_00]: per individual violation for
record-keeping for engaging in commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis without an unlicensed without a
license or with an unlicensed person
[SPEAKER_00]: that's five grand for record-keeping it
can be up to $30,000 per instance so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's my ad for compliance more fun stuff
so this is all right so we all knew that
[SPEAKER_00]: the temporary program was expiring on
December 31st what is kind of interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: news in their thing is that once the new
proposed regulations are accepted in early
[SPEAKER_00]: January the Bureau is no longer accepting
temporary license applications when those
[SPEAKER_00]: go into effect so pretty much in this
interpretation of this we lose the last
[SPEAKER_00]: possible three weeks of December to hope
that you get that temporary license
[SPEAKER_00]: application in and you can get that you
know New Year's Eve thing so they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not gonna accept it there seemed
to be some confusion Lori was speaking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the event yesterday and she's like I'm
gonna be doing licenses and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: take it to the last minute you know so
we'll see because what it says is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not gonna accept it so we'll have
to hope that those those temporary
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses get in because obviously if you
do not have a temporary license by the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the year you do not qualify for the
provisional license program so
[SPEAKER_00]: especially finishing CEQA and stuff like
that that will become a very long process
[SPEAKER_00]: for those who are not able to operate
through that process and make any income
[SPEAKER_00]: until they get their annual permit at that
goodbye teen plants market so the the BCC
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced a new definition of immature
plant which is anything over 18 inches I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of questions about this one
because they say it's necessary because
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't have a definition so they made
one up doesn't happen to be the same as
[SPEAKER_00]: the CDF a's definition so that's cool so
my questions around this would be if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a retailer and you've taken in some
plants and they grow tall what do you do
[SPEAKER_00]: with them you have to destroy them you
can't give them back you can't sell them
[SPEAKER_00]: to anybody you can't you know you can't
send them back to a cultivator to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice prosperous life as an adult plant so
this you know for that that market of you
[SPEAKER_00]: know teenage plants that some people like
that's too bad and goodbye this is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually sort of a positive thing the
14-day reconciliation was replaced with a
[SPEAKER_00]: 30-day reconciliation so that mandatory
track-and-trace requirement of reconciling
[SPEAKER_00]: every 14 days is now at least once every
30 calendar days and there was also a
[SPEAKER_00]: slight rise in the definition of a
significant discrepancy in inventory it
[SPEAKER_00]: used to be five thousand dollars or two
percent of your average daily sales and
[SPEAKER_00]: now five thousand is struck and it's three
percent of your average um monthly sales
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry it was whichever is less but they
took out the five thousand so so now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just three percent three percent yeah or
two percent or whatever's left they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like it just they're just making it up
somebody's like who knows um a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people were responding to this one added
to premises location that shipping
[SPEAKER_00]: containers not affixed to the land are not
any are no longer permitted as a structure
[SPEAKER_00]: is not considered a permanent structure
modular buildings not affixed to the land
[SPEAKER_00]: structures that rest on wheels or any
structure that can be readily moved there
[SPEAKER_00]: was some panic around this because they're
like oh my god all the pods but part of it
[SPEAKER_00]: is it has to do with that affixing nature
and when you read their statement of
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons it just makes me laugh because you
know somebody's doing it when you read it
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like they saw somebody do that
which is people with trailers that are
[SPEAKER_00]: like moving stuff around and being like
now we're over here and now we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: put it over here so their main thing is
like when you submit a premises diagram
[SPEAKER_00]: those structures need to stay where they
are but you can't move them around so
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a little more clarity around
pre-rolls that that you know it had said
[SPEAKER_00]: that they could do it now it's just a
little more clear that the distributor can
[SPEAKER_00]: package repackage label and relabel
cannabis including pre-rolls for retail
[SPEAKER_00]: sale as we were discussing there's more
questions risen because you're like whose
[SPEAKER_00]: brand is it is it their bread what do you
do what are you labeling it with I have no
[SPEAKER_00]: idea but an important part in the life in
the testing sequence to mark here is the
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed distributor can't process it but
can roll it if it could you know how has
[SPEAKER_00]: that and that they have to be rolled prior
to the compliance testing so it's not yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: boo yeah because I mean I have really
interesting questions on it because like
[SPEAKER_00]: when you sample when you take a
representative sample of pre-rolls out of
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple packets of pre-rolls you can't
then repack those packets into full carton
[SPEAKER_00]: so you're just destroying like oh anyway
it's a lot of I suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't you think wouldn't you imagine
that that would be the case but like as
[SPEAKER_00]: we've seen with some recall efforts and
stuff like that is their concern is that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are getting stuff text tested then
they're mixing it with other stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: then that final stuff is not clearing
testing so I mean this is this is a ripe
[SPEAKER_00]: area for comments it makes very little
sense that if a bulk cannabis bag passes
[SPEAKER_00]: the COA and then you roll it that then you
got to test it again that is the I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what we were talking about is the
the the clarity that needs to be had
[SPEAKER_00]: around that because while you're able to
do that activity if you're a distributor
[SPEAKER_00]: who's buying bulk flour and rolling it
whose brand are you releasing it as is are
[SPEAKER_00]: you do I mean because there I would
imagine there's multiple around
[SPEAKER_00]: arrangements there some you might be doing
it for another existing brand some you
[SPEAKER_00]: might be doing it in-house and then are
they going to consider that crossing into
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacture it's like war that there's a
lot of questions around this yes
[SPEAKER_09]: yeah they're allowed to roll that but I
don't see where they can do anything more
[SPEAKER_09]: than that right if they grind it up and
send it down range to the distributor says
[SPEAKER_09]: he can't process but he can you take that
crappy flour they sprinkle little keep on
[SPEAKER_09]: it and roll it up I'm just trying to see
where that line of manufacturing yeah no
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially if you know there's the
aspect of people doing infused p rolls
[SPEAKER_00]: which is you know that that has to happen
in the grind this is with the
[SPEAKER_00]: clarifications we need yeah
[SPEAKER_09]: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean
honestly it's like it's it's you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: long story short is like California jump
the shark on regulations and we made so
[SPEAKER_00]: many regulations and now they're learning
more about the industry so they have to
[SPEAKER_00]: make more regulations to cover that part
of the industry and it's getting down to
[SPEAKER_00]: every single activity and as I said we're
a wily bunch and we're gonna exploit every
[SPEAKER_00]: loophole there possibly is to be able to
stay alive so so it's constant like this
[SPEAKER_00]: game of whack-a-mole where it's it's you
know we're gonna see a lot of that I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: if I had a magic wand and could wave it I
would have said like can we start with
[SPEAKER_00]: four regulations that's like you know that
protects testing taxes and public safety
[SPEAKER_00]: and just be like let's work from there and
it'll be great but you know now we have
[SPEAKER_00]: this to contend with so it's a lot of yeah
I mean and that's the thing I mean I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember I remember long ago going to test
the the first like license the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: when they were testing out the online
licensing portal and their product
[SPEAKER_00]: categories for cannabis was like five
things and you're just like you guys have
[SPEAKER_00]: no idea do you like they didn't know there
was no like they didn't know I mean the
[SPEAKER_00]: maturity in the sophistication in the
ingenuity of this industry is baffling to
[SPEAKER_00]: them of how many applications there are
and how many things they've had to you
[SPEAKER_00]: know invent to be like what do you do with
a you know what do you do with a breath
[SPEAKER_00]: strip like what do you do with a tincture
that goes under your tongue and it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: capsule that they didn't know that we had
exactly he's a we don't want it there
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a big you know this will help a
lot in testing is that you know there was
[SPEAKER_00]: there was the issue of you know people
sampling you know the lab shopping that
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to not happen where you can't
send samples to multiple labs at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time and take the results that you like
but then we had the problem of what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens when a lab goes down or if a lab
loses their license or if the labs really
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive machinery breaks and then your
products are stuck in this laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: pipeline and there was no mechanism for
lab to transfer that product to another
[SPEAKER_00]: lab for testing or for you to be able to
have another batch sampled so they've
[SPEAKER_00]: corrected that I know the big ask from the
testing community again for these
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations is going to be about COA
remediation because right now if there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: typo if they got the name wrong if
anything happens the agency is like you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't fix it you can't talk about it it's
no good so even if you submit something
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can't read your handwriting
because of the prohibition on
[SPEAKER_00]: communicating with you with that once that
process has started they can't even be
[SPEAKER_00]: like what does this say like what did you
write down here so it's some of that will
[SPEAKER_00]: get cleaned up everybody across the board
is gonna get to do OSHA training yay 30
[SPEAKER_00]: hours of general industry outreach course
is gonna happen good for you OSHA so the
[SPEAKER_00]: main point is like you know be sure to
comment it's absolutely essential for your
[SPEAKER_00]: business it's great to get your your voice
in there if you need help commenting
[SPEAKER_00]: there's incredible trade organizations you
can get with your local trade organization
[SPEAKER_00]: CCIA is gonna be doing comments locally
there's lots of trade organizations and
[SPEAKER_00]: groups and collectives and there's lots of
smart people who will help you I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: give you these these this PowerPoint and
then I'm gonna try to create a hot list of
[SPEAKER_00]: just like again these are the main things
that I would go after it's a real great
[SPEAKER_00]: time to team up and and work collectively
to draft these statements letter it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: great for to have a whole lot of
individuals submitting feedback it's great
[SPEAKER_00]: to pair up and have these NASCAR letters
of get every cultivator you know every
[SPEAKER_00]: dispenser you know to tag on and create
group statements but it's incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: important that the agencies know that
we're we're seeing this we're reading this
[SPEAKER_00]: in the real life impacts that it has on
your business because those are sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: the most compelling things for them is
when you explain what the problem is and
[SPEAKER_00]: how this how this you know harms your
business or your ability to function in
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing when you're commenting always
remember to comment to the right agency if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a micro business don't send your
cultivation issues to the BCC they do not
[SPEAKER_00]: forward they don't send it on that you
make sure that you're aligning the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation with the agency that issued it
and that is who you're commenting to I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I'm done I think that's it yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah the question is you can impose this
on the licensees and that's great but what
[SPEAKER_10]: happens on the other side
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I mean one of the things that it's
important to clarify is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory authority of the agencies is
over licensed operators that's who they
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate that's who they enforce upon in
terms of an unlicensed operator that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: a legal activity at this point so it is on
the local law enforcement working with
[SPEAKER_00]: local law enforcement in the local
agencies to kind of work on those aspects
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah there's an interesting language shift
that that reminds me of it I had it in
[SPEAKER_00]: there the importance of a single word
where in one of the sections that used to
[SPEAKER_00]: say the formation documents and now it's
says all formation documents where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like where they just slip that in there
like they don't want a single contract
[SPEAKER_00]: side deal something that's related to that
business not submitted and and again I
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's ridiculous and I know lawyers
are expensive but like this is a critical
[SPEAKER_00]: time to be looking at having good
contracts with people having good
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution contracts good testing
contracts because the question is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be what happens when something goes wrong
like the question of is it the retailers
[SPEAKER_00]: whose problem is that that would be
something you can know you should
[SPEAKER_00]: negotiate in a distribution contract to
say if the BCC comes and you delivered me
[SPEAKER_00]: non-compliant product guess who's gonna
pay my bill you are you know that those
[SPEAKER_00]: are the things that can be negotiated
obviously for a smaller operator it's
[SPEAKER_00]: tough because you don't have a lot of
power to be like darn you I want this but
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna want to negotiate those good
contracts because one of my big fears is
[SPEAKER_00]: what's gonna happen next year when they
start levying penalties and fees and that
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't see the cannabis industry
cannibalize itself in lawsuits because
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's gonna be blaming everybody
else for what they did and know this is
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong and this is your fault and whatever
and that's the stuff that can be clarified
[SPEAKER_00]: through that those contract processes up
front yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it's an interesting like events is
its own like wormhole you can go down they
[SPEAKER_00]: did make an exception for a kind of
educational events that was put in that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't require a license when there is no
consumption there's no retail sales there
[SPEAKER_00]: those aspects this seems to be an
allowance for that to happen and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean in some of the rules around some of
the events that do have consumption in
[SPEAKER_00]: retail are I mean how anybody's ever gonna
my favorite one in there is that every bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of product that comes in on the transport
that is transported by a distributor is
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to be physically checked by the
event organizer licensee before it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: on premises so load in for high times is
gonna be like a week ahead of advance yet
[SPEAKER_00]: you can only get a permit for four days or
something so it's gonna be a little rough
[SPEAKER_00]: like a compliantly bringing product on
site when those those aspects are so
[SPEAKER_14]: onerous I mean that that kind of gets into
an interesting terrain of like yes there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a way I mean and that's the other thing
too I mean the things that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: panic about in these regulations when you
talk to the lawyers they're like yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: because because again for them it's just a
matter of I mean that's what we do all day
[SPEAKER_00]: long is just going like this is what we
want to do and here's you know here's the
[SPEAKER_00]: winding route to get there and making sure
you're covered yeah I read through the
[SPEAKER_09]: remediation plan
[SPEAKER_09]: asked Lori about remediation when you know
the testing that's wrong my guys are doing
[SPEAKER_09]: informational testing online we know it's
clean the testing that's a sorry you fail
[SPEAKER_09]: wait a second I don't know that I'm clear
whether we can remediation plan look we
[SPEAKER_09]: can prove they're wrong can we get another
test because my product stuck I can't get
[SPEAKER_09]: paid that's the real
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I mean there are a lot of
conversations about that it's I mean part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the issue again is it's always like
with with any regulation you know my motto
[SPEAKER_00]: is always like follow the money follow the
fear you know where you're like who's
[SPEAKER_00]: paying for it and what are they afraid of
so I mean one of the issues with testing
[SPEAKER_00]: in the in the labs are super frustrated
about this as well some of them is because
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing that they want to prevent
through these aspects is lab shopping they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want you you know shopping around to
get the results that you want but but one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the issues with like say a really
really effective lab with really really
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive equipment who's doing an amazing
job is there's going to be inherent lab
[SPEAKER_00]: shopping because if there's this threshold
and you're you're you know solvent or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever is going to be detected at this
lab but it's not going to be detected at
[SPEAKER_00]: this lab because they're in equipment
isn't as sensitive that lab shopping will
[SPEAKER_00]: become inherent because and then you'll
have people gravitating towards crappier
[SPEAKER_00]: labs because they're not going to see the
things that maybe are there so you know
[SPEAKER_00]: some of that the increasing of the
thresholds I mean a lot of labs I mean one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the issues that we're up against is
looking at phase three testing coming in
[SPEAKER_00]: and not even knowing is anything going to
pass you know once heavy metals come into
[SPEAKER_00]: the effect it would come into effect
because this is the part where we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to discover like what are your devices
leaching what is your packaging doing to
[SPEAKER_00]: your product what are giant metal machines
that extract your product putting into
[SPEAKER_00]: your products you know that and that if we
were you know again my pie in the sky
[SPEAKER_00]: fantasies I would love to see the state
subsidizing and funding testing labs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing phase three testing right now so we
would collect the data to know what is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna happen when January 1 hits and and
and then we would love to have a counter
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that was like and while we're at it
let's look at the amount of heavy metals
[SPEAKER_00]: in our banana you know it's like like what
are we up against don't go ahead well I I
[SPEAKER_09]: spend my career the other end where the
insurance companies now trying to figure
[SPEAKER_09]: out who caused this damage in a product I
think brass knuckles started rolling it
[SPEAKER_09]: don't matter what this the state requires
you if you can sue for a product there are
[SPEAKER_09]: rules regulations in case authorities that
it costs you a lot of money you're not
[SPEAKER_09]: looking at how to protect my product and
we're concerned in some of the companies I
[SPEAKER_09]: have of these cheap ass yeah cartridges
from China gonna reach out in real time
[SPEAKER_09]: and that and that's one of my big concerns
for the industry itself because there was
[SPEAKER_00]: not long ago there was a law office
holding a continuing learning class for
[SPEAKER_00]: attorneys on how to sue the cannabis
industry and it was a very long list from
[SPEAKER_00]: things like from product liability to dram
laws to you know that they're gonna come
[SPEAKER_00]: after the budtender who served the person
the cannabis that got them in an accident
[SPEAKER_00]: before so I mean this is most of my daily
concern for the industry is not against
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement from the agencies it's against
enforcement from litigant is crazy people
[SPEAKER_00]: out there like the prop 65 lawsuits that
that are that are that we just now that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're out in the open there's a target
painted on us and and and protecting
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself from that is is ridiculous I mean
and it's a really hard time right now and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's as much as so many people in the
industry feel like it's just all the
[SPEAKER_00]: lawyers trying to take their money it's
like this is this is survival you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's if you're gonna survive through this
incredibly difficult transition and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: do believe that there are greener pastures
on the other side once this settles and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can make it through this I always
described it as the violent j-curve you
[SPEAKER_00]: know we're in this freefall horrible graph
just plummeting down and then like a
[SPEAKER_00]: phoenix a few will rise you know from the
ashes who can like withstand all these all
[SPEAKER_00]: the demands being put upon us
[SPEAKER_11]: we then have to change our entire business
model instead of licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah we did we did cover that before and I
can have like an offline conversation with
[SPEAKER_00]: you about that just but I do think that
that's one of the ones where you know as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as that white labeling piece dropped
I could hear like the worrying brain of
[SPEAKER_00]: attorneys everywhere being like we're
gonna do this we're gonna and and part of
[SPEAKER_00]: it we were talking about is understanding
the source of what they're after and part
[SPEAKER_00]: of it is they want to know who's behind
these companies where is the money coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from who is disclosed who are the
financial interested parties and and bring
[SPEAKER_00]: them into the gap so so part of the work
that we're gonna have to do in this
[SPEAKER_00]: comment period and and with the agency is
is clarifying giving them the information
[SPEAKER_00]: they need and what do they need to see
about this business arrangement to make
[SPEAKER_00]: them comfortable to know that it's
happening to know who is involved because
[SPEAKER_00]: it does seem ridiculous that you know
because then you go I mean that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's thought is is then you like is
the nutrient guy and the you know light
[SPEAKER_00]: supplier and the equipment supplier and
the POS company incorporated in this and
[SPEAKER_00]: part of that is that it's sloppy language
and it's not finessed and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: clarified enough right now to know who is
truly incorporated in this I mean I would
[SPEAKER_00]: say talk to your lawyer because I mean
when I talked to the lawyers they're like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's fine like well we got this you know
so but it but it requires navigation and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no way to know in this second
because these regulations aren't finalized
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're not and they're not
established and so that's the clarity that
[SPEAKER_01]: has to be asked for from the agency yeah
yeah yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I think I mean I've run into a couple
of missing sections where I'm like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: referencing something that doesn't exist
so I think that my guess is that because
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems to be referring back to
record-keeping and that the record-keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: part isn't there yet so that's like where
we're gonna you know that yes I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll come back because that was something
I pointed out to them previously because
[SPEAKER_00]: there was those extensive directions of
what to do if it was a medicinal sale but
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't have any record-keeping
requirements for an adult use sale and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they expanded it to both and then
they took the whole thing out so I think
[SPEAKER_00]: they're having some you know evidently
they're spitballing like what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: there's definitely another draft coming
yeah maybe I mean we're like tick-tock
[SPEAKER_12]: yeah yeah because they'll be like it was
already there you knew about it there was
[SPEAKER_12]: something in the emergency right that said
not doing this this and this and then like
[SPEAKER_12]: what's the regular when they were
confirmed they took it out
[SPEAKER_12]: yeah don't until you see those final
regulations don't yeah yeah and and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: a difficult place to be is the business to
be like don't make any decisions order any
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging or do anything until they come
out but but I would encourage you like
[SPEAKER_00]: please reach out to you know your
communities you're the people who you
[SPEAKER_00]: brainstorm with me our agency other
agencies anybody because this is just it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a really trepidatious time it's rough this
isn't even this is not even half of it of
[SPEAKER_00]: the changes that are in there this is all
I could fit into this amount of time there
[SPEAKER_00]: are more little beautiful explosive
nuggets dropped into those regulations so
[SPEAKER_00]: so I mean I implore you to please like sit
down with people have a little study group
[SPEAKER_00]: and go through the ones incredibly
specifically that pertain exactly to your
[SPEAKER_00]: business type oh yeah and we are there is
a discussion tomorrow night future
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis project is hosting like the next
wave of this discussion with Jackie and
[SPEAKER_00]: Pamela and hopefully me we're gonna do it
and elected officials might be there so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can just continue this conversation
because I also think this is the way we
[SPEAKER_00]: get to solutions is by talking through
this and going through the scenarios and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing like the all the other impacted
things that one change might trigger so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's in Venice at the townhouse in the
basement speakeasy it's great it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be awesome the information's on future
cannabis projects just could go get all
[SPEAKER_11]: the information you can get yes yeah
that's what things that we were talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about earlier they think we might suggest
I don't know if they're talking about it
[SPEAKER_00]: but but we've talked about like there is a
beer brand or wine broker license there's
[SPEAKER_00]: models in the liquor industries in the
spirits industries for for just having an
[SPEAKER_00]: agent card a broker license registering as
a brand so that you'll get those
[SPEAKER_00]: disclosures of who you are and your
background information but you but you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't necessarily I mean they make it
sound so easy where it's like you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: participate go get a license and you're
like great yeah the other thing I'll say
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably gonna do a whole separate
piece on this later but this is my like
[SPEAKER_00]: cause of the day the type s license shared
facility licenses was invented six months
[SPEAKER_00]: ago to date guess how many type s licenses
there are zero never happened there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a pathway for small businesses
which is called a shared facility there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a pathway for the Airbnb of cannabis it's
called shared facilities and none of it
[SPEAKER_00]: has happened and part of it is it needs
action on the local level for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how to authorize it on the
operational level to understand how to
[SPEAKER_00]: make your facility compliant as a type s
and as a state level where they are
[SPEAKER_00]: receptive and they're ready they just like
are like we need the local authorization
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was one of the dreams of like this
is how small businesses can actually get
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses in function by registering with a
type s license type which would give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: license as a shared facility participant
and that's a process we're working on
[SPEAKER_00]: building playbook for that to help push
that through but I do see that as a as an
[SPEAKER_00]: inroad to help with people getting to this
pathway of licensure through shared
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities and it just isn't happening
it's crazy I just went to look into it the
[SPEAKER_00]: other day and talked to DPH and they're
like yeah no there's none
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I'm sure they did yeah I mean we
didn't talk about it here but I know in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of the comments that was a great
deal of concern people have in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: what's being disclosed about you and where
people knowing where you live
[SPEAKER_00]: the CBD market they're like the doubt
their market is kind of a spectacular
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful insane thing of none of it's
okay none of that's okay it's like the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest example of just because
everybody's doing it doesn't mean it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: right the state is is being very clear
about those but it is kind of like a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: separate conversation of like outside of
the scope of this yeah I mean anyway I
[SPEAKER_00]: would say it gives me great concern when
once Big Pharma has a stated interest in
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling the CBD market I would be
quaking in my boots a little bit if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: just like I'm great I'm doing CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I mean California is its own world
and that is a side conversation but I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: I would also look into the fact that the
state just issued pretty clear guidance on
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD and the DCR just asked everybody to
register for a BTRC to sell CBD like that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't make sense so thank you guys we
have to cut it off please call me hey
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll talk we'll talk we'll talk
