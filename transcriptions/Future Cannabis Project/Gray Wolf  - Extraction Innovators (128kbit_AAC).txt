[SPEAKER_00]: Man gray wolf to like yeah open like
there's a there's a couple guys who are
[SPEAKER_00]: like awesome in this tech community too
because they have openly like upset a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people but like Kept this small band of
people in the technology side side of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or specifically in processing
Kind of hanging on to each other like we
[SPEAKER_00]: all follow each other to IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see each other at all these events It's
not a huge group of people And so gray
[SPEAKER_01]: wolf and he doesn't even he's not even on
Instagram, which is no, but he he's an old
[SPEAKER_01]: codger that that he's been designing
closed-loop systems for Well, he He's an
[SPEAKER_01]: engineer and the closed-loop systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: He basically open source them On the
internet so people could So it would
[SPEAKER_01]: destroy the ability to make patents around
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then people could actually yeah make
the machines themselves, so he open source
[SPEAKER_01]: them very To just make sure that people
would be able to make closed-loop butane
[SPEAKER_01]: designs And don't know if you're familiar
with Connoisseur concentrates the mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Extractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a They it's a you're about to say
something that might cause drama There we
[SPEAKER_01]: you might have there was a big video
series about how this company had owned
[SPEAKER_01]: all these patents and they tried to patent
this stuff, but it's really they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: enforceable patents and there's They got
it and he was he was made a Pretty funny
[SPEAKER_01]: video series of him up in this big no Drew
hey, that's all I know man drew and with a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple pretty blondes and him in front of
a Desk overseeing like LA or something and
[SPEAKER_01]: he talks about and he gives like an hour
long series about how he's He owns all the
[SPEAKER_01]: patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's gonna be the future of the industry
and it was Like it was pretty cringy Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was a growner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah the whole thing Yeah, and I believe
that he's actually gray wolf has been sued
[SPEAKER_01]: for some of the stuff they put eyes he's
had to deal with No, actually Skunk farm
[SPEAKER_01]: had gotten bought from another company and
there's some really ugly stuff going on
[SPEAKER_01]: around the open sourcing of that but
people have attacked gray wolf for what he
[SPEAKER_01]: has tried to open source and He's been
like copied all over the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you see a closed-loop Butane
extractor like something on it's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: like taken from one of his designs
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost everything out there Is based on a
turpinator design?
[SPEAKER_01]: The turpinator was a yo a bunch of
tri-clamp spools you put the material in
[SPEAKER_01]: the small ones they have passive passive
ones that use hot you could just put in
[SPEAKER_01]: hot water and ice and recover your butane
and But it started out with just a small
[SPEAKER_01]: little turpinator series on skunk farm
research calm and then eventually he
[SPEAKER_01]: started showing an automated mark 2
version that they worked on to where it
[SPEAKER_01]: was all pneumatic valves and then they And
then they they brought the mark 3 was the
[SPEAKER_01]: basic design that everybody's been working
that the early design for the mini
[SPEAKER_00]: closed-loop that everybody worked on These
are hydrocarbon closed-loop Extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just getting the oil off the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so basically you have a Column you
pack the the material in the column you
[SPEAKER_01]: pass butane Through the column at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all collected with oil under vacuum
and then you heat that and you heat that
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom pot and then you would Pull all the
solvent out And then recover it with some
[SPEAKER_01]: type of condenser or a pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the fun days of using apion HVAC
recovery pumps and then eventually it
[SPEAKER_01]: moved to TR 21 HVAC recovery pumps and
then you had companies come in like with
[SPEAKER_01]: the I Can't remember the name of the
company but the CME POL series of these
[SPEAKER_01]: little stainless boxes for recovering
Hydrocarbons, yeah, like most of the pumps
[SPEAKER_01]: like that was a that was the first
approved one I believe there's that and
[SPEAKER_01]: then there's the pneumatic Haskell's that
were built around it as well But these
[SPEAKER_00]: were these most of the pumps that were
used for the first At least five years
[SPEAKER_00]: four years were doing it were all like the
same kind of pumps You would pump freon
[SPEAKER_00]: into your AC system Like that's the only
thing that really fit that marketplace and
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the technology that you would use
that would be a lot safer Was kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: you had to go through It was passive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean a lot of people you could just add
heat and add cooling in one spot We had
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble like going to specific companies
and saying hey, you know This is our
[SPEAKER_00]: company and this is what we do and they
wouldn't even they wouldn't sell us
[SPEAKER_00]: anything They've like no, you don't fit
the criteria of people that we sell our
[SPEAKER_00]: products to With like pharmaceutical
supplies, you know, like even inert,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you know beads Yeah,
getting butane in mass, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like all these laminate Yeah and trying to
do it legally, you know, so yeah as much
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible You
