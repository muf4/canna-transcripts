[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Sue Cicely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a physician from Scottsdale,
Arizona.
[SPEAKER_06]: I practice internal medicine and I'm the
site principal investigator on a
[SPEAKER_06]: randomized controlled trial looking at
whole plant cannabis for PTSD.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanted to convey our
appreciation to all the good folks here
[SPEAKER_06]: who've been following our saga,
trying to get this study underway.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're finally at a point where we're
screening veterans and hope to have our
[SPEAKER_06]: first vet enrolled in the next few weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you a little bit more about that
during my talk.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, my name is Dr. Polston.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from Emerald Coast Research,
the managing director.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're out of Pensacola, Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're primarily interested in trying to
study today's cannabis products,
[SPEAKER_03]: so the products that you're actually
picking up at your dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_03]: and encouraging some of the larger
companies to research those products in
[SPEAKER_03]: the ways that they can.
[SPEAKER_03]: So primarily survey and observational
research, and the means that are at their
[SPEAKER_03]: disposal at this point.
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is David Ostro.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like most of you, I'm from the Midwest,
Chicago, which is where I founded the
[SPEAKER_10]: first gay community clinic in the world
back when I was in my MD-PhD training at
[SPEAKER_10]: the University of Chicago.
[SPEAKER_10]: We went on to prove that hepatitis B was a
sexually transmitted disease.
[SPEAKER_10]: And from that, we were the first community
clinic to get a contract to study the
[SPEAKER_10]: natural history of AIDS and its causes
back in 1983.
[SPEAKER_10]: That became the largest AIDS study in the
history of the world, the Multi-Center
[SPEAKER_10]: AIDS Cohort Study, and we're still
following thousands of men all across the
[SPEAKER_10]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_10]: after 33 years, and we get semiannual
physical, mental, behavioral evaluations,
[SPEAKER_10]: plus we put away blood and lymphocytes and
purified viruses from those who become
[SPEAKER_10]: infected.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's been a tremendous source of
information, and it's a model for
[SPEAKER_10]: observational research in a subject where
we start basically at zero that I've been
[SPEAKER_10]: proposing in the form of the North
American Community-Based Clinical Cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: Research and Evaluation Network for the
last eight years.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's a model for how we can
move forward now, even
[SPEAKER_10]: pre-post-prehibition, to work together at
a community and patient-centered basis to
[SPEAKER_10]: really understand through observational
research what are the specific strains and
[SPEAKER_10]: preparations that work best and have the
least side effects for people suffering
[SPEAKER_10]: from specific illnesses.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think everybody who very properly
wants to think about post-prehibition,
[SPEAKER_10]: I take a very negative view about that
because I think post-prohibition will only
[SPEAKER_10]: happen once the pharmaceutical
corporations have taken over the whole
[SPEAKER_10]: field and driven the community out of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I hope we can get going.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the time is now, and the
opportunity is now to do as much science
[SPEAKER_10]: to help people patients and to help those
of us who are activists in this field
[SPEAKER_10]: really get the best out of this wonderful
herb.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks to all of our amazing panelists.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Rob Bonta.
[SPEAKER_09]: I serve in the California State Assembly.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was the lead joint author of the Medical
Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act from
[SPEAKER_09]: last year and doing some follow-up work
this year as well with a bill called AB
[SPEAKER_09]: 1575.
[SPEAKER_09]: And obviously there will be a lot of
ongoing work and research and development.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a critical issue, and we're just
super excited to have such a distinguished
[SPEAKER_09]: panel.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for the introductions.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm excited to be here and honored to be
here with you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So why don't we just jump in outside of
the introductions into a little maybe five
[SPEAKER_09]: minutes each on where research and
development is headed post-prohibition.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took a few notes here, so I'm going to
use my... First I wanted to say we got
[SPEAKER_06]: some potentially great news from the DEA
last month.
[SPEAKER_06]: They announced that they're ending the
NIDA Monopoly, which could possibly be a
[SPEAKER_06]: major step forward for cannabis research.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I emphasize possibly because the fact
is that the announcement was not
[SPEAKER_06]: accompanied by any timeline.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as we all know, the DEA are experts in
delay as our study is proof positive.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's taken us seven years to get to this
point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where they finally issued me a DEA
schedule one license that a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: scientists call that the golden ticket
because it gives you the privilege of
[SPEAKER_06]: buying cannabis from the federal
government.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if any of you have seen what that
looks like, I have some pictures on my
[SPEAKER_06]: laptop.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just got our shipment in a couple of
weeks ago and it was incredibly depressing
[SPEAKER_06]: after so many years of struggle with the
government and everyone was celebrating
[SPEAKER_06]: this so-called victory and then the study
drug arrives by FedEx, by the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: You think it's like armored truck,
four kilos of cannabis comes in a FedEx
[SPEAKER_06]: delivery man.
[SPEAKER_06]: So theoretically, this federal monopoly
that has stymied cannabis research for
[SPEAKER_06]: four decades now.
[SPEAKER_06]: The federal government has enjoyed,
they've assigned the University of
[SPEAKER_06]: Mississippi this monopoly for 48 years and
it's very sad that there are so many
[SPEAKER_06]: investigators whose studies have not been
approved to move forward because NIDA
[SPEAKER_06]: simply didn't like the nature of the
study.
[SPEAKER_06]: They only really were green lighting
studies looking, safety studies,
[SPEAKER_06]: we call them, looking at harmful side
effects and addiction potential.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Dare said that you wanted to study
efficacy of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those were the studies that were
systematically impeded by our government.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a problem in that the DEA
doesn't have any timetable to authorize
[SPEAKER_06]: other growers and in the meantime,
we are stuck with this cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: The paperwork that came with the cannabis
just does not tell you anything about,
[SPEAKER_06]: other than the THC to CBD ratio.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you just heard all these experts in the
last panel all these sophisticated growers
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about how complex this plant is.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know anything about the other
cannabinoids in the plant, the terpene
[SPEAKER_06]: profile, flavonoids, what conditions it
was grown under.
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it grown with pesticides or not?
[SPEAKER_06]: They told me it was grown organically.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they don't define that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it arrived frozen and with a thawing
procedure.
[SPEAKER_06]: They said it had been in their freezer for
two years.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did want to mention that, and obviously
we're still not able to get the varieties
[SPEAKER_06]: of cannabis that we request.
[SPEAKER_06]: Scientists who ask for more than 10 to 12%
THC, that is their high THC available.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look at the NIDA website,
they list the phenotypes that are
[SPEAKER_06]: available and 10 to 12% is the max.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did want to also give you one more bit
of good news.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to instill some optimism here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Many of you saw that the American Legion,
which is the largest veteran service
[SPEAKER_06]: organization in our country, 2.5 million
veteran members, mostly very conservative.
[SPEAKER_06]: They did announce that we were able to
infiltrate that group and pass a
[SPEAKER_06]: resolution there that not just ordered the
DEA to reschedule cannabis, but also
[SPEAKER_06]: demanded that the DEA license other
growers for research.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I thought that was very powerful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to give a shout out to my buddy,
Roberto Pickering, who is with the
[SPEAKER_06]: Battlefield Foundation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this gentleman was an integral part of
making that happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to continue to see efforts
of good people, real expert growers,
[SPEAKER_06]: to finally be able to apply for a Schedule
I license.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to pressure them as much
as we possibly can to get this going.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, tonight, just my final word is
that tonight at the Garden Grove,
[SPEAKER_06]: the city of Garden Grove, the mayor there
who was here yesterday at this event,
[SPEAKER_06]: invited us to speak to their city council
about them hosting a federal grow and
[SPEAKER_06]: helping them apply for a DEA Schedule I
license to cultivate cannabis for
[SPEAKER_06]: research.
[SPEAKER_06]: So any of you want to join us at that
council meeting tonight, we're thrilled.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's a really good opening.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you all very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much to Assemblymember Mata for
being here today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much to Susan for hosting such a
wonderful event.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks to all of you for being here,
seeing all these smiling faces that are
[SPEAKER_03]: part of the movement or want to be part of
the movement or just want to be educated.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of good energy in this room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we need in this movement
is a lot of positivity and good energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd also like to thank my esteemed
colleagues up here on stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually an honor and a privilege to
be speaking with such an accomplished
[SPEAKER_03]: group of cannabis scholars.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that being said, I'd like to speak for
just a moment about why I entered this
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the more pressing issues that
I believe are out there today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most folks realize that the gold
standard for researching and
[SPEAKER_03]: investigational new drug applications are
blinded, controlled, clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, we've had far too few
of those when it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that being said, I mean, we've got
pioneers like Dr. Sisley, who spent the
[SPEAKER_03]: better part of a decade trying to complete
a clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the situation with cannabis is
really unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is a drug that's been out
there for obviously a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been smoked for millennia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And frankly, it hasn't obviously followed
the traditional model of biomedical drug
[SPEAKER_03]: discovery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually we start out with a target,
usually G protein coupled receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: A protein kinase to a bunch of fancy
molecular modeling and high throughput
[SPEAKER_03]: screening and to identify candidate drugs
and then eventually the ideal candidate
[SPEAKER_03]: drug that will then go through the
clinical trial process.
[SPEAKER_03]: But obviously with cannabis, we've taken a
completely different route.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's unique about cannabis is you
couldn't ask for a better candidate drug
[SPEAKER_03]: in some ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has one of the best safety profiles
that you could ask for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the LD50, which is defined as the
lethal dose that would kill 50% of the
[SPEAKER_03]: people taking the drug is literally so
high with this drug that you could consume
[SPEAKER_03]: pounds and pounds of it and not die.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is very unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the drugs that are being
investigated out there today, they would
[SPEAKER_03]: die to have an LD50 in that range.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that being said, the real issue is that
the cannabis industry is moving so quickly
[SPEAKER_03]: right now and research is moving rather
slowly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the products that we are seeing in the
dispensaries today and especially these
[SPEAKER_03]: new products, we just got a wonderful
presentation about the evolution of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we've got all these new products on
the market that really haven't been
[SPEAKER_03]: adequately studied.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think most people would agree that whole
plant cannabis is relatively safe and
[SPEAKER_03]: anonymous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's really not harming folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, these new products that
are in the dispensaries, which are frankly
[SPEAKER_03]: outselling flour at this point,
such as concentrates, these vape pens,
[SPEAKER_03]: edibles, these new preparations obviously
haven't been studied for any real
[SPEAKER_03]: meaningful length of time because they've
only been in the dispensaries for a short
[SPEAKER_03]: period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess where I came into this is I
started seeing some of the older
[SPEAKER_03]: generation embracing these new products
and some of the younger generation as
[SPEAKER_03]: well, but primarily my parents and their
friends using these vape pens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the truth is, as a scientist,
I started to look on PubMed, the world's
[SPEAKER_03]: largest medical database for research.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there just really isn't any.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The tobacco industry, who initially
created these pens, they have the
[SPEAKER_03]: research, but they sure haven't published
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do believe that the vast majority of
the products that are out there in these
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries are probably safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am not an alarmist, and I'm not here to
scare anyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I am a supporter of this
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And an advocate.
[SPEAKER_03]: That being said, I also believe that it is
incumbent upon this industry and upon the
[SPEAKER_03]: producers of these new products to begin
to do at least what they can
[SPEAKER_03]: research-wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that's just survey research,
if it's just observational research for
[SPEAKER_03]: now, they could at least be capturing all
those data points.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I've been doing is
encouraging these larger companies that
[SPEAKER_03]: can actually afford to have a research and
development program to go ahead and begin
[SPEAKER_03]: that research.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll say that nonetheless, I do see a
lot of signs and a lot of improvement in
[SPEAKER_03]: both private and academic cannabis
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: The larger companies that I was calling on
privately a couple of years ago and asking
[SPEAKER_03]: for a chief scientific officer,
I mean, they just laughed at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't have a chief scientific
officer, head of research and development.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not that either.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were just talking with businessmen a
few years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now those larger companies, they have
those people in place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're starting to see scientists at
these larger companies and starting to see
[SPEAKER_03]: more of an emphasis on research and
development, although I would say
[SPEAKER_03]: personally that it's really skewed toward
development.
[SPEAKER_03]: And although slowly, academic research,
as Dr. Cicely talked about, is beginning
[SPEAKER_03]: to at least head in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as long as we can't do
translational research and as long as the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis that Dr. Cicely is being provided
by NIDA is of that poor quality,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's hard to really call that
translational research when the vets,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're going to be taking that product.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not the product that they're going
and buying in dispensaries, my friends,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're probably, like you said,
they're probably going to laugh when they
[SPEAKER_03]: see what you're going to ask them to
inhale.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really need these new partnerships.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like the model in Pennsylvania that
they've formed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado wanted to be the recreational
cannabis king.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pennsylvania, they want to be the medical
cannabis king.
[SPEAKER_03]: And frankly, I believe that these
partnerships between universities and all
[SPEAKER_03]: these probably private cannabis
institutes, in the same way you saw stem
[SPEAKER_03]: cells have to go private and stem cell
institutes, you're going to see a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: that in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to try and wrap up here quickly,
all I know is this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis needs to be studied thoroughly at
all levels as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe there needs to be, frankly,
tons more academic research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I believe that we need more private
research?
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I believe that there's a role for Big
Pharma in this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there's a lot of talent in Big
Pharma.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not going to be cut out of the
equation anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we might as well move forward with the
incremental steps that we can take right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And frankly, as many players as we can get
involved in the research is a good thing
[SPEAKER_03]: because we need a broad spectrum of
research, not just Big Pharma,
[SPEAKER_03]: not just academia.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need everyone to be doing this
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to finish, as a last point,
I've really actually never seen much harm
[SPEAKER_03]: done by doing too much research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Frankly, the harm is done when we do too
little research.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just here to advocate for more
research from all entities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Dr. Poston.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go to Dr. Ostrov.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I wanted to follow that talk because
you gave me so many great lead-ins.
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of that, my main talk is about,
yes, we talked about the future in terms
[SPEAKER_10]: of what's going to happen once Prohibition
ended or so forth.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we all know that that is a train
that's hurling down a track that's almost
[SPEAKER_10]: worse than when we invaded Iraq.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, that is a track that's been laid
by Palmer and the DEA and FDA for decades.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's just been a postponing act
against the community so they can have
[SPEAKER_10]: total control over this.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, one of the greatest lies that you
saw in the DEA statement was that we allow
[SPEAKER_10]: lower scheduling for synthetic
cannabinoids that have been made by the
[SPEAKER_10]: drug industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I want to tell you something.
[SPEAKER_10]: None of those compounds are synthetic.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mostly the THC is extracted from the
leftover crap from what you've received
[SPEAKER_10]: from the University of Mississippi,
which has been breaking their contract
[SPEAKER_10]: with NIDA for decades.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they have this other thing called
the Midas Touch.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is they put it in a capsule,
they add sesame oil, and voila,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's legal.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's schedule three.
[SPEAKER_10]: So these rules only apply to the community
and they will apply to the community and
[SPEAKER_10]: the activists and so forth as long as it
takes for Palmer to get complete control
[SPEAKER_10]: of this industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what do we have to do in the meanwhile?
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to do observational,
scientifically developed research on every
[SPEAKER_10]: single person we can capture who's going
on medical cannabis in an area or a state
[SPEAKER_10]: or a system where the concentration and
the composition of the cannabis is being
[SPEAKER_10]: very carefully monitored and the amount
that they're using is being controlled.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm working with the groups that are
trying to set up the standards for that
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'm working with the doctors through
the American Academy of Cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_10]: Medicine and the Society for Cannabis
Clinicians and all over the United States
[SPEAKER_10]: and Canada who will agree to give us
objectives of feedback on their patients
[SPEAKER_10]: every six months just like we ran the MAC
study.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then to interview those patients who
agree to be in it at least one-on-one on
[SPEAKER_10]: the phone and then maybe thereafter
through surveys because as a long-term
[SPEAKER_10]: survey researcher I know we can never
assume that we know what the questions are
[SPEAKER_10]: that the patients want us to answer.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we must do mixed method research
starting with qualitative and ethnographic
[SPEAKER_10]: and so forth and I've kind of come to this
place because I've been doing this for 34
[SPEAKER_10]: years in the area of AIDS and HIV and have
seen how powerful whoever thought we would
[SPEAKER_10]: have not only the treatment in hand by now
but be reaching for the elimination of
[SPEAKER_10]: this disease.
[SPEAKER_10]: I certainly never thought of this would
happen and we get to this point.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a lot we can do no matter how
much the drug companies say, oh no,
[SPEAKER_10]: observational research will never go past
the FDA.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not the state of the art and all this
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well sure they say that because they want
the system to stay the way it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to do the same thing that AIDS
activists did in the 1970s.
[SPEAKER_10]: What?
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have to stand up to this.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to get the people out of office.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to vote, vote, vote at the local
and every other level but we have to come
[SPEAKER_10]: together as a community that wants to work
together with standardized methods and
[SPEAKER_10]: good analysis and so forth and build that
database from which we can learn so,
[SPEAKER_10]: so much and we can do it right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cannabis is a controlled substance and yet
its use has proliferated uncontrolled for
[SPEAKER_11]: many decades.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not as freaked out about Big Pharma
as my colleague Dr. Astro is.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think Big Pharma or any other
single entity can ever totally control
[SPEAKER_11]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: It just won't happen.
[SPEAKER_11]: But Big Pharma is a serious player and can
have a serious influence.
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to start out my brief
introductory comments by giving a shout
[SPEAKER_11]: out to, of all people, President Ronald
Reagan and we should all thank him
[SPEAKER_11]: ironically because he did a lot
inadvertently to advance us to the place
[SPEAKER_11]: where we are.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know when Reagan took over he
relaunched the drug war with a vengeance.
[SPEAKER_11]: He militarized it.
[SPEAKER_11]: His administration put a lot of money into
research because they were sure this evil
[SPEAKER_11]: weed, if the research was done,
it could be shown how it damages the bird.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the 1980s.
[SPEAKER_11]: He put a lot of money into this but
instead of showing how harmful cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: was, they ended up funding the research
that culminated the discovery of the
[SPEAKER_11]: endocannabinoid system which shows why
cannabis has a neuroprotective effect,
[SPEAKER_11]: not a neurotoxic effect.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a great irony there.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a hugely important discovery and
it's the edifice for so much of research
[SPEAKER_11]: that has been done and will continue to be
done.
[SPEAKER_11]: As we transition into a post-prohibition
era, when I say it has a huge impact,
[SPEAKER_11]: it has really opened up whole new vistas
of understanding human biology and
[SPEAKER_11]: physiology and has an impact for many
different areas of medical science.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say a significant impact for all
areas of medical science.
[SPEAKER_11]: It sheds a lot of light on why cannabis is
such a versatile medicine and why it's the
[SPEAKER_11]: most popular recreational substance on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it is medical and recreational.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, low dose is very significant and
valuable and so is high dose.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to embrace it all.
[SPEAKER_11]: When we talk about research and the
landscape, thus far, I think one of the
[SPEAKER_11]: misconceptions that have been promoted by
largely the media but policy makers as
[SPEAKER_11]: well is that we're just lacking the
science to know really what's up with
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what the DEA said, that they didn't
have the science to reschedule or
[SPEAKER_11]: deschedule.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a voluminous amount of scientific
data that had been accumulated.
[SPEAKER_11]: Most of it has not been clinical oriented.
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, very little has been clinical
oriented.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's also been observational research,
observational studies.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a lot of data that explains how
and why cannabis works.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a lot of data people anecdotally
or through observational studies saying it
[SPEAKER_11]: works for this, that, the other thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: What we are lacking by and large is the
clinical research to prove quote unquote
[SPEAKER_11]: that it works to the extent that we need
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's the implications of this as we are
heading now into a new era?
[SPEAKER_11]: For a long time, the rule of thumb has
been cannabis is so dangerous that they
[SPEAKER_11]: couldn't do human studies.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have animal studies and we have a lot
of research and a lot of data for animal
[SPEAKER_11]: studies and some of it is very significant
and important but the problem is you can't
[SPEAKER_11]: extrapolate from animal data to humans
necessarily always.
[SPEAKER_11]: It provides leads.
[SPEAKER_11]: It can show the way to develop drugs and
so forth but it can't always be easily
[SPEAKER_11]: extrapolated.
[SPEAKER_11]: Particularly when it comes to dosage.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a problem that we see at Project
CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: People who want to make products or
sometimes they are healing but they're not
[SPEAKER_11]: necessarily medical professionals.
[SPEAKER_11]: They go read these science papers and they
look at how much CBD or THC, it's always
[SPEAKER_11]: single molecules generally, are given to a
rat or a mouse or a dog and they take that
[SPEAKER_11]: and then say okay, well if the dog or the
mouse is getting 20 milligrams of
[SPEAKER_11]: something per kilogram and they weigh 10
pounds, well for a 200 pound person,
[SPEAKER_11]: they should be getting 20 times the
amount.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, and really this is how
things are calculated.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've talked to people.
[SPEAKER_11]: So as a result, this is sort of a
prejudice for very high and when I say
[SPEAKER_11]: high dosing, I mean almost obscene dosing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not talking about what Swami was
talking about and we're on the same page
[SPEAKER_11]: about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: You start off on the wrong foot and you
can get very distorted results.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think when we talk about research and
where we're going, I would like to and
[SPEAKER_11]: it's gonna happen on many different levels
and Big Pharma will be involved and
[SPEAKER_11]: there'll be observational studies.
[SPEAKER_11]: There'll be all sorts of things going on.
[SPEAKER_11]: What I think is important is that at least
some of the research be oriented very
[SPEAKER_11]: pragmatically to enhance our ability to
optimize this plant, whether it's
[SPEAKER_11]: therapeutic use or recreational use.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have had, since before the written
word, humankind has had a relationship
[SPEAKER_11]: with this plant, a very significant one.
[SPEAKER_11]: That relationship was broken last century
because of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to relearn about how to use this
plant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that we have oils and the concentrates
where you can measure very specifically
[SPEAKER_11]: and know specifically what is in these
products if they're labeled properly.
[SPEAKER_11]: It gives us an opportunity to kind of take
it all onto a different level.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not just smoking a joint anymore and
I have nothing against that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do it practically every day.
[SPEAKER_11]: But now you can know exactly what you're
taking.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can repeat the dosage or you can
adjust the dosage and you can get a very
[SPEAKER_11]: clear indication of what you need if you
find something right so you can repeat it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think research, and we talked before,
we heard about this quagmire around dosing
[SPEAKER_11]: on the panel before.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is an area that's really significant.
[SPEAKER_11]: Dosing is all over the map.
[SPEAKER_11]: At Project CBD, we're hearing for as
little as two milligrams of CBD.
[SPEAKER_11]: When I say CBD, I always mean CBD rich
with other things.
[SPEAKER_11]: Never a CBD isolate is what I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_11]: As little as that can be very effective
therapeutically and as much as a gram a
[SPEAKER_11]: day.
[SPEAKER_11]: Where are we all at in this?
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Luckily, it's a very safe substance.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, I fear as we go forward,
last point I'll make real quickly is that
[SPEAKER_11]: researchers and scientists, they aren't
immune from the cultural prejudice in
[SPEAKER_11]: which they're working.
[SPEAKER_11]: There was just as an example, a study
done, it was published, the results only
[SPEAKER_11]: last month from the University of British
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe you heard about this.
[SPEAKER_11]: The press release released from the
university described it as the first
[SPEAKER_11]: scientific proof that cannabis makes
marijuana smoking causes one to be a
[SPEAKER_11]: slacker.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what they did with this?
[SPEAKER_11]: They injected massive doses of THC into a
rat's brain.
[SPEAKER_11]: They found the rat wasn't very interested
in eating or going for the sugar when they
[SPEAKER_11]: usually are.
[SPEAKER_11]: They overlooked the fact that you have a
biphasic effect so when you have very high
[SPEAKER_11]: doses of THC, it actually dampens the
appetite and dampens the interest in
[SPEAKER_11]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here, they extrapolated from a single
molecule of a mouse and projected onto
[SPEAKER_11]: that their own prejudices and concluded
that they had some serious data they could
[SPEAKER_11]: say about slackerhood or amotivation.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have to avoid this in the future but I
think that as we transition into this new
[SPEAKER_11]: era, these prejudices aren't gonna just be
let go.
[SPEAKER_11]: My final point here is I think I'm worried
but I'm also hopeful that as we move
[SPEAKER_11]: forward, that we don't sacrifice medical
on the altar of recreational.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're both important and the medical
shouldn't be shoved aside and big pharma
[SPEAKER_11]: shouldn't be allowed to dominate the
industry, at least the above ground part
[SPEAKER_11]: of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: There is a place for big pharma and
there's a place for isolates but to me,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's a small place in the overall research
universe and the potential of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a legitimate place but the problem is
it becomes imperious and wants to take
[SPEAKER_11]: over everything and shove everything in.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's nothing else out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Those
are mine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you to all of our panelists again
for your opening remarks.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we have some questions that could,
if you have any, you can, we'll identify
[SPEAKER_09]: you and we'll have a microphone up here
but let me just start with one.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was some reference to the federal
climate.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can any of the panelists share their
thoughts on specifically what is necessary
[SPEAKER_09]: to change the federal climate to be more
supportive of research?
[SPEAKER_09]: Who needs to do what and how can advocates
and activists be involved in making that
[SPEAKER_09]: happen sooner than later?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's a very interesting thing
because you can change the law.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can change the scheduling but until
you change the education of health
[SPEAKER_10]: professionals in the United States and the
stigmatization that's been driven into
[SPEAKER_10]: everybody, I mean, I've gone before
medical student classes and talked about
[SPEAKER_10]: the myths and the lies and everything else
and I've had students stand up and say,
[SPEAKER_10]: how dare you say that our government lies
to us?
[SPEAKER_10]: And I look at them and I say, wow,
I mean, don't they teach you anything
[SPEAKER_10]: about medical ethics and the projects that
have been done to infect people with all
[SPEAKER_10]: kinds of diseases and not even tell them?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just our history of our government
and cover-ups.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, from the AIDS epidemic,
I could write a whole book of having been
[SPEAKER_10]: the fly on the wall when government people
covered up and lied and even though they
[SPEAKER_10]: knew that the government was responsible
for the spread of HIV among Haitians,
[SPEAKER_10]: when they released them from the camps by
judge order, they didn't even warn the
[SPEAKER_10]: communities they were going to and then
they said, okay, being Haitian is a risk
[SPEAKER_10]: factor, okay, all right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can change everything but you have
to change beliefs and you change beliefs
[SPEAKER_10]: is the hardest thing to do and then you
change attitudes that way and I even
[SPEAKER_10]: proposed that NIDA wants that they should
sponsor a program to change the beliefs
[SPEAKER_10]: and attitudes of their own staff around
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: You could imagine that didn't get a very
warm reception right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: They say they've changed, they say they've
heard the message and everything but they
[SPEAKER_10]: still are a tool of the same FDA,
DEA, big pharma, NIDA, alcohol industry,
[SPEAKER_10]: you name it and who's fighting us the
hardest now?
[SPEAKER_10]: Now it's the opioid manufacturers because
they see a tremendous threat if strong
[SPEAKER_10]: strains of analgesic types of cannabis get
out there because they're not gonna be
[SPEAKER_10]: able to argue anymore that they're
incredibly addicting and counting for more
[SPEAKER_10]: and more deaths among youth and so forth
in the United States, that their drugs
[SPEAKER_10]: really are better than cannabis if we show
them this is the fact and in defense of
[SPEAKER_10]: the University of British Canadian,
there's another group there that published
[SPEAKER_10]: a wonderful paper a few months ago showing
that a huge proportion of the people in
[SPEAKER_10]: their survey of 1,500 people going on
medical cannabis, a quarter at least did
[SPEAKER_10]: it to reduce or stop the use of addictive
opiates for their treatment and I think
[SPEAKER_10]: that has to be a cry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just like we used to say ignorance kills
and so forth, we have to go out there and
[SPEAKER_10]: say that medical cannabis saves lives and
is harm reduction.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to mention that the challenge
with finding new sources of study drug for
[SPEAKER_06]: any of these control trials is even more
problematic because of course the DEA
[SPEAKER_06]: announcement said that if you're breaking
federal law now, if you're a state
[SPEAKER_06]: licensed grower, you're not eligible to
apply and so this has the potential to
[SPEAKER_06]: become an academic oligopoly where only
universities can apply to grow cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: for research and we really have to fight
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw an article in Vice recently,
I'm not sure how many other folks saw that
[SPEAKER_06]: the DEA director was interviewed by this
Vice reporter and said was this just a
[SPEAKER_06]: publicity stunt or is the DEA serious
about licensing other growers and he said
[SPEAKER_06]: absolutely not a publicity stunt,
this is serious, we are gonna find other
[SPEAKER_06]: growers but we haven't received any
applications yet he said that there were
[SPEAKER_06]: no applications in the pipeline because of
course everybody knew that there was a
[SPEAKER_06]: government enforced monopoly and nobody
bothered to try so we are trying to work
[SPEAKER_06]: with groups all over the country,
whoever is willing to put their toe in and
[SPEAKER_06]: fill out this application, I wanna
emphasize to you it's not as daunting as
[SPEAKER_06]: people think because everybody assumes a
DEA application is gonna be 200 pages and
[SPEAKER_06]: ridiculously bureaucratic, it is literally
a three page application, it took us five
[SPEAKER_06]: minutes to fill out with our group at the
Battlefield Foundation and I was really
[SPEAKER_06]: proud of people like Steve D'Angelo you
heard yesterday who's offered to partner
[SPEAKER_06]: with us on also on trying to apply for a
federal gross so I think I wanna encourage
[SPEAKER_06]: you all, the more people who can get
applications into the pipeline and
[SPEAKER_06]: pressure the DEA to license other real
expert cultivators, it is gonna be
[SPEAKER_06]: valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Dr. Rosen and I was the
one who practiced western medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: treating benign and cancer pain for 40
years and I retired 12 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: happy watching television and traveling
and all of a sudden medical marijuana came
[SPEAKER_00]: to view and for the last six months I've
been obsessed with trying to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what it's all about and so I resurrected
my license and I'm going to start a brand
[SPEAKER_00]: new clinic and a mobile clinic to be able
to get to those people who need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came from this last month of this month,
this is my fourth meeting on medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid and the last one before this
was in Israel which is the epicenter of
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabinoid and my husband calls
me the godmother of pain management
[SPEAKER_00]: because I did it before and I met the
godfather of medical cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is this, how could I treat my
patients if there is no standardized
[SPEAKER_00]: medication of medical cannabinoid that I
could use for my patients and how could I
[SPEAKER_00]: study and I plan to study all my patients
because I have both an academic and
[SPEAKER_00]: private practice experience, are they
standardized tests to know how they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and I'm talking about when you're in
the clinic you have to give a test that's
[SPEAKER_00]: practical, that's paper and pencil and can
be put in a database because I'd like to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to say after one year I treated
100 dementia patients and 80% had better
[SPEAKER_00]: cognition but I want to know what kind am
I gonna use and where am I gonna get it,
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Briefly there are products out there,
a lot of products, it's a question of how
[SPEAKER_11]: they're labeled, if they're labeled well
and properly but there are products out
[SPEAKER_11]: there, you can mention a few that we think
highly of and there are also product lines
[SPEAKER_11]: that have different ratios of CBD and THC
and you can think of it really in terms of
[SPEAKER_11]: what we can play with right now,
there's really two axes, the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_11]: axis which is really CBD and THC in terms
of what's practically out there what we
[SPEAKER_11]: can use and there's also the terpene axis,
one is ratio specific, the other is strain
[SPEAKER_11]: specific and at Project CBD where we hear
from a lot of doctors, a lot of patients
[SPEAKER_11]: and scientists, we have relations with the
entire community, the best we can say at
[SPEAKER_11]: this point is the goal is for a person to
self-medicate hopefully under the guidance
[SPEAKER_11]: of a health professional, starting out low
dose, usually starting out higher THC,
[SPEAKER_11]: higher CBD, lower THC and increasing that
ratio to the point where it becomes
[SPEAKER_11]: balanced, moving in a direction of balance
so that a person can use as much,
[SPEAKER_11]: a cannabis remedy with as much THC as
they're comfortable with and they
[SPEAKER_11]: shouldn't go beyond that and it doesn't
have to be high doses.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not about figuring out the perfect
ratio for every condition but what's right
[SPEAKER_11]: and comfortable for a person and you don't
necessarily know what the right ratio is
[SPEAKER_11]: in terms of what you're comfortable with
in terms of the psychoactivity or the
[SPEAKER_11]: Stoney effect unless you go beyond that
and when people go beyond that sometimes
[SPEAKER_11]: they find in fact they actually like that
for new people in the scene, they like
[SPEAKER_11]: getting a little high, they prefer that
and that's also therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_10]: You touch on a lot of really important
questions, it's one of the reasons why we
[SPEAKER_10]: started up forming the North American
community based and patients centered
[SPEAKER_10]: clinical cannabis research and evaluation
network some seven, eight years ago and
[SPEAKER_10]: we've been meeting regularly with all the
shareholders from every level of the like
[SPEAKER_10]: putting the seeds in the ground,
the genesis all the way up to the
[SPEAKER_10]: scientists and people like myself who are
basically into innovative research
[SPEAKER_10]: methodology that gets around these issues
and we've come up with a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_10]: baseline surveys that have been attributed
from different groups and things that have
[SPEAKER_10]: really validated these surveys and then
once you get into particular illness or
[SPEAKER_10]: what I got to say is set of cardinal
symptoms because it's very hard to do
[SPEAKER_10]: illness change but if you can break that
down to the cardinal symptoms that the
[SPEAKER_10]: patient is suffering and most of stress
them, there's always very simple measures
[SPEAKER_10]: of fibrosis six items at most that you can
use for that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sue knows that this is a great PTSD index
but you can also break it down to looking
[SPEAKER_10]: at the actual symptoms because some
symptoms may very likely respond to
[SPEAKER_10]: different cannabinoids and that's really
the ultimate question that we have to ask.
[SPEAKER_11]: One other real quick comment because
symptoms I want to also always play the
[SPEAKER_11]: devil's act and it's always both are true.
[SPEAKER_11]: Michael Backus referred to cortigen and
medicinal genomics earlier in the previous
[SPEAKER_11]: panel.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're doing gene sequencing of cannabis
strains.
[SPEAKER_11]: They were also involved in the human
genome product.
[SPEAKER_11]: The problem with just focusing on symptoms
when you're dealing with something like
[SPEAKER_11]: seizures for example, these little kids
with terrible epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are so many different factors that
can play into seizure disorder.
[SPEAKER_11]: There could be hundreds of different
mechanisms in the brain that are wrong.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hundreds possible to choose from and what
medicinal genomics then what I feel is so
[SPEAKER_11]: exciting in terms of the future of
cannabis research is that they are
[SPEAKER_11]: matching a condition where they will gene
sequence the tissue from the patient and
[SPEAKER_11]: they will locate the broken molecular
channel.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's say for the epilepsy they're finding
a common theme here is a problem with the
[SPEAKER_11]: sodium channel they call it, broken sodium
channel and that happens to be something
[SPEAKER_11]: that responds very well to CBD but there
are other severe cases of epilepsy that
[SPEAKER_11]: that symptom that aren't a result of a
broken sodium channel that don't respond
[SPEAKER_11]: well to CBD that respond hardly at all or
sometimes CBD can make it worse even
[SPEAKER_11]: violently worse.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very exciting that you have this kind
of technology emerging that you can match
[SPEAKER_11]: gene sequencing data from a plant to a
person and I think that there's a lot
[SPEAKER_11]: there and it's a future and I think it's
something that the FDA can hardly keep up
[SPEAKER_11]: with.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something beyond what the FDA is
really capable of regulating and I think
[SPEAKER_11]: it's a whole new universe opening up.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is for Martin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about something that you said
actually two things that I wasn't quite
[SPEAKER_01]: sure how to reconcile and I was wondering
if you could flush it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You made a statement that there is a role
for isolates but before that you said
[SPEAKER_01]: something about CBD and when you were
referring to CBD you were making it sound
[SPEAKER_01]: like you did not encourage the use of that
as an isolate so could you flush that out
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit please?
[SPEAKER_11]: Real quickly there's been some limited
research and one thing about research has
[SPEAKER_11]: to be done a lot over and over again until
you really have a consensus.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just one or two studies doesn't really
prove anything but in terms of there's
[SPEAKER_11]: been comparisons of CBD as an isolate to a
whole plant a CBD rich oil extract and
[SPEAKER_11]: what they found basically is done in
Israel that you can get a therapeutic
[SPEAKER_11]: effect from CBD as an isolate if very high
doses are used and very precise doses.
[SPEAKER_11]: They can get the readings they're looking
for for certain markers of inflammation
[SPEAKER_11]: and so forth and if you don't get the
exact or very the problem is it's a very
[SPEAKER_11]: narrow therapeutic window.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're a little too low or a little too
high it doesn't do anything where with the
[SPEAKER_11]: CBD rich oil extract you give a little it
has a little effect you give more it has
[SPEAKER_11]: more effect so it's not like the isolate
can't do anything in fact we're seeing
[SPEAKER_11]: from the studies now with GW
pharmaceuticals with Epidiolex for the
[SPEAKER_11]: Dravet syndrome for the it's almost pure
CBD and they they are having positive
[SPEAKER_11]: results but that's all well and good we
should recognize there's a reality there
[SPEAKER_11]: but you know big pharma didn't come to the
aid of little Charlotte you know it that
[SPEAKER_11]: came from marijuana growers and we have a
lot of research and a lot of information
[SPEAKER_11]: we're developing on the ground that's also
very important the point is not to reject
[SPEAKER_11]: what GW is doing with Epidiolex it has its
place I think it's a very small place and
[SPEAKER_11]: we have much more potential using the
complex plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to add to that that eons of
research have shown that a you cannot grow
[SPEAKER_10]: a cannabis plant that does not have THC
many people like to talk about oh we're
[SPEAKER_10]: gonna have this great law that only allows
see pure CBD you know that that's a
[SPEAKER_10]: fallacy first of all you need a little bit
of THC there to get the best effect and
[SPEAKER_10]: who knows what other compounds there and
CBD is despite the you know the general
[SPEAKER_10]: wisdom is probably not the specific
real-life type 2 receptor agonist it's
[SPEAKER_10]: probably one of its metabolites or a
mixture of compounds including what THC
[SPEAKER_10]: does at the CB1 receptors so we have to
think about this you know the way
[SPEAKER_10]: neuroscience has been moving the brain is
not a sponge living in a dish top and then
[SPEAKER_10]: it just absorbs all of these chemicals and
everything you have to think of what's
[SPEAKER_10]: going on at the synapses and at the system
level and you see that it is complex and
[SPEAKER_10]: involves a bunch of molecules doing
different things at different places in
[SPEAKER_10]: the brain and we shouldn't forget that
there's so much basic science throughout
[SPEAKER_10]: neurochemistry and including in
cannabinoid medicine to tell us not to
[SPEAKER_10]: think this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi so one of our patients called us and
said that one of our products completely
[SPEAKER_04]: made him be able to stop taking insulin
for his diabetes and Stanford University
[SPEAKER_04]: Hospital and Paulo Alto wants to do a
study on it and I was just wondering what
[SPEAKER_04]: do you do with that type of data once the
study has been completed I know you can do
[SPEAKER_04]: like get it published in a scientific
journal but then what do you do after that
[SPEAKER_04]: like where can we take that to?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah the best place for any scientific
data that's meaningful is in a
[SPEAKER_03]: peer-reviewed scientific journal I mean
PubMed is the world's largest medical
[SPEAKER_03]: database and frankly the attitudes out
here on the west coast are a lot more
[SPEAKER_03]: progressive than the attitudes out on the
east coast in the I-95 research corridor
[SPEAKER_03]: and until those physicians out there and
the doctors out there that are making a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of the policy decisions see a
systematic and probably rather lengthy
[SPEAKER_03]: string of good peer-reviewed science we're
probably going to be sitting here right at
[SPEAKER_03]: the same scheduling point we're at right
now would be my guess so peer-reviewed
[SPEAKER_03]: research is going to be the key to moving
this this industry forward in a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: ways because if that just gets into the
journals it doesn't do anything to change
[SPEAKER_10]: clinical practice we have to change the
attitude of the scientists and
[SPEAKER_10]: particularly the doctors and other primary
health caregivers that this is not a
[SPEAKER_10]: dangerous drug and then if they if they
prescribe it they're not going to get
[SPEAKER_10]: their license taken away a lot of what we
do at AACM is put out practice standards
[SPEAKER_10]: so that people have a way to defend
themselves when they've written that 50th
[SPEAKER_10]: recommendation and the DEA comes down on
them and seizes all the records and stops
[SPEAKER_05]: their practice next question from the
audience yes good afternoon I just wanted
[SPEAKER_05]: to segue also from the limited CBD
question that was just asked to go
[SPEAKER_05]: specifically in terms of industrial hemp
and cannabis I hope it's not sacrosanct to
[SPEAKER_05]: include that in the conversation
considering there hasn't been a whole lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of research done across the board but we
see so much of this industrial hemp coming
[SPEAKER_05]: from I think southern France is the
largest European China and it's you know
[SPEAKER_05]: it's invading our marketplace looking like
medical but it is I would like to know
[SPEAKER_11]: your opinion but you think about it okay
industrial hemp hemp is fantastic you know
[SPEAKER_11]: we know 20,000 products and one of I think
one very important aspect incidentally
[SPEAKER_11]: we're not even touching on in terms of the
new research era is research into the
[SPEAKER_11]: plant forget about all this clinical stuff
this is we're going to have more
[SPEAKER_11]: opportunities to actually research this
plant and as you would any other plant so
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is a whole vast area that
we're we're moving into that we're not
[SPEAKER_11]: touching upon it would be nice for the
previous panel to address that more but it
[SPEAKER_11]: and it is will be a lot of research in
terms of industrial hemp and I know
[SPEAKER_11]: there's a lot going on now with respect to
CBD to create a plant that's very rich in
[SPEAKER_11]: CBD let's say 20 percent like what we have
here in California with the ACDC in the
[SPEAKER_11]: non hemp varieties because it's above
point three percent THC but to create a
[SPEAKER_11]: plant that you know falls under that
marker for THC but still is very robust
[SPEAKER_11]: and rich in CBD that's where a lot of I
think they're far ahead in that effort in
[SPEAKER_11]: Europe but that's an example of how
politicized a needlessly politicized
[SPEAKER_11]: agenda kind of truncates and misshapes
research I mean who cares if the plant has
[SPEAKER_11]: point three percent THC or point seven
percent or one percent in terms of what it
[SPEAKER_11]: actually is going to do for a person if
you're talking about a drug or a therapy
[SPEAKER_11]: it really makes no difference point three
percent or point five percent because
[SPEAKER_11]: we've got the political situation it gets
a little skewed you know it's a real long
[SPEAKER_11]: answer that's required in terms of
industrial hemp because it's a matter a
[SPEAKER_11]: lot of it's a matter of definition as we
see it again we don't look at the legal
[SPEAKER_11]: definition of point three percent THC
industrial hemp is low resin cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: marijuana is high resin cannabis if you're
going to extract from a plant to make a
[SPEAKER_11]: drug you need the high resin cannabis not
the low resin cannabis in terms of low
[SPEAKER_11]: resin cannabis to keep the answer as short
as possible there's really two kinds
[SPEAKER_11]: there's the fiber hemp that's useless for
CBD and then there's the seed oil that you
[SPEAKER_11]: can make nutritional products varnish
paint from a very useful industrial
[SPEAKER_11]: product those plants you can get about
three percent THC from the foliage as
[SPEAKER_11]: compared to like our ACDC or some of the
other strains we have in California twenty
[SPEAKER_11]: percent you can get a decent serviceable
product from that type of seed oil foliage
[SPEAKER_11]: for CBD what it means you grow have to
grow you know tons of it to get a little
[SPEAKER_11]: amount of oil compared to what we have
here but from an economic perspective if
[SPEAKER_11]: you're in Europe there's no plant limits
here hundred plants right realistically
[SPEAKER_11]: you can't grow more than 99 so it's not
you can't compete economically with that
[SPEAKER_11]: source of CBD but it's not as good quality
but some you can make products that help
[SPEAKER_02]: people and if that's the case great I'm a
physician I've been working almost two
[SPEAKER_02]: years at a medical marijuana clinic here
in Southern California and I want to echo
[SPEAKER_02]: your comment about physician education in
general being needed I've seen hundreds of
[SPEAKER_02]: patients over my almost two years working
there and I would say that at least 50% of
[SPEAKER_02]: the patients I see the primary indication
they're coming in for medical marijuana is
[SPEAKER_02]: for chronic pain and the vast majority of
those also give me the comment I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: get off the opiates or I don't want to get
on the opiates and here we have a
[SPEAKER_02]: government campaign saying opiates are bad
we have to stop I get emails every day as
[SPEAKER_02]: a physician with programs about helping
physicians to get patients off of opiates
[SPEAKER_02]: the DEA will not deschedule right now they
say they're not worried about efficacy
[SPEAKER_02]: safety they're worried about efficacy it's
I'm sure it's not the first time the
[SPEAKER_02]: government's been speaking out of both
sides of their mouth but it seems to me
[SPEAKER_02]: there must be a way that we can leverage
the government's wish to get people off of
[SPEAKER_02]: opiates with the knowledge that at least
anecdotally that medical marijuana will go
[SPEAKER_10]: a long way to help this this a car we have
to do the studies to prove that this is
[SPEAKER_10]: better and less addictive and is an answer
to this every time there's an article that
[SPEAKER_10]: appears that talks about how to keep your
pain patients from getting addicted to
[SPEAKER_10]: opiates I always write in a letter to the
editor why didn't you mention cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_10]: why because the article was written and
paid for by a drug company that produces
[SPEAKER_10]: high dose ones and they're leveraging
their money by funding all these anti you
[SPEAKER_10]: know legalization campaigns because they
see this is a threat to their business so
[SPEAKER_10]: vote at the voting booth find people who
are not bought and owned hand-in-hand and
[SPEAKER_10]: work with your own medical groups and
societies and so forth to get them to
[SPEAKER_10]: adopt these you know resolutions in this
in favor of using medicinal cannabis it's
[SPEAKER_10]: a hard thing because so many doctors get
so much money from the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_10]: companies but there are others who don't
or you can prove their conflict of
[SPEAKER_10]: interest very easily follow the money is
one of the best things I always say I
[SPEAKER_03]: would just say physicians are required to
take continuing medical education correct
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't it be nice if cannabis was
included in that that would be wonderful
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah exactly education not propaganda this
is an area in terms of tremendous
[SPEAKER_11]: organizing opportunity to this is a way to
put pressure on local government city
[SPEAKER_11]: government state government I know in
Maine there was a advocacy effort as a
[SPEAKER_11]: result of doctors Dustin Sulot's work
there who's been one of the leading
[SPEAKER_11]: physicians in this whole field about
getting the state of Maine to recognize as
[SPEAKER_11]: part of its medical marijuana program that
cannabis is a therapy for opioid addiction
[SPEAKER_11]: it didn't didn't get passed because they
got a weird government they're kind of a
[SPEAKER_11]: tea party government but this is really a
right area for organizing it for political
[SPEAKER_06]: pressure there's a in every state now they
have a heroin task force you know opioid
[SPEAKER_06]: epidemic task force you know the medical
community needs to infiltrate all of these
[SPEAKER_06]: you know government bodies and try to
encourage them because if you look at all
[SPEAKER_06]: these task force reports none of them talk
about opioid as a potential substitution
[SPEAKER_06]: therapy absolute cannabis as substitution
therapy for opioids none of them even in
[SPEAKER_06]: legal medical cannabis states they fail to
address cannabis as a solution so we have
[SPEAKER_06]: a duty as people who are knowledgeable to
get on these committees and demand that
[SPEAKER_06]: that get attention on these task force
reports I mean I think we all probably
[SPEAKER_06]: realize that task force reports are
generally worthless and they sit on
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody's desk and never get read but it
is valuable to have that documented in
[SPEAKER_06]: these various states and I did want to
bring up I know yesterday somebody was
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about the the incis you know the
pharmaceutical company that dropped a half
[SPEAKER_06]: million dollars in Arizona to to fight
against the the legalization effort I just
[SPEAKER_06]: wanted to point out there's a quote from
their SEC filing so incis is the
[SPEAKER_06]: pharmaceutical company that manufactures
fentanyl and they also manufacture
[SPEAKER_06]: ironically dronabinol which is the
synthetic THC product but this was a quote
[SPEAKER_06]: from their SEC filing legalization of
cannabis or non synthetic cannabinoids in
[SPEAKER_06]: the US could significantly limit the
commercial success of our dronabinol
[SPEAKER_06]: product if marijuana or non synthetic
cannabinoids were legalized in the US the
[SPEAKER_06]: market for dronabinol product sales would
likely be significantly reduced and our
[SPEAKER_06]: ability to generate revenue and our
business prospects would be materially
[SPEAKER_06]: adversely affected so this is what we're
up against in all of these states these
[SPEAKER_06]: guys are the ones getting on these heroin
task forces talking about you know
[SPEAKER_06]: defending their position in the market so
we have to do the same thing we have to
[SPEAKER_06]: meet them where they're at and fight this
at every turn every single specialty and
[SPEAKER_10]: general medicine has a local and state
wide association and they hold grand
[SPEAKER_10]: rounds and I have found that that's the
best place to confront these ridiculous
[SPEAKER_10]: beliefs and attitudes about it I spoke to
the gynecologist and they said well you
[SPEAKER_10]: can't use cannabis in pregnant women and I
said where did you get that oh it's all
[SPEAKER_10]: over the place it's it's even in our board
tests well turns out that's total lie
[SPEAKER_10]: every single study that is shown like
Milly Dreyer's study of Rastafarians and
[SPEAKER_10]: those women who did smoke constantly and
those didn't the kids were the same and
[SPEAKER_10]: developed the same and I said and you know
we have a great opportunity is in
[SPEAKER_10]: childbirth because a lot of women don't
want to take the opiates they want to be a
[SPEAKER_10]: participant in the process well give them
a cannabinoid or a very low cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_10]: along with very low dose opioid and they
can participate and not feel like they
[SPEAKER_10]: were drugged out during that very
important all right event my question is
[SPEAKER_07]: does is everyone familiar with talk to the
hand campaign referring to government
[SPEAKER_07]: patent six six three zero five zero seven
it seems that if everyone knew about six
[SPEAKER_07]: six three zero five zero seven that the
government said that it is medicinal and
[SPEAKER_07]: non-toxic that it could be a basis for
different conversation if everyone was
[SPEAKER_11]: educated about that patent one thing about
that patent it's it's been misconstrued by
[SPEAKER_11]: the industry I think purposely as the
legalizing CBD or patent for CBD not
[SPEAKER_11]: legalizing and that's incorrect it was
based on research into CBD THC and other
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabinoids it's not just about CBD it
was saying a patent for cannabinoids their
[SPEAKER_11]: neuroprotective and antioxidant properties
which could have potentially great
[SPEAKER_11]: benefits for neurological and this is
stroke Alzheimer's and so forth and yes it
[SPEAKER_11]: underscores the glaring contradiction but
the way they get around that contradiction
[SPEAKER_11]: is through sophistry or they're not
talking about cannabis they're talking
[SPEAKER_11]: about individual components of the plant
marijuana no medical value but THC it's
[SPEAKER_11]: already recognized as a medicine CBD is
going to be recognized it is met single
[SPEAKER_11]: molecule very soon so it's a game that's
played verbally that's what's going on
[SPEAKER_11]: well it's not so much a cover-up but they
just will see it's on its way to approval
[SPEAKER_11]: we hope it should be a medicine in there
but you could already get something
[SPEAKER_11]: exactly like cannabis sad of X which is a
one-to-one CBD to THC sublingual spray in
[SPEAKER_11]: most dispensaries in this town you can
probably get something almost exactly the
[SPEAKER_11]: same except a little better because it's
not alcohol based it will be coconut oil
[SPEAKER_09]: based yes so is Saturday thank you to all
of our panelists I just want to make a few
[SPEAKER_09]: closing remarks a little bit of a
perspective from the state legislature and
[SPEAKER_09]: a lot of comments about the important role
that government can play hasn't been
[SPEAKER_09]: playing but could play if it if it were
more supportive of medical cannabis and
[SPEAKER_09]: research I think right now we're in a time
of massive transformation and change it's
[SPEAKER_09]: dynamic you know we had the Medical
Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act passed
[SPEAKER_09]: a year ago Prop 64 is almost sure to pass
in my view the California Medical
[SPEAKER_09]: Association did endorse and support the
Prop 64 and I've seen the attitudes and
[SPEAKER_09]: beliefs that have been discussed up here
changing and the legislature in the short
[SPEAKER_09]: time that I've been there there were folks
who you know fully adopted the stigmatized
[SPEAKER_09]: view of medical cannabis but changed
during the process when we were carrying
[SPEAKER_09]: the legislation so I think that California
can continue to have a leadership role in
[SPEAKER_09]: changing those beliefs those ideas those
attitudes and I think there's going to be
[SPEAKER_09]: more bracing of it we had a bill this year
that would have provided for research and
[SPEAKER_09]: development opportunities in the state of
California it got stuck because the
[SPEAKER_09]: governor's office wasn't prepared to to
support that given that they thought Prop
[SPEAKER_09]: 64 was likely gonna gonna pass and they
wanted to make sure that things were all
[SPEAKER_09]: harmonized but you know when in my view
when Prop 64 passes there will be an
[SPEAKER_09]: opportunity to revisit that and there'll
be a lot of other work to do to harmonize
[SPEAKER_09]: and synchronize the MCRSA with Prop 64 but
there's folks who are very interested in
[SPEAKER_09]: this we see the medical benefits we see
that medical cannabis can be an
[SPEAKER_09]: alternative to addictive opioids and all
the other positive benefits of it so I
[SPEAKER_09]: think those attitudes are changing I think
you'll see more from the state legislature
[SPEAKER_09]: so just a little bit of a window into the
mind of the collective legislature but
[SPEAKER_09]: let's have one more round of applause for
our amazing panel.
Thank you.
