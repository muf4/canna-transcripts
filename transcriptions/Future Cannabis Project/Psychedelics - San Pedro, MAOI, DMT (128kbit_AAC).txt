[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first of all, nice bowlet tie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to mention that right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we were talking about different
psychedelics yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys, do me a favor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Introduce yourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Thane Evans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Brian Junkers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were talking about you live in
Southwest area and grow San Pedro's
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in Tucson, Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, in the backyard under the
Mesquite trees, got a lot of Peruvian
[SPEAKER_01]: cacti.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that region, there's peyote that
grows, but it's really rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it grows really slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And peyote contains mescaline,
just like San Pedro does.
[SPEAKER_01]: San Pedro is a lot more amenable to
cultivation, because it grows very
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can water it every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can use it as a sacramental plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like peyote.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I think Peruvian torches seem to
be more available, generally speaking,
[SPEAKER_03]: in different horticultural centers where
you can pick up such unique plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a place called Companion Plants in
Athens, Ohio, where I'm located.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, they have different things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Peruvian torch is great,
because it's consistently higher alkaloid
[SPEAKER_01]: content, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like San Pedro's vary a lot and tend to be
at a lower concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: But San Pedro's more common.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you often just find them growing in
people's yards or in the parking lot at
[SPEAKER_01]: the bank or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very, very common.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you create a garden?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you build a garden to grow them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or what's the growing environment that you
created?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have raised beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, can you talk a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So amended beds with a little structure
over the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can throw some plastic over it
during the winter, keep them warmer and
[SPEAKER_01]: happier, and then take it off in the
summer when it's hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Tucson gets pretty hot in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't want to have it under
plastic for the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, I mean, I've grown them just in
pots, too, or bring them indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to live at 9,000 feet in Colorado
and had San Pedro up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd have to bring them inside during
the winter, because it was just too cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there a special soil, or where
you're growing them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the cacti really like calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to have plenty of calcium in
your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, you actually can't
put too much nutrients in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll burn really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even I used to make compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put it on all of my other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the plants love the compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you put it on the cacti.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cacti would actually start to get
these little scabs on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to back it way off and
dilute the hell out of it to actually make
[SPEAKER_01]: it something that cacti would like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can water them every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as your soil drains well,
they'll just grow and grow and grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll grow like a foot a year or more,
depending on the size of the cacti.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you were saying you've been through
different methods of consumption,
[SPEAKER_03]: just raw and now often dry out and put in
capsule form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever seen Christian Roche's book,
The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what got me into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in grad school at UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was wandering through the library.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found his book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I pulled it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like 22, 23 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I start flipping through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, I found San Pedro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, wow, this is growing in the
garden at the co-ops where I live.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I had no idea this was
psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Christian, in his book, he's got all
these recommendations on how people use it
[SPEAKER_01]: historically and the full use of these
plants, but also his own personal context.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's used it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the things he said was he
would dry and take capsules and gave
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations on dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started trying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also will brew brews with friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll go out and go on journeys in
nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you cut pieces of the plant off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you harvest the whole cacti?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always just cut pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll cut lengths of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to brew it,
you can cut a section, chop it up into
[SPEAKER_01]: little slices, and brew it for six or
eight hours or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm going to dry it, I'll despine it,
cut it into tiny little pieces,
[SPEAKER_01]: put it in a dehydrator for a few days,
and dry it until it's crispy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then powder it in a coffee grinder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then put it in little capsules.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with the brew, then, would you add
alcohol or anything to help with the
[SPEAKER_03]: extraction?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of like lime juice?
[SPEAKER_03]: Lime juice.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some sort of slightly acidic helps pull
out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's usually it.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how powerful is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you dose?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everyone's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find San Pedro to be really gentle as
far as psychedelics go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really an emotional experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you take one gram of dry powder,
it just has this sort of tonic effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll slightly notice perceptional change
if you're sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's more just kind of therapeutic
cleansing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you take four grams, you should notice
an emotional response and heightened
[SPEAKER_01]: energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mescaline is actually a lot like MDMA.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually got this energizing sort of
volume to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like more like an empathogen
type experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very much so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like six grams is much more
heightened, more even like going to go
[SPEAKER_01]: party and dance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at 10 grams or 12 grams, you're
talking full on psychedelic experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually, for most people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is conducive to a sort of micro
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's typically how I use it unless
I've got other intentions.
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems to be popular these days,
microdosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microdosing is very popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just so I understand, the plants,
the cactus will remain there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The entire plant isn't cut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're just constantly, it continues to
grow, and you just harvest from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So an individual doesn't need to
continuously plant new plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, it's a great plant to work
with because you cut it, and it will dry
[SPEAKER_01]: and scab over where you cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the cut part will then continue to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you'll have usually like two or more
will grow out of that same spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it falls over, it will usually
start to grow again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had cuttings sitting in my garage for
six months or longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I take them out, and they're growing
new growths.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still alive, and they're still
trying to put out new growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't stop these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got so much life in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if someone wanted to grow some of
these, what would they do?
[SPEAKER_02]: How would they go about doing that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you grow from a cutting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you go out and find it wild?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hard to find wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might find it growing in, like I said,
landscaping.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use it in landscaping all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to Home Depot or any nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: They usually have them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even if you just took a cutting from
someone, the only thing you really need to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure to do is let it scab over before
you try to plant it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So wait, let me get this straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Home Depot is selling psychedelic cacti?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they aware of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm sure some people working there
realize it, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone's taking all the ones that don't
look so good after a while, just getting a
[SPEAKER_03]: huge collection and starting them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this one looks sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't want to put it directly in
the ground if you just cut it fresh,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the bottom can rot, and it won't
root well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually, you let it sit for a few days
and scab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And be totally scabbed and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can put it in, and then it'll
start to put roots right out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to have it refocus its energy after
it's healed itself back towards root
[SPEAKER_03]: development.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there other people that you know of
that are into this particular plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, is this a known?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little obscure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Peruvian thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's becoming a lot more popular in recent
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever watch Hamilton's Pharmacopia?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming you like it.
Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hamilton is a big fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last episode I've seen of that show,
he went down to Peru and studied under a
[SPEAKER_01]: shaman, who's a San Pedro shaman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy asked him, so are you
religious?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, well, I'm kind of an atheist,
but if I had a religion, it would be this
[SPEAKER_01]: cactus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had mentioned altitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, Peru is pretty much up and
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So does altitude have an effect on how
this cactus grows?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or producers?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually really don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it would have been nice if I had
known more about it when I was living at
[SPEAKER_01]: 9,000 feet compared to when I lived down
lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just know where I live in Tucson,
if I leave them out in the direct sun,
[SPEAKER_01]: like full sun, they get unhappy and start
to yellow because it's just too intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they really like to be under the
mesquite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they love, especially when it's hot,
they love to be watered every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll just grow, grow, grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they love water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in Peru, it rains a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they grow, it's very rainy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a cactus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a cactus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, which is confusing for a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, you don't want to overwater
cactus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not a problem with San Pedro,
as long as the roots drain well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the roots get soggy, then they'll mold
and get mushy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are you guys seeing overall,
just in general, in terms of the
[SPEAKER_02]: psychedelics movement?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's really happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oakland.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's extending the language to entheogens
at large, which is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Santa Cruz as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Santa Cruz, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of taking, again, Denver's lead on
legalization here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Transforming it and expanding it is
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ayahuasca ceremony is obviously becoming
more popular in the states.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like you said, microdosing,
of course, is now on the rise,
[SPEAKER_03]: as far as trying to understand the
therapeutic potential there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, consciousness expansion.
[SPEAKER_02]: The therapeutic potential is just pretty
much off the charts, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, are you guys who believe that done
right, it could make for a better world?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no question, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I definitely believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I believe the only reason it's
illegal is because it posed so much of a
[SPEAKER_01]: threat to the oppressing classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that it's coming back around,
I mean, we have that opportunity to have
[SPEAKER_01]: it done right and used properly and get
the benefits from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about commercial potential,
like commercial, like on the market?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, is that going to happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard rumors about, yeah,
especially mushroom companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's a company, Silo,
that has the first nasal spray,
[SPEAKER_03]: actually, with psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's more of a microdose
administration.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think, you know, if you had enough
microdoses, you could probably get more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a Colorado?
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget where they're based out of.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, relatively new company.
[SPEAKER_03]: The research, I believe, is done in
Jamaica, where apparently there's an
[SPEAKER_03]: extremely wide variety of psychedelic
mushroom species.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so some research is going on there
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're doubling this for your own
purposes and friends and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any plans to expand your
garden?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, to grow other types of mushrooms
or something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I've grown mushrooms before.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with mushroom growing for me
was it was very interesting and
[SPEAKER_01]: fascinating at first in these very sterile
environments, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh, just the ability to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you've done it, then you
have to keep doing it over and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything has to be so sterile because
you don't want to get contamination,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't like having to sterilize the
shit out of the grow environment
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I could grow outdoors, like,
again, Hamilton's pharmacopoeia,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the episodes he's he's down in in
South America and he goes and finds this
[SPEAKER_01]: guy growing mushrooms and actually he's in
Oaxaca.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're growing mushrooms on sugarcane
scraps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the mushrooms are insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're growing so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, that's the kind of mushroom
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love the sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like the biggest mushrooms you'd
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that would be that would be nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they need so they need do they need
also a moist environment like a lot of so
[SPEAKER_02]: particular environments like outside?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really I mean, could they grow
wild, don't they?
[SPEAKER_01]: They do grow wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's different varieties obviously
want different environments or grow in
[SPEAKER_01]: partnership with different types of trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they want to be like companion growing
along with the root systems of these
[SPEAKER_01]: different trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it can be really hard to actually
cultivate certain types of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Morales come to mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Symbiotic relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's imperative to their growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they're, you know, very hard to
grow commercially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like cyanescence, azorescence on the
psychedelic side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are very difficult to replicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would only make sense to do it
because there's a cost associated with
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the effort, you know, the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yields are not massive, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why most people focus on
like the cubenses, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the yields are good and it's
consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like your cactus has nice
yields, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cactus is very, it's very favorable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just not really known or really
widely applied yet outside of Peru.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick question in terms of dosing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that five grams, 10 grams, 12 grams
range, is that dried?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dried cap, which is a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's pretty incredible when you
consider, you know, five grams of cubenses
[SPEAKER_03]: is a big boy dose.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Terrence McKenna's notion of
that being, you know, a full ride,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, you know, double that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just kind of interesting to
note.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if back to the environment and
like genetic expression maybe of the
[SPEAKER_03]: cacti, if it varies in Peru and if the
altitude actually plays into the level of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, psychedelic compounds that are
produced, mescaline that's produced.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not doubt it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the active ingredient in this
plant, mescaline?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mescaline is the most famous one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other alkaloids as well that are
present.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, like I said, the mescaline
content in San Pedro is much lower than in
[SPEAKER_01]: peyote.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's lower than in Peruvian torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were going to do the same thing
using Peruvian torch, you'd probably use
[SPEAKER_01]: like half the dosage that you would use
for San Pedro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So San Pedro is relatively, you know,
low concentrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, how many grams was five
grams of dried?
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Make a tea?
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it in caps.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's quite a few caps.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to wash that down with something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 500 milligrams caps,
so like 10 caps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool, 10 caps a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very convenient, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe a little brew as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't have to have the bitter,
because it has a very bitter flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you make cookies?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you make, you know, use it baking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some exotic dishes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm imagining good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never tried cooking with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: More of a savory dish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, I mean, you can brew it for hours
and hours and hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you don't denature it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can imagine you could.
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes me think, too, if there's other
alkaloids that, you know, we aren't really
[SPEAKER_03]: even aware of yet that create sort of the
synergy or entourage as with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids and terpenes and flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there's maybe something going on
there that sort of influences more of the
[SPEAKER_03]: empathogenic experience versus more of a
directly psychedelic experience with other
[SPEAKER_03]: substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would imagine.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think it's virtually unstudied.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like we were talking about,
like, which things affect, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: your alkaloid content?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, we really have no idea at this
point, because there's all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: studies that have been done since,
like, the 50s and assays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they all come up with different
results, even from the same stand of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, which is like different results.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that implies that there are men.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot at work here, all different
variables.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be elevation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be any number of factors if the
results are different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how could it be otherwise?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting, which sort of
also implies there's, like, more
[SPEAKER_02]: potential, you know, within this plant,
you know, once it's understood.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you know about the mescaline
content then and those different
[SPEAKER_02]: alkaloids?
[SPEAKER_02]: Were some studies done?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some studies have been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are some that are in the
Christian Roche book.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is Trout's Notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you aware of?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen the title?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like stories from Trout.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like there's a guy named Trout
who's done a lot of work around San Pedro,
[SPEAKER_01]: more than just about anybody in like the
in the lay field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's he's published a lot under a
synonym or what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just a false name.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does the plant look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does San Pedro look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's a columnar cactus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows up just very phallic,
tall, green, sometimes very, very big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually one main.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll grow from one main stock and you'll
usually get a few coming out of the base
[SPEAKER_01]: or sometimes just one and they'll grow
next to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But and what color is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's a fairly bright green,
bright green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it flower at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it has these beautiful white
trumpeting flowers when it does flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do they have any use, the flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They they tend to wilt and die very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: They smell wonderful, but I have no idea
if they're useful for anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they so this plant contains turpenes as
well with the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, any fragrance profile would be
an aromatic compound.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, most plants do not.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most ubiquitous compounds in the air,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I wouldn't know which ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, some analytical tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, where where where is this
happening in Arizona?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm based in Tucson, in Tucson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Tucson has a community, a fairly
significant community of folks that are in
[SPEAKER_01]: this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're like the epicenter of
where the the Bufo Alvarius Toads,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Colorado River Toad that has the five
Mio DMT and its poison sags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's that's where they're
indigenous to.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if there's other plants with
similar, you know, capabilities that we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know about growing out in the
desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a ton of suspicion around the
acacias and DMT content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of acacias have been found to
have DMT.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are all these acacia trees that
have not been studied or profiled yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I haven't haven't dug into the
science of it too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: More opportunity there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just around the corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything you want to add about those?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe just a couple more things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like Folares grass is another,
you know, opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Likewise, haven't really done anything
with it, but fun to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And speaking of MAO eyes, which we were
talking about yesterday, maybe just a
[SPEAKER_03]: brief note on what people could seek out
to potentially, you know, expand and
[SPEAKER_03]: extend a psychedelic experience through
available MAO eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm actually growing a Banastropis
capi as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, likewise.
[SPEAKER_03]: The psychotria counterpart to ayahuasca,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The vine and the leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: So both combined.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you grow that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a tropical plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really likes just to be under like in
the understory, growing up on other on
[SPEAKER_01]: trees, other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I have it outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hates the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as it starts to get cold,
it dies back.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've had it for I think it's like 10
years old at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how big is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many leaves are on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I could show you some pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gotten it got really big this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was finding out like taking over the
whole whole area.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it had stayed warm, it would have just
kept going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was super happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the compost tea I was using on
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because I was using bat guano and the
bat guano just was exactly what it wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just went crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, banistering is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other MAO eyes like we were talking about
passiflora, the passion flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a little careful with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it works fairly well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Toxic in high doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nutmeg is very similar, like toxic in
high doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a very effective MAO I you know,
when used properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's MAO I monoamine oxidase inhibitor
essentially inhibits enzymes in your
[SPEAKER_01]: stomach so that you are able able to
process and then bring to your brain other
[SPEAKER_03]: psychoactive without them breaking down
along the way and so expanding and
[SPEAKER_03]: extending your experience essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's very it's economizing to you
can really reduce how much you need of
[SPEAKER_02]: other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you take those in conjunction with
other with your with your psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that how that works?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and so does it make does it does it
increase the intensity or just prolong
[SPEAKER_01]: your experience or it really depends on
what you're taking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, this is I just want to say it's
a very sensitive area because right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some there's some dangerous
aspects to combining MAO eyes with other
[SPEAKER_01]: psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just just put that like it's sort of
like you don't do this at home unless you
[SPEAKER_02]: know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you definitely need to know what
you're doing if you're playing with MAO
[SPEAKER_01]: eyes because they because they inhibit
your your digestive tract.
[SPEAKER_01]: People there's they call it toxic cheese
syndrome or like there's certain ferments,
[SPEAKER_01]: wines, cheeses that can actually kill you
if you are if you're have a high dose of
[SPEAKER_01]: MAO eye and you consume these foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and there's contraindication.
[SPEAKER_01]: So often, like if you are on an MAO eye,
there's lots of other drugs they tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: not to take or not to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: So very good side note here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: More of a you know, just a conversation
about potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone you know, interested in this
subject, obviously, you know, a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: research is required before
experimentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's not really advocating
necessarily the use.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the conversation is very intriguing,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the notion that Oakland, Santa Cruz
now have, again, expanded that language
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of back to where we started here to
include entheogens at large is is a notion
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you know, society is interested in
exploring these compounds and trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: determine their therapeutic potential and
how they can really help shape the world
[SPEAKER_03]: that we live in and contribute to what
touching out what you mentioned earlier
[SPEAKER_03]: seems to be sort of a spiritual battle in
a way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's really the conversation is
about, I think, at large, just to be
[SPEAKER_03]: clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Light disclaimer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've disclaimed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just talking here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but but but the insider talk,
you know, is of value and and it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: like people aren't using these and doing
these.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why the conversation is important.
Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, cognitive liberty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what a lot of it comes down
to for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people should have the opportunity to
do what they want within their own school.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but but it's providing information,
you know, so that people don't go out
[SPEAKER_02]: there, you know, without the proper
knowledge that they need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody is necessarily as careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, really speak away,
you know, talk away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's the psychedelic reticence of
sorts happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means we're coming out of the
dark ages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's lots of misinformation and just
total absence of information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, listen, speak about that for a
minute, because what do you think are the
[SPEAKER_02]: largest bullet points or misinformation
that people in general or that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, for a fact, might misunderstand
about, you know, this this this area?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, one of my big one for me is the
psychedelic determinism that this drug
[SPEAKER_01]: does this thing to this person always.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That like I took this drug, so therefore I
must do X, Y and Z, almost like you have
[SPEAKER_01]: no choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no control over over yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes me think of Reefer Madness and how
cannabis is a gateway drug to heroin
[SPEAKER_03]: addiction, which is, you know,
what the narrative was in the 1900s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's part of what in other words,
you're not in control of this experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: The the the the the product or whatever it
is, is controlling you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not I think it's a product of
the fear mongering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, you know, there's all these
scare stories that have been out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, every drug scare story,
PCP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, you can name so many crocodile
from from Russia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always as if like this drug is
controlling this person and making them do
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and often, you know, people that do
really crazy things on drugs were in a
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly fragile or maybe a really bad spot
before the drugs were introduced to the
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things at play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's it's kind of it's very naive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like drug naivete to just be like,
oh, but specifically the idea of the
[SPEAKER_02]: predeterminism with psychedelics,
is that especially problematic?
[SPEAKER_02]: But but is that especially acute with
psychedelics, this idea that that I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: in control of my ultimate experience?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that is that the pet peeve?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I think it's very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because it is a very intense
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and there's this ego death experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part piece of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, and sometimes you aren't you
aren't in control.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you did make a choice and you just
have to like set setting dose are very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very important with psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So knowing where you are, who you're with,
what your intentions are, what your
[SPEAKER_01]: initial mindset was before you went into
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I as anecdotally, I said last night
years ago, not not not willfully of my own
[SPEAKER_02]: accord.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I ended up tripping with my mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maintained and everything was fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and then in fact, you you you can
control your experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and and and that's just a fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you might need to, you know,
be experienced a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your willpower is very strong.
Very strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, maybe we'll do a part two because
we're about to lose our sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our pleasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
