[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, welcome to Meadowlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we are blessed to be smoking
Frenchy canola hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a white buffalo that he made himself
and Jacob brought infinite euphoria from
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower Days Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got those stacked on top of each
other in this amazing vaporized hookah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're all doing this together,
community style.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flavor is unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smooth, tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tastes kind of like wedding cake almost to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got a stupid palate, so who knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, being able to do something like
this in Meadowlands with such amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: people in a community event like the
hookah is a special time in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at it bubbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to take this thing out of my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
