[SPEAKER_01]: Give some love to someone whose genetics
are like blowing you away right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, it's been a genetic that was
an 11-year hunt for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was in seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turns out it was a clone-only form,
and it was from southern Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a strain called Lemon G.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of our breeders are currently using
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a strain that's predominantly,
or I'm sorry, a cut that's predominantly
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the terpene profile to me is timeless,
and the original formation of that was
[SPEAKER_00]: totally by chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a bagged seed, from what I'm told.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had contact with the original
breeders over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original breeders, I can't necessarily
tell you their names just based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that they're still in a state where
technically they could be obtained for
[SPEAKER_00]: what they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I can tell you this, they are the
most fantastic people I've ever had the
[SPEAKER_00]: graces of coming into contact with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very much community-type people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a seed strain where it was a
total random crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got everything from a waxy old
overtone of that lemon terpene down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a skunk genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they said somewhere in there was
the original G13, but to be totally
[SPEAKER_00]: direct, I'm not 100% on the statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had only heard them actually reference
the original parent genetics twice in my
[SPEAKER_00]: lifetime after countless sit-downs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something that I know they hold
very dear, and I'm kind of glad I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know if that's the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, I do know that the skunk
genetic is in there, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: attributing to the terpene profile from
what they were gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That lemon terpene ended up being
everything from acrylic wax to full-on,
[SPEAKER_00]: just straight-up pine-sol.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that I came into contact with
actually nine years ago, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, it would be 11 now, had the strain for
two years, so that would have been a
[SPEAKER_00]: nine-year hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was the pine-sol phenol.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one that didn't sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Rick was saying earlier when we
were talking about, sometimes the terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: can be a double-edged sword, because all
of a sudden it's a great after-dinner
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, but not necessarily a every-moment
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that becomes a very big issue when
you're producing, especially on a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial scale, because sellability is
always number one on that based on,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, I shouldn't say number one,
because ideally the health of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and the people consuming it is the number
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say that'd be the number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ultimately it's one of those things
where you've got to pay attention to your
[SPEAKER_00]: market, and you've got to adjust,
which is one of the reasons why we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing the MAC takeover.
[SPEAKER_00]: What worries me about this is,
yes, it's a great strain, and yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cookies are great, but when the
cookies over-saturate the market and the
[SPEAKER_00]: glue over-saturates the market,
we start to see cross-breeding reliant on
[SPEAKER_00]: these strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where it becomes a very big danger
for us, because now we're starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: single-channel all of our genetics into
another genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this does is it actually lopsides the
market and creates a dog breeding issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will, where all of a sudden
inbreeding is almost a direct result,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's no around it because of the
way that the prior genetics have been
[SPEAKER_00]: bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to destabilize over time
and create issues or genetic mutations,
[SPEAKER_00]: which could be good, could be bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also believe that that's possibly why
we've seen such a dramatic THC increase,
[SPEAKER_00]: because in the last 20 years, all the
breeding we've been doing has been
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing these genomes so aggressively
that we see stresses that we never would
[SPEAKER_00]: have seen in an naturalized environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are plants that would have never met
in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that happens, we're stretching the
genetic rubber band and creating a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic variabilities that don't
necessarily mean everything we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of destabilization comes from
these processes, which is also part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cause of today's multi-pheno generation,
we'll call it, where it's okay if I have
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 different phenos come out of a seed
pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sellable seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, in the old market, that would have
not have been sellable.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, that's one of the reasons why the
Amsterdam market was so closed off,
[SPEAKER_00]: because those breeders had processes to
maintain quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't see those practices being
transformed today in very many seed banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be great genetics coming out of
those seed banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as quality of genetics,
that's not necessarily the equation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the equation is the long game.
[SPEAKER_00]: The long game of having that genetic or
some traits of that genetic not be mutated
[SPEAKER_00]: down the line by a incestual pattern of
breeding, which is almost in some cases
[SPEAKER_00]: and in some markets impossible to escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine the old days, when we had a lot
more quarantine going on to our groups and
[SPEAKER_00]: collectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We maybe had three friends that we got
introduced into the same thing we were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then out of those three friends,
maybe we have six, seven genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our breeding pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very shallow breeding pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where a lot of these hybridized
things came out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as America expanded its seed
collaboration, and became a seed creating
[SPEAKER_00]: populous, which used to only belong over
in Europe at the time, and maybe down
[SPEAKER_00]: south in South America, we literally
skipped some processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have a teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were accidents that were made
accidentally, which should be harmless,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're not to the end game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one of those things where a
miseducation and a little bit too much fun
[SPEAKER_00]: too early is going to cause us future
problems in this industry if we don't pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to them currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I say things like the mac's great,
or the cookies are great, but what I
[SPEAKER_00]: really mean by that are they're fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people working with them are working
with them for a very specific reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that they get what they need
out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're over breeding these strains,
we're destabilizing our future
[SPEAKER_00]: availability to further creation of
terpene profiles, terpene mixes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the availability to having a good THC
volume with heavy terpenes, or just the
[SPEAKER_00]: anomalies that we're not currently seeing
prevalently on today's market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, prevalently ever, because
we've been continually developing this
[SPEAKER_00]: crop only aggressively, let's say,
in the last 20 years notably.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really different when we talk about
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about things that have been
kind of corn with something that had over
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 years of development.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's a big change in pace,
and we still have time to fix these
[SPEAKER_00]: problems that we're now realizing have
been caused by shallow breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: shallow gene pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when we see destabilizing
genetics, we see pollen late stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: like basically week seven, week eight
popping out, single little bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all things that say we should
have went further generations or further
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes out before back breeding back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really where the stabilization
comes into play, and one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not seeing it in today's game,
because that takes years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're going to do that maybe
three, four, five times, but in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that, that's four times a set out that
it has to mix with itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's parents four generations back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we go back and do the same line of
sequence over and over again, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: how you get to the F-16s, F-18s,
F-20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get there, you narrow down
your phenos that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, what basically Rick was talking
about with the parents breeding to create
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds is once you have that,
that is your, that's your Mona Lisa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, what his techniques allow,
and why I have such a respect for Rick and
[SPEAKER_00]: Brothers Grimm, is they do a great deal of
work just safe lining their painting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't store their paintings in direct
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They literally sit there and have them
behind covered glass, making sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're protected, so when somebody wants
to enjoy them, they enjoy what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're enjoying what they remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, and this is not a slam on
nirvana, I've gotten great genetics out of
[SPEAKER_00]: nirvana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the early days, we worked with
nirvana on a couple of strains of ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked with them on Mystic Blue and
Papaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all, amongst others, Medusa,
Snow White, all kinds of stuff from them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what I noticed was after the EU formed
and kind of took over and altered our
[SPEAKER_00]: industry over in Europe, we ended up
having genetic issues with retaining what
[SPEAKER_00]: we remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some of the terpenes were still
there, but the flower formation was
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a papaya that looked like it could
have been wheat from the way it grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it would have produced crazy
amounts due to the almost, I'd have to
[SPEAKER_00]: say, a thousand heads it had, but they
were all no bigger than wheat,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it was kind of a really weird flower
formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Papayas known for big chunky flowers had
the smell, so somewhere along the line,
[SPEAKER_00]: destabilization of these genetics occurred
because now these are phenotypes that we
[SPEAKER_00]: never used to see in the early days.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all obscurities, and they're
from the same genetic profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why work like Rick was talking
about with going back and having these
[SPEAKER_00]: parents on Safeline is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, over in Europe with the EU shifts and
the raids that happened in Switzerland and
[SPEAKER_00]: Austria, we started to see that
destabilization be caused by the
[SPEAKER_00]: government, and not necessarily something
these breeders did, so to hold it against
[SPEAKER_00]: them is absolutely asinine because they
were just trying to make sure that they
[SPEAKER_00]: were staying in line with what they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, granted, they just got crippled by
their own people and pushed back soon and
[SPEAKER_00]: super far in their genetic lines and had
to go back and crack seeds for mothers
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Rick was saying, if you want to
change your lineup and get variants,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go for consistency,
you need your mother and your father to
[SPEAKER_00]: re-breed, re-breed, otherwise your seed
batches will vary from time to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, aging can be an issue,
but that's where proper usage of boron
[SPEAKER_00]: during these processes and phosphates end
up allowing for these seeds to be produced
[SPEAKER_00]: with all the micro, macro minerals and
elements that's needed for the protection
[SPEAKER_00]: of this genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I reference boron mainly because its
main thing in a plant system is to create
[SPEAKER_00]: plasma, which is basically the cushion
inside the cell for all the material to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay from placking and getting damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the reasons why boron is
actually very important in the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: industry as well as phosphates because
that increases vigor to the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: generally keeps the root base healthy as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are ways to kind of almost have
better and worse seed batches based on
[SPEAKER_00]: your chemistries in your grow room as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of variables that we
don't necessarily take into account when
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at who's consistent and who's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a big deal because we get one
chance to draw an opinion off of most seed
[SPEAKER_00]: packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very few of us are like myself and a few
other breeders I know that go out and buy
[SPEAKER_00]: 10, 15 packs of, you know, regular seeds
to go feno hunting through, get a feel for
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetic and try and pull something
that we can make a market with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really where feminization loses
its foothold because feminization,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, will give you what the breeder wants,
but you're going to ultimately end up with
[SPEAKER_00]: the same feno that the dude 200 miles away
has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in your market's mesh, it's going to
interfere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole idea with rego seeds or
regular seeds, sorry for calling them
[SPEAKER_00]: regos, regular seeds is the idea of
actually getting a true unrepeatable
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype because like Rick was saying,
there's very fine subtleties that will
[SPEAKER_00]: change along the way and that's really
what your corner stoning on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want that change in the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want that change to the actual
physical growth of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a denser plant than the others
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look at the gorilla glue and original
conception of the gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it came out, there were two actual
gorilla coup cuts from my knowledge of
[SPEAKER_00]: what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first one out was a lower yielding
strain that was identical to the higher
[SPEAKER_00]: yielding strain in almost every way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this could be a little bit of
folklore, mind you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no, I don't have this,
I haven't spoken with the breeder and had
[SPEAKER_00]: him say, yes, this happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but the idea is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sold out on the lower yield and aided
that in the public market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what I remember, they handed it
out, which at that point you're thankful
[SPEAKER_00]: to have an awesome genetic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's freaking great regardless of how much
he yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, later on, there was some issue that
ended up happening and I guess they lost
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to have access to that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was kind of the all of a sudden
lift in the volumes we saw from gorilla
[SPEAKER_00]: glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is that substantially due to genetic
drifting off of cuttings?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it could be that they actually came out
with the two different cuts, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just kind of an example of
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally like looking like your
brother, but being two inches taller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly kind of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why it's important to have your own is
out of a pack of a thousand, we say
[SPEAKER_00]: there'll be a couple of superstars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at the superstar to really
build your facility with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintain your market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go national or even want to
go and take over a state or even a portion
[SPEAKER_00]: of a state or even a portion of your city
with what you're doing, you've got to have
[SPEAKER_00]: something nobody else has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise the next guy can come down,
knock 10 bucks off your price,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's going to take your market and
walk with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we see this drastic
destabilization of the pound too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I get worried because
like we were talking earlier with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: genomes kind of bottlenecking,
we're starting to see price per pound drop
[SPEAKER_00]: because everybody's going to have this or
everybody's going to have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to eventually affect the
entire market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so not only are we shooting ourselves
in the foot in the future of having
[SPEAKER_00]: variabilities to our genomes, but we're
also creating a decomposition to our
[SPEAKER_00]: market at a much faster rate by centering
around just a couple of these genomes and
[SPEAKER_00]: not truly having that kind of what's next
feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of my favorite parts about
this is not knowing what's around the
[SPEAKER_00]: corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a seed pack from a regular bag
that you had from years and years ago and
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a sativa that blows your socks off
because it was done inside, not out,
[SPEAKER_00]: or it wasn't brought over in a tire and
sprayed with ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now granted that's extremely rare,
but if you're not going out and looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for these genomes, you're never going to
find the new genetic crunch, the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that everybody wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all have this essence of wanting to
be the creator of our own art.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what it comes down to
when we want a canvas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we want something that consistently has
a road painted in it before we get there,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as having a genetic that everybody
else has in that genome?
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden I'm stuck painting
land scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens if I want to paint an ocean
scene and have a big wave and an iceberg?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a road sitting right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like somehow there's a road there
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, and that's kind of what
we're doing with the genomes and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I speak on it as almost a
negative thing, but it's the exciting
[SPEAKER_00]: parts because you never get the bruises
until you fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never get the bumps on the nose to
tell you not to run down the hall until
[SPEAKER_00]: you face the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, these are our wake up calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are our moments to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've hit that point in the creation
of these genetic availabilities to really
[SPEAKER_00]: start to see the flaws and follies and
also the grands and the glories and know
[SPEAKER_00]: what's what and how to produce and proceed
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully with today's internet age,
we have access to more books than we could
[SPEAKER_00]: speak of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day when we first started,
it was a situation where you'd go to
[SPEAKER_00]: Barnes and Noble's and have your friend
buy your book and then he'd meet you at a
[SPEAKER_00]: gas station 10 miles from your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was absurd, but it was what we
had to do to feel safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nowadays you just hop on the internet,
Google up plant deficiencies and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: find out what's going wrong in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's one of the greatest
turnarounds in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great turnaround that I would have
never seen coming in my lifetime,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially growing up in this industry at
the ages of 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15, 16, figuring it out and having the old
ways kind of translate into the new
[SPEAKER_00]: availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I see from that is a lot of
carelessness, but from this carelessness
[SPEAKER_00]: can come a lot of greatness, comes a lot
of wake up calls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also can cause a lot of problems,
but just like anything else, anybody who's
[SPEAKER_00]: grown a business or grown genetics or
grown anything, it all comes with
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these problems that I speak of are not
necessarily truly negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, they're absolutely positive to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This industry, because without these
lessons, we ultimately might find
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves lost in the middle of the woods
instead of still in view of the path.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a big deal when we're able to
create health in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to maintain and care for others
and myself and, and really focus on the
[SPEAKER_00]: health and quality of the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something we're starting to see
with commercialization, with mass
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrometry, and it's creating a safer
product for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately when you have the genetics,
the next thing is what was that genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: grown with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we look at this market and we say,
oh, food's food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to feed your kid noodles
every day and just oatmeal and see him
[SPEAKER_00]: develop into a great, fantastic,
multidimensional human being?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he's going to lose his eyesight.
[SPEAKER_00]: He may not have brain development.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the same things that we don't
know we're doing to these plants yet by
[SPEAKER_00]: not knowing how to feed it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We aren't necessarily giving these plants
everything they can to create their best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're realizing in the
hemp industry as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these farmers are
intentionally starving these crops to not
[SPEAKER_00]: permit to making THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the understanding of food in the
cannabis plant is very much in its infancy
[SPEAKER_00]: in this industry, uh, just based on the
understanding of the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not in its infancy as far as its
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where a really interesting
correlation comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like handing a six year old a
cell phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not know what they have,
but they know they like it and they know
[SPEAKER_00]: that it does well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where focusing on all aspects
of your growth comes into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you talk to a gardener about
what's their water source and all of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden, Oh, I do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you treating your water?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you not treating your water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are you not setting a zero variability
in the biggest variable area of your room?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, your chemistry is your genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that may work right with the wrong
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important to start with the
full picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start at the base and work your way
up, but every single volume of this
[SPEAKER_00]: culture cultivation in the state of being
is important and just as important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's, it's interesting because you
may say, Oh, nutrients are more important
[SPEAKER_00]: or lighting's more important or mediums
just as important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is it's all important
because it's a symbiotic nature in which
[SPEAKER_00]: they mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to create that end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a nutritional line and see a
pound and a half production per light,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you can use that same nutritional line
properly and see three pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a various, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: As gardeners, cause it's, it's a
misunderstanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been working with GMO crops on the
ag fields for too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we associate farming,
we ultimately think a big ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we think of genetic development
and not realizing that those
[SPEAKER_00]: implementations have not been applied to
this area yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully never because that will
ultimately narrow down genetics and lead
[SPEAKER_00]: into the problem we originated from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's a monster deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm excited about is the massive
allowance of education that we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get from the internet,
the availability of clean nutrition,
[SPEAKER_00]: the availability of clean mediums,
the availability of good stable genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've been working on for decades and
breeding the same parents to create
[SPEAKER_00]: repeatable seed crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who are some of the sources you go to
online?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like are there any people on Instagram
that you're following or websites?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been doing a lot of, I've worked
with Brothers Grims for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done work with Nirvana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done work with greenhouse,
Barneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paradise was a really interesting kind of
run for me because a 15 to 18% ice cream
[SPEAKER_00]: plant went through mass spectrometry from
a greenhouse and hit 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somewhere along the lines, those
genetics got upgraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after going over what I knew of it
from the book of buds, it sit every format
[SPEAKER_00]: and profile of the original genetic and
that creamy flavor down to the rock hard
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers down to the, you know,
two and a half ounce maximum per plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really just about anybody's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the older breeders cause they tend
to have a certain style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working aggressively with Ethos
lately as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been really excited with a lot of his
limited releases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, you know, just because
it's limited, just cause it's a one time
[SPEAKER_00]: run doesn't mean that it's truly a lazy
man strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us may call it that, but it really
is something special and to maintain it's
[SPEAKER_00]: being special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these guys will put out limiteds
that are not just, Hey, I had this
[SPEAKER_00]: accident and here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually limited for being
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we look at some of the old like
the reservoir sour, the reservoir sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't necessarily get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a cut only.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of these old school strains
that were breeder strains and backbones
[SPEAKER_00]: for a lot of these new, new school
genetics, as well as old school genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: came from that time period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's messed up about it is that
bottlenecking because we're sitting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of that issue right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing that with the saturation
of cookies and glues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you look at any breeder's line and
if they don't have a glue or a cookie,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they're not in today's market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That says something because that's been in
their shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The potentiality for issues down the line
are there because that genetic is
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those things where it's cool
until everybody has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been the cannabis game.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of been our crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to remember that's
where we come from because that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: safe line, not only the future where we
can have things like the cookies and the
[SPEAKER_00]: glue come out, saturate the market,
but as long as we recognize not to
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily take that as a crutch,
but to use it as a tool, that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now we're getting a good
equalization of people realizing that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a crutch than a tool right now in
most gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that we need to walk away from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as much as I love these genetics and
have great respect for the breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: because they did a lot of hard work to get
these phenomenal things to the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of danger in the excitement
that surrounds them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost, it's almost dangerous to a
certain extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's kind of been one of my
more focal points of concern in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the reasons I've been focusing
on terpenes because terpenes are a really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting profile format that follows
through those genetic lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the hazes, for instance, you'll smoke
a lemon haze, you'll smoke a silver haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll smoke a super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will find that exact terpene
profile that's dominant in the haze
[SPEAKER_00]: genome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the same thing going on in our
elephant tooth, which was a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: blue ice cream, which is Bluetooth from
BCC before the scandal mixed with elephant
[SPEAKER_00]: and paradise's ice cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one turned into a full blown haze
based on the Bluetooth genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what was interesting about that was
the ice cream would have been the main
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic producer, I would have thought,
or the dominant replicant, based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that the seeds came from the ice
cream plant, which was one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_00]: why I really wanted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, Hey, that'd be dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it doesn't always work like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that we're starting
to also evolve and recognize is it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: as easy as it seems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's interesting because if
we're paying attention, it'll show us that
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got a lot of interest in this
market as far as retention, but we got a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people wondering how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're wondering how to do that and
it's their end goal to do it, currently
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're starting to see that interfere
with
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I think we beat that one up a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to leave it there,
but it's been a big bothersome reason for
[SPEAKER_00]: me to be very vocal about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
