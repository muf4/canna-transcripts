[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have any woodchip shots?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, no, like here's my road slide.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my road slide, which is relevant,
is some IMO.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm like, there's my road sliding out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's like my road,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so look, and I'm like, oh,
I reached down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, oh, look at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, oh, bring that back with me
and toss it in something.
[SPEAKER_06]: But woodchips, bunch of weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, woodchips.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, JLF, that's going to be like plant
food.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like all going to be plant food,
you know, basically just stems and leaves,
[SPEAKER_06]: nothing fucking fancy at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, you know, but I was going to make a
liquid plant food out of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the beauty of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of what the point I was trying
to make earlier is for when you
[SPEAKER_06]: intentionally do an anaerobic JLF where
you are putting this stuff in a barrel,
[SPEAKER_06]: culturing it anaerobically, speeding up
the breakdown process instead of nature
[SPEAKER_06]: taking a year, having to put it into a
hugel bed so that nature can break it down
[SPEAKER_06]: or, you know, whether you leave it
outside, let nature do it, whatever time,
[SPEAKER_06]: that takes time.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you put it in a barrel and you go
anaerobic on that, it breaks it down in
[SPEAKER_06]: like two weeks and shit's like gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like mush.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, and it's like, and it's
available and the bacteria that the plant
[SPEAKER_06]: wants are right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it cultures those specific
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_06]: So therefore you're out competing,
out competing anything that's not
[SPEAKER_06]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not welcome because it's not there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It shouldn't be there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So whatever's there is beneficial.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're just focusing on not bringing
outside things in and well, I mean,
[SPEAKER_06]: even though I am doing well wood chips in
my environment, there's, there's trees
[SPEAKER_06]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: So wood chips are legit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm just trying to like,
you know, mimic nature, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: but, you know, but that's more of an
intentional anaerobic process process,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost wanted to JLF wood chips.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to like, like, uh,
do an anaerobic wood chip.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually I, I, I basically am cause some
of the, I have thrown some of my mulch in
[SPEAKER_06]: there, which has wood chips, but I'm not
really going for, uh, I should do wood
[SPEAKER_06]: chips and see what they do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you got on wood chips?
[SPEAKER_07]: I got wood chips.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what I was looking at.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, these are some piles, uh, that we,
that, yeah, that were, oh, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: but then what I was going to show you,
what I originally pulled up was,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, you know, some of the starting
material, um, which like this right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be chipping that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, that's right on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me see.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's chipping like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: How long have you had that piece of
equipment?
[SPEAKER_07]: This one right here is a rental.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I, I have an eight inch chipper,
which could chip something that size,
[SPEAKER_07]: but, uh, we use a 12 inch chipper when
we're going to chip this, like we're
[SPEAKER_06]: chipping hundreds of yards.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think about chippers all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want one so bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is what I would say.
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just that thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is, so this is, uh, right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: This, this is, um, I have no idea how old
it is, but it's the, um, what I guess I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: saying, I know that it's been sitting in
this pile for 20 years, but I don't know
[SPEAKER_07]: if it was already starting to break down,
but what's going on here is this is just
[SPEAKER_07]: some really broken down fur.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, but this is actually straight off of
the log.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, right on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Straight off the log, baby.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we got like, uh, like this pile here,
I guess it's, uh, it's predominantly like
[SPEAKER_06]: wood chips and, um, worm castings and,
uh, that, uh, wisteria, a hundred year old
[SPEAKER_06]: wisteria, tan oak leaves, grasses from
weed whacking.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like anything that looks good,
wood duff without like raping,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, kind of take, it's easy to like
the, the IMO is it's a sensitive thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't really want to like over
harvest, like, like the IMO in the,
[SPEAKER_06]: in the forest, you know, it's like mining
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you really do want to be like really
gentle with it and then, and then grow it
[SPEAKER_06]: in wood chips.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this, this, this goes, there's actually
something like, I go down this road a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the, the ethics of using stuff we have,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's very obvious for the stuff that needs
to be pulled out.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then at what point does that go into
the, its own way of forest management?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's lying on the forest floor,
but it's helping to build soil for the
[SPEAKER_07]: forest by being there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I pull it out and chip it and use it
in my garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I damaging the forest?
[SPEAKER_07]: That being said,
[SPEAKER_07]: but they're not using it for commercial
production.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's why, yeah, once you start
reaching that, if you, you start
[SPEAKER_06]: questioning your own practices and you
really need to start like, thinking about
[SPEAKER_06]: like, like Jadam methodology would say,
you know, like Young Song says,
[SPEAKER_06]: go in nature, grab some vodka,
you know, in our case, it would be like
[SPEAKER_06]: some weed and go ask the forest how we can
use the forest to do that, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: work with the forest.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and just with thinning, it's great
anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, they're basically going to
be like cut more trees down and,
[SPEAKER_06]: and just, and just inoculate piles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you're thinning the forest to the
forest happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a flail mower for my excavator so
I can go up to like a 25 foot tree and
[SPEAKER_06]: even like a 35 foot tree because I can
flail mow the top off and catch the top in
[SPEAKER_06]: midair and suck it into the flail mower
and vaporize it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like a whole move.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like a trick move and I've developed,
but regardless of that, you can just
[SPEAKER_06]: straight up like flail mow a tree,
you know, to the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can vaporize the branches if you want,
if you, you know, go into the branches
[SPEAKER_06]: slowly from the, you know, and let the
flail mower suck them in.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll, it'll really just vaporize them and
shoot them right to the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if you want to go in like just like
fucking wild, like chunking, like just
[SPEAKER_06]: throwing shit everywhere, you can kind of
do that too.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's like throw shit everywhere,
hog it down to the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you're like, it's clear and that
works fine too in certain situations,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, but sometimes you just want it
more clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want it clean.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easier to clean up too.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I, you know, vaporize it, the cleanup
with a, with a leaf rake is like easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have leaf mulch, you know,
like, I mean, then you have like mulch,
[SPEAKER_06]: just like, you know, mulch up to your
knee.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like two feet, three feet thick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it's like insane how much
material that is when you mulch it all,
[SPEAKER_06]: a bunch of, you know, wisteria or,
or like some tan oaks or redwoods.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's amazing what a, how much,
how much material is there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it to the ground and then it just
feeds and protects, you know, erosion and,
[SPEAKER_06]: and a high, you know, it just feeds the
soil, blah, blah, blah, blah, on and on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I love my, my flail mower.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a great way to build up your amount
of material you have that can be composted
[SPEAKER_07]: in a quick manner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any way to accelerate that, I just.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you don't have to touch it like with
the chipper, but I have limitations,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, um, on size, but you know,
you end up with like a piece sticking up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just cut that down, you know,
and just toss, do whatever firewood or
[SPEAKER_06]: just make it disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can leave the tree alive too if you
wanted to, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean the tan oaks don't die.
[SPEAKER_06]: The redwoods don't die.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll flail a redwood down to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a little nubby stump as much as I can
get it to the close to the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it'll be in one year, it'll be,
you know, this high again, tan oaks too.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't die.
[SPEAKER_06]: Madrones don't die.
[SPEAKER_06]: The furrow die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just seeds itself really close like
that too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just find it like, just, it just,
yeah, it just, it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: so I just like flail mow it and it's like
saves me like, you do like 10 years worth
[SPEAKER_06]: of work in like 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sorta like that, but it's,
it's a rotary one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it rotates this way.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like this way.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the blade has a, it has flail
teeth on a hydraulic drum that rotates
[SPEAKER_06]: like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have, I have videos of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It shit throws material.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's like a chipper without the
chipper.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like having 20 flying goats,
like eating shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's insane.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would never be able to do the type of
work, you know, that kind of brushwork
[SPEAKER_06]: manually as one guy, a wall of like,
you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just, it's like fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just, it's like painting.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just like mow it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love my flail mower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I killed the motor on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was operating it on high, my hydraulic
pump on high.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was, that way I could really like,
you know, get some production going on
[SPEAKER_06]: because it was kind of too slow.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, you have to just kind of go
into a cut like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was really limiting me to like,
kind of like, you know, like work with
[SPEAKER_06]: the, you know, get.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I, I burnt my pump up.
[SPEAKER_07]: What amount of flow, what amount of flow
do you need to run the flail mower?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it was like, I was running it at like
25, which my pump couldn't handle.
[SPEAKER_06]: My, my, the flail mower pump couldn't
handle, you know, my excavator on high.
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of excavator are you running?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a KX 121.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a few, you know, it's a 10,000
pound.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a mini.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who makes it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Kubota.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you have a Kubota.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: You a track loader?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I wish I did.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need a track loader.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need something with, uh, either a PTO or
something.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need something either tracks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want wheels, but I can't afford
tracks, but so I'm just trying to use my
[SPEAKER_06]: excavator as like the all purpose,
you know, do it all.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a bunch of attachments for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can put any attachment that fits on a
skid steer on my excavator.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I've got like a hook up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I can put like forks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got forks on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was going to put a chipper on
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: For a skid steer chipper on my excavator.
[SPEAKER_06]: So then I could reach down the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And not.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I wanted to hear.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to, I was curious about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: If that was like a super good idea
because, or I could reach up the hill and
[SPEAKER_06]: put the chipper up in the woods and put
the chipper down in the woods,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and then actually, you know,
when the hills are so steep, then you just
[SPEAKER_06]: can like side hill, drop something
downhill and just feed the butt of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two feet right into the chipper.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you don't have to move really.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not moving.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not dragging brush.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not winching.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to reach down there all the
way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause a lot of stuff you can't reach,
you know, so it's crazy what we have to do
[SPEAKER_06]: to, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Work on the side of like a hill to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nuts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: He knows.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We live with, we live with, uh,
wood chips and usually I have wood chips
[SPEAKER_06]: on my hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I just use them straight up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: He was asking about like any screening.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think as they're breaking down those
veins are kind of, you know, they just
[SPEAKER_06]: break down so easily that you just find a
good vein or a pocket.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's kind of like, I like the
wood chips cause they kind of got like a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of meat on the bone.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: They, they last for a while where other
things just break down quicker.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, if you're just like,
it takes energy to apply them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, you might as well stay
around for a while where like grasses will
[SPEAKER_06]: just break down quick, you know,
like grasses or, you know, plant material
[SPEAKER_06]: breaks down super quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're, you know, you're kind of just
messing with it more.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's why I like the wood
chips.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just like, yeah, protein,
high protein carbs, not like grasses,
[SPEAKER_06]: which are sugar, you know, like less,
less, less of that, but more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the JDOM thing, just breaking
down those grasses anyway into a protein,
[SPEAKER_06]: getting the protein out of those grasses
instead of focusing on the sugars in the
[SPEAKER_06]: grasses, you know, I guess, you know,
so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a, but I know the stinkier,
the better it seems.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are maggots in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously, like giant,
giant, like maggots in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I can't believe I'm really
using this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how they get in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're obviously there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not claiming to like be any like,
like I really, I don't have a background
[SPEAKER_06]: in like science or a garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I was, my dad was like a sign
painter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a welder and a carpenter.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like my background.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kind of like winging it and
listening to whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just winging it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I don't know a lot of the
technical terms, you know, like I'm stuck
[SPEAKER_06]: just because it's like, there's so much
science and information now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been, maybe I've been doing
something for a long time, but you don't
[SPEAKER_06]: know what it's called.
[SPEAKER_07]: How long have you been doing K&F for?
[SPEAKER_07]: How long have you been working with K&F?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I guess I've been doing JDOM since
I've been growing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I've been doing like this no-till
thing since the beginning, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: so I've been basically, and then I,
I, I basically like about like five years
[SPEAKER_06]: ago, I, I went anaerobic just on,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went all anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which was kind of just an experiment
because I had broad mites.
[SPEAKER_06]: So then I took all the plants with the
broad mites and I put them in a barrel and
[SPEAKER_06]: a sealed 55 gallon barrel that was sealed
with the seal top and then added water and
[SPEAKER_06]: some other, you know, a couple other
things, but basically I just was,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, killed them, you know,
that was a way to kill any bugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was an ideal in the sun.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I did was basically cultured,
I guess an anaerobic, like a homeopathic
[SPEAKER_06]: remedy, which I then sprayed on the
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just like spray.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I don't, I can't even believe
I was doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I'm actually going to do this,
like this nasty ass, like, and I was just
[SPEAKER_06]: like, Oh, I couldn't resist.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just like, do it, do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just, I'm doing, my wife was like,
what the fuck are you doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just, I'm just like, I'm just like,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like something's taking control of me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've no, it's just, I have to do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I did it and it, and it worked and
it was fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was like no problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, you know, I mean, there were,
that was the year that everybody had broad
[SPEAKER_06]: mites.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a big broad my problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably one of our, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are ours probably.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them is, yeah, this is a mimosa.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is kind of like a mix,
[SPEAKER_06]: but like, yeah, it's a, that's a mimosa.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like white Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like the, that's the grow off
strain from last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still smoking it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like a year and a half old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I have three year old weed that looks
greener, just like this from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I, when I placed third at the Emerald
cup in 2017, I put out two jars or with
[SPEAKER_06]: two Mason jars away.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically you vacuum seal it in a Mason
jar and put it in the freezer and it will
[SPEAKER_06]: stay good for a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll stay green.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like this has been stored that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: This, this a white Tahoe was stored.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you see, I mean, that's like a year.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got those.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like a year and a half old for
sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every bit of a year and a half old.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's been, it's been out of the
freezer for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just don't, don't just, you don't open
the jar when you take it out of the
[SPEAKER_06]: freezer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just let it sit until it's there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, all the humidity goes,
you know, all the moisture goes away,
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just then you just crack it or
sometimes I'll just pull it out of the
[SPEAKER_06]: freezer, crack a jar, pop it open,
grab some buds while it's like all icy and
[SPEAKER_06]: shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Grab some buds, put the top back on,
go over to the vacuum sealer, revacuum
[SPEAKER_06]: seal it, stick it back in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's mostly what I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just like easier.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you just take your little head,
whatever half ounce, all that out,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, whatever, let it do its thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: In like 10 minutes you're like,
it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, sometimes it's, sometimes if
it's, if it's like, if it gets to be like
[SPEAKER_06]: two years, sometimes it'll need airing,
you know, just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: At about like two years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I've got something like three year,
over three year old.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it looks literally better than my,
it looks just like my, my fresh silver.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'm not even kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just starting to like kind of
break down probably, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: cause I've had the jar out now it's
getting oxidized, you know, I've been
[SPEAKER_06]: smoking on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still, um, you know, you know
what I want to do now is, uh, I want to
[SPEAKER_06]: test this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to retest this because I know I had
the test from when I harvested it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now I want to test stuff, start testing
stuff three years, two and three years
[SPEAKER_06]: later.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can, I would like to prove,
I would like to prove that, um,
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah, with our techniques, we can keep
weed like at like fresh for like three,
[SPEAKER_06]: three years apparently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Covering ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yo, cause did Ray, did Ray tell you about
like the eights that in jars compared to
[SPEAKER_04]: the same weed, same batch, same harvest,
the weed that we keep congregated
[SPEAKER_04]: together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we fucked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we don't have any eight jars,
but.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, they're dry and like it's starting to
turn the, the smell is starting to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if it's kept in the Turkey bag with
the other stuff, it's fresh.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like vacuum sealed or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like, Oh, just the jars themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we should, you should, we should.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know anybody that's freezing
flowers and taking it like cold storage to
[SPEAKER_04]: the shelf.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like actually incorporating that into,
I did let, give that away so everybody
[SPEAKER_06]: could preserve their shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause like there's so much value,
but we can take that to whoever's holding
[SPEAKER_04]: in quarantine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we have like, um, they already have the
frozen, the frozen thing going on and they
[SPEAKER_06]: have really good, I mean, even if for your
own brand, I could provide my own freezer,
[SPEAKER_06]: my own freezer space, you know,
my own quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if I want to just know that it's,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean that can be a thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you work with the retailers,
some specific retailers, like,
[SPEAKER_04]: no, our stuff is kept in the freezer and
we take it out and thought for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like a time machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a time machine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we vacuum seal it and then freeze
it and, Oh, but it won't be, Oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: at least it'll be vacuum sealed in the
bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we vacuum seal it in a bag and then the
jars are just like in flats that are
[SPEAKER_06]: vacuum sealed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they get, they can, even the samples
can be fresher because they're so showing
[SPEAKER_04]: samples that are like super old and
oxidized.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Open clothes, open clothes, open clothes
for months.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they can just take out as they
need it from your freezer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep it like a fresh sample.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's cute quality control right
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's some, that's a serious
shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is, that's real.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We should do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Raise cannabis, humble sunrise farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Working with the legacy farmers.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's been doing it for 40 years with a
bunch of goats and worm castings.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's been doing it regeneratively before
regeneratively was the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now we're trying to implement some of
these like CANF, these two Hewl beds and
[SPEAKER_04]: making the transition, you know,
to more regenerative stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully, I don't know what we can
talk about some sort of certification in
[SPEAKER_04]: the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: Throw it out there, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a certifications.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever the, you know, it's like,
it's just beyond that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all good, but you know, it's just
like labels and whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, like, yeah, we're trying to
figure out packaging and stuff ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what's the most eco conscious
packaging, you know, like, some corn
[SPEAKER_04]: plastic, some hemp plastic will be like,
will be cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some vegetable stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got some hemp plastics coming online.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear, but we're still rocking like the
glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, we got our, this is what
we're rocking here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look, we got the Emerald cup thing on
there from 2017 where we took third in our
[SPEAKER_06]: third decade old living soil with just
water.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one compost tea, just as a default,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: And default style, just like one,
just like two, two compost teas a year to
[SPEAKER_06]: my soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a top dress of wood chips and high
fungal, just, you know, and then the
[SPEAKER_06]: Hewl's like, it's kind of like a Hewl bed
within a Hewl bed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, it's, it's like,
what are the Russian dolls inside?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, basically it's kind of like a Hewl
bed inside of a Hewl bed inside of a Hewl
[SPEAKER_06]: bed.
[SPEAKER_06]: How deep, like for starting a trench or
like a raised bed with a side.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do like a subterranean pit thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little trench thing, a soil going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a full greenhouse size.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that's why I have an excavator.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why, that's why I say there's the
more work you put in on the front end,
[SPEAKER_06]: on the back end.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, I don't do, there's a big
difference between growing, okay,
[SPEAKER_06]: here it is, like in pots.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have, you know, on the in
pots on the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you got like raised beds on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you got like in the ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's like subterranean in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is, it just is some serious magic
going on there, but you have to,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to make some impact on the
environment to set it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then once it's set up, you don't have
to do shit forever, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I basically did gopher control
with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as far as, cause we have gophers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're kind of like, a lot of that like
tractor work is almost like because of
[SPEAKER_06]: gophers.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause if you're doing like high production
light deck, you kind of have to like lock
[SPEAKER_06]: your space in.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, you kind of like lock it in from
the gophers or critters because they'll
[SPEAKER_06]: just fuck your shit up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, you got no choice but to
take, you know, measures.
[SPEAKER_04]: But after a certain amount of years of
regenerative practices, cover crops and
[SPEAKER_04]: soil till.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's like, okay, you might disturb
the soil.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you disturb the soil initially,
but it's like, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, what we're doing is
like, it's so easy to bring it back with
[SPEAKER_06]: like make a JMS, a Jadam microbial
solution, which is what I was like using
[SPEAKER_06]: this year with sea salt, potatoes,
and anaerobic, you know, culturing of your
[SPEAKER_06]: microbes in readily available liquid form
that you can spray through a sprayer,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, foliar, or just water it in.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, which is just like solid microbes,
you know, it's just like a, like a,
[SPEAKER_06]: like a, just a, just a layer of just
beautiful like microbes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you just, you know, just, just trying
to out-compete anything else, like not
[SPEAKER_06]: worry about anything else.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like keep on the, you know,
um, proactive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure that it's always inoculated with
the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there's so many beneficial microbes
and bacteria and fungus that like,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, did you play with um, bran?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or was it barley?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it barley?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Barley is a cover crop or something?
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, not really.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just like kind of invasive cover crops.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, those natural ones that kind of show
up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Invasive cover cropping.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got some lamb's quarter that shows
up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like invasive gardening techniques.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Stuff that just like is invasive.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's just like makes my life
easier.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like nettles.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always like nettles and, uh,
purslane and like chickweed and different.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got these, uh, South African.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I got these South African ground
cherries.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got these South African ground cherries.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, like, yeah, those are cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You planted them or did they just show up
or something?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, no, I planted them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are they?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're ground cherries.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're just like a tomatillo,
vining kind of.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll pop up through the trellis and out
compete a plant and I'll just have to step
[SPEAKER_06]: on it and be like, no, chill out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you get some, some of those,
some, some good juices.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just like step on them, you know,
just like step on them and they're,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, chill.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what's up.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't take too much nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even worry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have potatoes in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like every whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grow everything in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody was trying to tell me you can't
grow brassicas in pot together.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, nah, man, I've been doing that
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: It works.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't like, they get that symbiosis
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I was doing, uh, okra.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was doing purple okra.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, that's the texture of okra and
that's something that I want in the bud,
[SPEAKER_04]: man.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on there?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of what, you know,
whatever, you know, yeah, trying too hard,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, you just, you can use whatever,
you know, yeah, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever's available.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, whatever wants to be there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just kind of like the pool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that works.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of nettles though.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of nettles.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do the horse tail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have horse tail on our property.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our in Spring Creek's got a ton of horse
tails.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were using, we were going,
you know, we jail left horse tail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I was folaring horse tail.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the JLF process?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's the, that's that anaerobic,
you know, culturing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what it's called.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm calling it culture more instead of
like fermenting.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably just like tomato,
tomato, you know, but like can.
[SPEAKER_06]: K and F are more focusing on fermenting
where I feel like I'm more culturing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not really like fermenting with like
sugar and trying to like do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know that fermentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not, are you sealing it up?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like culturing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying, are you put a fermentation
lock on it or just, just seal it up,
[SPEAKER_04]: check it every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, buddy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's so easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not even like rocket science,
but any, you know, it's really just so
easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took some, it's just that we just,
you know, the first time I played,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is the first year I played with some
horse tail extract and I, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: went out in the morning, got this little
new growth spears of it, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: five gallon bucket of it, some boiling
water, mashed it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I inoculated it with the
lactobacillus serum, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: let that cook for a week, sealed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, the plants did some big
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they just went on whole mode and the
pest pressure was like down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't really, I don't know what was
going on, but something good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna do some more of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: This stuff works.
[SPEAKER_04]: This stuff really works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did some lab this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you... A foliar.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did a foliar even at like week.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had like a couple of like some like leaf
necrosis and like show up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like trying to just keep the
beneficial bacteria on the leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, buddy.
Hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's for the labs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like do you harvest them from the air or
are you using some EM1?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I just get a bottle of EM1.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't even make this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was my buddy made it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're using them IMOs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just really going IMO.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going like heavy on the IMO.
[SPEAKER_06]: He gave me some labs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used it and cause we were like,
I was like, I think I need it actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would really help with my situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had like this plague cause somebody got
KNF like sloppy or KNF crazy on my shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, and I, they gave me the plague.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were calling it the plague.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ended up with like what we were calling
a plague, which was like a leaf necrosis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, like eating like fucking like leafs
were stuck like eating into it and like he
[SPEAKER_06]: gave me like whatever you don't want to
hear.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, you know, what a whatever,
you know, it came from the dude left his
[SPEAKER_06]: sprayer in the sun with his shit and
didn't clean out his sprayer left in the
[SPEAKER_06]: sun sprayed after that did whatever
basically did whatever happened in there
[SPEAKER_06]: went onto my plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that wasn't good.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not what I was going for.
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed some, that's why I said KNF
sloppy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a mutant serration from that lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: KNF done wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I had to come in with like zymes to
just kind of like get like, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: nip it in the bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but at that point, the plants were so
loud that, that it was literally like eye
[SPEAKER_06]: tearing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they were loud, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, Whoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I zymed them and it killed it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It really did take out that it took that
out.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I mean, it's still loud, but it was,
yeah, it affected the turps for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I feel like I had to do that because
it was just a dangerous situation,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and it was 2019.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to pay the bills.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: And not to be like that, but it was like,
that was my only harvest of the year too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have any, so I really just had to
just, you know, make sure it was good.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's tough.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's trying not to spray shit,
but whatever, you know, it wasn't bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, zymes ain't bad at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's totally legit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_06]: it was fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: It turned out fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I labbed, and then I labbed after
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dr. Zymes, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I was going to maybe hit it with a
Jadam sulfur and, and, and, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: the whole, the whole Jadam, you know,
but I was like, you know, I just got to
[SPEAKER_06]: like, you know, no, do something.
[SPEAKER_06]: That, um, is more reliable right now
because I wasn't ready for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have the stuff made up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, and then besides that and the,
the, the, uh, aphid pressure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Holy cow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never seen, never seen anything like that
before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever it's like, whenever something
new, it's just like, oh fuck, oh fuck,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then afterwards it's like,
okay, there's, there's a natural cycle to
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to, you know, we're going to
find a balance.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was spraying like three times in the,
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would spray off, I would do spray zymes
in the morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: For the aphids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I would come through and
physically spray off again, physically
[SPEAKER_06]: remove them dead bodies and spray them
off.
[SPEAKER_04]: That pressure was like the best thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get them off.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I would let that dry,
you know, dry off.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I'd come through and spray like a
Rosemary horse tail, whatever I was
[SPEAKER_06]: making.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, a bunch of stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, JMS, JLA, spicy peppers kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, no, I was just more going like
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, uh, not past, not
necessarily for them, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: to fight the past, but just for the
plants, you know, just to restore the leaf
[SPEAKER_06]: surface.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Using those essential oils.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was all in like the morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my, that was like three sprays in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like that's how every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Three, three sprays.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, like as long as just whatever,
as long as it doesn't, you don't even
[SPEAKER_06]: have, you don't ask how long it's just for
whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Forever until for whatever you need to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, but then when you get that shit
under control, then it was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: but dude, it never really got super under
control from what I saw.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just saw that they didn't end up infest.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't like to infest in the resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't like to like have babies and
prolificate in the flowers, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, it wasn't a big problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really scary in a late veg,
early flower, but because you seem like
[SPEAKER_04]: they're on the buds, they're on the bud
sites.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on, man?
[SPEAKER_04]: But after the resin showed up,
that started like, oh, it's protecting
[SPEAKER_04]: itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we didn't, I don't think we needed to
worry about it as much as we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at their neighbors that really
didn't do shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just let the green lace wings show up
and the ladybugs show up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't know what they were.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and they showed up in such
numbers that they thought there was an
[SPEAKER_04]: infestation of some mutant shit,
but they were green.
[SPEAKER_04]: Green lace wing larva, you know,
and they were just, you could just watch
[SPEAKER_04]: them in the macro video, just chomping
away at those aphids, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, like they need the aphid
pressure so the population, so the
[SPEAKER_04]: beneficial population gets to balance,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think next year we'll be able,
we'll be able to ride the aphid problem a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit more smoothly, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, like I don't even want to say
what's, you know, what next year,
[SPEAKER_06]: who knows what problems we could have.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's always something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully it's not a cold summer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's every other year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe give us a break.
[SPEAKER_04]: The lack of extreme temperature in that
winter and like we didn't have much snow
[SPEAKER_04]: and a lot of it was cold and have a lot of
heat and we didn't have enough heat to
[SPEAKER_04]: process through some of the food,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we were like, we fed nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was cold in cold conditions,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't have the sun to process it.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of bad things can start happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that sun will come out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, I hear that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I hear that.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you have like a fire, if there's a fire
and the sun gets blocked out from the
[SPEAKER_06]: fire, it's like, it can just be anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the sun is like super inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's never like the same twice,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't have a 100 degree day all summer
long, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think like no day in your life will be
the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's amount of light, you know,
quality and quantity of light.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll never be as, it's just so
inconsistent that every day the light
[SPEAKER_06]: levels are different in your life.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll never be like the same brightness.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe somebody's going to prove that
wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're right spot on.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's somebody, something told me,
so I don't know, just so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why 2018 is a little bit different
than 2019.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's why.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every year is just so different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's part of the beauty of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you just guys, why you need tools in
your toolkit to adapt.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where the full spectrum comes in.
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the two plots you guys are on,
I assume you have, or the two,
[SPEAKER_08]: his property and Melody's property,
you have a lot of plots that are all
[SPEAKER_08]: facing different directions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, different little microclimates
appellation.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's little pockets on the lower
elevation where the cold sits for a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit more humid, higher
elevation, a little bit more dry,
[SPEAKER_04]: a little bit more intense exposure to the
sun out of the trees.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you see the soil dries out a little
bit differently at those different
[SPEAKER_04]: elevations and microclimates.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, trying to stick to the VPD a
little bit to get that turgor pressure
[SPEAKER_04]: going, firing all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tricky because you got all these kind
of in multiple places at different times.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm thinking about the soil down at
1,300 feet versus 2,000 feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's totally different things going
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a cool little thing to follow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you just got to adapt and try to
keep everything consistent.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Consistency, consistency, consistency.
[SPEAKER_06]: So no matter whatever you're doing,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, doesn't even matter whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's consistency, consistency,
consistency.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what equals quality, I think,
ultimately.
[SPEAKER_06]: Consistency equals quality.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a bunch of other shit, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for having me.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
