[SPEAKER_01]: So, the loaded question in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: The loaded question in the room that
everybody's like, now with this regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry, this regulated cannabis
industry, we must be getting some really
[SPEAKER_01]: good, high quality tested cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those testing facilities must be working
overtime well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What has been your experience on that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are far too few labs and far too
many people who need to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the few labs there are, they keep
getting themselves shut down for just
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit, like lying about six months
worth of test results, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: six months worth of recalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 700 batch recalls from one lab who
screwed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was fortunate not to be caught up in
that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks different on when I had actually
produced, that would have been my lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be doing a recall right now,
which would be horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if our manufacturer products were
screwed, because we're like third down the
[SPEAKER_01]: line in testing, and if something fails
somewhere and it gets recalled earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the oil that we use got later on
failed, then they come and look at our
[SPEAKER_01]: audit for us using that oil, and we can
get screwed twice, because our lab may
[SPEAKER_01]: have tested it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at the previous COAs and went,
oh, it must be okay, and not flag it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worry that we don't get the same quality
level testing that concentrates and flyers
[SPEAKER_01]: do, because the labs are trying to get us
through so quickly at the end,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they just kind of probably look,
well, it passed already, and I'm worried
[SPEAKER_01]: that we might be getting rubber stamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to have those issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that happened that time,
because we didn't use the same lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand, but you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like they do hinky shit, and if it's
a profit motive for them to get more
[SPEAKER_01]: people in their throughput, and okay,
as long as I get this done this year,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I made my nut and I'm gone,
that's the reason why it looks like- I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult to do oversight and
regulation of labs, because so few people
[SPEAKER_00]: actually understand lab processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very professional job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your average person going in to look at it
doesn't know what they're looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually surprised that the BCC
inspectors were able to identify that that
[SPEAKER_00]: one lab I was talking about had a bad
machine, because normally they would just
[SPEAKER_00]: take it at your word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they defer to the professionals
within a given field.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're regulatory people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know STEM methods of lab
procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know that, so they assume that
the professionals in those areas are the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though we were throwing out various
different questions like, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: why doesn't the state have its own
self-internalized reference frame,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a cannabis that they send to all the
tests, that they already have tested
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves to be able to validate what the
machine should be reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: Standardize on a cleaning solvent so that
all of them are using the same cleaning
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent so they have the same resolution
when they come back for testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that one group doesn't have a different
resolution testing than another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all things that they're unaware
of that they even need to be looking into,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they just assume that most of
these industries regulate themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get stuck with the problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The testing is also a bit excessive,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we ever formulate our products,
the cannabis material, the regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: material that goes into it gets tested
twice before it even gets into our hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after we make our products,
it gets tested again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where this gets tricky, especially going
into phase three, which starts January
[SPEAKER_00]: 1st, phase three testing and January 1st,
it's highly likely that common ingredients
[SPEAKER_00]: like the olive oil that we use or the
avocado oil or even the ginger extract
[SPEAKER_00]: could be, quote unquote, contaminated in a
way that would be harmful if you were
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking a flower, but has zero potential
for harm delivered on the surface of your
[SPEAKER_00]: skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's absolutely no differentiation in
testing between the actual potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: harm of some of these ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all treated as if you were going
to smoke and eat them, even when that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not happening at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that a certified organic approved
to be food grade on the shelves olive oil
[SPEAKER_00]: could fail a cannabis test because of
something like lead in the soil that the
[SPEAKER_00]: olive tree was growing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arsenic in the well water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sensitivity on the testing and how far
that scope goes way beyond just the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis ingredients, but all the way to
every ingredient you're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: it needs to be fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be fixed eventually, but for now,
we're just hideously overregulated.
We'll be right back.
