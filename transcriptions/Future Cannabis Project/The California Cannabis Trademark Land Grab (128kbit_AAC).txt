[SPEAKER_01]: People who create killer genetics being
able to give it out and know that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not gonna lose control and get fucked and
never be the ones like someone's just
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna steal it and run on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really two areas of intellectual
property that that would relate to and
[SPEAKER_00]: your strongest level of enforcement would
be a patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also really hard to get but if it could be
granted it would have a range of profile
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabinoids, growing style for the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be very specific to that kind
of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we haven't seen any of that enforced
yet in the industry but in theory if
[SPEAKER_00]: someone stole your genetics that was an
exactable one-for-one if you could have a
[SPEAKER_00]: patent registered on this prior to putting
it in commerce or prior to the theft you
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be the strongest enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people are not gonna do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people can't afford that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question of being able to show the
evidence that you actually cultivated in a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific way that would qualify for the
patent registration most people can't
[SPEAKER_00]: really provide that evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more accessible way would be through a
trademark and what you would do is you
[SPEAKER_00]: would concede that the genetics are gonna
get out but what you would focus on is
[SPEAKER_00]: this is so we'll say the strain is
stardust right that's what you decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would focus on I am great seeds which
is the brand trademark stardust.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if other people are buying stardust
from other creators or other cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators they just they trust your
brand and I think that is one of the best
[SPEAKER_00]: ways we can do it right now because if you
see other packaging so long as you record
[SPEAKER_00]: your trademark with the state of
California which as of January 2nd at 9 a
[SPEAKER_00]: .m.
[SPEAKER_00]: they started accepting cannabis trademarks
for cannabis goods and services so long as
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not trying to trademark the name of
the strain which is not allowed at the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal level if a plant has ever been
identified by its cultivar rule 12 0 2 dot
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 I believe of the TMEP states that any
plant identified by its cultivar that
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar is not able to be registered as a
trademark if you want to do more research
[SPEAKER_00]: on this check out what happened with the
Honeycrisp Apple situation that they filed
[SPEAKER_00]: the patent in the patent identified
Honeycrisp as the cultivar then University
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a Minnesota went to seek
trademark protection at the federal level
[SPEAKER_00]: for Honeycrisp to which for the
application the inquiry was well is this
[SPEAKER_00]: the name the cultivar name of the plant
and on the patent it was registered as the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar name so that they ended up
getting denied they filed a trademark on
[SPEAKER_00]: Honeycrisp so this law is already in
effect for plants and actually for doing
[SPEAKER_00]: more research they use the same law in
Canada so there is a novel issue with
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to protect strain names as
trademarks right now that I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is going to have to deal with a
lot in the upcoming years probably in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next two years we're going to see a lot
more of this but if you are the farm the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed company any of these brands and you
sell it as farm trademark TM this strain
[SPEAKER_00]: for stardust that is a way to protect it
and you can have strength in this because
[SPEAKER_00]: if you see anyone else claiming sure the
genetics might get grown you're we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to assume it's inferior quality if
it's better than you yours that only in
[SPEAKER_00]: certain ways helps your legacy if you say
I originally came up with a strain but if
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone else is claiming that is directly
from your source you're going to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to fight that which is a new opportunity
in California second night yes of this
[SPEAKER_01]: year yeah if I'm just an amazing rower and
reader I think the issue now is I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: guard that right like the Colonel secret
recipe right which is a trade secret right
[SPEAKER_01]: so do you see any time soon us getting to
the point where I as the amazing reader
[SPEAKER_01]: slash cultivator would willingly for
example give my clipping
[SPEAKER_00]: right into the market I kind of a cheeky
answer it depends on the rage of
[SPEAKER_00]: penetration you want your genetics to have
in the market maybe you're like you find a
[SPEAKER_00]: sweetheart deal and you just do a license
of I'm gonna write a contract with this
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator and give them just one plant
that they're and this is the one company
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm gonna do it with because I really
believe in their ability to propagate this
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you would do that especially if you
have some mystique or some renowned for
[SPEAKER_00]: being a geneticist there I think that
could be viable but if you want to hold it
[SPEAKER_00]: really tight trying to establish that
chain of control is very difficult right
[SPEAKER_00]: now because really if one clipping gets
out unless you've taken steps like filing
[SPEAKER_00]: a patent or registering a trademark and
the genetic did lose trying to assert
[SPEAKER_00]: ownership over that is unrealistic it's
just not gonna happen right now so I think
[SPEAKER_00]: you either have a really structured I mean
if you wanted to try and I don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: think protecting it as a trade secret
would work that well because as soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: you share it with someone it's not really
a secret so yeah I think protecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: name of it as a trademark or trying to get
registration as the patent is best but I
[SPEAKER_00]: do think there is incentive for people
developing genetics to share this you just
[SPEAKER_00]: have to create the brand around the
genetics that's the thing that will be
[SPEAKER_00]: easiest for you to protect and then it's
just an incentive of I provide quality
[SPEAKER_00]: clones or quality seeds which I think
there's going to be an increased demand
[SPEAKER_00]: for that I think there's a really solid
role for nurseries especially supplying
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent clones to these large-scale
cultivating operations that maybe don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to deal with having a constant clone
supply or dedicating part of their grow
[SPEAKER_00]: operation to creating mother plants and
doing that upkeep so I think you could
[SPEAKER_00]: make a name for yourself definitely as a
nursery
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be a lot of restrictive
clauses so focused on how much plot space
[SPEAKER_00]: do I get how many plants are you going to
have in production for me how many clones
[SPEAKER_00]: or do you have to be accountable for
tracking how many clones you take do I get
[SPEAKER_00]: to try and dictate who you sell the clones
to things like that so I can try and
[SPEAKER_00]: control the chain of command the question
for a lot of these would be would they be
[SPEAKER_00]: enforceable terms I feel like we haven't
really tested that as much in California
[SPEAKER_00]: this is going to happen though I think
this is an issue that probably there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of agreements being developed around
these terms right now so a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions of just do I have the ability
to inspect your site do I have because a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of these are like getting creative
with the bound of control without saying I
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have an ownership interest in
your business or and because you're still
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially running the risk of having
someone be like tear up your contract I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go do whatever I want so I think
for someone developing genetics finding
[SPEAKER_00]: the solid relationship first where
hopefully you're never going to need to
[SPEAKER_00]: enforce the contract is key or your
inverse of that is I just believe in my
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics I want them out there I have my
trademark attached to this and they get to
[SPEAKER_00]: use my trademark saying I'm buying clones
from nursery X or seed producer X and I
[SPEAKER_00]: just want everyone to have them like if
everyone of all of California was growing
[SPEAKER_00]: my genetics I would love that because my
market penetration is amazing so yeah I
[SPEAKER_00]: think trying to control these things where
if you find out your employee so I give
[SPEAKER_00]: you this plan and I find out your employee
brought it home and shared it with their
[SPEAKER_00]: friends trying to have some form of legal
recourse and then then like enforcing that
[SPEAKER_00]: is really difficult and cost prohibitive
for a lot of businesses so theoretically
[SPEAKER_00]: that could work but then trying to assess
what are the damages you know where is the
[SPEAKER_00]: the value that was detracted from my my
part of the contract that seems kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: onerous and undefined right now once again
I mean it's going to depend contract and
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship by relationship contract by
contract but I think the enforceability
[SPEAKER_00]: for a lot of these things would be more
cost prohibitive it's a lot easier if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: premised around something like you're
infringing on my trademark you're using my
[SPEAKER_00]: trademark in a way I don't want or in the
case of if there was a patent registered
[SPEAKER_00]: in that sense but just hey I wrote a
contract with you I trust you with my
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics don't dick me over that is a
harder one to the forest especially for
[SPEAKER_00]: assessing damages
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of my practice is in trademarks
and because California just started this
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to to register trademarks for
cannabis goods and services there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a land grab going on right
now and if you register first trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: invalidate that registration if someone
else is the superior right to the
[SPEAKER_00]: trademark is fairly problematic it's
litigation there's not a I'm gonna call up
[SPEAKER_00]: and complain to the state and invalidate
your trademark that really doesn't happen
[SPEAKER_00]: so trying to establish what you own right
now is huge talking about agreements and
[SPEAKER_00]: other issues that are coming up the due
diligence side the wild claims of who owns
[SPEAKER_00]: what right now is are pretty amazing in
some cases and doing the actual due
[SPEAKER_00]: diligence of saying if I'm gonna contract
with you make sure that I see
[SPEAKER_00]: documentation substantiating that you
actually own this intellectual property
[SPEAKER_00]: not a hey I own this because there has
been certain famous strains that have made
[SPEAKER_00]: the news where there was an assertion of I
own this because I'm telling everyone I do
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't make it legally binding and
there is some of that going on right now
[SPEAKER_00]: so I encourage diligence especially have
an understanding of whatever you're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to license and make sure that you've taken
steps to protect it or if you're taking
[SPEAKER_00]: your licensing something from someone make
sure it actually has value there is a very
[SPEAKER_00]: low understanding I feel like of different
intellectual property issues in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis space right now and I don't
expect everyone to just know these things
[SPEAKER_00]: you know but work with someone who does
because I've seen I'll I've seen some
[SPEAKER_00]: agreements that I don't know if they will
they would hold up in court I've seen some
[SPEAKER_00]: requests that I don't think are reasonable
and then from the other side of outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: agreements I've seen some filings and
recordings that have been done that are
[SPEAKER_00]: just completely invalid or should never
have been done and so I think there is an
[SPEAKER_00]: immense amount of value going forward for
protecting your intellectual property but
[SPEAKER_00]: having an understanding what that actually
is and if it one is it protectable to have
[SPEAKER_00]: I taken the steps to protect it or three
if I'm engaging someone else do they own
[SPEAKER_00]: it like those are really fundamental
questions you need to be asking so with
[SPEAKER_01]: everything you just said can we give some
concrete examples because you said like
[SPEAKER_01]: intellectual property so like that like an
example that be like I created Peters
[SPEAKER_01]: brand in Colorado and you're gonna license
Peters brand in California right your
[SPEAKER_01]: point that you the California guy should
make sure I can show you trademarks yes
[SPEAKER_00]: and in that case you're probably gonna
write into part of the licensing agreement
[SPEAKER_00]: when you license into California I'm not
gonna see trademarks protection trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: use your your registration and after I
start using your trademark you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: register the registration there's a lot of
room for that to go bad also if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in from out of state if you the
licensee hasn't taken steps to protect if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just basing this purely off of
state right and there's no federal
[SPEAKER_00]: registrations and that isn't registered to
have the license or turn around and then
[SPEAKER_00]: register some of the intellectual property
that's totally possible outcome so taking
[SPEAKER_00]: the steps to say hey if we're gonna do
this you're gonna forego X Y & Z and allow
[SPEAKER_00]: me to do it and then we understand that
really that's gonna be the sub substance
[SPEAKER_00]: of this agreement but I might not have had
the opportunity to even register the
[SPEAKER_00]: trademark yet so Colorado brand because
most so between federal and state
[SPEAKER_00]: trademark applications at the federal
level you are allowed to do what's called
[SPEAKER_00]: a 1b filing or an intent to use filing a
1a filing is that I'm actually using the
[SPEAKER_00]: trademark in commerce and mind you you
can't get a federal trademark on cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: or cannabis goods and services because
it's a violation of the Controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: Substance Act do the schedule one status
so that's not lawful use in commerce the
[SPEAKER_00]: best you can do is ancillary goods and
services but at the state level it
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the state you're in you can
register on goods and services for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis but the requirement there is
there is no 1b filing there's only I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: actually using it so if you're coming from
Colorado licensing the brand into
[SPEAKER_00]: California you probably haven't used the
trademark in commerce yet and you're the
[SPEAKER_00]: licensee will be the first one to use it
so if they use it and then registered it
[SPEAKER_00]: right away you've created a very and you
haven't included a term saying you are not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do the registration I'm gonna do
the registration and own it you're
[SPEAKER_00]: creating a very interesting issue with the
contract because who really owns the
[SPEAKER_00]: trademark then and did that trademark get
entered into the agreement or so yeah that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are a lot of problems there is we
can't generally do an a to b solution for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis right now there's usually a few
extra steps and especially at the state
[SPEAKER_00]: level when it's state to state because
your protection doesn't expand past the
[SPEAKER_00]: state that you've registered them so
taking those steps to say okay well if
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna license into another state how
do we go about protecting ourselves either
[SPEAKER_01]: before the agreement is signed or in
conjunction with signing the agreement I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean you're gonna see some internal maybe
even a term of hey if you're producing
[SPEAKER_00]: this for me I'm gonna license you my
trademark even if it's just internally in
[SPEAKER_00]: the same state I don't maybe I'm not going
after a manufacturing license so but I own
[SPEAKER_00]: the intellectual property so I'm gonna
license you my trademark or my branding
[SPEAKER_00]: and then have you create the products we
probably have some sort of free agreement
[SPEAKER_00]: for you to create do the manufacturing and
then I would maybe collect a royalty
[SPEAKER_00]: royalty payment for the use of the
trademark maybe with art so if somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: designs some really cool art for your
packaging or your website or something and
[SPEAKER_00]: they would license you write a licensing
agreement if you have limited access to my
[SPEAKER_00]: art or my artistic works and then that's
hopefully protected by a copyright
[SPEAKER_00]: registration that that would get bundled
into the licensing agreement for patents
[SPEAKER_00]: you know maybe I have a method that I have
registered a patent on method of
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction and I will license you the use
of that technique or if there's a machine
[SPEAKER_00]: that I don't want to manufacture because
it's gonna be too expensive but you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: great manufacturing facility I'll license
you my design that I've registered as a
[SPEAKER_00]: patent trade secrets maybe I have an
edible company that I'm just known for
[SPEAKER_00]: having amazingly good cookies and my
recipe I've not shared with anyone and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's my proprietary blend and I'm gonna
license you that so long as you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: share the secret with anyone your
employees generally don't know and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably some other restriction in the
agreement where that extra little secret
[SPEAKER_00]: when I put nutmeg in it like one or two
people at your company know that and they
[SPEAKER_00]: do it in the back room but all those
things could be internally those don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be state-to-state we're gonna see
a lot more dynamic licensing agreements
[SPEAKER_00]: between businesses that don't necessarily
do everything or somebody stand out and
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have the ability to maximize on
production so let's license it to someone
[SPEAKER_00]: else and let's collect royalty payments
just as much also so state state-to-state
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna start seeing international but
this definitely branding art is moving
[SPEAKER_00]: international the concept of international
cannabis brand is very real it's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretical like that's going on and that
it gets only more dynamic because then you
[SPEAKER_00]: have two different jurisdictions of law
trying to figure out how do you do an
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement what's the obligation what's
my ability to police or monitor my
[SPEAKER_00]: contract trademarks especially Canada and
actually I just learned that they're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have an issue with social media but it
sounds like there will be a way to do
[SPEAKER_00]: agreements where trademarks get brought up
from California get used in Canada Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: has restrictive packaging so it's a very
dumbed-down packaging but if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: brand that already has a very flourished
social media presence exactly so being
[SPEAKER_00]: imposed of building a grassroots up brand
where you have very limited marketing and
[SPEAKER_00]: your packaging is nondescript and you have
this much space for a logo it's in Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: they're massive packaging just was
learning about this massive packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions so if you have an American
brand or it doesn't have to be American
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a brand that already has a robust
following and brand identity putting that
[SPEAKER_00]: on because people the natural people use
their phones oh what is this and if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's already this developed market I
think for consumers that's fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: persuasive opposed to what's this other
brand that has maybe 3,000 social media
[SPEAKER_00]: followers or like is that any good might
be good but it doesn't have as much of a
[SPEAKER_00]: following and a lot of consumption or
consumers buy based off of the reviews of
[SPEAKER_00]: other people or have I heard of this
before so yeah bringing California brands
[SPEAKER_00]: that are established up to to Canada is in
discussions that is definitely in
[SPEAKER_00]: discussions from a different international
and I have not worked on this I spoke with
[SPEAKER_00]: an Israeli attorney about it but trying to
do patent licensing issues from Israel to
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States and even doing
completion of research and development in
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel for aspects of patents that we
couldn't do the research on in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States without being it federally illegal
so just doing research for that amount in
[SPEAKER_00]: a different country and then bringing that
part of the patent back or that part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the intellectual property back and from
the international side my advice would
[SPEAKER_00]: just be hire an international attorney
like if you for these deals you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: working with someone domestically who has
your own best interest and they should
[SPEAKER_00]: have a counterpart in the other country
who also then can say well here's the laws
[SPEAKER_00]: here's how this is same here's this is how
this is different opposed to just relying
[SPEAKER_00]: on the other side you're licensing to
having their representation and telling
[SPEAKER_00]: you oh yeah this is our part of the
contract is good that is not sufficient
[SPEAKER_00]: representation and so that's why either
working I can see where there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage to maybe working with law firms
that have a presence in multiple countries
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's a central but I think
just finding attorneys in both countries
[SPEAKER_00]: that have a good knowledge base of
cannabis and how it relates intellectual
[SPEAKER_00]: property relates to cannabis yeah
