[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have UFC teams of doctors that
prescribe stuff to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our own personal doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not organized, I guess, like the NFL
teams, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my father, who's a physician,
they're very quick to, what do you need
[SPEAKER_01]: for pain?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, here you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a Vicodin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's Percocets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'd be nice to get people to kind of
change their perceptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Michelle was talking about
education.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it doesn't work on people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also think that it helps as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Educating people on, really, what are the
benefits?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is going to happen if you use
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is your life going to be over?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to be really lazy?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people just have these crazy
perceptions and crazy ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think education is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work on everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to believe what they're
going to believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think there's a lot of benefits
to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's forms like this that I think will
hopefully help and educate people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's monumental for UFC fighters,
MMA in general, because you guys have a
[SPEAKER_00]: fight here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next fight's not for,
what, six or seven months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people take more fights in a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, in doing that, I think masking
pain while training, because if you get
[SPEAKER_00]: injury and it prevents you from training
for about five days, that five days is
[SPEAKER_00]: huge because there are fights coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with NFL, we have like 16 games.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can come out and somebody will go
in for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's backups.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no backups in fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to do it all yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, that right there in and of
itself just shows the power.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said a lot of people are getting
sponsored by CBD companies now because it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see athletes that are benefiting
from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of the fighters that are
sponsored that are taking CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: they say that it's monumental for just
joint pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I imagine getting into the ring
and you roll on the ring in jujitsu and
[SPEAKER_00]: your knees are aching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and it's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to say it's easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, in the NFL, if you're not
able to play on a Sunday, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you wait and you're able to to play the
next Sunday and you're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your contract kind of guarantees you a
certain amount of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the case in fighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not able to go that Saturday
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, good luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you get a fight another three months
or maybe you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the only way you're really
going to get paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sponsorship has changed significantly in
the UFC.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a time where, you know,
you kind of look like you had NASCAR
[SPEAKER_01]: shorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had sponsors all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can't really do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other ways to go about those
sponsorships.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, that's that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not able to fight,
you're not getting paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not able to pay the bills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of guys are dealing with a lot
of pain and have to fight with with major
[SPEAKER_01]: injuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have to go up in a weight class,
I think that cannabis could help probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
