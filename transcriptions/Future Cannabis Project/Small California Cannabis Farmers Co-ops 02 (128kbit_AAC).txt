[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I do see co-ops working
together, and there's more to it than just
[SPEAKER_00]: crop coordination.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more to it than just trying to
mandate everybody to grow the same things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in the formation of our local
cooperative, we've been able to learn from
[SPEAKER_00]: successes and failures alike, from the
different incarnations of emerald groan
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years, and being able to reach
out to farmers that are going through
[SPEAKER_00]: parallel permitting processes in other
counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn from an extra year or two of
experience has been very, very helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, I'll just speak to
emerald groan specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Emerald groan is not a cannabis
cooperative.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a federation of cannabis
cooperatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's a certain level of
efficiency and scale you can achieve
[SPEAKER_03]: within a single chapter 22 co-op that is
limited at four acres cumulative.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the membership of the co-op as a whole
can only grow a total of four acres.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you link together 10 four acre
blocks, then you're a much larger scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the federation structure is
relatively common in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is relatively common to to agricultural
producers.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a rice growers coalition in the
northern half of California's Central
[SPEAKER_03]: Valley that is a bit like a federation of
co-ops.
[SPEAKER_03]: That said, nobody's ever quite made a
model like the emerald groan model.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is intentionally meant to be a place
where all of the co-ops can come together.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, cooperation to me
is about much more than how we structure
[SPEAKER_03]: our businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cooperation is the reason why humans homo
sapiens persisted when other upper level
[SPEAKER_03]: primates didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually to our very core.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is my belief that our ability to work
together makes us who we are, our ability
[SPEAKER_03]: to empathize, to care about other people's
interests, needs, their feelings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so cooperation runs much, much deeper.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this isn't just about forming a
co-op.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is about creating a cooperative
global system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what better resource to do it with
than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have been able to flex some of
those efficiencies of scale to talk with
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the leading experts.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a law firm out of Arkansas where
agriculture co-ops are very common.
[SPEAKER_03]: These folks literally wrote the book
called Special Laws Pertaining to
[SPEAKER_03]: Agricultural Cooperatives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Zero percent chance that any one of our
farms would have been able to afford them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Collectively, we've been able to spend
some time working with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we've hammered out, I think,
a pretty cannabis co-op.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was definitely born of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's meant for our market.
[SPEAKER_03]: One last point on being able to work
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, sometimes we take flack that the
Emerald Triangle is the Emerald Triangle
[SPEAKER_03]: and it doesn't include you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to make very clear that to
me, there's something deeper than the
[SPEAKER_03]: place where I grew up.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a culture that I grew up in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Casey said, when he crossed the
river, like this was home.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where our people live.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I felt that since I decided to be an
advocate and get to know growers all over
[SPEAKER_03]: the state, you feel that in these
different pockets.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Emerald Triangle may be a three
county geography on the North Coast,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the culture, the Emerald grown culture
is something larger that transcends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's something that as we go global,
I think it is something recognizable that
[SPEAKER_03]: a much larger group of co-ops can stand
behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, I think we should
be the supplier, the primary supplier of
[SPEAKER_03]: flour globally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we should do that by working
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the pathway forward at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, kind of piggybacking on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a difficult, there's a loss in
translation a lot of the times in the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you talk, you really hit the
nail on the head, Jonathan, with the two
[SPEAKER_01]: circles, the industry circle and the
culture circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when those overlap, magic happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times that overlap isn't
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the big questions for us has
been how do you, in trying to convey the
[SPEAKER_01]: culture, like how do you accomplish that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the cooperative status that
you're only allowing for farms 10,000
[SPEAKER_01]: square feet and smaller, that creates a
definition that creates the potential for
[SPEAKER_01]: a paradigm there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's one of the things that I'm
really excited about is this idea that
[SPEAKER_01]: cooperative cannabis can come to mean and
to be synonymous with the culture that we
[SPEAKER_01]: all come from, because it was cooperative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if, you know, if the one neighborhood
got cleaned out by the Fed, then everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: chipped in for the winter, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's been this thing over decades
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's both like, I think the most
challenging and heartbreaking thing right
[SPEAKER_01]: now in terms of seeing the transition,
but also the biggest point of potential
[SPEAKER_01]: moving forward is that this thing has been
real and has meant something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can communicate that to the
marketplace in a way that is
[SPEAKER_01]: understandable, then it's going to stand
on its own for the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially, you know, the state market
right now is really, really challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you look at, you know,
this whole thing happening with like
[SPEAKER_01]: acreage and the thing being hinged on
federal legalization, when like that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of money starts to move in that arena,
you're like, oh, this is going to happen
[SPEAKER_01]: really soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we start to look at what
happens under federal legalization,
[SPEAKER_01]: cooperative California cannabis,
I think, has a tremendous potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, you know, Fed legalization
has been kind of like the pie in the sky
[SPEAKER_01]: thing for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I say, when you start to see that
kind of monetary happening, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, boy, this thing is shifting fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for us, it's about like,
you know, I feel that it's about getting
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves together and being able to agree
on a paradigm that represents what has
[SPEAKER_01]: been and what will be.
[SPEAKER_02]: In commercial horticulture, we've
typically seen co-ops gathering together
[SPEAKER_02]: to just bring a similar crop to market
with more efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys see as the possibility of
working with the special genetics that
[SPEAKER_02]: each of our small farms have, that we've
all been breeding on our own pieces of
[SPEAKER_02]: property?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, all the large scale
farmers are growing acres of diesel and
[SPEAKER_02]: all the dessert flavors and all the
boutique flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even as a small farmer, yeah,
OK, we can most likely produce a higher
[SPEAKER_02]: quality product of that strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what value do we have of having the
genetics that aren't available to these
[SPEAKER_02]: large scale farmers?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is both like the tremendous blessing
and something of a curse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the first year with Emerald Grum was
like we had 40 farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody had 10 to 25 strains,
two to 10 pounds, 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden it was just like,
oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like like start, start small,
like start with something that works and
[SPEAKER_01]: branch back out into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I'm really hopeful
for is is cooperative nursery processes,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's like everybody knows old
timers that have a barrel full of seeds of
[SPEAKER_01]: all kind of things that we don't even know
what they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what they test.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's been no systematic genetic
shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of those seeds are in danger of
going by.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I think it's a dual
facet of like figure out some baselines
[SPEAKER_01]: that work and then develop into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm saying this because this is what
I'm trying to figure out myself right now
[SPEAKER_01]: is like, what are the things that work and
then what can I develop into moving
[SPEAKER_01]: forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's like if you show up with 400
strains of two to 10 pounds of each,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just it's like a marketing nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a there's a I think a
balance there of like figuring out what
[SPEAKER_01]: are special, unique things to each terroir
to each neighborhood's and then being able
[SPEAKER_01]: to to propagate those forward within the
cooperative and then also sift along to
[SPEAKER_01]: find other things moving forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, first, I think we could look
at coffee as a relatively decent analog in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of other commodities that I'm
checking on and keeping an eye on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are seeing a proliferation of more
genetic diversity there, and we are seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: co-ops and connection between market and
farm build some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to me, you actually when we when we
formed Emerald Grown, the goal was to sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of document, to catalog, to articulate the
craft and the culture, the culture of
[SPEAKER_03]: craft cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we came up with four elements,
microclimates, genetics, culture and
[SPEAKER_03]: heritage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so genetics are the point of this
whole experiment is to proliferate more
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way that we're dealing with this
operationally this year, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we our marketing strategy is the tool with
which we sort of balance between consumer
[SPEAKER_03]: demand and suppliers needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not a one way street.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a it's very much a two way street.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're trying to create opportunity
for both.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're encouraging that folks who
participate in the Emerald Grown program
[SPEAKER_03]: grow for the house brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: The house brand is prescriptive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a couple genetics that we've picked
out, you know, a good upper, a good
[SPEAKER_03]: downer, a good in the middle and a solid
CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody grows a little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will have a consistent house brand
around the state if you need it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we also are building spin off
brands, whether they're regional brands to
[SPEAKER_03]: highlight a place, whether they're
cooperative brands, whether they're brand
[SPEAKER_03]: collaborations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these brands get a lot more
specialized.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one that we'll be bringing to market
first is farm cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a minimally processed process on the
farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: The farmer is getting not a great price
per the pound, but because they're also
[SPEAKER_03]: getting the labor of packaging,
there's enough of a value add on farm that
[SPEAKER_03]: they're getting a living wage for that
pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that and that farm cut product is
meant to highlight a very small batch
[SPEAKER_03]: specialized.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody touched it except the farmer from
plant to jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get it, you're the next human to
touch it since the person who loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's meant to be an ultra small batch.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're turning away anything more than 10
pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to have these different channels to
explore the small batch, to explore the
[SPEAKER_03]: art and the craft while putting this
bedrock of a house brand underneath of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: we think that this two way conversation
between farmer and consumer is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: produce what we all want, which is tons of
choices of good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really what this is all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're pretty sure we might get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If not, we'll have fun growing good flour
on the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to break it down a little bit in
terms of, for instance, on farm,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not packaging into eighths.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not cost effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not time effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I can do half ounce an ounce
increments and take the big leaf off,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's minimally processed, that's
something that I can still accomplish on
[SPEAKER_01]: farm at a small scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the goal, like as I said,
is to minimize the packaging costs by
[SPEAKER_01]: going a larger unit and minimize the
processing costs so that I can still do it
[SPEAKER_01]: on farm myself without having a commercial
building and a crew, which for a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: small farms at this point is very
difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a commercial building.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to try to figure out a way to keep
some of that value on farm by being able
[SPEAKER_01]: to do those steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ideally to be able to deliver to the
consumer something that's cured
[SPEAKER_01]: excellently, that's in a larger unit size
that is at a valuable price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what we're all seeing out there is
patients and consumers who are paying
[SPEAKER_01]: these huge prices for small amounts of
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, man, that kind of cuts out
the tradition of the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the goal, like I say, is to be able
to hold value on the farm and also get
[SPEAKER_01]: value to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You bring up a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went into one of my first dispensaries
the other night, and thankfully I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have to go into dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was an experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give thanks to all the dispensary owners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because not everybody has the opportunity
to grow all their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that I really
experienced while being in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, there was a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been saying this for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how do we tell our story?
[SPEAKER_02]: And more importantly, how do we
communicate that story to the consumer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because our best friend is small farmers
as an educated consumer, because once
[SPEAKER_02]: they're educated about the product,
they can make the decision of who they
[SPEAKER_02]: want to support and what products they
want to buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But overwhelmingly, when I was in this
dispensary, it's just a bunch of boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some guy that's doing his best to tell
me everything about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, at the end of the day,
I would just look at what what's the
[SPEAKER_02]: coolest box?
[SPEAKER_02]: So how are you guys working with your
farmers to tell not only the story of the
[SPEAKER_02]: co-op, but the story of the farmer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, I've stopped going to
cannabis events, which a lot of you know
[SPEAKER_03]: that I speak a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're an exception.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll come to any event you host ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these days I talk to other folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the cannabis community probably
already has access to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's be real.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the rest of the consumers that need.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's sort of like Casey's don't know
you don't know thing earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of consumers out there that
don't know that they don't know where
[SPEAKER_03]: their cannabis comes from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't even actually the cool
thing, at least for me, like I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: actually have to push a farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can just say, hey, cooperative cannabis,
you guys like go check out a co-op.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it doesn't matter which shop
you're in, where in the state it might be
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy Day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be down home.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be somebody totally else.
[SPEAKER_03]: But having that cooperative, that
recognizable center of gravity that we can
[SPEAKER_03]: all come back to, that we know means
values, means culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think just the more it feels,
putting my consumer hat on, because I am a
[SPEAKER_03]: consumer of lots of things, cannabis,
one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like it when people tell me,
here, smoke mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you let me smoke it and I decide
it's the best, then cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so show somebody the door.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't tell them which door to walk through
has really been my approach on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
