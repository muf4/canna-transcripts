[SPEAKER_04]: So I've got two panelists here who are
former colleagues of mine from the
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana policy project.
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting with Aaron Smith, the executive
director of the National Cannabis Industry
[SPEAKER_04]: Association.
[SPEAKER_04]: Aaron and I used to work together at MPP.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was the director of our California
policy and now he is very busy
[SPEAKER_04]: spearheading the organization of the
cannabis industry at NCIA.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got Neil Levine, also a former
colleague.
[SPEAKER_04]: We worked together on our Arizona
legalization campaign back when we were
[SPEAKER_04]: just getting it off the ground in 2014.
[SPEAKER_04]: Neil was our director of initiative
campaigns, a major politico over here,
[SPEAKER_04]: and now he's the senior vice president of
government affairs for Live Well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last panelist here is Adam Cohen with M.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hardee.
[SPEAKER_04]: Adam is both a dispensary owner as well as
one of the leaders of M.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hardeen, which is a turnkey cultivation
management company in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to pass over to you all to
fill in any blanks I've left and then
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll get started.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I'm Aaron Smith, co-founder and
executive director of the National
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis Industry Association.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are, just as any other industry has,
we are the trade association that
[SPEAKER_07]: represents your business interests in
Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_07]: We represent just about 1,100 member
businesses across the country,
[SPEAKER_07]: including about 300, last I checked,
here in California.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also maintain a California affiliate,
California Cannabis Industry Association,
[SPEAKER_07]: that I hope all of you are involved in as
members as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm really glad to be on this panel
about the federal conflict because the
[SPEAKER_07]: really primary purpose of NCIA is to make
sure that the industry has a seat at the
[SPEAKER_07]: table in Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_07]: to ultimately take down the barriers that
federal conflict poses to our businesses.
[SPEAKER_07]: And while we're not seeing, those of you
who have been involved, especially in
[SPEAKER_07]: California for a long time, may remember
the days where we were seeing criminal
[SPEAKER_07]: justice actions taken against medical
cannabis collectives throughout the state
[SPEAKER_07]: and the country on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_07]: While fortunately that has slowed way,
way down, there's other issues that in
[SPEAKER_07]: some ways are more insidious to
undermining the industry because of the
[SPEAKER_07]: federal conflict.
[SPEAKER_07]: Primarily, section 280E of the tax code,
which is a little known to most people in
[SPEAKER_07]: this country, but hopefully very well
known to those in this room, disallows any
[SPEAKER_07]: ordinary business deductions associated
with the trafficking, quote unquote,
[SPEAKER_07]: of cannabis, meaning your rent,
your marketing, payroll, many of the
[SPEAKER_07]: ordinary expenses that any other business
can take for granted as an expense,
[SPEAKER_07]: can't in our industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that has many of our members facing 80
to even 90% effective tax rates as opposed
[SPEAKER_07]: to 35% or so that other comparable
businesses would face.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other big issue that we're working on
is resolving the banking crisis so that
[SPEAKER_07]: businesses can safely deposit their cash
into a depository institution,
[SPEAKER_07]: into a bank, not have to run on a full,
you know, some operations are running
[SPEAKER_07]: entirely cash-only basis, which is a
public safety nightmare and very costly to
[SPEAKER_07]: anybody in the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: We maintain a full-time lobbying presence
on the Hill, working on these issues,
[SPEAKER_07]: as well as really the end goal,
which is ending federal prohibition,
[SPEAKER_07]: removing cannabis from the list of
controlled substances entirely,
[SPEAKER_07]: and allowing states to regulate in a model
similar to alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Aaron.
[SPEAKER_04]: Neil?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm Neil Levine with Live Well and
Lighten Health.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sarah and Aaron covered just about
everything, so I'll be incredibly brief
[SPEAKER_05]: because I would like to get to some Q&A
and like to wrap up in time for us all to
[SPEAKER_05]: watch the debate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just say this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two additions to what Sarah said.
[SPEAKER_05]: Live Well and Lighten Health, we are a
fully vertically integrated cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now we're only in the state of
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have 14 retail locations all on the
east side of the mountains, and I am also
[SPEAKER_05]: a member of the NCAA board and agree with
everything Aaron just said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Neil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Adam?
[SPEAKER_08]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Adam Cohen.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm one of the co-founders of M Hardeen.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are a turnkey commercial cultivation
company, providing a range of services to
[SPEAKER_08]: our clients, including licensure support,
facility design, ramp up, and then the
[SPEAKER_08]: day-to-day operation of our clients'
facilities.
[SPEAKER_08]: We also maintain our own licenses and
businesses, and we provide the same
[SPEAKER_08]: service for ourselves, of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have clients in 10 states.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've produced over 130,000 pounds of
finished product to date.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been very successful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: In working with our clients in the
competitive application markets like
[SPEAKER_08]: Hawaii and Maryland, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_08]: Florida's another one.
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition to M Hardeen, we also,
as indicated, we own our own cultivation
[SPEAKER_08]: facilities and our own dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the family, between all of the partners
of M Hardeen, we have 16 dispensaries
[SPEAKER_08]: operating under four different brands in
two different states.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I got into the industry about four
years ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a lawyer by trade, a recovering
attorney, and I came by way of private
[SPEAKER_08]: equity, and I was doing investment both
private and institutional money and luxury
[SPEAKER_08]: resorts and hotels around the Caribbean
and Latin America.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can imagine I actually loved that,
and so I found this opportunity to be so
[SPEAKER_08]: compelling.
[SPEAKER_08]: The first time I ever walked into a
large-scale growth flow, it was just a
[SPEAKER_08]: eureka moment for me, and I knew that,
and after doing research, I realized this
[SPEAKER_08]: is a multi-billion dollar industry,
clear macro trends towards legalization
[SPEAKER_08]: and acceptance, and yet not a dollar of
institutional capital.
[SPEAKER_08]: And why is that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's because of the conflict with
federal law.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so for the last four years,
I've been trying to navigate that process.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thankfully, I'm still free.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have fewer concerns today about my door
getting kicked in, but that was always a
[SPEAKER_08]: concern, and it still is for many people.
[SPEAKER_08]: Things are getting better, but we have a
very far away to go still.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Adam.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Sarah Hollyhead.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a fundraiser with the Marijuana Policy
Project.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been with the organization since
2006, before there was much of an industry
[SPEAKER_04]: to speak of, so I've seen a lot of change.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the past two years, I've been primarily
focused on raising money for our Arizona
[SPEAKER_04]: Legalization Campaign, and that's been
really fun for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: The industry there is pretty mature and
very actively engaged in ending
[SPEAKER_04]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Aaron touched on these.
[SPEAKER_04]: The three biggest issues, federal issues,
are 280E, the tax issue, banking,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I have donors all the time tell me
their check is going to be delayed because
[SPEAKER_04]: their account got shut down, so I know
it's real, and then the Controlled
[SPEAKER_04]: Substances Act, the need to remove
marijuana from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wonder if one of you could jump in
with which of these you think is most
[SPEAKER_04]: pressing, where we're at on the issue,
and where we're headed.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all pressing, but 280E is our
largest concern, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: The history of how this all came about is
that a lot of people don't know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I actually wrote something about this
last week, that the United States Supreme
[SPEAKER_05]: Court ruled that the Marijuana Tax Act of
1937 was unconstitutional back in 1969,
[SPEAKER_05]: which led to the creation of the
Controlled Substances Act, which was a
[SPEAKER_05]: more constitutionally defensible
prohibition scheme than the one that
[SPEAKER_05]: existed.
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is that it was placed into
schedule one upon the creation by the
[SPEAKER_05]: Nixon administration temporarily,
while they formed their handpicked
[SPEAKER_05]: commission to justify the science behind
making marijuana a schedule one controlled
[SPEAKER_05]: substance.
[SPEAKER_05]: The commission, now referred to as the
Schaeffer Commission, came back and said
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana should be decriminalized,
but I guess at that point, the Nixon
[SPEAKER_05]: administration no longer felt the need for
scientific justification, and marijuana
[SPEAKER_05]: remains schedule one where it is to this
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second thing that happened was in the
70s, an industrious drug dealer from
[SPEAKER_05]: Minneapolis took a bunch of deductions for
his business selling cocaine and
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana, and he went to tax court and
successfully defended a portion of those
[SPEAKER_05]: deductions.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Congress responded with IRS Code 280E
in 1982, which said that you cannot take
[SPEAKER_05]: standard deductions if you are violating
state or federal law in a schedule one
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana or schedule two cocaine
controlled substance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we go fast forward to 1996,
where California becomes the first state
[SPEAKER_05]: to opt out of federal prohibition on the
state level in any way under Prop 215,
[SPEAKER_05]: and President Clinton, who was just
re-elected and wasn't gonna face another
[SPEAKER_05]: election, asked Barry McCaffrey,
his drug czar, the head of the ONDCP,
[SPEAKER_05]: to craft a strategy to crush the new laws,
and in that memo, from December 20th,
[SPEAKER_05]: 1996, the ONDCP specifically, all the
stuff that we saw happen for the last 20
[SPEAKER_05]: years are in that memo, the raids,
everything, and they spell out using 280E
[SPEAKER_05]: as a weapon to crush the industry and the
cradle.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you take a look at this
historically, marijuana never should have
[SPEAKER_05]: been the controlled substance act to begin
with, that's number one, and this is on
[SPEAKER_05]: purpose.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like the IRS stumbled upon this
code that was there for 1982, and they're
[SPEAKER_05]: using it as a weapon, this was weaponized
by the Clinton administration in 1996 as a
[SPEAKER_05]: lynch pin in modern federal prohibition.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we need to do is marijuana needs
to be removed from the controlled
[SPEAKER_05]: substance act entirely, which will take
care of banking, which will take care of
[SPEAKER_05]: 280E, and in the interim, we've heard from
a lot of folks, Ethan was just here on
[SPEAKER_05]: this stage, I keep hearing from my friends
in the cannabis legalization movement that
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of the philanthropists that have
historically funded the movement are
[SPEAKER_05]: pulling back, they're pulling their giving
back.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're looking to us in the industry
to fill that gap, but we're being kept
[SPEAKER_05]: small and poor on purpose, dealing with an
effective tax rate of upwards of 80%
[SPEAKER_05]: because we can't take any standard
business deductions based on tax code
[SPEAKER_05]: 280E.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is it, this is the lynch pin to
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remove marijuana from the controlled
substance act entirely, like tobacco,
[SPEAKER_05]: like alcohol, where it was never meant to
be, get rid of 280E, and then yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: we can end prohibition once and for all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Neil.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanna shift and ask, how does some of
this tie in to what's happening at the
[SPEAKER_04]: state level?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we seeing happening at the state
level that could positively or negatively
[SPEAKER_04]: impact these issues?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, obviously we have a huge election
coming up, up on November 8th,
[SPEAKER_07]: that will, has the potential, if we
succeed in California and at least a
[SPEAKER_07]: majority of the eight other states,
to really reshape the debate around
[SPEAKER_07]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's absolutely vital that as an industry
that we're supporting those efforts at the
[SPEAKER_07]: state level because there's a direct
correlation between the state policies and
[SPEAKER_07]: what's happening in Congress.
[SPEAKER_07]: Members of Congress are very timid,
they're already probably 20, 30 years by
[SPEAKER_07]: now, behind public opinion on this issue,
as it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: They tend to only really care about what's
happening in their districts, in their
[SPEAKER_07]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you look at this election,
right now we have less than two dozen,
[SPEAKER_07]: just over 20, I think, members of the
House of Representatives that represent
[SPEAKER_07]: the four adult-use states.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we pass all five this year,
this will be over 100 that will be
[SPEAKER_07]: representing states where marijuana is
legal and regulated.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not to mention three quarters or so of the
House and a majority of the Senate
[SPEAKER_07]: representing states that have some form of
regulated marijuana that departs from
[SPEAKER_07]: federal law, meaning medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that that, you know,
we're already seeing the issue being taken
[SPEAKER_07]: more and more seriously after,
you know, Amendment 64 and I-502 passed in
[SPEAKER_07]: 2012.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to see another big flood of
interest in this issue and resolving the
[SPEAKER_07]: federal conflict.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, if you think about
California here alone, by 2020,
[SPEAKER_07]: given passage of 64 in November,
the market here alone could be upwards of
[SPEAKER_07]: $7 billion, like the size of the whole
country right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we don't fix things like banking,
280E, and the banking issue specifically
[SPEAKER_07]: is one that is very kind of pressing for
our opponents and those who maybe don't
[SPEAKER_07]: really care about whether our businesses
succeed, but they want to resolve that
[SPEAKER_07]: because that's $7 billion that's outside
of the banking system and creating public
[SPEAKER_07]: safety hazards and transparency issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that alone, I think, is, you know,
one of the biggest things that we,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and clearly is pressing because
I think that that's, I think it's six
[SPEAKER_07]: weeks away from tomorrow that we have this
election before us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's also really critical that as
industries develop in new states that the
[SPEAKER_07]: industry be involved, not just involved
through the association, of course,
[SPEAKER_07]: but involved in local politics,
involved with their members of Congress
[SPEAKER_07]: and meeting with their members of Congress
in the districts, attending fundraisers,
[SPEAKER_07]: giving money.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that we're all asking for money,
but those members of Congress who support
[SPEAKER_07]: our issues deserve your support.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as more states flip, there will be
more, you know, what NCIA is, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: what we do is we work to build coalitions
and move the members of Congress kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: along the ladder.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, the moderate opponents are
now, you're now seeing them come on board
[SPEAKER_07]: as, you know, championing things like CBD
access.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those are laws that we probably,
you know, largely ineffectual CBD laws,
[SPEAKER_07]: but they're pushing something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those that were just for medical are now
moving along and supporting just a full
[SPEAKER_07]: states rights approach to adult use.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll just, I think we're going to see
that exponentially, that pace.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to increase after November if
we're successful.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what's absolutely important
that we all know that this is not
[SPEAKER_07]: inevitable because if the opposite happens
and California loses or a majority of the
[SPEAKER_07]: other states go down, the narrative will
change.
[SPEAKER_07]: And especially with California,
the headline will say, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: public not ready for marijuana
legalization.
[SPEAKER_07]: So get out and vote and donate money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I jump in real quick?
[SPEAKER_05]: One real world application on the state
level to federal prohibition I think is
[SPEAKER_05]: really, and I'm talking about impact on
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see my friend Sue Sisley sitting in the
front right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a bunch of you probably know that
Congress through the appropriation process
[SPEAKER_05]: was going to allow veterans to go to the
VA in states that have medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_05]: laws and not be subject to sanction for
getting their medicine and actually being
[SPEAKER_05]: transparent, open, working with the VA.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was killed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So because of the federal conflict,
veterans with conditions protected under
[SPEAKER_05]: state law who are going through the VA or
are worried about their retirement cannot
[SPEAKER_05]: go into medical marijuana systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Colorado, where I live, PTSD is not an
approved condition.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like the legislature's going to
move on that finally in 2017, knock on
[SPEAKER_05]: wood, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's a real impact.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you get down into,
Aaron's 100% right on the policy impacts,
[SPEAKER_05]: but the real life impacts down the state
level with federal prohibition,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just when they get so tone deaf that
they're putting our veterans' retirement
[SPEAKER_05]: at risk and their health at risk,
how can you not be disgusted with the
[SPEAKER_05]: state of federal prohibition in its
entirety?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Adam, I wanted to pass it to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I may, it's not just the veterans,
it's the youth.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not creating a new market here.
[SPEAKER_08]: This product exists.
[SPEAKER_08]: What we're doing is providing an
opportunity to test it, regulate it,
[SPEAKER_08]: and tax it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time for the federal government to
get its head out of its ass and deal with
[SPEAKER_08]: this the right way.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the public policy around the banking
in particular is just terrible.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we live in a different world
financially post 9-11.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the government strives for
transparency and accountability,
[SPEAKER_08]: and yet they want to force this
multi-billion dollar cash underground
[SPEAKER_08]: market, which sets us up for all kinds of
problems from tax evasion, money
[SPEAKER_08]: laundering, theft, physical insecurity for
people who are transferring money from one
[SPEAKER_08]: location to another.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just terrible public policy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of real world impacts,
Adam, I mean, I'm interested in knowing in
[SPEAKER_04]: your business dealings with clients,
how are they impacted by federal
[SPEAKER_04]: prohibition, and what steps are you able
to take to try to lessen the risk,
[SPEAKER_04]: lessen the impact on them?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you asking specifically, like,
my clients or my investors and the people
[SPEAKER_08]: I work with?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, your investors, any of the folks
that you deal with through M.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hardeen or through any of your business
entities?
[SPEAKER_08]: Originally, the way that we structured the
company, now, mind you, this is going back
[SPEAKER_08]: several years, so things were even more
challenging.
[SPEAKER_08]: Imagine trying to ask somebody to write a
million dollars check for a federally
[SPEAKER_08]: illegal business.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everyone's very interested in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: We hear that, we feel it every day,
but when push comes to shove to write that
[SPEAKER_08]: check, I can't tell you how many calls
I've had the day of a closing where my
[SPEAKER_08]: wife's not comfortable with this,
my lawyer advised me not to do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you really need to structure in a way
that protects your investors.
[SPEAKER_08]: The way we did that is we formed a
separate intellectual property holding
[SPEAKER_08]: company that would never touch the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: It simply licensed the IP to the operating
company and kept a degree of separation,
[SPEAKER_08]: but it's not board proof, but that's one
thing that we've done.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm curious, can one of you or several
of you paint the picture for me?
[SPEAKER_04]: What does the end of federal prohibition
look like?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are we headed, ideally, and maybe
actually?
[SPEAKER_05]: After the big party?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, this is actually a very
important question.
[SPEAKER_07]: We could have several panel discussions on
this alone, because there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: different, I think there's eight different
legalization bills right now pending in
[SPEAKER_07]: Congress, ranging from just pure state's
rights, where remove, like the Sanders
[SPEAKER_07]: bill in the Senate, remove cannabis from
the CSA and just defer to the states,
[SPEAKER_07]: to more alcohol, related model that has a
federal excise tax, but still puts
[SPEAKER_07]: marijuana regulation primarily under the
purview of the states, and then there's
[SPEAKER_07]: also move to reschedule marijuana rather
than deschedule it and put it in a two or
[SPEAKER_07]: three category.
[SPEAKER_07]: So from an industry perspective,
probably the worst thing we could do is
[SPEAKER_07]: rescheduling, because that would
essentially create a whole new
[SPEAKER_07]: jurisdiction that we're dealing with,
the FDA, that you're not gonna get
[SPEAKER_07]: clinical trials of raw cannabis strains
approved through the FDA, and even if you
[SPEAKER_07]: did, those would only be dispensed through
pharmacies, and pretty much everybody in
[SPEAKER_07]: this room is no longer in business,
except maybe a few possibly that might be
[SPEAKER_07]: able to navigate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we wanna see is cannabis to be
treated more similarly to alcohol,
[SPEAKER_07]: not under the purview of the FDA,
under the purview of ATF, ATFNC,
[SPEAKER_07]: that would also allow, still defer to the
states, so that states can continue to
[SPEAKER_07]: experiment with different regulatory
models, so that we can continue to have
[SPEAKER_07]: this laboratory of democracy, and frankly,
I think that's more politically winnable,
[SPEAKER_07]: because it would still allow states that
are really, really backwards to maybe just
[SPEAKER_07]: have medical marijuana for a few more
years, and we're not, so as far as when it
[SPEAKER_07]: goes to, like I said, most members of
Congress care about their district and
[SPEAKER_07]: what's happening in their state,
so we can go to somebody who represents
[SPEAKER_07]: North Carolina and say, well, actually,
this doesn't affect you until your state
[SPEAKER_07]: legislature makes a change.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a lot, but there's also,
I think, something that we need to be
[SPEAKER_07]: really concerned about is there are
growing influencers in the space that are
[SPEAKER_07]: starting to acknowledge that marijuana
prohibition isn't working, or maybe
[SPEAKER_07]: they're just acknowledging that it's on
its way out anyway, and that legalization
[SPEAKER_07]: is inevitable, and they are proposing
models that would not be good for the
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis industry, and that would not be
good for patients or consumers,
[SPEAKER_07]: models like state-run stores, where
government employees would be tasked with
[SPEAKER_07]: selling marijuana, and marijuana users
would have to get onto a registry in order
[SPEAKER_07]: to access, sort of like the heroin model
in the UK, and those forces are out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them is Botech, hired by some of
the state regulators throughout the
[SPEAKER_07]: country, is pushing that model,
and as this issue heats up, our voice will
[SPEAKER_07]: be amplified, but so will theirs,
and we really, as an industry,
[SPEAKER_07]: need to unify to make sure that that's not
the direction that we take reform,
[SPEAKER_07]: because they do have a seat at the table
as it is, and they will continue to gain
[SPEAKER_07]: influence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Erin, just piggybacking on that,
I have been hearing more and more about
[SPEAKER_04]: companies offering compliance-related
solutions for the cannabis industry that
[SPEAKER_04]: they feel have a strong foothold in the
marketplace, because the government is
[SPEAKER_04]: looking for all these transparency
mechanisms to make sure that the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: industry is compliant, but some of the
ones I've heard about so far are really
[SPEAKER_04]: scary-sounding, and along the lines of
what you were just talking about,
[SPEAKER_04]: like causing every cannabis consumer at a
dispensary to have to show their driver's
[SPEAKER_04]: license, and every transaction would
therefore be recorded.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the direction that we're headed
in?
[SPEAKER_04]: A complete lack of privacy for all
cannabis consumers?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't think that that's necessary.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what you're getting at with some
of the compliance solutions that you're
[SPEAKER_07]: seeing out there, and not to talk about
any companies specifically, they're
[SPEAKER_07]: providing solutions for banks,
because the banks are now under guidance
[SPEAKER_07]: from FinCEN, and the Department of
Treasury and Department of Justice,
[SPEAKER_07]: they have guidance that basically says,
you know what, you can do business with
[SPEAKER_07]: state legal marijuana businesses,
but oversight of their compliance and
[SPEAKER_07]: their legality under state law is your
responsibility to track that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, banks are extremely
conservative institutions, and I don't
[SPEAKER_07]: think they should be put in that position
when you have a state license hanging on
[SPEAKER_07]: the wall and regular state inspections and
such, but that's the current state.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of these solutions are there so that
the banks can have that level of comfort.
[SPEAKER_07]: To fill the gap.
[SPEAKER_07]: To fill the gap.
[SPEAKER_04]: So once we address the banking issue,
we can kind of do away with those
[SPEAKER_04]: concerns, it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like you had a comment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think it all runs together,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: As these gentlemen indicated, rescheduling
is not a good option, and frankly,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm glad that the DEA declined to do that
in this summer, because they think that
[SPEAKER_08]: the best they would have done was to make
it a schedule two, and that would have
[SPEAKER_08]: done no one any favors.
[SPEAKER_08]: It just would have complicated the matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: It needs to be three or lower or
completely removed, which is the most
[SPEAKER_08]: appropriate.
[SPEAKER_08]: And once you do that, you solve the
banking almost automatically, I believe.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll start to see institutional capital
come into the industry in very significant
[SPEAKER_08]: ways.
[SPEAKER_08]: 280E goes away.
[SPEAKER_08]: We start to normalize.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is really the crux of the issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: It needs to be rescheduled.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to ask a question,
please come up here to the front corner
[SPEAKER_04]: where Susan is standing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so the question was basically,
why are we talking about regulating
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis like alcohol, rather than like a
medication?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not really a federal question,
unfortunately, because we're not
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily proposing federal regulations
like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess alcohol is regulated by the ATF,
but not as granularly as it is at the
[SPEAKER_04]: state level, is that right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, and a lot of it is about okay,
what models already exist?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's politically possible?
[SPEAKER_07]: And in my mind, it's going to be much
harder to create some third regulatory
[SPEAKER_07]: regime that has never been invented before
and get that through Congress.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really FDA, the pharmaceutical,
that direction, or something more similar
[SPEAKER_07]: to alcohol.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that what's best for the
industry is to not try to shove this down
[SPEAKER_07]: into the, because this is also not a
dangerous pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_07]: It shouldn't be treated like OxyContin or
any, it's a safer substance than most
[SPEAKER_07]: over-the-counter drugs for that matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those are state, she's saying every
city in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: has public health departments.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, that's state level, and we're
really talking about federal level policy
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_08]: This should be taken out of the hands of
the federal government altogether.
[SPEAKER_08]: The best model that I've seen is just to
simply create a safe harbor for the states
[SPEAKER_08]: that choose to regulate it, allow the
states to do what they want to do with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And a number of things are accomplished
there, and one of the things that we'll
[SPEAKER_08]: see now in a number of these states,
they have very well developed programs
[SPEAKER_08]: that are creating a lot of jobs and a lot
of tax revenue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Colorado last year generated twice the
amount of tax revenue for marijuana that
[SPEAKER_08]: they did for alcohol.
[SPEAKER_08]: One billion dollars of direct marijuana
purchases last year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Colorado's not just going to fold that up.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to protect that system,
and all the states, presumably many of the
[SPEAKER_08]: states, will want to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: The federal government simply needs to
back off and allow the states to regulate
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, money makes the world go round.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an incentive.
[SPEAKER_05]: To the point on the federal level,
we do want it to be like alcohol,
[SPEAKER_05]: and that we want to remove from the CSA
entirely.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to be in the FDA system.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the FDA system, if we open up research,
what does that actually mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, spend tens of millions of dollars
to find something that you can replicate
[SPEAKER_05]: that then gets rescheduled, like Marinol,
into schedule three.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, is that what we want for whole
plant marijuana?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the FDA system is not... Now,
can pharmaceutical companies derive
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis-based medicine through the FDA
system that gets prescribed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to take marijuana and put it at
schedule two, or even schedule three,
[SPEAKER_05]: and put it into the FDA system is not
where the plan is supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: In our opinion, it should be removed from
the CSA entirely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Though there is a role for the FDA,
certainly when it comes to pure pharma and
[SPEAKER_08]: the development of drugs that are designed
to address very specific ailments,
[SPEAKER_08]: and you want to go through the clinical
trials and the FDA approval process for
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really see two divergent paths,
one being a pure pharma play, and the
[SPEAKER_08]: other being everything else.
[SPEAKER_08]: The nutraceuticals, the adult use,
soft medical, et cetera.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, any other questions from the
audience?
[SPEAKER_04]: Please come up here to Susan so you can
use the microphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate your insight.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question I have is, how do you as two
physical retailers feel about delivery,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what do you see as the future of
delivery in Colorado or the other states
[SPEAKER_01]: that you operate in?
[SPEAKER_05]: We both want to jump on that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a general policy, as a company,
we tend to be pretty I think everybody in
[SPEAKER_05]: the industry tends to be pretty adaptable
when it comes to local regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it comes to something like delivery,
that's very much a local issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as the delivery in Colorado,
I don't want to hear anything about
[SPEAKER_05]: allowing delivery in Colorado anytime
soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we were in a jurisdiction that allowed
delivery, maybe we'd consider it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not, so we haven't had that internal
discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously delivery especially when you're
dealing with patients, that could be a
[SPEAKER_05]: huge benefit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that as far as we're concerned,
there are certain things that we are
[SPEAKER_05]: really, really concerned about.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're concerned about 280E.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are concerned about banking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other stuff where it's, we're pretty
malleable.
[SPEAKER_05]: The businesses in this industry,
they're as tough and as hardy as the
[SPEAKER_05]: plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it comes to local stuff like that,
we can go with the roll with the punches.
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't had to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're only in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a company, we don't even have a
position on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nevada allows for delivery.
[SPEAKER_08]: I look at it honestly as more of a pain
than anything good.
[SPEAKER_08]: From an economic standpoint as the
business owner, certainly you're providing
[SPEAKER_08]: valuable service for people who are
indigent or somehow inconvenienced or
[SPEAKER_08]: simply can't go to a location to buy the
product.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's certainly some public service
benefit to that, but as a business owner,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's certainly not a big driver of the
business.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to see drive-throughs.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that could be interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Social use clubs, those would be more
important to me than focused on delivery.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you go back to your banking system
with regards to federal law?
[SPEAKER_02]: You had basically said that there's no
federal prohibition, but the burden is so
[SPEAKER_02]: great that banks are choosing not to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you speak more to that?
[SPEAKER_07]: There is federal prohibition, but there's
guidance that was released in 2014 by the
[SPEAKER_07]: Department of Treasury and the Department
of Justice jointly that essentially
[SPEAKER_07]: outlined the priorities of the Justice
Department in their enforcement against
[SPEAKER_07]: state legal businesses, which to be clear,
all of them, no matter how compliant they
[SPEAKER_07]: are, are committing felonies every time
they open their door, but the Obama
[SPEAKER_07]: administration's had their guidelines,
which were things that I think everybody
[SPEAKER_07]: here can agree on, no diversion out of
state, no ties to violent criminal
[SPEAKER_07]: enterprises, no sales to minors,
ensuring 100% compliance with all of the
[SPEAKER_07]: state guidelines, but they left that
burden to the banks, at least the way that
[SPEAKER_07]: it's been interpreted.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sort of vague, actually, but the way
that it's been interpreted pretty much
[SPEAKER_07]: universally is that it's up to the banks
to know their customer and ensure that all
[SPEAKER_07]: of these guidelines are being met.
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, a bank wouldn't want to take,
a very conservative one, would not want to
[SPEAKER_07]: take the client unless they knew 100% that
client wasn't selling to minors.
[SPEAKER_07]: How does a bank do that without being in
the store?
[SPEAKER_07]: What we asked for, that was a step forward
when we got that guidance, but it was a
[SPEAKER_07]: compromise to what we were asking for,
which was that if a client could walk into
[SPEAKER_07]: a bank and present a valid, all of the
paperwork to show that they have a license
[SPEAKER_07]: in their state and in their local
jurisdiction, then the bank would treat
[SPEAKER_07]: them like any other business, but this,
again, politics is often about
[SPEAKER_07]: compromises, and that's what we got.
[SPEAKER_07]: The real solution is to carve out in the
statute a safe harbor to banks that do
[SPEAKER_07]: business with any state legal marijuana
operation, and that would be an amendment
[SPEAKER_07]: to the Bank Secrecy Act, and there's
legislation pending right now to do just
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the guidance is really a band-aid,
and then all of the other compliance
[SPEAKER_07]: software and things that have kind of
popped up for banks to use are part of
[SPEAKER_07]: that band-aid.
[SPEAKER_08]: Interestingly enough, we're fortunate.
[SPEAKER_08]: All of our companies, including our
dispensaries, are fully-banked,
[SPEAKER_08]: and we have open, transparent,
and good relationships with all of our
[SPEAKER_08]: banks.
[SPEAKER_08]: They know exactly what we do.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have audited financials for all of our
companies, and we've been doing this for a
[SPEAKER_08]: few years now, and yet, on the personal
side, I bank with a big national bank,
[SPEAKER_08]: and they shut down all my accounts last
week, so it's still, I mean, this is a
[SPEAKER_08]: real issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not going away.
[SPEAKER_04]: MPP also has difficulty getting banking
services, and we don't do anything
[SPEAKER_04]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have banking, too, but when we say
banking, we have banking, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We have check deposit services that we pay
an enormous amount of money for.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have commercial banking services.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't get a loan.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't have banking, but yes,
some of the folks that are able to
[SPEAKER_05]: establish a relationship with their banks
and show that this is who we are and we
[SPEAKER_05]: can be transparent, that yes, we have
access to banking services, but it's
[SPEAKER_05]: always a struggle, and stuff always gets
ripped out, and you'll have a vendor
[SPEAKER_05]: that's dealing with you that all of a
sudden will randomly call and say,
[SPEAKER_05]: well, we can't deal with you anymore
because we got shut down over here for
[SPEAKER_05]: dealing with you, and personal banking
accounts being pulled, and on and on and
[SPEAKER_05]: on and on, losing payroll services,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Jonah Irvine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was involved in policy and child
protection in the adult entertainment
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, and talking about an industry
that was legal and still could not get
[SPEAKER_00]: banking accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like five or six banks across the
country that would work with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they would disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even as a child protection association
in the 501c3 and four, they questioned our
[SPEAKER_00]: banking account.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even with it becoming legalized,
don't you think that there's still gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be that same issue, and what can really be
done around that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I was in that industry,
it was not something that was really being
[SPEAKER_00]: handled very well.
[SPEAKER_05]: We could remove cannabis from the CSA
entirely.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what could be done.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like Adam said, this is all related.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all related.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all part of the federal prohibition
scheme.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's one thing that you can all do
about this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go vote.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go vote, and we continue to fight the good
fight.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have made a tremendous amount of
progress over the last few years.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen a sea change from when I got
involved in the industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully we're at that tipping point.
[SPEAKER_08]: But as Aaron indicated, it could go either
way.
[SPEAKER_08]: If a number or a majority or, God willing,
all of these referenda pass this year,
[SPEAKER_08]: there's no turning back.
[SPEAKER_08]: If on the other hand, we have a setback
and few or none of these initiatives pass,
[SPEAKER_08]: we're setback quite a few years.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing you do is you can contact
your congressman and you can contact your
[SPEAKER_05]: senator.
[SPEAKER_05]: In congressional offices, they have the
100 to one rule for every contact they
[SPEAKER_05]: receive.
[SPEAKER_05]: They figure it represents 100 people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So contact your congressman.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they are good on this issue,
thank them.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're not, ask them why.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put on social whatever they put as a
response, either praising them or shaming
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: This has gotta get done through the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: Congress.
[SPEAKER_08]: The good thing is I don't think there's
much to be gained politically for most at
[SPEAKER_08]: the state or federal level to be fighting
cannabis as much as they once were.
[SPEAKER_08]: At least we're talking about it now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Four or five years ago, there was very
little discussion in the halls of congress
[SPEAKER_08]: about changing the laws around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although unfortunately, in two of our
initiative states, it's the governor who's
[SPEAKER_04]: actually spearheading the opposition
effort.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's in Massachusetts and Arizona.
[SPEAKER_04]: Neil was just telling me about Harry Reid
in Nevada coming out against our
[SPEAKER_04]: initiative.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, these folks do still need
to hear from their constituents and hear
[SPEAKER_04]: that indeed they're hardworking business
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: They support a better approach to how we
regulate marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the record, the governor, the AG,
the mayor of Boston, they all came out
[SPEAKER_05]: against us in 2008 for decrim in
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got 63% of the vote.
[SPEAKER_04]: More than Obama got.
[SPEAKER_05]: 65% of the vote in Massachusetts,
actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: At some point, the endorsement game,
people I think are seeing through this for
[SPEAKER_05]: what it is, especially when it gets to
those folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's dog bites man for the
governor to say that they're against
[SPEAKER_05]: legalizing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: The news is really the other way.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's even getting less and less.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really good point though.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's that we have this stubborn
misperception that the people are not
[SPEAKER_05]: where they are and the politicians are
behind the people and that's the key point
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We wouldn't be where we are if it wasn't
for direct democracy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, at the state level,
it's taken us almost as far as we can go.
[SPEAKER_05]: The California initiative is enormous and
it has to pass this November, but we are
[SPEAKER_05]: now positioning ourselves so we have to
effect change on the federal level.
[SPEAKER_08]: It takes a lot of work to unwind 70 years
of misinformation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, we've made a lot of progress.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we count noses in Congress,
counting votes, I'm pretty confident we
[SPEAKER_07]: have the votes for a medical marijuana law
already as it stands.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've seen Rohrbacher Farr pass on more
than one year running.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're only maybe half a dozen votes away
in the House from some form of support for
[SPEAKER_07]: some form of state's rights.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of what we're up against now are
just the general dysfunction of Congress.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've been paying any attention,
Congress hasn't done anything their entire
[SPEAKER_07]: two years in this session.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next year, we have a really good
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_07]: Given success on the ballot in November,
given that we're going to be in the first
[SPEAKER_07]: year of a new administration, whichever
administration that ends up being,
[SPEAKER_07]: we have a huge opportunity.
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as we don't screw this up,
I think that we can see 280E reform,
[SPEAKER_07]: banking reform, and ultimately the end of
federal marijuana prohibition across the
[SPEAKER_07]: country.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Aaron.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the federal question, on the
presidential election coming up,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard a lot of people say that Trump
and Clinton are very similar candidates in
[SPEAKER_04]: terms of their stance on marijuana,
which is essentially to let the states do
[SPEAKER_04]: their thing, but there is one area where
they differ significantly, and that is in
[SPEAKER_04]: who they plan to pick for AG, attorney
general.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you all speak to what impact that may
or may not have on marijuana policy going
[SPEAKER_04]: forward?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think the candidates are the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hillary has come out and said that she
will pursue rescheduling, probably not
[SPEAKER_08]: nearly as aggressively as we might like to
see, but worst case, we're gonna have
[SPEAKER_08]: status quo.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can live with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Trump's a wild card.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody knows what he's gonna do or who
he's going to appoint.
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard him give a speech in the last week
talking about the great scourge of drugs
[SPEAKER_08]: on our nation's youth.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same old shit we've been hearing
for my entire lifetime, so I think that
[SPEAKER_08]: that is the riskier of the two options.
[SPEAKER_08]: What man's opinion?
[SPEAKER_05]: At the risk of offending any Republican
friends in the audience, I refuse to
[SPEAKER_05]: acknowledge Trump as a normal candidate in
any way, shape, or form.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's running a racist, misogynistic
campaign, and he's trying to bring fascism
[SPEAKER_05]: to America, and I reject him entirely,
so I won't even take the question.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing similar between them as
candidates.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's just such a wild card.
[SPEAKER_07]: He has said some good things.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's also said some really disastrous
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's too close to Chris Christie for me to
be comfortable with him, so yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: beware.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a danger, right, that he appoints
Christie as AG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's what I'm really getting at.
[SPEAKER_05]: The danger is we give him the new codes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We give him the nuclear codes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the danger.
[SPEAKER_07]: To be honest, I don't know how much I'll
be worried about marijuana in a Trump
[SPEAKER_07]: presidency given everything else.
[SPEAKER_07]: But now I'm steering away from NCIA scope,
I guess, when I say that up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You may become a heavy user.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Arizona, where I've been doing a lot of
work, the Democratic Party is doing a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of get out the vote work right now because
it's turning out to be a swing state.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of folks in the state who
are Republican, but there are also a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: who are very dissatisfied with Trump as an
option, so Hillary could end up saving the
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana vote in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is a very real question.
[SPEAKER_04]: What if the crazies get their way and
Trump gets elected?
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris Christie has made it well known that
he doesn't see this issue the way we do,
[SPEAKER_04]: so that's a real concern.
[SPEAKER_08]: Regardless of who you want to vote for
president, please go out and support these
[SPEAKER_08]: referenda and the jurisdictions in which
you live.
[SPEAKER_08]: Take your friends and take your family.
[SPEAKER_08]: This year is so important for our
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one last question for you all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate these prognostication questions
because they assume some level of
[SPEAKER_04]: inevitability in forward progress,
but I am going to ask you to prognosticate
[SPEAKER_04]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Say we do pass one or more of our five
legalization initiatives in November.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are California, Arizona,
Nevada, Massachusetts, and Maine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So say California passes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows about the others?
[SPEAKER_04]: All these municipalities in California and
probably elsewhere who raise as a reason
[SPEAKER_04]: for not moving forward the federal
conflict excuse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't do anything because we would be
breaking federal law.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we see happening?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just here in California, but in states
like Louisiana who probably would throw
[SPEAKER_04]: out that excuse as a reason for not
passing better marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's ahead?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're always going to hear that from some
of the backwards jurisdictions and places
[SPEAKER_07]: like California that's very diverse.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got some parts of the state that
are very red.
[SPEAKER_07]: The answer is let's work on fixing federal
law and ending that conflict.
[SPEAKER_07]: But also if you're working in those
jurisdictions, what we're seeing is,
[SPEAKER_07]: and we see in Colorado and California,
when neighboring jurisdictions are
[SPEAKER_07]: regulating cannabis cultivation and
reaping the tax benefits from that and not
[SPEAKER_07]: seeing any increase in crime, usually
their neighbors start coming around and
[SPEAKER_07]: deciding that it's time to allow
cultivation or retail.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that economically it just makes
more sense for these jurisdictions to come
[SPEAKER_07]: on board.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know that we've been working on it
here in California for 20 years now.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the answer is yeah, we got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's another reason we need to change
federal law because a lot of the local
[SPEAKER_07]: problems, even with talking to your zoning
commission, your city council at the very,
[SPEAKER_07]: very local level are rooted in this
federal conflict.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why we can't lose sight of the
need to keep pushing hard in Congress.
[SPEAKER_05]: This relates to your earlier question
actually, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because federally, our entire industry is
built on a memo and a restriction on DEA
[SPEAKER_05]: being able to use funds to go after
medical providers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need real change on the federal
level.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got to that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's play that scenario out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Chris Christie or whomever becomes the
AG and the head of justice.
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole memo is gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a prosecutorial guidance and it's
over.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now they're free to begin the raids.
[SPEAKER_05]: What does that look like in Colorado where
we have 29,000 badged employees in the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry as of last month?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you do when you're gonna go and
start rounding all the tens of thousands
[SPEAKER_05]: of people, hundreds of thousands of people
throughout the country, seizing all their
[SPEAKER_05]: funds, destroying those jobs, crashing
local economies?
[SPEAKER_08]: Only after we're done with the immigrants.
[SPEAKER_05]: The wool.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a joke, but it's not a joke,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we're dealing with today.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need real federal reform and it really,
it all comes down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone says it's pie in the sky.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no appetite on the federal level
right now for real 280 reform.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no appetite to remove marijuana
from the Controlled Substances Act.
[SPEAKER_05]: The very first political campaign I was
ever involved in with Jesse Ventura for
[SPEAKER_05]: governor of Minnesota in 1998.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no chance he could become
governor of Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no chance that Donald Trump
could become the Republican nominee last
[SPEAKER_05]: year.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was no chance when in 2004 we went
to Vermont with Gary Johnson and the
[SPEAKER_05]: governor of Vermont and the speaker of the
house told us, you'll never, ever,
[SPEAKER_05]: ever get a medical marijuana law passed as
long as we're in this position and four
[SPEAKER_05]: months later we passed a medical marijuana
law that the governor let go into law
[SPEAKER_05]: without his signature.
[SPEAKER_05]: People keep saying it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Politically we have to ask for what we
need, not what we think we can get.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we need is to remove marijuana
from the CSA entirely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess that's where I was headed with
my question too is state level progress is
[SPEAKER_04]: crucial to achieve federal level progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact that's MPP's whole strategy is to
make progress state by state by state and
[SPEAKER_04]: that builds the support in Congress like
Aaron was talking about earlier and that
[SPEAKER_04]: helps us make that federal level change.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think I'm gonna wrap it up right
there unless we have more questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give you all a chance to hit the bathroom
before the debate.
[SPEAKER_04]: One more question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So would an increase in state level
product liability lawsuits have an impact
[SPEAKER_03]: on the fed's taste for reform?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure they're directly connected to
be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: As a business owner I can tell you I worry
about that quite a bit but I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_08]: that the state's seeing more litigation
around product safety or even enhanced
[SPEAKER_08]: state regulations gonna make too much of a
difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah I don't think that that's something
that Congress is concerned about right
[SPEAKER_07]: now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean I think what matters is that the
state regulations are effective and that
[SPEAKER_07]: all of the major actors in the states are
following the regulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes we get them, obviously we
get them wrong sometimes and it takes time
[SPEAKER_07]: to improve and work at the state level but
that isn't something that's really being
[SPEAKER_07]: looked at deeply as far as I can tell.
Thank you.
