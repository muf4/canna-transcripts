[SPEAKER_00]: The co-founder, CEO, and president of
Indus Holdings that is an IP company that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually holds the IP for Dixie,
California along with our brand Altai
[SPEAKER_00]: based in Monterey, California,
Salinas Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started looking at this about two years
ago, really hardcore, about a year ago we
[SPEAKER_00]: got into this to create a brand,
an edible brand on the market that could
[SPEAKER_00]: be trusted, that was about transparency,
low dose, single serving, and really have
[SPEAKER_00]: a product that everybody knew when you had
this product that you'd have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: experience time after time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We met Dixie kind of in the research as we
were looking at Altai and how we were
[SPEAKER_00]: launching our own brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tripp and Chuck and I met in Las Vegas
actually with a business partner of mine
[SPEAKER_00]: had met Tripp before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tripp introduced us and we just hit it
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were so like-minded in the way that we
want to look to continue to elevate this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and to continue to bring
legitimacy and transparency and safety to
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry and so that's kind of where
the conversation started with Dixie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably about six, nine months after we
started down the road with Altai and we
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up launching both brands at the same
time, both Dixie and Altai and it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: great synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dixie's been in the industry for five
years they've gone through a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ups and downs, the different regulations
and in Colorado they have the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: have science on property.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean their science department is
unbelievable to where we were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit from that where in California we
can't really get into the extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: process and some of that science where we
had that experience with them and then my
[SPEAKER_00]: business partner Mark Ainsworth who has...
We're not allowed to, correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extraction is still an issue here in
California and so having the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material is legal, having the oil is
legal, the process of making it from plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material into the oil is still considered
illegal here in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with 266 that's changing and they'll
actually be an area there that's written
[SPEAKER_00]: into the bill that highlights extraction
and you can actually get a permit for
[SPEAKER_00]: either in volatile or volatile extraction
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really kind of where the things
came through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark Ainsworth who's my other business
partner worked for... He had his own
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing facility where he produced
for Whole Foods nationally for the last
[SPEAKER_00]: eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a pastry chef for Ritz Carlton for
eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he understood food science and quality
and shelf life and that's where it really
[SPEAKER_00]: got us excited about coming into this
industry also is that a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: products out there were people that were
in the cannabis industry that maybe didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any experience in actual food
manufacturing and understanding food
[SPEAKER_00]: science and shelf life and safety
mechanisms to where we had all of that and
[SPEAKER_00]: we use cannabis as an ingredient in our
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cannabis oil is just another
ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look to create a product that could
stand up on Whole Foods or in any gourmet
[SPEAKER_00]: shop on its own and then look to infuse
the oil to make sure that we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine for the people here in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason medicine needs to taste
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at really going into the low
dose of 10 milligrams and 25 milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: are the only two serving sizes that we
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our belief is that that's where the
market's going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants to take a 500 milligram
cookie and break it into 10 pieces and
[SPEAKER_00]: have guesswork of how much am I having?
[SPEAKER_00]: Last time I had a good experience,
this time am I going to have a bad
[SPEAKER_00]: experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much medication am I really getting?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our stuff is triple tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we tell you it's 10 milligrams or
25 milligrams, it's really 10 milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: or 25 milligrams of active THC and so we
feel that's really the future on a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things as you look at Colorado and their
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all now, it has to be 10 milligrams
serving size, maximum of 100 milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: proportion or per container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it really leads to making sure
with the safety aspect and as people get
[SPEAKER_00]: into it to understand, you know,
when you talk to a lot of people these
[SPEAKER_00]: days, they talk about how edibles,
they're excited, they like it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're still unsure on how to
actually medicate with edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the appropriate dose?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's really a lack of education out
there on some of this and that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're really trying to push is the
education level, that consistency level
[SPEAKER_00]: that people can really understand and know
what to expect every single time they have
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we looked into licensing a product here
into California like Dixie, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was one of those opportunities to,
as we jumped into this market,
[SPEAKER_00]: to have somebody who had a lot more
experience than us and knowledge into
[SPEAKER_00]: things and to be able to benefit from
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we started talking with Chuck and
Tripp on the licensing things and being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to feel comfortable sharing
information where going, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: wait a second, you guys are starting your
own edible company and we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: share our recipes and our process and the
science behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we quickly, you know, we worked
through a lot of that stuff because we had
[SPEAKER_00]: the experience in food science and
manufacturing, which we could also lend to
[SPEAKER_00]: Dixie and really help elevate each other's
brands where they're really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were a little weaker where they were a
little weaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some more expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're very big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from the restaurant industry where
restaurants, the camaraderie between chefs
[SPEAKER_00]: and restaurateurs, we constantly help each
other out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We loan the neighbor restaurant a bottle
of vodka if they run out or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just ran out of sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You run next door to your neighbor
restaurant and they loan it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's not a lot of that
camaraderie yet in this business and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: really starting to see that to where
like-minded individuals, like-minded
[SPEAKER_00]: brands can really help each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of room on the shelves for
multiple brands that are all doing it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the right way so that we can bring
transparency and we can bring safety and
[SPEAKER_00]: we can bring expectations into this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry with, in terms of
camaraderie, has definitely some room to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and as we can all get together and
share trade secrets and different things
[SPEAKER_00]: on how we do things, it's going to be
great for the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I think there's a lot of
like-minded people that are starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: see that and come together and say there's
plenty of shelf space there for the
[SPEAKER_00]: best-in-class, per se, that will help
elevate this industry, that will help move
[SPEAKER_00]: the movement, will help with legislation
and be part of it versus fight the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a big part of what we want to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very open.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a 15,000-square-foot manufacturing
facility in Salinas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a license, a business license that
actually states cannabis-infused products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've invited, we've had congressmen,
senators, police chiefs, FBI all walk our
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, tour it, other competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've opened our doors to everybody else
to say, listen, it's an open book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get together and make sure that
we're all doing this in the right manner
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we can elevate this business and
we can stand on the steps of Congress or
[SPEAKER_00]: the Senate and say, listen, we pay our
taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in child-proof packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do everything to be a legitimate
business and to continue to give patients
[SPEAKER_00]: the medication they need or in other
states like Colorado and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: adults that are over 21 years of age,
an alternative to a way to unwind at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of a day's work or to relax or to
medicate in a way that they see fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Licensing in the cannabis industry is
always a very interesting pathway because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The federal government still doesn't
recognize contracts, really, in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really have the rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was going to stand up in court if
you're going to do, if it ever came to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really about doing business deals
with people that you trust and like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always joke, life's too short to be
in business with people you don't enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: being in business with or working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was one of the great things
with Dixie and Altai is that we have the
[SPEAKER_00]: same mindset, the same goals long-term
with elevating this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's interesting because we want to
share ideas and share product,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can't go across state lines
because they're federally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulated and so you have to be able to
come up with systems where our packaging
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from Colorado for Dixie,
but we manufacture everything in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we buy all local ingredients from
California, all accustomed to their
[SPEAKER_00]: recipes and in touch with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the cannabis and the oil comes from
Monterey County and Santa Cruz County.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the test results are based here in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really looking at how you build
out markets and being able to trust your
[SPEAKER_00]: brand because as we all know, your brand
is everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be able to sit down with
individuals and say, listen, here's my
[SPEAKER_00]: baby that I've nurtured for five years and
we've created this amazing thing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: area of Dixie where they've spent five
years and built this brand in Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: that's so recognized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be able to turn that over to us
here in California and know that we will
[SPEAKER_00]: treat that brand just as they will in
Colorado and to make sure that the safety
[SPEAKER_00]: and the aspects and all of the
manufacturing and science and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: they put into their bars and their
products that will maintain that quality
[SPEAKER_00]: standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's great with the licensing
deal too and the relationship that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: with Dixie.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we look at the markets, the difference
between Colorado and California obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: are very vast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, California's had a cannabis
movement for over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, you know, as much as they passed
us with their recreational or adult use,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously California was way ahead of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously the culture, you know,
with the growers, everything that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: here in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we spent a lot of time with Dixie,
whether we're in Colorado or they come
[SPEAKER_00]: here into our facility as we start to
tweak recipes to make sure, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no humidity in Colorado or very
little compared to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so recipes have to be tweaked for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also making things at 7,000 feet elevation
versus sea level.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things are taken into effect
as we build out recipes and product lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, here in California, again,
you have a lot of areas where people have
[SPEAKER_00]: been utilizing the product for a long
period of time, they're looking for higher
[SPEAKER_00]: dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've taken things like the toasted
rooster that was 84 milligrams in Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's 180 milligrams here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now again, it's scored for 15 milligrams
per square.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when anybody looks at doing a
licensing deal with another company is
[SPEAKER_00]: really do your research, look at the
brand, understand if your core concepts,
[SPEAKER_00]: your core values are aligned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, do you like the individuals that
you're doing business with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because hopefully it's going to be a
long-term deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would always stay away from short-term
things, putting your toe in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't want to go out and
build somebody's brand, bring everything
[SPEAKER_00]: into a bunch of dispensaries and then walk
away from that in a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always looking for long-term
relationships and do your research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really dive into things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand what is the consumer's feeling
about this brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the industry's feeling about this
brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: And to make sure that when you go into a
partnership like this, you're bringing the
[SPEAKER_00]: right brand, the right values,
the right package and product to fill a
[SPEAKER_00]: void in your market.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the edible market, you're going to see
a lot of growth over the next few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you've seen in the last year,
the market's I think quadrupled in the
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you talk to Steve D'Angelo in
Harborside, edibles used to make up this
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny little portion of Harborside in a
corner two years ago, and now it has prime
[SPEAKER_00]: time space right in the middle as they're
seeing consumers continuing to move
[SPEAKER_00]: towards that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially here in California where
smoking, people are so sensitive to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking, to smoking flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edible seems like it's not this illegal
thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, hey, popping a piece of milk
chocolate or a bonbon doesn't feel
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal, but it gives me the medication,
it gives me the relaxation, the feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm looking for in a way that I'm not
publicly out there smoking or any other
[SPEAKER_00]: ways you're looking to ingest the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think beverages are definitely an area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dixie Elixir in Colorado, I mean,
it's more than 50% of their revenues is
[SPEAKER_00]: their elixirs and their sodas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a popular area to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, for people who don't drink and to
be able to go out and be able to be social
[SPEAKER_00]: with people these days and be able to have
their soda, their medicine, their thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that's equal to a glass of wine or a beer
and have a Dixie One, which is 10
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams, it's pretty much equivalent to
a glass of wine or a mixed cocktail and be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to be social like that in that
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you're gonna see continued more
low dose items, more regulation where you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually know what's in the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's tested versus being charan
wrapped with a sticker on it or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that to where regulation's a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the different areas to keep people
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tamper proof packaging, it's definitely
gonna be a big area that you're gonna see
[SPEAKER_00]: things moving down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, low dose as people start to
experiment back into this industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding what their comfort level is
and to be able to be social and just be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to take the edge off.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we've jumped into this industry,
it's been interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a year in the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've actually had product on the shelves
now for only eight weeks, both Altai and
[SPEAKER_00]: Dixie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we continue to grow the team and we
have 10 sales reps throughout California
[SPEAKER_00]: that build out everything and visit all
the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a manufacturing team right now of
about 15 people that work Monday through
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plant's 15,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the ability to really ramp up
and look towards that ramp of November
[SPEAKER_00]: 2016 when most of us here think that
California will go adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll go into effect most likely in
January of 18, but really ramping up for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we see that, we'll need to
really build the manufacturing side out
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure that we can handle the new
influx of people that are very interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry and looking to try a
different alternative when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: being social.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you next time.
