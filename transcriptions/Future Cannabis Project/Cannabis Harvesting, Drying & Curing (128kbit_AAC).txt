[SPEAKER_00]: To determine when a plant is ready are the
indicators of harvest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking for both the pistils and
the trichomes will begin to change color
[SPEAKER_00]: as the plant matures and gets closer to
harvest and the plant itself will start to
[SPEAKER_00]: lose energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice change of color in some of
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the big families will start to
wither, turn yellow as the plant kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: withdraws the nutrients out of those and
basically sheds them in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the plant itself will just start
to lose energy, start to lose momentum.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you first go into flower you see it
build real quickly into that push and then
[SPEAKER_00]: as it gets towards the end that energy
backs way off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pistils and trichomes will shift from
the trichomes are generally a clear early
[SPEAKER_00]: then turn milky and then we'll start to
oxidize turn orange dark and tan on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start to see a ratio of about
80-20 with the pistols which do the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing go from a light a white color or I
shouldn't necessarily say that they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: all white but they'll go from a live
healthy moisture present to dry withered
[SPEAKER_00]: and often a darker color.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moist is the new growth and you'll
start to see the plant slow down the new
[SPEAKER_00]: pistils emerging will slow down and slow
down and slow down the old ones will
[SPEAKER_00]: wither and eventually what ends up
happening is you end up with different
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios early into flower you should if the
plant is healthy you'll have close to a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred percent of the pistols are a
lighter color and alive and actively
[SPEAKER_00]: emerging and then as that slows down and
the old ones start to turn dark the new
[SPEAKER_00]: ones will slow as well the new emergence
will slow down and eventually what you end
[SPEAKER_00]: up with is the majority of them are dead
or dry and withered and so the the two
[SPEAKER_00]: changing color and kind of the ratios the
percentages that you find are what lead
[SPEAKER_00]: you into the question of you know is it
time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes time to harvest often the
manner the harvest depends on the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: it's done differently indoors the
greenhouses and outdoor scenarios
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how big that plant was
usually for me is the determining factor
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what method you might consider
you can go in take the whole plant down
[SPEAKER_00]: and just hang the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: With some of the bigger ones what you'll
see is that the flowers mature on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside before they mature on the inside
so the things down on the inside branches
[SPEAKER_00]: below the colas will be sometimes a week
behind week and a half and if you take the
[SPEAKER_00]: tops off of big plants first and then
allow that inside to mature a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: in my experience you end up with a higher
yield you can do two is obviously the
[SPEAKER_00]: starting point if you're going more than
one I've seen it done as many as four and
[SPEAKER_00]: five times I think when you start to get
into five cuts on the same plant that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily viable commercially but I
think a first harvest on the outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the big plants is and and
increases your yield and can increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of the material down on the inside
if you allow that actually excess to
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight before taking it you take the
tops off and de-leaf a little bit the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the plant again and allow that
light to get in and penetrate down into
[SPEAKER_00]: some of that stuff that hasn't really seen
light you'll notice that they get more
[SPEAKER_00]: dense a lot of times they'll put on mass
they'll continue to grow and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times what you'll find is that when the
when the outside colas specifically are
[SPEAKER_00]: ready for harvest if you look down inside
that stuff still has a ways to go all the
[SPEAKER_00]: pistols will be the the pistols will tend
to be fresher younger continuing to emerge
[SPEAKER_00]: or appearing to continue to emerge very
few dry withered compared to the outsides
[SPEAKER_00]: and and the trichomes as well will
generally be behind the the outside behind
[SPEAKER_00]: the the colas the outside of the plant
generally a the key I think for the curing
[SPEAKER_00]: of it is is controlling the temperature
and humidity in the room and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep that as stable as possible
fluctuations in temperature and humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: are what begin to turn the plant colors in
a lot of cases you'll start to see things
[SPEAKER_00]: will tan off if they were if they were
taken on a little bit too hard of a ride
[SPEAKER_00]: what you want to try and do is bring the
temperature and humidity of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material kind of down down down down and
and kind of slide it in rather than just
[SPEAKER_00]: all the humidity out and then continue to
to drain off what continues to come out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant material for a few days the
drying of the material will take a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit too hard of a dip and a lot of times
what you'll do is you'll dip below the
[SPEAKER_00]: threshold for the cure which is if I
remember correctly is 50% and so if you
[SPEAKER_00]: drop that plant material below 50%
humidity that curing process stops and
[SPEAKER_00]: what you have is a dried material often
the difference between that drying it
[SPEAKER_00]: versus kind of curing it versus slowly
withdrawing the the last bits of moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: out differences is often found in the
smoke the the young stuff the flash dried
[SPEAKER_00]: as I tend to refer to it the flash dried
stuff you tend to get a little bit harsher
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke and the THC to kind of changes the
experience as it matures it softens it
[SPEAKER_00]: mellows the experience a little bit
especially with some of the sativa stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that can get you really racy very
uplifting but a lot of times that can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit too much with some of the
strains that we have now being so
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly high in THC it'll it'll soften
that I guess similar to the way that they
[SPEAKER_00]: age tobacco or wine with wines you know
that there's a sharper flavor in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience has been is kind of a sharper
tint to the to the young stuff and then as
[SPEAKER_00]: you get older it gets kind of smoother
more refined and that same type of thing
[SPEAKER_00]: happens with with THC which with cannabis
for the cure the temperature and humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling the temperature and humidity
of the room is kind of the most the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest priority for me is watching that
temperature and humidity in the room not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily in the plant material but in
the room so as you first look at the room
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to load up a cure space or dry
space and that fresh plant material will
[SPEAKER_00]: be will be shedding moisture very very
quickly so your humidity will shoot up and
[SPEAKER_00]: it will stay high for usually two three
four days during that stage I take the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity out as fast as possible and then
as that starts to slow down I will back
[SPEAKER_00]: off the speed at which I'm pulling the
humidity out of the room and that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: allows the plant material to shed the
moisture and a little bit more drawn out
[SPEAKER_00]: drawing out that that that drying process
or the process of shedding the moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: and what I'm trying to avoid is just kind
of a crash and in humidity sucking it out
[SPEAKER_00]: too fast and a lot of times what you'll
end up doing is you'll dry it too fast
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll become crispy you'll drop below the
threshold of 50% and once you once you
[SPEAKER_00]: drop below that threshold my understanding
of the process is that that's when the
[SPEAKER_00]: curing stops and once it stops there's no
restarting it so in order the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between drying it and curing it is
maintaining maintaining a minimum of 50
[SPEAKER_00]: percent humidity in the material and
drawing it out slowly elongating that
[SPEAKER_00]: process a bit drawing out that process
ends up with a higher quality product cure
[SPEAKER_00]: space temperature I tend to keep it as low
as most AC systems will allow which seems
[SPEAKER_00]: to be in the mid to high 50s and then as
I'm drawing out the humidity the only
[SPEAKER_00]: other real concern that I have is airflow
in the room keeping the humidity within
[SPEAKER_00]: that room consistent throughout the room
not having higher humidity down low hot
[SPEAKER_00]: dry air up top you'll you'll end up with
an uneven uneven cure if I'm able to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: the room for a few days at 55% humidity
that's kind of a I've had my best results
[SPEAKER_00]: that way if I'm able to draw that process
out and finish by being able to hold the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and humidity in the room
temperature low and consistent from start
[SPEAKER_00]: to finish or as close to consistent as I
can get from start to finish and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity drawing that out quickly to
beginning slowing it way way way down and
[SPEAKER_00]: and then that last few days the process I
should be able to if I'm on top of things
[SPEAKER_00]: and in a easily controlled environment I
should be able to take that last few days
[SPEAKER_00]: and just hold the room right where it is
and allow the last little bit of humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of make its way from the inside of
the flower to the outside out into the air
[SPEAKER_00]: and then if you're able to get that whole
space to hold that 55% humidity for that
[SPEAKER_00]: extra day or two days what you're doing is
kind of evening everything out so if there
[SPEAKER_00]: are parts that dried a little bit faster
than others that last little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity is going to continue to work
itself out of the dense the more dense
[SPEAKER_00]: material and you'll end up with a more
consistent humidity throughout so the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the flower will be roughly 55%
60% humidity and the inside will be the
[SPEAKER_00]: same versus the outside being the outside
being 40% humidity or 35% humidity or or
[SPEAKER_00]: even 50% humidity and the inside is still
in the 60s or 70s you know 10 to 10 10 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 points higher on the inside for for
that first stage of the cure the cure can
[SPEAKER_00]: be broken into stages you don't
necessarily have to keep the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: process in your drying space or in your in
your initial in your kind of initial cure
[SPEAKER_00]: space you can if you can draw that process
the first step of the process out to 10 12
[SPEAKER_00]: days that seems to be a very easily
achievable target where if you draw it out
[SPEAKER_00]: too long then you're just allowing you
know that stuff to kind of sit out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: air a little bit longer than needed you
then break it down break it down into bins
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can kind of slow walk the
remainder of the process there by just
[SPEAKER_00]: checking the bins on occasion closing them
up and allowing that humidity in the bin
[SPEAKER_00]: to even out keeping track obviously what
that is and if there's still a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more humidity to escape you can burp the
lids on occasion there are a handful of
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to to go into that second stage of
cure what's been I think very popular for
[SPEAKER_00]: a very long time now on what's been more
of the hobbyist scale compared to you know
[SPEAKER_00]: we're now expanding into full scale
commercial production type facilities but
[SPEAKER_00]: in the history of Canada the last 60 years
of the history of cannabis at least it's
[SPEAKER_00]: been underground and on a small scale
which makes it to wear large mason jars or
[SPEAKER_00]: five gallon bottles sealable containers of
that size work well for the second stage
[SPEAKER_00]: of cure you want I tend to go towards food
grade material you don't necessarily just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to go grab a Home Depot bucket I
think that the the smells the off gassing
[SPEAKER_00]: of the manufacturing process of the
plastics can work its way into the flour
[SPEAKER_00]: material but any sort of food grade
plastic or glass in anything mason jar up
[SPEAKER_00]: to maybe a five gallon as you scale that
up you start to start to look at things
[SPEAKER_00]: like 55 gallon drums that can be just
rotated on a rack a little bit at a time
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of keep that material moving if
there is any humidity left you don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: it all sinking to the bottom you want
everything in there to kind of cure evenly
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can turn that 55 gallon bucket for
to have five gallon drum on a rack similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to what you see with you know whiskey the
bear else yeah on its side it seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: the key to longer term storage is in
temperature and humidity levels being
[SPEAKER_00]: maintained but also removing the oxygen
from the equation so storing in vacuum
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed or nitrogen sealed bags similar to
the way they store you know a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things in the market in the supermarket
more often than not what I see is a rush
[SPEAKER_00]: to get paid that causes people to skip
that last step and so assuming you've
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten all the way to the finish line you
have clean healthy material the the most
[SPEAKER_00]: common way people kind of lose that
quality level that I found is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: drying process and then storage
transportation any sort of heat and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity fluctuations will cause that
material to start to turn the color first
[SPEAKER_00]: and smell let's say both will go usually
hand-in-hand depending on how that
[SPEAKER_00]: material is treated if it's not it's not
treated well after harvest you lose value
[SPEAKER_00]: so if you had something that may sell for
a thousand dollars a pound now the smell
[SPEAKER_00]: is kind of diminished in the appearance is
starting to turn a little bit there's
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a little bit more color it's not a
clean green dried material or cured
[SPEAKER_00]: material it starts to tan turn various
shades of yellow orange tint will start to
[SPEAKER_00]: come into the material and and then the
the smell will also start to diminish or
[SPEAKER_00]: turn into something else a lot of times
you'll be able to to really tell from from
[SPEAKER_00]: the smell specifically what's happening
was it was the material cured properly
[SPEAKER_00]: stored properly or was it put away wet
will create a little bit a different scent
[SPEAKER_00]: then if it was beaten up while it was
still alive and then properly cured things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that so you'll start to see the
quality level diminish and and in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cases it seems that that is due to kind of
a rush to get to market rush to get paid
[SPEAKER_00]: and in that rush you end up taking less on
the material you you you you you
