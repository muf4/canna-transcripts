[SPEAKER_00]: Si vous n'avez pas de nom pour tous ces
microbes, comment ça serait ?
[SPEAKER_00]: Comment ça serait d'order du café de Java,
si vous n'avez pas l'exacte mot qui
[SPEAKER_00]: définit, l'exacte profil terpènes que vous
voulez, ou du cigare, ou du vin,
[SPEAKER_00]: ou du chez, ou de n'importe quoi qui est
dégustatif.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vous avez besoin d'un vocabulaire pour
distinguer et même plus de cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: parce qu'il y a tellement de diversité.
[SPEAKER_02]: C'est comme des graines, vous savez,
il y a combien de différents... Il y a une
[SPEAKER_00]: douzaine de cultivateurs, maintenant il y
a des milliers et des milliers et des
[SPEAKER_00]: milliers de cultivateurs de cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: C'est ce qui complique un peu.
[SPEAKER_00]: La histoire des terroirs basiques est
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nous n'avons même pas besoin de prouver
que nous avons un terroir de cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: c'est prouvé.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintenant, quand vous ajoutez la
diversité de cannabis à ce que représente
[SPEAKER_00]: un terroir, ça le traite à une autre
dimension, vous dévouez le cannabis de
[SPEAKER_00]: toute façon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ça va être plus grand que tout ce qu'il y
a.
[SPEAKER_00]: C'est déjà plus grand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mais ce n'est pas une limitation,
c'est juste un territoire beaucoup plus
[SPEAKER_00]: grand.
[SPEAKER_00]: C 'est un territoire qui crée beaucoup de
profils différents, vous savez ce que je
[SPEAKER_00]: veux dire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Donc, nous devons plus s'attendre à la
base, c'est comme une appelation d
[SPEAKER_00]: 'origine, c'est quelque chose qui est
dédié à créer de la qualité seulement.
[SPEAKER_00]: C'est ça, le nom du jeu c'est ça.
[SPEAKER_00]: Donc, nous devons s'attendre à tous les
standards qui créent de la qualité,
[SPEAKER_00]: en commençant, je n'ai jamais vraiment
pensé à ça, mais le microbe dans votre
[SPEAKER_00]: cerveau, je pense, ce serait la première
étape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vous savez, savoir votre cerveau,
ce que les plantes prennent de votre
[SPEAKER_00]: cerveau, et ce qui définit cette
caractéristique spécifique de la place où
[SPEAKER_00]: elle crée, le goût de cet endroit
spécifique, c'est le valeur de la
[SPEAKER_00]: fermeture petite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Et le terroir est définitivement le
mélange précis des nutrients qui sont
[SPEAKER_02]: apportés par la plante et comment la
plante disperse cela dans son corps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Et c'est ce qui donne ce goût unique aux
différents cultivateurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mais pas seulement le cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: C'est pour tout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parce qu'en France, vous avez le terroir,
le pays, le climat, le cultivateur,
[SPEAKER_00]: et les agriculteurs, les communautés qui
créent cette qualité.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mais vous avez aussi le terroir,
le test du terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Et dans ce cas, il y a toujours été un
grand débat parce qu'il n'a jamais été
[SPEAKER_00]: prouvé que le terroir capture la
caractéristique de la place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintenant, avec l'étude sur le microbe,
ils réalisent que c'est en fait la vie
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiale qui change d'une certaine
partie de la terre à l'autre côté du
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Et c'est ce qui donne ce différent
caractéristique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ce n'est pas la plante, c'est la vie dans
le sol qui fait tout.
[SPEAKER_06]: Il y a des communautés dans le sol,
n'est-ce pas ?
[SPEAKER_06]: Et comment sont ces communautés dans le
sol qui transforent les communautés
[SPEAKER_06]: au-dessus du terroir ?
[SPEAKER_00]: Avec le cannabis, parce qu'il utilise son
terroir pour régler tout sur le terrain,
[SPEAKER_00]: la spécificité du climat, de la vie
insecte, va donner un certain aspect de
[SPEAKER_00]: son profil que vous n'aurez pas sur l
'autre côté du terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ou dans d'autres endroits dans le monde.
[SPEAKER_00]: C'est comme si vous aviez... En tant que
vous obtenez les terpenes de tous les
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients que la plante absorbe,
ces terpenes, les plantes les mélangent,
[SPEAKER_00]: selon la nécessité supérieure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Donc, je veux voir si cette métaphore s
'arrête.
[SPEAKER_05]: Toutes ces petites pièces de puzzle sont
comme une photo pixelée.
[SPEAKER_05]: C'est par eux-mêmes, ils sont une partie
de ça, mais seulement en travaillant
[SPEAKER_05]: ensemble, vous voyez ce qui se passe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oui, je pense que c'est une bonne
métaphore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Et certes dans le monde de la science,
en étant très réductionniste, ils veulent
[SPEAKER_02]: prendre chaque petite pixel et étudier ça
très, très finement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Et ils se perdent dans ce réductionnisme.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ils oublient qu'ils doivent mettre toutes
les pièces dans le puzzle ensemble pour
[SPEAKER_02]: voir ce pattern entier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Et puis vous réalisez que c'est juste une
petite pixelée et une photo plus grande.
[SPEAKER_02]: Une photo que c'est plus grande et plus
grande et plus grande.
[SPEAKER_06]: Qu'est-ce qu'il y a entre les communautés
et les gens ?
[SPEAKER_06]: Comment les murs, les communautés dans le
sol vont effectuer les communautés comme
[SPEAKER_06]: des gens ?
[SPEAKER_05]: C'est une bonne question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Le direct de l'enquête des nutriments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Non, attendez.
[SPEAKER_05]: Qui a aidé le plus ?
[SPEAKER_05]: Quelles communautés autour du monde,
pas seulement ici dans l'Amérique,
[SPEAKER_05]: quand vous prenez en compte le web de
nourriture du sol ?
[SPEAKER_02]: Qu'est-ce qu'on peut influencer ?
[SPEAKER_02]: Quel groupe de gens, de communautés ?
[SPEAKER_05]: Quelles cultures sont les plus réceptives
à apprendre à faire ça de façon naturelle
[SPEAKER_02]: ?
[SPEAKER_02]: C 'est les pays les plus pauvres du monde.
[SPEAKER_02]: C'est là que le plus grand effet peut s
'occuper le plus rapidement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Parce que vous devez envoyer quelqu'un là
pour qu'ils comprennent les mesures
[SPEAKER_02]: simples, whereas in industrialized
nations, we've got to have big equipment,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've got 1,000 acres of farms or 10,000
hectares of farms or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard to change those systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mono-culture is not good for the planet,
they just don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do big space, but you have to cut
down that big space into chunks,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in nature, chunks that do not
produce the same product, because insect
[SPEAKER_00]: lives, the whole life web of the planet,
is made of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're fucking scared of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to create GMO, tomato,
to make a tomato resist arid place,
[SPEAKER_00]: the tomato was bloody born in a desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have on a planet some genetics
that could do exactly and better whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like it's that fear of diversity
and wanting to corner that specific aspect
[SPEAKER_00]: of whatever because we fancy it better.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why we do GMO in the
conventional world is because we want
[SPEAKER_02]: everything to become right on exactly the
same day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the most important thing about
your food ?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it became that it was all pickable
at the same time on the same day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the wrong thing to be emphasizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they don't really have the choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to create plants that can grow on
poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to grow a plant or you have to
clean the soil to be able to grow an
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is only two choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds very simple when you...
[SPEAKER_05]: You say there's only two choices.
[SPEAKER_05]: Working 100% with a healthy ecosystem,
which takes care of the plant for you,
[SPEAKER_05]: or growing it in poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's where we stole them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that where you feel too?
[SPEAKER_02]: In the industrial version where you have
to grow it in poison to control every
[SPEAKER_02]: single little process.
[SPEAKER_07]: Micromanage it to death.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, to death.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the fact is if we get the proper
biology in the soil, we can achieve the
[SPEAKER_02]: same end, which is to get everything
becoming ripe on the same day and harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: it just the way the chemical companies
want to be able to manage all of their
[SPEAKER_02]: growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do the same thing, but you have to
understand all the bits and pieces in that
[SPEAKER_02]: picture puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture here, it's flabbergasting for
all Europeans to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we have a connection with our
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our farmers are small.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom, she never bought in her life
anything but at the farmer down the street
[SPEAKER_00]: every other day of her life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my grandma the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those farmers during World War II,
not only they were growing food for
[SPEAKER_00]: France, but they were risking their life
to bring that in a city.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot of power, the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are protected like national treasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing that come in a country
that can compete with the quality and the
[SPEAKER_00]: price that are owed by the French
government and the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they go on strike, there is
nothing that move in France ever until you
[SPEAKER_00]: give it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like that power, that relation
with people, you don't have it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is respect for farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a better understanding that your
carrot is actually growing in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people have no relation with that
part of the food chain because here it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not food, it's business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food, it's not something super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharing food in Europe, sharing water
around the Mediterranean Sea, it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest hospitality gesture that you can
give.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like food is everything and now we
just see it as a necessity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing behind but it's business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commodity, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like our health is dependent on what
you eat and we are eating poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to make it worse by creating GMO
monster when you can just clean the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you say, it's not that difficult to
clean the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to dedicate, there is so
much organic matter that we can take care
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they clean the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are responsible because there is a huge
responsibility behind being in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are supposed to save the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you go in Colorado, they extract only
CBD from plants and they throw the hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: stock and they let it rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even do paper with it,
seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is a by-product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's icing on the cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant has been breathed for tens of
thousands of years to make fiber and seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and that you just throw away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The money people, they don't see what you
can do with hemp fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not only you can change the face of
the planet, but the guy who's going to put
[SPEAKER_00]: a biodegradable plastic bag on the table
is going to eat it seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a jackpot, you want money,
do this bag, do this road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do everything that is made of petrol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us some bricks that are fireproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really need it in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is so much to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, you clean the ground and
it's the ultimate power that gives us the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to go into the 21st century and
find really a source of energy that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't compromise life on Earth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Many traditional cultures that I've
experienced around the world, the farmer
[SPEAKER_05]: is at the same cultural level in the
community as the best hunter or the best
[SPEAKER_05]: fisherman because it's really about
meeting the community's needs and the
[SPEAKER_05]: farmer is the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: When the animals aren't there,
plants are really hard to run away from.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have managed to denigrate the role of
the farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people think of farmers as being
stupid and not really knowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But part of it is that instead of them
managing their own land and them managing
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant and getting the best,
they just call up a fertilizer agent and
[SPEAKER_02]: that fertilizer person tells them what to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to go out and put out three tons
of lime and half a ton of gypsum on your
[SPEAKER_02]: land and then a week later, what am I
supposed to do from the farmer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're supposed to go out and you
put on ammonium nitrate or you put out
[SPEAKER_02]: urea and the next week it's something
else, something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that farmer has released the
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are just slaves, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're serfs to the chemical companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: For being told what to do by someone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're not thinking, they're not
participating in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just the worker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've got to have farmers that
actually understand and know what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small farms are much better for having
people really know what's going on in
[SPEAKER_02]: their soil, what's going on with their
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a thousand hectares, you have a
thousand acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can you keep track of everything?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really like the European model much
better where the farms are smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I look at the space you have here,
it's really hard to think small farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same point, what I don't
understand is monoculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I learn that you have to move your B
from A to Z to B to C over the country to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to have pollination, this is scary
to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're a farmer and you don't
have B, you don't have pollination,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, oh man, and you're not flipping
out of your shoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: No pollination, no seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like we're really reaching a point
of no return here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the scary thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole economic power that stands
behind cannabis has to be used to change
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, it's not like I'm cool,
I don't want to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give away and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of people, but fucking make
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we have money, it's a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have money, you can do stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more money you have, the bigger the
stuff you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there is so much stuff to do that it
would be cool that people with a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: level of consciousness have the bread to
make it happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And take care of their community.
[SPEAKER_00]: To define a terroir, there is six
sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the science of soil, which is two
sciences at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else, it's all the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beyond the actual farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more that the community of the region
and the agronomy that changes,
[SPEAKER_00]: that specific place and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just heard him say that there's the
soil community and then there's the rest
[SPEAKER_05]: of the community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's all community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now what we're doing is even bridging
the gap between the soil community and the
[SPEAKER_05]: rest of the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think it's not community,
it's soil awareness that we never had.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's something that our ancestors knew
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like our grandparents,
they knew how to keep the soil fertile
[SPEAKER_00]: doing not that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And producing a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have the science to show what
our valid traditions are, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important because you need
this to validate anything in the 21st
[SPEAKER_00]: century, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, it's just like bullshit of old
people, crazy people, that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you can put the number and show
that, yes, you're doing this, you produce
[SPEAKER_00]: such a ripple in a life web and that's why
you shouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's only
[SPEAKER_00]: the vocal, oral knowledge that is passed
down, it's something that you have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: into it to believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can tell everybody here that has
been using bullshit, pushed by companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, it's simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making a mistake because this is
this and this and it's not refutable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you fast-fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like now tradition has the weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That science brings with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, Ash and everything that is
happening, it's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need that science to be able to prove
what I experienced with a plant and a
[SPEAKER_00]: resin all my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody thinks of microbes and the life web
of the soil when everything is coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Except for people who've been studying for
40 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to interject something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to keep things simple, three words
or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came up with something that I refer to
as symbiosis to synapse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a very good way of relating
that because your brain synapse and then
[SPEAKER_01]: the symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really a good expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be wrong, but I like to keep
things very simple for people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a term that if you could simplify
it even more that you would say embodies
[SPEAKER_05]: what you've spent so much time?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a scientist and I get down to those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work at fairly small scales and then
build the layers up and look at each
[SPEAKER_02]: layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We often talk about breadth of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we need depth of knowledge as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like our roots?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, somewhat similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the question.
[SPEAKER_05]: How will the roots grow?
[SPEAKER_05]: How deep will the roots go?
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Standard ecological answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on the conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most plants can be put in their root
systems down 15, 20, 25, 100.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you get to certain feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why is my plant growing in a pot this
small?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we restrict our plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: A small tree in a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no smart pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice brown name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen how the main roots destroy the
bottom and go straight down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it a clue that you shouldn't
confine?
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we go out with big equipment,
when we compact the soil, when we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have plant material on the surface of the
soil, then rainfall will hit that surface
[SPEAKER_02]: and cause compaction at some depth,
which means your roots going down can't
[SPEAKER_02]: get through that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to go sideways and they're
going to fight with their neighbor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to fight with things around.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of your plants are going to be
healthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So instead of them thriving as a
community, this is a metaphor too.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're fighting for survival.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, it's warfare.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they can fight on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they can fight on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to fight, but let's not
fight with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because nature really selects more towards
symbiosis, working together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as you have plants in the soil,
they should have mycorrhizal fungi that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're sharing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore, every plant in this whole
thousand acres, should be connected
[SPEAKER_02]: equally as healthy because they're
connected below ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is really one plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: The aspen tree is a literal example that a
lot of people know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because when an aspen tree turns,
a whole hillside will turn because it's
[SPEAKER_05]: really one tree with lots of branches that
come up out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of runners popping up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where in our situation, we know that it's
not just one tree, it's one community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we want the whole thing to be healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want everything connected below ground
because then everything's healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If any one of those plants is healthy,
then all of them will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that chain, if there is anyone that
cannot feed the other, you're in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, it's finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't work anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty violent when you think of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the predator eating each other,
literally, until there is the goodness
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plant is taking from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the microbial level, it's warfare.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really like the plant is the farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant is putting out the exudates to
grow this system to protect itself,
[SPEAKER_02]: to build above ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And below ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant is in control of all of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since World War I, human beings have
started to forget about that, not pay
[SPEAKER_02]: attention to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant is stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to supply it with all of its
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't fend for itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to put all of this effort into
growing a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if you would just stop and let the
right biology come back, the plant is
[SPEAKER_02]: perfectly capable of growing itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of getting the nutrients that it requires
and protecting itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Without us adding truckloads of amendment
that it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Toxic chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're killing ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I learned that the whole industry of
feeding plants is based on the three
[SPEAKER_00]: elements that you find once you burn the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you figure it out a way, the whole
alimentation of a living organism,
[SPEAKER_00]: by burning that living organism and
checking what is left from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you figure out the alimentation
of a human being by burning and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: the data from the ashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't even make sense in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody follows it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people bullshit you with a level
of non-logical approach to it that is
[SPEAKER_00]: really scary and nobody asks questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're living through chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're just chemicals or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a huge number of emergent
properties that you cannot predict just on
[SPEAKER_02]: the basis of the chemistry in your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mineral elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't predict human behavior from that
point of view.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why do we keep trying to do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's used as an excuse to sell people
something they don't need.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put themselves into that trap by
listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get to need it after because they
have no choice but.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they've destroyed the system
that's supposed to be there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a point because they're in an
addictive relationship where they have to
[SPEAKER_05]: go back.
[SPEAKER_05]: You do it one time, that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Suppose that's one time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You kill your microbes and they're dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not there to do the job that the
plant's expecting them to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now the plant's not getting the
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not getting what it needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think that we have to come along and
we have to provide it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you kill the organisms, then you're
going to have to do their job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are horrific.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are really bad at doing the job that
these microorganisms should be doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they love to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like human beings living in houses
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Human beings want to live there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to have families.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well so do the organisms in the Soil Belt.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just their house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we keep destroying them when
they're only trying to do what they're
supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because somebody wants to sell you
something that you don't need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doctor, is there any evidence in using
crystals or rocks with plant or living
[SPEAKER_01]: organisms in Earth?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a way to measure that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: There sometimes seems to be a benefit but
not all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we don't have machines.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a way to assess it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can't measure something... It
doesn't count.
[SPEAKER_01]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't know what I've been feeling
for a while and I wasn't sure if there was
[SPEAKER_01]: any kind of... So I'm not going to say yes
or no.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a scientist point of view,
we've got to work on how do we measure
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you measure moon for tidal forces
of the moon?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you measure...
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you measure different kinds of
energies coming through the atmosphere?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Resonant frequency.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry that I can't answer that.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how I answer that question to my
kid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that specific.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I say let's go find out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes it's a Google search.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it's us going out to the garden
because he's like what happens if you do
[SPEAKER_05]: this?
[SPEAKER_05]: My garden is a place where he can
experiment growing life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes it means he kills my plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: But my plants, once they die, stop
growing, they don't get ripped out.
[SPEAKER_05]: They go back into the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even pull roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: The root is the pathway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't take that plant and throw it
on the waste pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And take it off to the landfill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet we've taught the current
generations that that's what you do here
[SPEAKER_02]: in the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't do it in the third world.
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't teach them that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't teach them that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You didn't teach them to throw it on the
trash pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't leave something you can be
busted for.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Frenchy just gave a reality to the
culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why are you growing in pots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you put back all your trees and
everything where the plant grows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't leave shit in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You burn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You throw it in a place nobody sees it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like there's a lot of stuff that
people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because of prohibition and they don't
really know better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they've been told that if they leave
that material on the soil surface,
[SPEAKER_02]: that it grows pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how it started.
[SPEAKER_05]: So should we be taking the organic
material that grew right up out of the
[SPEAKER_05]: ground that we're standing in front and
then use that to go back into the ground?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it has to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what should be happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But who's making money?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you have to go back to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's like when you create
standard of quality, you can define as
[SPEAKER_00]: well not only the microbial life that is
going to be mandatory to do such and such
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant in such a place, but you can
control every aspect of it so that people
[SPEAKER_00]: like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like there is every plant on the
planet is growing from the preceding
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not having that, it's something we are
missing also in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was telling them last night,
if the plant has an epigenetic memory,
[SPEAKER_00]: how come we always have all the problems
that there is here that I have never seen
[SPEAKER_00]: in producing country?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the plant should be after a few
generations have no problem whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like at best, the best genetic here
are... We keep destroying the biology in
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this paradigm of conventional
agriculture, they are killing all of those
[SPEAKER_02]: things that would be allowing that plant
to develop the resistant populations of
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria, fungi, phytosone, nematodes,
micro-arthropods with worms in the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because instead of focusing on the plant's
weakness, we need to create strength.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but the plant is not weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant is weak, there is something
going wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the plant that's weak.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lack of the proper biology in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant feeds those organisms in the
soil using exudates, using sugars and
[SPEAKER_02]: proteins and carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being released from that root system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that plant is expecting to have those
organisms around that root system,
[SPEAKER_02]: in that soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's been there for the last four
billion years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant is communicating.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant keeps expecting that it's there
and will grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've destroyed, in modern
agriculture, we've destroyed that biology
[SPEAKER_02]: for the express purpose of allowing
certain people... Certain people,
[SPEAKER_02]: certain type of characteristic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was telling them because maybe they
don't winter the seed in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that there is something missing in that
whole seasonal life of the plant and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: not having the seed in the ground in the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't have that memory changing
the DNA and giving the data to the next
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I never thought about the soil at that
level either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not having the seed in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we've got other seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but for that plant to become heirloom,
to adapt to the place, you know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they keep it, they protect it in
the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just put it in the fridge often
before germinating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is something that is not happening
in the life of that seed that normally
[SPEAKER_00]: happens to seed that phase of evolution
and diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this is why it doesn't get stronger
and stronger generation after generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the soil is going to be there.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are questions that are honest
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have observations where I would
probably say I don't think that that seed
[SPEAKER_02]: being in the soil through that winter time
period is all that important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you just say that a seed in the soil
over winter may not be important?
[SPEAKER_02]: May not be that important.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still part of the picture.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you put that seed in the soil
in the springtime, we see all those
[SPEAKER_02]: populations of beneficial organisms
develop around the root system and move up
[SPEAKER_02]: onto the above ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grow plants that have no diseases,
no pests, no lack of fertility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that leads me to suspect we don't
have to have that seed in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: There isn't really anything that really
requires that to happen because we're not
[SPEAKER_02]: having plants that are weak and unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it was like for the plant to
really become part of the terroir,
[SPEAKER_00]: to become heirloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's something that they miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to breed with the plant that thrives
after a winter under hard conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That slowly, slowly you create a genetic
that becomes an heirloom, literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's local.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that might be more... But it's not
part of the defensive system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not part of the system as much as I
thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a terroir kind of thing where you're
developing the flavonoids, you're
[SPEAKER_02]: developing some chemistry in that plant
that is very dependent on making certain
[SPEAKER_02]: you have exactly the right sets of
microorganisms to end up with that flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really it might be that you have to
save the seed from those plants and plant
[SPEAKER_02]: those seeds in the springtime again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're selecting for the organisms
in the soil as well as those results of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always thought about the land and the
climate, but I never went at the microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, never.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it brings another dimension to
your ability to fine-tune and make the
[SPEAKER_00]: best of what the land has to offer you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shouldn't we make the best of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we should.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should clean what we cannot do the
best out of it as fast as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that we need to make compost
in the location that you're going to use
[SPEAKER_02]: that compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's the indigenous species of
bacteria, fungi, protozoa, nematodes,
[SPEAKER_02]: microarthropods that we want to have
growing and becoming a high number,
[SPEAKER_02]: a large biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that selects four plants that can grow
in a healthy fashion in this community.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to be taking compost from
Alaska and bringing it to Southern
[SPEAKER_02]: California because the organisms from
Alaska don't survive in that desert kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of system, or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_02]: The desert organisms can't survive.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm freezing up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm having a hard time surviving and I'm
from Central California.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we were up in Alaska, Jeff would be
happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but it's like that whole Appellation
de Régime in France.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about that concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all that local web life that is used
that makes the quality of the products
[SPEAKER_00]: that grow here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you bring from the outside and
change the recipe when the recipe is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have uniqueness and quality,
that recipe that the land is giving you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just want to protect it and nourish
it, basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: And nourish it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the plant is the farmer and it's the
one telling the whole ecosystem below the
[SPEAKER_05]: surface what's going on and what it needs,
what's our job?
[SPEAKER_02]: Our job is to grow, harvest and eat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then make certain that those organisms
that are supposed to be in that soil are
[SPEAKER_02]: promoted.
[SPEAKER_02]: You make sure that they're going to still
be there for the next crop going in the
[SPEAKER_02]: next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the next crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing the plant wants is to
reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name of the game is reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best condition appears the plant is
going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seed that's produced has maximum
nutrition in it, maximum quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the purpose of that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're just helping ourselves to that
bounty.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to reserve some of those seeds so
we plant them again.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to worry about rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we don't kill off the biology in the
soil, you're not going to have disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to have pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to have a lack of
fertility.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have more than enough nutrients in
your soil, especially with organic matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Without having to add buckets of other
stuff from all over the world,
[SPEAKER_05]: that costs money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're killing things.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're putting in those buckets of
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it in three words your last.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the name of my company in three
words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let it grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: People growing mostly organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're organic and you don't touch any
chemical, any nutrient and pesticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're not.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not about organic because salt's
organic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I put salt all over the base of my
plant, it's organic.
[SPEAKER_05]: But is it going to grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: You killed the organisms that are needed
to help that plant grow in a healthy
[SPEAKER_02]: fashion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm not a very good steward if I'm
killing the farmer.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we get started down that path?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, being dependent on
petrochemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really started with the mechanical
tractor.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we went from us having to hold the
plow on the ground and push it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have to expend all of our energy
making sure that horse or mule or whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: pulling that plow.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we go from one human being can only
manage a small acreage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, probably no more than 20 or 40
acres, something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can care for a much larger parcel if
you're not tilling it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no need to till.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the dependence on petrochemicals.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where do we start with that?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a vicious cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we have to do something to
put seed into the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that usually means you and a plow and
a horse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got to apply that muscle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't manage that much land all by
yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you have kids and you can have,
you know, okay, so there's family.
[SPEAKER_05]: Family, community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's when the mechanical tractor was
invented in Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Australians, for messing us up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden you could jump on a
tractor and you could till 100 acres,
[SPEAKER_02]: 200 acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, as soon as you start doing
that and you put your seed in,
[SPEAKER_02]: what comes up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you've tilled the soil,
you've brought that seed bank of weeds to
[SPEAKER_02]: the surface of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you do to prevent those weeds
from growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You go out and you till again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you slice and dice and crush and
destroy the biology that your plant needs
[SPEAKER_02]: in order to be able to outcompete those
weeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you then split pesticide and herbicides
on them, which kills plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we came back from World War I,
or World War II is when it really starts
[SPEAKER_02]: getting massive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you do with all of the
munitions that we're not going to have to
[SPEAKER_02]: use because we dropped the atomic bomb on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we ended the war two years early.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means we had literally piles of
munitions that weren't going to get used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And somebody noticed that if you threw
those munitions on an agricultural field,
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants started growing better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we had already destroyed the
biology in the soil, now when those plants
[SPEAKER_02]: get those soluble inorganic nutrients,
they grow better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if you had the biology in the soil
and you threw those munitions out,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's absolutely no effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the biology is already there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's that destruction of the biology in
the soil because of the mechanical tractor
[SPEAKER_02]: and then the imposition of the wars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happened just at the right time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that now we went down this pathway of
the Green Revolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in order to reverse that, we've got to
start putting this biology back into the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you put those inorganic
fertilizers on, nothing happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a waste of your time and effort.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you're going to stop putting them
on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to stop using those
pesticides because you don't have the
[SPEAKER_02]: problem with those pests and those
diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like tractor, all that happened also in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because everything is smaller in
Europe, it didn't have that much of an
[SPEAKER_00]: impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Europe, it's all small farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you're going to use a tractor on
your bigger piece, but not everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they were sharing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were much less damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: While they were damaged, they were much
less damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was also the time where they were
pushing poison on us because nobody knew
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make your life easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just put this stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you resisted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Europeans resisted more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just didn't see the point and purpose in
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we answer that question?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which question?
[SPEAKER_04]: The question of where we all start to go
wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was actually when Europeans
came to the United States and we looked at
[SPEAKER_03]: the Native Americans and thought that they
were doing it wrong and that they weren't
[SPEAKER_03]: making money off of it and we could make
it better.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were looking to nature for all their
answers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were working with ecology and fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were really putting it back in,
watching the earth and how it worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: We came in, oh, we can do it better.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to cut down all these trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to mix up the dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where it started, is making money.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at the Europeans when they
first arrived in the United States,
[SPEAKER_02]: they went into the typical slash and burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Approach, where you would cut down all of
the forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You till this land.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would get the crop for five to ten,
maybe even 15 years, at which point
[SPEAKER_02]: everything's diseased, it's unhappy,
you can't make a yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you go to the next plot and you take
down the trees, you till it, you repeat
[SPEAKER_02]: that whole cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to the journals, of Thomas
Jefferson at Monticello in Virginia,
[SPEAKER_02]: you see that's exactly what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd do agriculture here and then have to
move there and then had to move again and
[SPEAKER_02]: then he had to move again and then he had
to move again and then he had to come back
[SPEAKER_02]: to that first original plot.
[SPEAKER_02]: He could not grow the crops that he used
to be able to grow when he did slash and
[SPEAKER_02]: burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he started working with compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: He started trying to put whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't really understand what it was,
but he was trying to put it back into the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not being very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but what you're saying is like,
it's civilization and nomadic life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It clash.
[SPEAKER_00]: But listening to Hélène, most of the
biggest civilizations that lived on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet died because they killed their soul
and they couldn't nourish themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started that from the beginning of
civilization, the beginning of
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have not been doing very good
civilization after civilization.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as Indians, that's exactly what they
were doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were companion cropping.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they were nomadic people who use the
plant kingdom but didn't control it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's vastly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, humanity,
when they come in that continent,
[SPEAKER_00]: they destroyed every animal, prehistoric
animal that was really big.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a matter of a thousand years,
endless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, don't think that the Indian
and all what have you being in America
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have a huge impact on the
continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that, the people living in the Pueblo,
that whole Mississippi civilization,
[SPEAKER_00]: they starve themselves to death,
literally, because they killed the soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that I'm thinking, I'm starting to
think back to a bunch of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know really well my story around the
Mediterranean Sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, a lot of it, it's like they
don't talk much about it, but it's slowly,
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly, the territory getting arid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go into other people's
territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Europe wasn't that big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had been warring each other since
civilization was born.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say thank you to both of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reality that this is the biggest treat
for me, I hope you understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm Dr. Elaine Inham.
[SPEAKER_02]: My company is Soul Food Web Incorporated
and Soul Food Web School.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I spend my life going around talking
to people about all of these concepts,
[SPEAKER_02]: promoting, getting away from the toxic
chemicals, growing plants in the most
[SPEAKER_02]: natural of ways, using all plants,
all plants, using life in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those organisms who were the first ones on
this planet and started everything
[SPEAKER_02]: growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go back and replenish that
biology that's supposed to be in the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: to help your plants grow better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And me, I receive from the farmers that
receive from the living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at the end of the chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more I know about what gives me
quality, the better I can pass it down to
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my name is Ryan Noss from Central
Coast Let It Grow, where that's what all I
[SPEAKER_05]: want to do is grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also want to say thank you so much to
Future Cannabis Project and Signs of the
[SPEAKER_05]: Times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Signs for the Times.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the One Log Dispensary.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're so grateful for this venue,
which is probably the most unique venue.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are literally inside of a home made
from one redwood tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hollowed out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a home.
[SPEAKER_05]: How cool is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
