[SPEAKER_04]: We'll end with one viewer question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gemma, do you want to say hi?
Hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you been doing while we've been
talking?
Hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you been doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been watching what?
[SPEAKER_04]: TV.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my babysitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lydia, we'll let you go because I know
Lydia has to leave a viewer question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me cue it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Blue of Green Tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a cultivator in Coastal Maine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really appreciate you fielding
questions like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question revolves around living soil
and decomposition rates and nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: cycling from season to season in a
greenhouse that is not climate controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we have here is a couple of grass
roots, fabric beds, living soil addition
[SPEAKER_01]: equipped with blue mat, blue soak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I built the soil that the intention
was high porosity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good drainage and getting away from the
use of unsustainable peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I did is I used a greater
proportion of rice hulls in the soil and I
[SPEAKER_01]: would say outfitted it with appropriate
amount of organic amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my plan was to put around six inches
or so of hardwood chip and then inoculate
[SPEAKER_01]: it with King's Traferia mushroom spawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a nice thick mat here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I laid down my blue soak and
everything did really well last season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now going into this season,
I was surprised and looking in a few spots
[SPEAKER_01]: that the rate of decomposition from what
I'm used to inside in my living soil
[SPEAKER_01]: systems is far lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my main question is what can I do
in this bed to stimulate some radical
[SPEAKER_01]: rapid decomposition to ensure that I have
enough nutrient cycling to provide my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants of what I need this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any suggestions,
whether it be a more of inoculation of
[SPEAKER_01]: worms, as you can see, there's one
slithering by right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have survived the winter,
but I figured that they would
[SPEAKER_01]: self-populate or maybe a sprouted seed tea
or compost extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wondering what you guys would recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks in advance.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Scott.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to let the wife get this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it, wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was a long time viewer,
first time caller.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, long time viewer.
[SPEAKER_03]: First time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Professional.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a CO question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was subtle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first of all, I would say there's a
couple of things off the bat that I would
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of steer on this is that anytime
you're wanting to increase the nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: cycling in a system, you need to quantify
what you have first and what that balance
[SPEAKER_02]: looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would get it quantified because you
don't really know what you got and where
[SPEAKER_02]: you need to address the issues or any
changes until you take a look.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would quantify that if you're serious
about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second thing is, is you want a natural
decomposition in the system, a sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: natural, steady decomposition in the
system that is advantageous to growing a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and not necessarily a compost site.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say that is steered by the
amount of organic matter and the
[SPEAKER_02]: combination of organic matter in the
system and on top of the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first and foremost, if you're growing,
if you're growing cannabis, if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: growing any cash crop for money or
whatever, you're doing this seriously,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would make sure that you're keeping your
organic matter and your rates of nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: cycling are the first and foremost
priority of the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that requires oxygenation of the
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means that the soil, you need to
understand that the soil needs to respire
[SPEAKER_02]: and for the soil to respire and breathe,
it needs to be able to get access to that
[SPEAKER_02]: air.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's smothered with any thick cake
layers of anything, whether that be caked
[SPEAKER_02]: on new minerals that aren't too much,
anything could be too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any organic material, any mineral material
can be too much if it smothers that
[SPEAKER_02]: surface layer, even if it's roots growing
in the surface layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can have a living mulch layer,
a crop layer that is too much,
[SPEAKER_02]: that is holding on to so much water that
now you're getting gnats and now you're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting other things like that that maybe
you don't want to have to deal with in
[SPEAKER_02]: your system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So understanding that when you're dealing
with a living soil system, you want that
[SPEAKER_02]: aerobic respiration in the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, you want organic matter and that
can come in the form of roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure that they're not overwhelming
your system.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're getting too many gnats,
then that down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure that your mulch layer is
something that is not suffocating the
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, if you're having gnats,
you're seeing that you're accumulating
[SPEAKER_02]: water on the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't try to emulate necessarily too
much of a decomposition in the soil per
[SPEAKER_02]: se.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave that portion for composting on its
own off to the side, I would suggest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the steps that I would
immediately take.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get that it sounds like he's in a colder
climate and he's trying to buffer through
[SPEAKER_02]: when he didn't have the plants and that's
fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just take off that huge mulch layer when
you go to plant the plants and make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that your soil can respire, that it can
breathe, that you can kind of see here and
[SPEAKER_02]: there into the soil and see what is going
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you're in a hot climate and you
want to mitigate water loss, you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that you have enough mulch layer
that you do mitigate that water loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just everything is context and a
balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But keeping in mind that you want that
aerobic microbial life doing those
[SPEAKER_02]: processes for you, that's what gives you
all the nutrients in the form that you
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what gives you all the enzymes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what gives you all of the hormones
and different things like that that the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what engages the genetics of
the plant to give it what it needs when it
[SPEAKER_02]: needs it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, microbes aren't perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do have to balance that with your
mineral profile too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say on decomposition
though, if you're laying that much rice
[SPEAKER_00]: hull into a media, and you're not putting
in enough of a nitrogen source in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: go along with it, it's effectively drawing
as a nutrient sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't that also slow down that
decomposition process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I've used rice hulls in a mix,
I compost it first and then add it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't add it as an aeration component
because to me, it's always been a nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: thief.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it ends up stealing my effective
nitrogen in order to break down naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under microbial level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he might have had enough to drive
fertility, but he's not getting enough of
[SPEAKER_00]: biological activity in the way he needs to
really do composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just curious from your opinion,
does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is what I was going to say is that
the conditions are what's important for,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, if there's no water out there,
there's no organisms doing any
[SPEAKER_03]: decomposition at all because wherever the
organisms are, whether it's under the snow
[SPEAKER_03]: layer or in the rainforest, they need
ideal levels of moisture for those sets of
[SPEAKER_03]: organisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need organisms that will operate
within those temperatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if his bed doesn't have any organisms
that are suitable to operating during
[SPEAKER_03]: those extreme cold, then nothing's going
to be happening anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Dr. Lane did a bunch of research
and her work found that some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: highest rates of decomposition happen
under the snow layer during the winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what she supposes is happening is that
where the snow meets the soil,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not completely frozen and there's a
little free water layer that is the ideal
[SPEAKER_03]: moisture percentage for organisms to
perform decomposition activities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I would start to look at the main
differences between his indoor that's
[SPEAKER_03]: having high rates of decomposition and the
outdoor that's not having high rates of
[SPEAKER_03]: decomposition.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would think one of the easy components
is he's watering the indoor and he's not
[SPEAKER_03]: watering the outdoor because he's just
letting it try to decompose.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's not adequate moisture in
that compost pile, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_03]: then nothing's going to be happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if there's too much of anything,
you're suffocating it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, nothing's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need adequate and ideal aeration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And levels of oxygen for rates of
decomposition to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need ideal levers of moisture for that
decomposition to happen because they need
[SPEAKER_03]: to be awake and operating with certain
amounts of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you need the organisms that will
function and operate under those
[SPEAKER_03]: conditions with which they're under.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you need that, again, that taking a
look at what organisms are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are the organisms even there to do the
decomposition?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you may be asking the system to do
something that it can't really do at this
[SPEAKER_02]: stage in its evolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he did ask about acceleration
techniques.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, if you add supplemental things
that can encourage biology, which will
[SPEAKER_03]: encourage decomposition.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that he mentioned was
the sprouted seed tea, which is a very
[SPEAKER_03]: popular thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of all the things that collapse beneficial
populations of organisms in the organic
[SPEAKER_03]: sector, I would say the sprouted seed teas
are the most effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're just as capable at completely
wiping out soil organisms as an
[SPEAKER_03]: application of a systemic fungicide is.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the same amount of dropout.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: People don't think about that,
but an accelerant can also blow the head
[SPEAKER_03]: off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, you can start your car with a
little shot of ether into the air cleaner
[SPEAKER_03]: every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at some point, the motor is going to
blow up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you do add anything to that
mulch layer to accelerate decomposition,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to also factor in that where most
of us are way over applying things,
[SPEAKER_03]: which causes a actual destruction of the
organism populations through
[SPEAKER_03]: overstimulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you need to not collapse it through
overstimulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a boom bust effect in any
ecological system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like even if you have too many rabbits
and now you're going to have a big
[SPEAKER_02]: proliferation of coyotes and whatever eats
rabbits, then they're going to decimate
[SPEAKER_02]: the population and then you'll have too
many of the predators and that can go back
[SPEAKER_02]: and forth in extremes in the microbial
community as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Scott, you had said something
interesting about what Elaine said about
[SPEAKER_04]: snow and what happens underneath it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue is growing in Maine, but he's growing
in a greenhouse, so there's not a layer of
[SPEAKER_04]: snow.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if he didn't have that top,
can you talk about what would happen with
[SPEAKER_04]: the snow and what goes on underneath?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm not necessarily advocating
adding snow either.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what's important is that the snow
is providing the ideal level of moisture
[SPEAKER_03]: on the soil surface where the
decomposition is happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if he harvested those plants and
never added any more water in there,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, water, oxygen, and microbes are the
three things that cause decomposition to
[SPEAKER_03]: happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So without the water, it's not going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without the oxygen, it's not going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without the organisms, it's not going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So whether he adds moisture out there,
I think what he really needs personally is
[SPEAKER_03]: he needs to get a good foundational
composting technique to get that aspect
[SPEAKER_03]: covered to where he is providing benefit
to his farm in the off season.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just let the soil be soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't try to force it into composting
because by the time you plant again,
[SPEAKER_03]: you might still be composting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Kevin said, you get too many rice
holes, your carbon to nitrogen ratios off,
[SPEAKER_03]: your composting is going to be
ineffective, and you're going to have
[SPEAKER_03]: problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say focus on getting a really
healthy worm bin.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need a ton of compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's after mounds and mounds of
compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah and I take little tiny totes,
like three cubic feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So two soil bags of compost will treat
40,000 square feet of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you don't need, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in a rubber made tote, that's enough
compost to treat 40,000 square feet of
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need a massive amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you need is a very healthy amount of
compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're trying to turn biologically
complete so that we delineate and
[SPEAKER_02]: differentiate between municipal compost,
which is a very different thing than the
[SPEAKER_02]: type of compost we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So biologically complete just means it
has, it's inoculum grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has all of those organisms we're
talking about that are doing the job that
[SPEAKER_02]: he's asking the system to do.
So.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: On that note, Gemma, do you want to close
us out?
Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye bye.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you Gemma for being so patient.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thanks guys.
