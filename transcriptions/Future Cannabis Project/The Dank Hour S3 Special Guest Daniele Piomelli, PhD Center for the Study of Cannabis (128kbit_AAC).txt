[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, hello, hello, everybody,
and welcome to another episode of the Dank
[SPEAKER_01]: Hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're super excited to have you with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about the slow start today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been an interesting one because we've
had to bounce around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're streaming this from Zoom on
StreamYard into YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like we're multi-platform,
but we're only going one spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, I hope you're excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: As usual, I'm London, your dictator of
dialogue, your master of moderation,
[SPEAKER_01]: all around the weird guy that likes to
talk about cannabis with some wacky
[SPEAKER_01]: weirdos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't call you all weirdo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Human beings, everyone should be saying
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have an amazing really star in the
cannabis space that is that is written.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how many papers this year
alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and we're a bit behind schedule,
so we're going to roll right into it and
[SPEAKER_01]: get the conversation going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Dr. Daniel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you prefer to go by or would
you prefer something else?
[SPEAKER_03]: So my name is Daniel Biomelli.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a distinguished professor of
neuroscience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm at the University of California Irvine
School of Medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a neuroscientist pharmacologist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a PhD from Columbia University.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did my postdoctoral work at the
Rockefeller University and worked
[SPEAKER_03]: basically on the endocannabinoid system
since the early 1990s.
[SPEAKER_03]: For about 10, 15 years, 100 percent of my
activity was on the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: signaling system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then as it became clear, the cannabis was
becoming more legalized in the state of
[SPEAKER_03]: California, happens in 96 the first time
and in 2016 the second time, it became
[SPEAKER_03]: clear to me that there was a topic that
had to be tackled.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so my lab started also working on on
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cannabinoids that are derived from the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am the editor in chief of a journal
called Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research
[SPEAKER_03]: that whose mission is really to publish a
solid peer-reviewed work in everything
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a little bit of an issue on our
last episode where we had some problems
[SPEAKER_01]: with recording and all the other business
and whatnot and so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got cut off on the first question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, we missed Kyle's very first
awesome question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did kind of start the recording of
the video in Zoom with Dr. Mark's question
[SPEAKER_01]: and really was quite phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we sorry, we've missed that part of the
recording, but we're going to get right
[SPEAKER_01]: back into it right now and you can watch
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch it all from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fantastic episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't miss any of it and we'll see you
all next week on the Dank Hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did it entirely by CB1 cannabinoid
receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe there is a small CB2 component,
but CB1 drives most of the pharmacology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the CB1 receptor gets involved because
AM404, which does not bind to CB1
[SPEAKER_03]: receptors, stops the degradation of an
endomite and endomite levels increase.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now an endomite activates CB1 receptors
and produces analgesia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, if you block the CB1
receptor, you block the effect of AM404.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you block the effect of an
endomite.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the context.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we published that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a science paper in 1997 where we
identified that the endomite transporter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a few years later, I think was the
group of Ben Cravat, but I don't remember
[SPEAKER_03]: precisely, made an interesting observation
that if they gave Tylenol, which actually
[SPEAKER_03]: the structure of Tylenol is very simply
contained in the structure of AM404,
[SPEAKER_03]: if they gave Tylenol to AM- Well,
no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to remove the acetate.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an acetyl group.
[SPEAKER_03]: Acetate, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you remove the acetate group,
then you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was simplifying things, Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's precisely right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're precisely correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they found that this portion of Tylenol
gets condensed with arachidonic acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is the reaction that almost
certainly is carried out by the enzyme
[SPEAKER_03]: fatty acid amyloidylase and work in
reverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you have this structure,
which is actually AM404.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because it's been known for actually
quite a few years, at least in animal
[SPEAKER_03]: models, if you block CB1 receptors,
Tylenol's effects decrease or disappear.
[SPEAKER_03]: People drew the conclusion, which I think
is not unreasonable, that in vivo,
[SPEAKER_03]: whenever we take Tylenol, at least part of
it, and Tylenol is taken at fairly high
[SPEAKER_03]: doses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the brain levels are probably
micromolar, so they're probably rather
[SPEAKER_03]: substantial.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the reaction is not impossible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, no one has seen it in the human
brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's still speculative, but it could
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is seen in the rat and the mouse
brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So mammalian brains can carry out their
reaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the reaction takes place,
yes, it's entirely possible that AM404
[SPEAKER_03]: participates in the effects of Tylenol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because another important background is
that Tylenol, although it's categorized
[SPEAKER_03]: often erroneously as an NSAID,
so a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug,
[SPEAKER_03]: actually it is not, in that it does not
very effectively block the major target of
[SPEAKER_03]: all NSAIDs, like aspirin or endometasine,
which is cyclooxycinase.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tylenol probably, and it's been for many
years a mystery.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is one of the possible solution of
this mystery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we would need to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a simple experiment to be done in
humans, if one could do these experiments,
[SPEAKER_03]: or one had the approvals to do some,
or the funding to do such an experiment,
[SPEAKER_03]: just to give Tylenol to someone,
to people, measure the analogistic effect,
[SPEAKER_03]: and with or without a cannabinoid receptor
antagonist.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if the effect is abrogated by the
cannabinoid receptor antagonist,
[SPEAKER_03]: then you have your answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one has done these experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think everyone will ever do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and we should remind our viewers
that the cyclooxycinase pathway is one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the penultimate pathways in the
arachidonic acid pathway, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it shows how these two sets of
pathways, if you will, making these
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds that have neurological activity
as well as antioxidant activity,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as the prostaglandins,
which enjoy a variety of different
[SPEAKER_02]: biological activities.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are not trivial molecules,
but they're molecules that have their
[SPEAKER_02]: origins in the lipid themselves,
which I find just absolutely fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, going back to mother nature's
anatomy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do the endocannabinoids, both an
anamide and 2 AG, but they do in a
[SPEAKER_03]: different way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what's fascinating about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after this, I think we should move on
to other questions, but basically what we
[SPEAKER_03]: showed over the years is that an anamide
and 2 AG, the two main endocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_03]: are preformed and they're present
preformed in the fat-like membrane that
[SPEAKER_03]: surrounds cells, the lipid membrane that
surrounds cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're preformed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not active because they are not
liberated.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are liberated upon demand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a stimulus that comes by,
activates the cell, the cell releases the
[SPEAKER_03]: active endocannabinoid with the
endocannabinoid structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the arachidonic acid, the ethanolamine,
arachidonic acid and glycerol.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the compound activates the
cannabinoid receptor and then he's
[SPEAKER_03]: destroyed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this is very different from the
eicosanoids, which you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_03]: like cyclooxygenase, lipooxygenase
product, because in the case you release
[SPEAKER_03]: an arachidonic acid and then arachidonic
acid is metabolized.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the concept is the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cell is not just a membrane,
it's not just a protection, but it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: source of signaling molecules.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's actually really what fascinated
me 35 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I still am fascinated by it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, I don't have a lot of fantasy
or better things to do, but that's what I
[SPEAKER_03]: work on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really much enjoy your literature and
enjoy reading every paper you've
[SPEAKER_02]: published.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very kind of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to jump into just real
quick before we have Tess, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry I'm on like the dark screen on
this side of the internet that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: want me visible anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did want to throw out that we have a
very passionate group of epic,
[SPEAKER_01]: epic nerds on our channel and that like to
follow and do these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try and keep it as high brow as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go on a long tangent about
like whatever, we're here to listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, I'm going to give the floor
to Tess to ask the next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's a great segue.
[SPEAKER_07]: London, I was about to comment on the
level of nerddom that was going on right
[SPEAKER_07]: now and how much I was loving it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's such a pleasure to have you on Dr.
PMLE.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am a microbiologist by training,
but there was a very couple of years when
[SPEAKER_07]: I was an undergrad and early grad student
where I worked in neuroimmune pharmacology
[SPEAKER_07]: lab and I was studying neurogenesis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought it was fascinating,
all of the things going on in your brain,
[SPEAKER_07]: all the different, I always thought of it
as like a soap opera of characters in your
[SPEAKER_07]: brain, like communicating with each other,
sometimes liking each other, sometimes
[SPEAKER_07]: stabbing each other in the back.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all the crazy networks of signaling
that goes on where there's arrows and
[SPEAKER_07]: there's arrows of the blunt end and all
the crazy shenanigans that goes on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like bringing it down a couple nerd
levels.
[SPEAKER_07]: To just like what it looks like when
you're trying to understand it from a
[SPEAKER_07]: systematic point of view.
[SPEAKER_07]: And since you got started in, you know,
understanding and trying to study
[SPEAKER_07]: lipid-derived messengers, I was wondering
besides cannabis, what's your favorite
[SPEAKER_07]: lipid-derived, sorry, endocannabinoids or
other cannabinoid-related compounds
[SPEAKER_07]: besides them?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we talk about that all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are some of the other favorite
players, especially the lipids out there
[SPEAKER_07]: and why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, you know, I was not expecting a
nerd panel being, you know, attacking me
[SPEAKER_03]: from all angles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm loving it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more fun than I was expecting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my other favorite lipid-derived
molecules at this point in my career are
[SPEAKER_03]: two actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've been also working on them for
quite a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are called, okay, I'm not going to
say how they're called right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say, first of all,
they look like an anemide, but they don't
[SPEAKER_03]: walk like an anemide and they don't walk
like an anemide.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they are not endocannabinoids,
but they have some basic similarities with
[SPEAKER_03]: an anemide.
[SPEAKER_03]: So an anemide is arachidonic acid,
which is this long fatty acid with four
[SPEAKER_03]: double bonds or unsaturations and one
polar head made of ethanolamine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's an anemide, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is an amide bond between the
ethanolamine and the fatty acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's very, very important,
the amide bond.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: These compounds have the same general
structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is ethanolamine, there is an
amide bond, but instead of having
[SPEAKER_03]: arachidonic acid, so a very long chain
fatty acid with multiple unsaturations,
[SPEAKER_03]: they have either no unsaturation at all
and 16 carbon atoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's called palmitoyl ethanolamide or
PEA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 18 carbon atoms, so one double bond
oleic acid, and that's called oleyl
[SPEAKER_03]: ethanolamide or OEA.
[SPEAKER_03]: So OEA and PEA are my second best lipids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I call them, we call them
paracannabinoids, and let me explain why
[SPEAKER_03]: we call them paracannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Para in Greek means around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so these are compounds that are around
our main endocannabinoids, an anemide and
[SPEAKER_03]: 2AG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they resemble, there are many
things they do in common with an anemide
[SPEAKER_03]: in particular.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have, as I said, similar structure,
but most importantly, they have a similar
[SPEAKER_03]: set of membrane precursors, not identical,
but similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are produced by the very same enzyme.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is an enzyme which, by the way,
Mark, contains a zinc atom.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's one of your favorite molecules.
[SPEAKER_03]: This zinc containing enzyme is called Nape
phospholipase D or Nape PLD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And releases an anemide and releases also
these other guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the key difference, however,
is functional because OEA and PEA do not
[SPEAKER_03]: bind or activate in any shape or form
cannabinoid receptors, neither the CB1 nor
[SPEAKER_03]: the CB2.
[SPEAKER_03]: They activate a different set of
receptors, and particularly they are high
[SPEAKER_03]: affinity agonist ligands, so high affinity
activators of the so-called peroxisome,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a mouthful, peroxisome proliferator
activated receptor type alpha,
[SPEAKER_03]: P par alpha for short, P par alpha for
short.
[SPEAKER_03]: And P par alpha is a nuclear receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these compounds go into the cell,
bind to this nuclear receptor,
[SPEAKER_03]: the nuclear receptor moves to the moon
nucleus.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all sort of interesting things.
[SPEAKER_03]: OEA, we proved this already 20 years ago,
and we've been studying it very
[SPEAKER_03]: systematically over the last two decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: OEA is a very important regulator of
feeding and lipid metabolism by activating
[SPEAKER_03]: P par alpha.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, it curbs food intake very
markedly, is a very effective anorexiant,
[SPEAKER_03]: as they say technically, but also it
stimulates the consumption, utilization of
[SPEAKER_03]: energy throughout the body in the white
adipose tissue, in the brown adipose
[SPEAKER_03]: tissue, in the liver, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just a fascinating molecule just
from that perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: PEA, if anything is possible, is even more
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also works on P par alpha, but in
different cells than OEA does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And PEA is particularly important in
immune cells, and it's particularly
[SPEAKER_03]: important in regulating inflammatory
responses and pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So PEA now, in fact, is in the market,
after we discovered its receptor many
[SPEAKER_03]: years ago, and we characterized it,
it's now been sold throughout the world,
[SPEAKER_03]: mostly in Europe, but also here in the
United States as a supplement to reduce
[SPEAKER_03]: mild forms of pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is actually quite effective in that
regard, not very effective because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: rapidly destroyed by the body,
but it's rather effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to answer your question, I love this
paracannabinoids because they encapsulate
[SPEAKER_03]: a very important principle that in nature,
just as you said before, things don't
[SPEAKER_03]: work.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're never that simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: So ananamide is produced, and these other
guys are produced.
[SPEAKER_03]: They work together, sometimes
synergistically, so they add onto the
[SPEAKER_03]: activity of each other, sometimes
antagonistically.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, PEA and ananamide both
inhibit pain, and they do so in a way that
[SPEAKER_03]: if you add one ananamide and one PEA,
you have the effect of five molecules,
[SPEAKER_03]: not two molecules.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's this sort of synergistic
effect, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So they work together on pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: But ananamide and OEA work opposite on
foot intake because ananamide stimulates
[SPEAKER_03]: foot intake, OEA inhibits it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because these are my favorite lipids
in the whole wide world, I could talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about them for hours, but even the nerds
that are listening to us, I see it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: very many of them, but so I assume they're
really the, you know, those who are
[SPEAKER_03]: interested, I think would start shooting
themselves in the temple.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think I'd rather stop here.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that you have other favorite
signaling molecules, and it's cool that
[SPEAKER_07]: they can be so similar, but also so
different.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it doesn't take that much of a little
tweak of a molecule to completely change
[SPEAKER_07]: how it behaves.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that that segues really well
into a question that Evian had.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of feel like, hi, Dr. Fiumeli.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I actually feel like you were answering
the question as we're going.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he's actually answering my
question because my question was around
[SPEAKER_06]: the feeding and the body weight part of
some of your research was really
[SPEAKER_06]: fascinating to me and how that implies,
you know, what the therapeutic
[SPEAKER_06]: applications for some of that more recent
research with the PAA.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was kind of where I wanted to go with
it, which sounds like basically what you
[SPEAKER_06]: just answered.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was curious about the signaling and the
responses and also like what the
[SPEAKER_06]: implications are for therapeutic,
you know, how we're going to apply these
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoid kind of research that you've
been working towards for therapeutic
[SPEAKER_06]: application.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really fascinated by that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also, you know, I know you've
done a lot of work around the molecular
[SPEAKER_06]: signaling also, so I just wanted to see if
maybe you could break it down for people
[SPEAKER_06]: in a way that is maybe like doesn't have
to totally be layman's terms, but,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, just bringing how that research
is going to impact people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was also very curious, like where
it's headed for you on the therapeutic
[SPEAKER_06]: element, like what's your goals or what
are you most excited about researching
[SPEAKER_06]: into the future with these things?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think those are a couple of different
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me start with the first one.
[SPEAKER_03]: The issue of food intake and body energy
regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is actually really, really
critical.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we started 30 years ago working on
the endocannabinoid system, the last thing
[SPEAKER_03]: we would have imagined is that the
endocannabinoid system is more important
[SPEAKER_03]: outside the brain than it is inside the
brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why it's more important
outside the brain than inside the brain is
[SPEAKER_03]: because it regulates energy metabolism at
every level from the tongue to the gut,
[SPEAKER_03]: to the adipose organ, to the liver,
to the pancreas.
[SPEAKER_03]: The entire body has cannabinoid receptors,
particularly CB1 cannabinoid receptors
[SPEAKER_03]: that are linked somehow to something that
has to do with energy intake and energy
[SPEAKER_03]: storage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the overarching logic here is actually
very, very simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Regardless of how specifically they act in
different parts of the body, CB1
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid receptors and the
endocannabinoids that activate them are
[SPEAKER_03]: involved in keeping, in getting as much
energy as possible from the environment,
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly fat energy, because that's
the best energy that we can get,
[SPEAKER_03]: and keep it in our fat storage stores,
our adipose stores, as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is simply because, as I'm sure
all of you know, for 250,000 years,
[SPEAKER_03]: we did not have refrigerators,
and it was pretty hard for us to find fat.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to hunt it, and once we found it,
most of the time, animals are not fat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the time, they are lean because
they run around.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had to break their bones and suck
the marrow or eat the brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was the main way of getting fat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really, really hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the evolution of the endocannabinoid
system, I believe, is based on this,
[SPEAKER_03]: on the idea that just like insulin,
it helps us achieve, get as much fat as
[SPEAKER_03]: possible from the environment and store it
as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, now that plenty has put us in a
situation where we have the opposite
[SPEAKER_03]: problem, not finding fat, but getting rid
of fat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where cannabinoid receptors also
can become a target.
[SPEAKER_03]: From a therapeutic perspective,
a molecular target, in that one,
[SPEAKER_03]: by blocking these receptors, one could
block all these actions that I just told
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, you would block,
reduce appetite.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can reduce the absorption of lipids in
the gut.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would reduce the ability of fat to be
incorporated into adipose cells,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, and that was done.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was tested not just in the animals,
but actually was shown to be quite
[SPEAKER_03]: effective in humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, quite a few years ago, 2003,
2004.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 20 years ago already.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the only problem, the small detail that
the pharmaceutical company that developed
[SPEAKER_03]: these agents are called cannabinoid
receptor antagonists.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they block CB1 receptors quite
selectively, and they have exactly the
[SPEAKER_03]: opposite effect to what the
endocannabinoid would have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they will block appetite, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever I told you, and they're in
reverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever I said, in reverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are very effective in humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, there were clinical trials
showing that one of them called Remonabent
[SPEAKER_03]: that was developed by a company called
Sanofi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Remonabent really worked for obese
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only small problem, as I said,
was that they did not consider,
[SPEAKER_03]: the pharmaceutical company that developed
it, did not consider the main effect of
[SPEAKER_03]: the endocannabinoid system in the brain,
as we, by the way, had discovered in those
[SPEAKER_03]: very same years, in 2001 to 2003,
in the five, is to regulate mood.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to improve mood.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the other thing that the
cannabinoids do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They make our life a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happens if you block the
cannabinoid receptor in the brain,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can imagine now your life becomes
sensibly less good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you develop anxiety, you develop
depression, you develop even suicidal
[SPEAKER_03]: ideation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this whole set of dose-dependent
side effects of the cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_03]: the CB1 receptor antagonist, Remonabent,
emerged pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Food and Drug Administration of
the United States never gave the
[SPEAKER_03]: authorization to use Remonabent in
patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Europe, it was briefly, it briefly
approved, but then withdrawn when they saw
[SPEAKER_03]: the same side effects that had been seen
in the clinical trials in the United
[SPEAKER_03]: States, in the clinical trials in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now what the people are doing,
and this is something that initially had
[SPEAKER_03]: hard time in gaining traction,
but now has become rather increasingly
[SPEAKER_03]: more popular, they're developing a CB1
receptor antagonist that don't enter the
[SPEAKER_03]: CNS.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't enter the brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that useful?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because the anxiety effect,
the pro-anxiety, pro-depression effect
[SPEAKER_03]: occurs in the central nervous system.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as I said before, the effects on
metabolism occur outside the central
[SPEAKER_03]: nervous system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you can take advantage of this just
by developing agents that fail to cross
[SPEAKER_03]: the so-called blood-brain barrier,
which is this big wall that prevents the
[SPEAKER_03]: entrance of many substances from the
circulation into the brain parenchima.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just, you know, if you play
chemical tricks, and I'm sure Mark would
[SPEAKER_03]: know about them, if you play some kind of
chemical tricks, you can prevent that from
[SPEAKER_03]: happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot harder to do than it is to say,
but it can be done and it has been done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now there are some of these
peripherally restricted, as they say,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're called cannabino receptor
antagonists, which seem very, very
[SPEAKER_03]: promising in animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: They seem to be very, very promising and
they believe that clinical trials are
[SPEAKER_03]: either ongoing or about to start.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one possible therapeutic
application of using, now negatively
[SPEAKER_03]: using, blocking the cannabino receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally think that there is a lot
more, I mean, not a lot more, certainly a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of value and promise also in
activating the cannabino receptor in ways
[SPEAKER_03]: that are therapeutically relevant.
[SPEAKER_03]: The simplest way is of course,
by using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis contains THC, THC mimics the
endocannabinoids in many ways and produces
[SPEAKER_03]: many of the effects of the
endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem in using cannabis,
as we all know, is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's very difficult to separate one effect
from the other because, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: once you have THC in circulation,
you have THC in circulation, it gets to
[SPEAKER_03]: the brain and every, you know,
basically every cannabino receptor in the
[SPEAKER_03]: brain is activated, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So depending on the dose, then you can
have, I don't know, a relatively mild
[SPEAKER_03]: effect, which could be, for example,
analgesic in some cases, but it's very
[SPEAKER_03]: hard now not to impinge upon the next
effect, which is now, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe a little bit of sedation,
maybe a little bit of euphoria,
[SPEAKER_03]: giddiness and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's hard to separate the therapeutic
effect, which could be, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_03]: analgesic or apatite stimulating from a
more intoxicating action, which some
[SPEAKER_03]: people just don't want.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, of course, if you use cannabis
for no medical purposes, you are seeking
[SPEAKER_03]: the intoxication.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's done, you know, properly,
it's a very safe way of getting out of our
[SPEAKER_03]: thoughts and relax a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a separate problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Medically, if you need to go to work and,
you know, you just want to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: stimulate your appetite or block your pain
or have an analgesic effect, it's harder
[SPEAKER_03]: to separate the, you know, this is called
the therapeutic window, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the therapeutic window of THC of
cannabis is really not very large.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a very small separation
between the effects you want from an
[SPEAKER_03]: effect you may not want.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the main problem we have with
activating the cannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_03]: the endocannabinoid system directly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have spent, you know, literally 20
years trying to activate it indirectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by that, what I mean is that we have
the endocannabinoids, we have enzymes that
[SPEAKER_03]: destroy the endocannabinoids or,
you know, protein systems like the
[SPEAKER_03]: transporter I mentioned before,
that destroy the endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we block these enzymes or we block
these, you know, protein systems,
[SPEAKER_03]: what happens?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the endocannabinoid levels will
rise, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they rise because you stop the
degradation, if they rise, they will
[SPEAKER_03]: activate cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could say, well, well, then,
you know, it's the same effect as giving
[SPEAKER_03]: THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it isn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why it is not is that
endocannabinoids, let's not forget,
[SPEAKER_03]: are not produced upon demand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're not normally there all the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're there when we need them,
when they are needed and where and when
[SPEAKER_03]: they're needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's say in a particular area of the
brain, there is a need for the production
[SPEAKER_03]: of an endomite, an endomite production
increases.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that point, if on board,
we have a drug and a chemical that blocks
[SPEAKER_03]: the degradation of an endomite in that
specific region at that specific time,
[SPEAKER_03]: there will be an increase in an endomite,
not elsewhere, just in that specific
[SPEAKER_03]: region.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that increase in an endomite will
presumably also be limited just because
[SPEAKER_03]: there is only so much an endomite the body
can produce, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas, you know, there is an unlimited
amount of THC one can take.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, in fact, this concept is not
theoretical anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been demonstrated in thousands of
animal studies since we launched the idea
[SPEAKER_03]: with the first inhibitor of the
tricellular degradation of an endomite was
[SPEAKER_03]: published in 2002.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since then, we showed that, you know,
an endomite blocking an endomite
[SPEAKER_03]: degradation is anxiolytic, reduces,
reduces anxiety.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one reason why blocking a
cannabinoid receptor causes anxiety,
[SPEAKER_03]: because, you know, an endomite typically
is a kind of a body-owned anxiolytic or
[SPEAKER_03]: anti-anxiety molecule, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, fine inhibitors, this is the
enzyme that cleaves an endomite,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's called FAAH, fatty acid
amylohydrolase.
[SPEAKER_03]: And fine inhibitors now, 20 years after
this discovery, 20 plus years after the
[SPEAKER_03]: discovery, are being tested in the clinic
for the treatment of sort of anxiety,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is something that, of course,
you know, I'm following very closely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me very, very proud because that
would be, after 20 years working on this,
[SPEAKER_03]: a very nice vindication of our work.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if it doesn't work, it doesn't
work, but a job is at least to give it a
[SPEAKER_03]: try.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and I could go on, you know,
honestly, if, Jan, I could go on the topic
[SPEAKER_03]: of therapeutic applications for a while,
I just don't want to digress too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, maybe we could go back to the
questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate, I will just say I really
appreciate your answer because I,
[SPEAKER_06]: and it does, every time you go,
it gives me like five more questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I know that there's a bunch of other
questions in there, but I'm curious about
[SPEAKER_06]: the, like a couple things later,
just to put in the mind, is that I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: curious about the implications you
mentioned also with the other cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_06]: like THCV kept coming up in my mind when
you were speaking about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also the, I feel like there's
some, I think, well, I'll pass it on,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I feel like there's a couple things
like the inflammatory PCU did drop a
[SPEAKER_06]: couple things about the inflammatory
potential.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'm also curious about that,
but I'm just going to put it out there and
[SPEAKER_06]: pass it on to, I think Damon is next,
or now Lenin's here if you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Damon is up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Dr. Piumeli.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we're going to talk more about
therapeutic cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an amazing conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, originally I wanted to ask like,
why does cannabis work for chronic pain
[SPEAKER_04]: management?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you had a really good discussion with
Dr. Scaldoni there, and you touched on
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like what you said about the therapeutic
window of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something that patients always have
to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you ensure, or like,
what would you suggest that a medical
[SPEAKER_04]: patient could do to stay within that
therapeutic window?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what would you suggest for dosage
safety?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's another very, very, very good
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when it comes to cannabis and pain,
I am extremely frustrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason for that is that there is
what is called substantial evidence that
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and cannabinoids are effective in
alleviating pain in adults.
[SPEAKER_03]: Substantial evidence, unfortunately,
is not conclusive evidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for this reason, the medical
profession are very recalcitrant,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're very hesitant to recommend
cannabis, although they do more and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, what they do, because they
don't understand the system very well,
[SPEAKER_03]: is they will suggest that people start
with CBD, as if CBD was the dumb cousin of
[SPEAKER_03]: THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD and THC are completely different
molecules.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are not completely different
chemically, but they are functionally
[SPEAKER_03]: completely different, and they do very,
very different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So unfortunately, we have a very,
very long route before we educate the
[SPEAKER_03]: medical profession on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But back to your question, given the fact
that physicians, especially in the United
[SPEAKER_03]: States, do not understand the problem,
a lot of patients ask around, go online,
[SPEAKER_03]: ask me, they send me emails, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that puts me always in a very
difficult position.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason for that is because if we had
one cannabis, I go into a store and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: give me cannabis, and they give you
cannabis, that would be relatively easy to
[SPEAKER_03]: answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, the choice that consumers
have these days, especially in states
[SPEAKER_03]: where it's legal, obviously, is gigantic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are so many small differences.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not big differences.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, you go into a
dispensary and you look around,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's pretty much all cush.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are still different varieties
and different levels of potency,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do I recommend?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can recommend easily to a nerd,
but it's difficult to recommend to a lay
[SPEAKER_03]: person who does not know about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I say, look, start a five-milligram
THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish that they could go into a store,
pull out a little thing like this and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, five-milligram of THC is this much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, as you well know,
it doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, start a five-milligram THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are a man, start at 2.5 if you are
a woman.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason for that is that women tend
to respond more profoundly to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: mostly, I think, because they metabolize
it more quickly to something else called
[SPEAKER_03]: 11-hydroxy THC, which is even more potent
than THC is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 2.5 as a woman, five-milligram as a
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by that, I mean, of course,
a man in between, say, 70 and 90 kilograms
[SPEAKER_03]: of weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have an obese person, it's
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a child, I do not recommend
using cannabis, period.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a different story, maybe for a
separate question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we are between 2.5 and five,
and you do that for a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You cannot do it just for a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, you don't need to have a
high.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't necessarily need to feel the
high.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're completely naive, you will feel
simulation, but it's not going to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: real intoxication in a normal person.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you don't feel any relief from
pain, I would increase the dose maybe to
[SPEAKER_03]: 10-milligram and five-milligram,
five in a woman, 10 in a man, and OMB 7.5,
[SPEAKER_03]: depending on how risk averse one is.
[SPEAKER_03]: The risk there, again, is to be unable to
drive a car, for example, having an
[SPEAKER_03]: intoxicating response and being unable to
operate machinery, drive a car.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you could also offset that by using it
at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that depends, again, on your pain
condition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people, especially people in
my age group, who now start using cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: because they have pains and aches and
don't sleep well, they use it at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the ideal scenario.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an ideal scenario because if you
dose, if you take a relatively low dose of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis at night, five, 10 milligrams,
15 milligrams, 20 milligram tops,
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 milligram, 20 milligram tops,
then you are very unlikely to have any
[SPEAKER_03]: side effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you will wake up in the morning with
very little hangover, if any.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that will undoubtedly
happen is that your REM sleep,
[SPEAKER_03]: so the sleep associated with dreams,
will be pushed toward the end of the
[SPEAKER_03]: night.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you will wake up remembering every
single dream you have made.
[SPEAKER_03]: But aside from that, you know,
you may make up a little hungry,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe, but not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's my suggestion.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can, use it at night, use it at
fairly low doses, titrate it yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And often, if you ask the physicians,
they won't know what to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: In some cases, actually, and this is
scandalous, in my opinion, but I've heard
[SPEAKER_03]: of situations where physicians have been
ordered by their bosses not to advise on
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis because some people are just so
paranoid about it in some fields of
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Dr. Piamelli.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a wonderful response.
[SPEAKER_04]: I now understand why I remember all of my
dreams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm anecdotal evidence to that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, London, who you got up next,
Kyle?
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to ask my question, because I mean,
other than your intro, which I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have to like steal from you a quick again
at the end of the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing I really want to dig into,
and well, actually, it's really a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more open question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you look at, we have a shared
document that we put up of links to all
[SPEAKER_01]: the papers that you've released over the
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just in 2023 alone, I don't know
how many there were there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there were seven or eight papers
that were released that are coming
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is something that maybe not is common
knowledge?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, of course, we have a lot of people
that are very invested in cannabis that
[SPEAKER_01]: people don't know or that every person
should know about cannabis that isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: being spoken about right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's something that the average person
in the world should know about cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: that isn't common knowledge at this point
in time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I feel that there are so many things
that, as you say, the person who is not an
[SPEAKER_03]: expert in cannabis will not know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the main problem is that we are facing
just a barrage of these misinformation and
[SPEAKER_03]: misinformation that comes from the media.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that this information comes into two
basic buckets.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is those who love cannabis and think
is the best thing since sliced bread and
[SPEAKER_03]: those who hate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they think it's going to kill you if
you even sniff it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so unfortunately, this is we are
really between a rock and a hard place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And both positions are obviously wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one picks people pick one or the other
may be based on political inclinations or
[SPEAKER_03]: personal experience, whatnot, but not
really based on data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there was one thing about cannabis
that I would tell sort of the average
[SPEAKER_03]: person who doesn't know much about it is
don't be afraid of it as long as you are
[SPEAKER_03]: not a teenager.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are a teenager, and you really want
to test, you really want to try it fine,
[SPEAKER_03]: but just don't do it that often.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it maybe once a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't make sure you don't do it daily.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you are an adult, don't be too
afraid of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't think it's going to kill you because
it's not going to kill you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the other hand, consider that there
is a finite chance that you could become
[SPEAKER_03]: it could become a beach roll, that you
could just want to do it regardless of
[SPEAKER_03]: what, you know, you'd rather stay home,
excuse me, and smoke pot than say go to
[SPEAKER_03]: the movies with your girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and I'm sorry, my my throat is getting
a little bit of a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know something in the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so I guess what I'm trying to say
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't don't be paranoid about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people are, and that's wrong,
but don't be too lackadaisical about it
[SPEAKER_03]: either.
[SPEAKER_03]: Treat it with respect that it deserves.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's something you want to add to your
life, just be careful with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're if you have kids and they
want to experiment with it, direct them to
[SPEAKER_03]: an experimentation that is free of harm,
so small, you know, in a in a controlled
[SPEAKER_03]: environment and most importantly,
not too frequent because we are
[SPEAKER_03]: discovering about long term effects of
cannabis that are very, very, very
[SPEAKER_03]: surprising.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me give you an example.
[SPEAKER_03]: People get really freaked out about
cannabis and schizophrenia, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that's overblown.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that is completely overblown.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that is the yes, there is evidence
of an increased risk with heavy cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: use in adolescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think by and large, that evidence is
difficult to interpret.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for example, the use of cannabis
during adolescence will likely cause
[SPEAKER_03]: permanent changes in your adipose organ.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the ability to store fat in
adipose tissue, white and brown,
[SPEAKER_03]: will probably change for life if you use
regularly during adolescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have evidence from animal studies,
but also evidence from human, a large
[SPEAKER_03]: number of human studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that could be something you want to
think about, because before you enter,
[SPEAKER_03]: you adopt a behavior that you know for a
fact is going to change you forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And without with consequences that are not
clear, and cannot be fully be predicted a
[SPEAKER_03]: priori, I think one should be really
careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's the way I would talk to
my daughter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my daughter asked me about it,
and that's what I told her.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, sweetie, this is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really have to do it because your
friends are pushing you because you're
[SPEAKER_03]: curious, just try not to do it frequently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it every once a week or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't exaggerate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that just a basic rate rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is what I would tell people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would not be like something very,
very technical.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would just be a way of assuaging fears,
but also at the same time of not making it
[SPEAKER_03]: look like, okay, cannabis is just a glass
of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: You drink a glass of water, you can smoke
a whole joint, especially these days at
[SPEAKER_03]: 24%, 25%, 30% THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: A whole joint is a lot of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would be careful there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always kind of landed in the middle
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to think of myself as, although
I've been a very passionate cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: advocate, for me, no matter what,
there's danger to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like 150 people die a year in the States
alone from Tylenol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything has its risks and everything
has its safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're still learning so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, as a parent as well,
I look at my kids and go, if what my
[SPEAKER_01]: parents said to me was just terrible,
you're going to make yourself stupid and
[SPEAKER_01]: all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I spoke to them,
I'm like, oh, well, this isn't true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where now I can have a more realistic
viewpoint of going to my children and
[SPEAKER_01]: going, hey, well, if you're going to do
it, which I'm probably not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to stop you because you're my kids,
at least you can do it in moderation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why you should.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a really important and
valuable insight to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give the floor for one more
question from Kyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got his question cut off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I can just get you a little
bit of an intro just after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we run and finish off the show,
I want to be respectful for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said we would be to about, I believe,
630 PST.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to take too much of your
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you have dinner to get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, Kyle.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now that we've got the explanation of
the paracannabinoids, I have some
[SPEAKER_05]: questions about PAE and OEA as a
supplement.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this question comes from Jason,
I guess, inspired by Jason Wilson,
[SPEAKER_05]: who I believe you've been on his show
before as well, curious about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: But essentially, he uses cannabis for his
chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he has told me that when he uses PA as
a supplement, as an adjunct, his pain
[SPEAKER_05]: score goes way down, like markedly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very noticeable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so given what you know about PA and
OEA and its functions, is that something
[SPEAKER_05]: that people can be doing regularly?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that something that people should be
concerned about?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you had mentioned it targets P par
alpha.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is there such a thing as the potential
for P par alpha down regulation with
[SPEAKER_05]: overuse?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any potential downsides that you
see to using these adjuncts either for
[SPEAKER_05]: pain and inflammation or in the case of
OEA for something like weight loss and
[SPEAKER_05]: dieting?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a very, very, very thoughtful
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first of all, your friend, the person
who uses THC cannabis, THC containing
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, and then when they add PA,
they find this much more pronounced
[SPEAKER_03]: effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an anecdote, of course,
but actually fits extremely well with a
[SPEAKER_03]: very, very important body of preclinical
data, data in animals showing that
[SPEAKER_03]: co-activation of the CB1 cannabinoid
receptors by an endomide or by THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the P par alpha receptor by PA,
co-activation of these two receptors is
[SPEAKER_03]: synergistic which means that if one
produces two and the other produces two in
[SPEAKER_03]: isolation, when you put it together,
you actually have more like 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something that is very,
very, very striking in animal models.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason for that is because,
it's quite interesting, P par alpha and
[SPEAKER_03]: CB1 each independently is capable of
reducing pain, but through different
[SPEAKER_03]: mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you add the two of them together,
the two mechanisms don't overlap.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because they don't overlap,
they don't block one another.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in fact, they potentiate one another.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the end result is, as I said,
is this sort of what we call formally a
[SPEAKER_03]: synergism, a pharmacological synergism.
[SPEAKER_03]: This said, PA alone is used and is sold in
Europe and in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Europe, it's actually prescribed and
found in pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the United States, it's mostly on
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or websites like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And PA alone has some analgesic effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very safe compound.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's considered GRAS or grass,
generally recognized as safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if any, even squeezing my
brain, I can't remember of any single
[SPEAKER_03]: negative effect with PA that one should be
concerned about.
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course, we all do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if one person decides to use PA for
their pain, for example, moderate pain,
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't use it for anything too serious
because for reasons I'll explain in a
[SPEAKER_03]: minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they decide to use it, just monitor
yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like with THC, like with everything
else, monitor yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let yourself, do an experiment on
yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You try it for a week, for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: If something strange happens, for example,
you get a pain somewhere that you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: that is new to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop, wait, and if the new pain
disappears, likely it was caused by PA,
[SPEAKER_03]: but some weird reaction to PA.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all are weird, in a sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all are different animals, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not mice or rats.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not congenic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to be cognizant of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's for PA.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you mentioned OEA as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: OEA, it's interesting, is a little bit
more complicated than PA, is not quite as
[SPEAKER_03]: clearly as safe as OEA is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably quite safe, but we don't
have as much data on OEA as we do on PA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And PA, the main effect of PA,
if you take it by mouth, the main effect
[SPEAKER_03]: is actually to reduce food intake.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it will reduce your appetite.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will reduce your hunger.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does so in a weird way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does so in an interesting way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not really make you eat less in a
meal, but it prolongs the time between one
[SPEAKER_03]: meal and the next.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even if you have a relatively small
meal, now you're not going to be hungry
[SPEAKER_03]: two hours later.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would probably be hungry four hours
later if you had a nice dose of OEA.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been shown in animal models,
but also in humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, OEA is quite effective as an
anti-obesity drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been shown in clinical trials as an
anti-obesity agent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a natural component, natural
compound.
[SPEAKER_03]: For OEA and PA, the same rule applies.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are natural compounds, and that is
their forte, their strength, but also
[SPEAKER_03]: their weakness.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is their strength?
[SPEAKER_03]: The strength is that because they are
natural, they recognize the receptors,
[SPEAKER_03]: they do their thing, and then our body
disposes of them very quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is important, because if you
over-activate the PIPA alpha receptor,
[SPEAKER_03]: as you pointed out, you can risk to
down-regulate the receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, you have all sorts of effects,
not just the receptor down-regulation,
[SPEAKER_03]: all sorts of nasty things you don't want
to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are very delicate receptor systems,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But instead, you give OEA, PA,
they're destroyed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They activate the receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go away.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're destroyed.
[SPEAKER_03]: No harm, no foul.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a strength, but it's also a
weakness because, of course, if you want,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, OEA to go to a specific
tissue, I don't know, the brain,
[SPEAKER_03]: good luck with that, because it has to go
through the intestinal mucosa or where
[SPEAKER_03]: fats are absorbed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it has to pass the liver where OEA
finds an enzyme that destroys it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole role of that enzyme is to
destroy OEA and PA.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called FA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it's very abundant in the liver.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same enzyme.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so by the time the blood exits the
liver to go toward the brain, the cerebral
[SPEAKER_03]: circulation, OEA is virtually all gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only the OEA that is produced by
the body.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not a very good drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neither OEA nor PA are good drugs because
of this reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the few things that they do,
they do well and they're safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: The approach that I have taken as a lab
is, again, as I did for the
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoids, to try and block the
degradation, particularly of PA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is one enzyme that is not far,
it's called NAAA, it destroys PA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that enzyme is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, it's my favorite enzyme.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, I mean, I go by years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for this year and next year,
it's probably gonna be my favorite enzyme.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we develop inhibitors for this enzyme.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call colleagues in Italy who are
medicinal chemists, so we develop
[SPEAKER_03]: inhibitors for this enzyme.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these inhibitors are killer
analgesics.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just so good at blocking pain in
animals and they're also very good
[SPEAKER_03]: anti-inflammatory agents.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my hope is that, yes, it's good to use
OEA and PA, mostly PA.
[SPEAKER_03]: OEA, we don't have as much data in terms
of safety and some efficacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But ultimately, what we wanna do is to
really use, utilize, make use of this
[SPEAKER_03]: system, of this endogenous signaling
system to achieve more efficacy for
[SPEAKER_03]: serious disorders like arthritis or
chronic neuropathic pain, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was beautifully answered.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the take homes that I got from that,
at least, are pharmacological
[SPEAKER_05]: interventions and ways that we're trying
to approach this, maybe by working on some
[SPEAKER_05]: of these enzymes or other things might be
a good way.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in terms of product formulators,
this is really great news.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you were saying, the THC and PA
completely hitting different angles and
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of synergizing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it sounds like a lot of product
formulators may wanna consider using
[SPEAKER_05]: paracannabinoids a bit more in their
formulations, is what I got.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope something activity will develop in
that direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: The FDA, the Food and Drug Administration
does not like combining things.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get all freaked out when you combine
things and they care about, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: they seem to care about safety.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on the situation, but let's not
go there, it's politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fascinating to a chemist like me that
a single double bond that's in the middle
[SPEAKER_02]: of that fatty chain has anything to do
with anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's uncanny.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is uncanny.
[SPEAKER_02]: The polyunsaturated analogs like linoleic
and linoleic, do those ethanolamides have?
[SPEAKER_03]: They do primarily CB1.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you start adding double bonds,
it goes toward the CB1.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you remove the double bonds,
as you remove them, it goes towards the
[SPEAKER_03]: PIPR alpha.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people have done, including in my lab,
we have done structural activity
[SPEAKER_03]: relationship studies showing exactly that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so from an evolutionary perspective,
I think is interesting because cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: receptors are relatively new in evolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not present in insects.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're probably present in cordata,
but they're not present in bacteria or
[SPEAKER_03]: unicellular air organisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or implants, but these implants,
for example, have something similar to
[SPEAKER_03]: PEA.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is also a signaling molecule.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in order to, during evolution,
the addition of double bonds help
[SPEAKER_03]: diversify this general class of molecules,
the fatty acid ethanolamides that had all
[SPEAKER_03]: signaling functions already, diversify
them in a specific direction, away from
[SPEAKER_03]: PIPR alpha, toward G protein capital
receptors like CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's total speculation,
but I mean, no one will ever know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a nice just so story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to tell that to myself at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, here is a suggestion to your
viewers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned my papers before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have problems with cannabis and
still want to sleep, read my papers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way you'll get your right to sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And no risk of intoxication.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned Italy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know if I've mentioned it before,
but I actually get to go back to Florence
[SPEAKER_01]: on the 23rd to go visit my family.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm currently living in Croatia,
so it's like 2 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: here, 3.30 at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have a friend, Sativa Creations is
his brand, but he's Michele Modafari.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always mess up pronouncing his last
name, but he works with some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Italian experts in the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I bet there's maybe one or two apart
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you get over to Italy very often?
[SPEAKER_03]: Once a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not during COVID.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went there because my mother passed away
and I had some business to do there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I missed a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was there in October, actually,
for work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mainly, but I did stop in my hometown to
see my old friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Croatia is a beautiful, beautiful
country.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are very well set.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no Italy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't tell the Croatian that because
they'll kill me and they're all 18 feet
[SPEAKER_01]: tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just this little half Italian guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're all a lot bigger than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have the south, like my family is
from the south and we have a farm down
[SPEAKER_01]: there and it's just something about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between the cheese and the bread and the
people, it's magical to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're actually, I'm getting my
citizenship and moving there full time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should be by summer, I'll have my
passport.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wanted to just do one last thing and
ask you, how can we support what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: on with you, with all the research you're
doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where can we check out more?
[SPEAKER_01]: We will, of course, share the link in our
description of where we found the grouping
[SPEAKER_01]: of your papers, but where else can people
find out more?
[SPEAKER_01]: And get more involved if they would like
to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't do a lot of social media and
that's a weakness.
[SPEAKER_03]: My journal does cannabis and cannabino
research as some social media activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: If your viewers are interested in
exploring and understanding, and mostly if
[SPEAKER_03]: they're interested in solid information
about cannabis and cannabino, it's really
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and cannabino research is a good
source of information.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very scholarly, of course,
very technical, but at least everything is
[SPEAKER_03]: double checked, is vetted through the peer
review system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also, as a journal, try to explore
everything cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we go from the plant, we publish papers
in botany, for example, all the way to the
[SPEAKER_03]: clinic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not just that, we even go into policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have editors for policy,
editors for botany, editors for this and
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a place where I think people will
be able to find reliable information.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are, unfortunately, a bunch of sites
out there to make money that, and we don't
[SPEAKER_03]: make money, at least I don't make money
out of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, someone must, you know,
would for them, but I don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And neither do any of the editors and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are sites out there like this
American Journal of Endocannabinology,
[SPEAKER_03]: as if it was even a discipline,
that are really just to sell stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think people should be very aware
about that, because, of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the case, incentives are different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while everyone has got incentives,
incentive to sell is probably the
[SPEAKER_03]: strongest incentive to fool people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I would be very careful into using
those, quote unquote, journals as a source
[SPEAKER_03]: of reliable information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
