[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for coming to the Heart
of Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so excited for the day to have you all
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to introduce to you Steve
Kamel.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's coming from Las Vegas, Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: He operates the Dragonfly Earth Medicine
Certified and Clean Green Certified indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: No-till, a no-till indoor facility under
LED lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's able to pass the strictest microbial
testing in the nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he is here to talk to us about
building a successful brand in a
[SPEAKER_01]: competitive market, maintaining efficient
and sustainable farming practices in the
site.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming out, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so did not come to talk today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I was going to be on a panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jonathan asked me to talk a little bit
about building a brand in the competitive
[SPEAKER_00]: market, some of the ups and downs we want
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really come prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to go over our story and
touch on some strong points of the nation,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys may have built off of
potentially a boy group or trend towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So years ago, how I got into Canada is I
was actually an MMA fighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew up, as a kid, like most people
here probably, smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after I became a professional
athlete and chased this whole UFC dream,
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked up a lot of injuries on the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got into Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the US, in Nevada, they had a
medical marijuana program somewhere in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can apply for a prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Nevada, it was crazy hard to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to go to the freaking, you know,
I'm talking about a, yeah, Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Taxation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had doctor's appointments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to get your, everything,
get your fingerprints done, FBI check,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these crazy things to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went through all the hoops, grew cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my personal garden for years,
got really comfortable growing my own
[SPEAKER_00]: really good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evolved as a grower from flood tables,
to cocoa, to soil with nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: to living, or to amended soil,
to living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had my own little personal evolution and
it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the cannabis industry kind of
showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always big guys who come into
town.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go talking about, you know, this
corporate takeover and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similar to what California's going
through now, this idea of having a
[SPEAKER_00]: homegrown personal garden, whether to do
other things with it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was slowly shrinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got nervous and started putting
together some concepts on how to run this
[SPEAKER_00]: on a larger scale, a lot bigger than the
four lights I was running in my personal
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, sorry, six lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started putting together some ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran into living organic soil over the
years in permaculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something I was extremely
passionate about, something I could stand
[SPEAKER_00]: behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought, okay, I'm gonna build my
company around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I wanna really focus my
brand on, is something that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can stand behind, something that people
can stand behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that's bigger than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really focused on that and the whole
regenerative movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, I've really been in
permaculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then basically put a team together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got really lucky with my team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put my local team together,
my hometown in front of that, a real small
[SPEAKER_00]: group, that basically backed me 100% and
let me do what I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically got a bunch of construction
contractors, general contractors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they built our whole building out in
old days hardware.
[SPEAKER_00]: Completely renovated this rusty old lumber
yard into a state of the art grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, four years ago state of the art.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays I look at my grow and it looks
like a dinosaur to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's technology, I guess, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, so we put together this really
cool local dream team.
[SPEAKER_00]: We built this really cool concept around a
living soil system, a regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: movement, and then we hit the ground
running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four or five years ago, this was actually
five years ago, we cropped out our first
[SPEAKER_00]: crop about four years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we first opened up, it was a
joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: People thought we were the, I got so much
slack from every single angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living soil, living soil indoors,
LED, everything you could possibly think
[SPEAKER_00]: of, no one thought would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But four years later, we're the only brand
still operating with the same ownership,
[SPEAKER_00]: under the same roof, under the same
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely something there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm trying to basically say is make
sure if you build a brand, first of all,
[SPEAKER_00]: build it on something that you can stand
behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just build it on some random trend
or some random fab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build it on something that you can
definitely, when days are bad,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can definitely manage to get
through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I guarantee you right now,
if you open up shop based off of some
[SPEAKER_00]: trends, some bad, and you have a hard day,
you're gonna be hitting the road hard,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we built our grow out, again,
fairly small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if any of you guys are
familiar with GLP, but people tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: think that we're this really big,
corporate grow, but no we're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just a really small, efficient grow
that we just keep constantly, perpetual
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, so we built our grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a whole living organic soil thing,
and we stood by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you guys, again,
are familiar with us, but again,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're living organic soil indoors with
LEDs, we're in our 16th cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I preach a whole lot of water only,
and I really, truly mean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of very minimalistic with our
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of polyculture in our soil,
so we do a lot of we don't want clover no
[SPEAKER_00]: more, but a lot of different dynamic
accumulators, dacondra, chickweed,
[SPEAKER_00]: straw, grasses, rye, things like that,
as part of our soil program.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of indoor guys don't really,
truly do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a lot of guys running soil,
but they're also running a bottle nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: line behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing that we try to stray
away from, is we want to really keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: real.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I want to build my brand behind
something real, not just some,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, some living soil fad, like you're
trying to see people constantly block you
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's why I'm kind of saying
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we want to, everything that we
do, we do for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with some of the best people
in the industry, from with Jonathan and
[SPEAKER_00]: his crew to some of the best soil people,
some of the best permaculturists,
[SPEAKER_00]: and putting it all together under one roof
is really going to be key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Building a team is going to be key to
trying to build a successful brand and be
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I'm really big on
is having people that I can play devil's
[SPEAKER_00]: advocate with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an owner operator, so I have the
freedom to make decisions, but I also
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize the people I have around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always try to get as much people in the
room as possible before I make any
[SPEAKER_00]: decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if I'm going to make a decision
in the grow, I always put my growers in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going to make a decision in the
trim team, I'm going to put my trimmers
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to build this really good,
solid team, because at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's who's really going to build your
brand for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have about 30 employees on my perm team,
and they do more for my brand than any ad
[SPEAKER_00]: in the magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than any Instagram post, than anything
that's happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those 30 people go home happy on the
day that they work for a good company that
[SPEAKER_00]: stands behind what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best thing you could do for your
brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Treat your employees with respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that they're heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really, really, truly important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing that we managed to do
that was unsuccessful at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so building a brand and being
competitive, make sure you have your
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us in Nevada, everybody was really
this corporate breed model, where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to crop out really big,
really fast, and chase trends,
[SPEAKER_00]: chase strains, and do all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, we took the whole living soil
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't always yield the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't make the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it was our niche that,
again, we could stand behind that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: truly passionate about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't pay off at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, especially with the microbial
testing in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys are going through it now
here in California, the stage three,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they call it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess with the microbial, or is that the
heavy metals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stage three is heavy metals, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: So microtoxins on phase three?
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys are going through it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely challenging, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And early on, especially with the
biological system, that's one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest things you could fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in Nevada, one of the things that
helped us the most is that we opened up
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were one of the first cultivators in
the entire state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have a brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one was even planning on having brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then, everybody was envisioning this
Starbucks model, where they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow a flower, a bean, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to sell it to a shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that shop's going to sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go to Starbucks, you're not
asking, hey, who grew these beans?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're drinking Starbucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what all the corporate model
wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what everybody was heading
towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: We opened up first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to differentiate
ourselves from anybody else from behind
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't focus on strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: We focused on how we grew, not what we
grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually, it gave us presence in
the market, where we lack a, we're just a
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have an expenditure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have a front door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by building a brand, by having a strong
brand, you're able to have a demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have people ask for your
product versus you just trying to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: When somebody walks in through the sensory
and asks for green light productions,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one of the most powerful things
that I can have somebody do in a market
[SPEAKER_00]: where I don't have a front door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So building a brand is going to be one of
the most key things you guys could do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, building it on something,
not a trend, but on something you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually stand behind it would be
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Nevada, they're all trying to chase the
strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have somebody opening up and
they're selling a box with a gold sticker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's who's box has the prettiest gold
sticker with the best labeling,
[SPEAKER_00]: the best packaging, and the best test
schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in the data market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the best packaging and the
highest numbers on test schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then as consumers educate themselves,
it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot, hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has 30% now.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now you have straight regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now nobody's using pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even synthetic guys aren't using
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you differentiate yourself from
not being pesticides, from being organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're not using, now are you using a
bottle line?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going water only?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you curing properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically you have to do everything right
if you want to build a brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's what do I want to smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to share with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, it's I try to grow the best
weed that I could possibly grow and sell
[SPEAKER_00]: the best weed that I could possibly sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have the freedom to do so as not
only an operator, but as an owner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, one of the biggest fears when
corporate cannabis is coming is I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to lose the ability to smoke
good quality medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I was going to be stuck smoking
synthetic mids, you know, people blue
[SPEAKER_00]: dream or whatever yielded the most that
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I hate non-blue dreams,
y'all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a good strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, what I'm getting at is don't build
around things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build around things, again, that you can
see behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, I wanted to set trends,
not follow trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, four years ago, we opened up
this living soil permaculture driven
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were forced to go indoors because the
Nevada market really wasn't sure what they
[SPEAKER_00]: were going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outdoor was a no go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greenhouses were kind of getting
frowned upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't sure what they were going to
do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really focused on how can I make the
most sustainable indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's what we added to our
brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really fit in with everything,
the LED lights, the living soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It screams regenerative in the most
unregenerative way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in a market that is just completely
toxic in the middle of the desert where
[SPEAKER_00]: plants don't flourish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're cropping out some of those the
best herb possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our price per gram, per pound,
whatever, however you want to chalk it up,
[SPEAKER_00]: is extremely low.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're extremely successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have presence in an industry where
we're not supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in Nevada, one of the hardest
licenses to get, and I'm sure you guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting this in California too,
is a dispensary license, is an actual,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to sell a product to the
public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you don't have that and you
don't have a brand, you really don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to end up being a THC farmer
that basically sells to extraction artists
[SPEAKER_00]: or white labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're never going to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're never going to be able to grow
the quality that you want to grow because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be chasing that bottom
dollar and racing to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the beauty of this No-Tilting
Organic Soil that we run is that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: able to compete for that bottom dollar,
be able to race to the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: and still produce the highest grade
quality product in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you're running a No-Tilting
Organic Soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inputs are low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's regenerative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant feeds the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly recommend anybody here if you
guys are, I mean, obviously we're here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the organic capital of Canada,
in the world, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure it's acquired as far as
that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just know that your competitive
advantage is the fact that you guys have
[SPEAKER_00]: that organic background, that your ability
to use the sun, the ability to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have great materials around you,
resources around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Build your brand around that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
