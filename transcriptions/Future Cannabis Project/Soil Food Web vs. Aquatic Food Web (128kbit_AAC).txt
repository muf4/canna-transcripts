[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I'm Steven Reisner with Potent Ponyx,
and I do a lot of work with aquaponic
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're here with Chris Trump to talk
about how you can utilize Korean natural
[SPEAKER_00]: farming and lactobacillus ferments to
improve aquaponic both fish production and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant production, be it cannabis or
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't you tell everybody a little
bit about what lactobacillus ferment is
[SPEAKER_00]: before we get into how it helps
aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, lactobacillus is this family of
microbes that really does all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: things in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're outnumbered in your body 10 or
1,000 to 1, and 70% of the microbes in
[SPEAKER_01]: your body that you rely on for nutrients
in your gut is lactic acid bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's reasonable and understandable
that the digestive system of a plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: similar as we find all these
interconnectivity in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's the cultivation of it to
have a high density serum of lactic acid
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria is what we're using in farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't you tell everybody why it is
that you're an expert on Korean natural
[SPEAKER_00]: farming?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pretty much the biggest expert that
speaks English, as far as I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's by necessity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We farm 700 acres of macadamia nuts in
Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was nobody holding my hand
through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a lot of learning through trial
and error.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been a blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we now farm exclusively with natural
farming on 700 acres of macadamia nuts,
[SPEAKER_01]: organically certified.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is organically certifiable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick plug to if you're doing natural
farming and want to mess with
[SPEAKER_01]: certification, don't try and teach your
certifier what natural farming is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't try and go to USDA and define
terms and create a new system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're making plant-based compost or
actively aerated compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of regulations in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a few simple steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little protection for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you start making up terms, you might
run into problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after meeting Chris and hearing about
all the awesome stuff he does,
[SPEAKER_00]: I started using different Korean natural
farming components in aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that allowed us to do,
specifically with lactobacillus,
[SPEAKER_00]: it allows us to eliminate the fish waste
in parts of the system where it gets past
[SPEAKER_00]: the filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also helps eliminate pathogens in the
system by eliminating them, by consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also helps mineralize the fish waste a
lot faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also increases fish growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall, there's a study that's going
to be coming out later this year through
[SPEAKER_00]: the University of Kentucky State.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a really awesome guy over there
named Joe Pate that helped put a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: that research together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to talk about how it
increases fish growth rate by 15% and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth rate on average by 18%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be really, really
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take things like lactobacillus
or even WCA to provide bioavailable
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium or all different types of things,
everything but basically FFA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't intimidate the fish too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or FAA, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to make sure that you don't use the
fish stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everything else from Korean natural
farming can be used in aquaponics and
[SPEAKER_00]: greatly benefit the aquatic food web as
well as the soil food web and really help
[SPEAKER_00]: people on both ends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would mention I would probably avoid
liquid IMO or IMO in aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the soil microbes,
if you're really trying to introduce a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of them, can mess with your balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, I think I told you this
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a commercial aquaponics system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We raised baby romaine for chefs in Kona
in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ran into some wonkiness when adding
IMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was playing with all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: LAB, FPGA, all these things were just
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But IMO caused some just strange things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, like you said, and you've
talked a lot about the aquatic food web
[SPEAKER_01]: being pretty uniquely different from the
soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think respecting that, understanding
that nature has those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's where water is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's where soil is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a little bit of crossover.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is a pretty big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of things are different?
[SPEAKER_01]: What have you experienced?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found that certain minerals will
oxidize.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will oxidize a little faster and
maybe need to be supplemented a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like iron would be the biggest
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But aside from that, just with aquaponics,
we can run much lower nutrient levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have lower bioavailable nutrients
because we have a wider biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have multiple different microbial
chains that are making things
[SPEAKER_00]: bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you combine that with something
called a dual root zone, which is a method
[SPEAKER_00]: that I talk about regularly where we have
this terrestrial soil layer and living
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and all the wonderful things that a
lot of the other speakers here at the
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative conference are speaking on
can survive and thrive and benefit the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the upper half of the root zone,
then we have a layer of burlap just to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep that soil from getting down below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then below that, we have a layer of
hydrogen that get flood and drains and
[SPEAKER_00]: allows us to have all the aquatic microbes
and the fish waste and all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms that are aquatically based
and allowing them to break down nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: in a whole different way along with the
fish waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really and usually the fish waste is
their main mineral source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this allows us to get 70 to 90 percent
depending on strain of the nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Base and having very little
supplementation that we only need to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide with the soil zone, which if
you're doing living soil requires next to
[SPEAKER_00]: no supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as we have an iron rich soil
zone or other things, we can use all the
[SPEAKER_00]: Korean natural farming methods in the soil
zone, even FFA or FAA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, whichever one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had one too many joints today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll admit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as you you can use all those
in the soil layer and it really can make a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference and you can use all the
practices if you're soil grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: hybridize that and really increase
production, especially for veg or clone
[SPEAKER_00]: production and even get enhanced or
different terpene profiles as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're trying to really change up the
terpene profiles for your resin production
[SPEAKER_00]: in your own hash making.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever messed with red soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did some red soil work in Jamaica,
but nothing here in the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a lot of work with green sand,
which is high in iron and silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because iron and silica are two
things are often lacking in the water part
[SPEAKER_00]: of an aquaponic system because it oxidizes
or in silica's case isn't super highly
[SPEAKER_00]: bioavailable to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be an interesting study.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if you mined a bunch of red soil
and used it as that soil layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder how that might offset some of
that increased oxidization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in IMO 4, one of the things that I
didn't teach in my videos, but is a
[SPEAKER_01]: component is you can bring in red soil is
like a 25 percent when you make IMO 4.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so that you have that increased
mineral content as you apply it for
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wonder if you made like that whole
layer red soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool what you're doing with the
with the soil layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not anything I ever messed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the floating floating rafts and but
I loved we had lava rock in our in our
[SPEAKER_01]: worm bed biofilter and lava rock broke
down so fast in the aquaponic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just became this powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing you you would get on a on the soil
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah the microbes will just plow right
through it in an aquaponic system and
[SPEAKER_00]: really unlock and make those minerals
bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found I did a bunch of side by sides
and with DWC or the floating rafts we
[SPEAKER_00]: found that you don't really get the proper
bud formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you don't really see if you
look at all the commercial aquaponic
[SPEAKER_00]: producers that are that are growing THC
cannabis in particular all of them have a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil layer in the upper half.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root zone and that provides us a space
for micro risal fungi all the terrestrial
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes that really help with phosphorus
potassium and other micronutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: bioavailability and give it a time release
area so the plant can adjust it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it's going to have the bulk of
its nutrients built from the fish but it
[SPEAKER_00]: has the option of choosing nutrients from
that soil zone as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant knows better than any of us
ever will with any supplementation it can
[SPEAKER_00]: pick and choose whichever group whichever
store it chooses to shop at it can pick
[SPEAKER_00]: and choose to get its nutrients from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that allows us to maximize the
bioavailability and there was a study done
[SPEAKER_00]: by NASA when they did a bunch of
bioavailability research with aquaponic
[SPEAKER_00]: farms where they tried to see okay which
micro microbes are responsible for the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient processing and nutrient cycling
of different nutrients nitrogen phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium blah blah blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found across all those
different farms over 50 different farms is
[SPEAKER_00]: none of them were identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them were completely different and
when they tested a group of soil to try
[SPEAKER_00]: and figure out the same type of microbes
in soil and they compared the two data
[SPEAKER_00]: sheets the aquaponic system was even the
worst aquaponic system compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: best soil system was a hundred and sixty
seven percent more biodiverse in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: number of different species when they did
genetic testing to see just biodiverse
[SPEAKER_00]: broad biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your aquatic biome is how it has more
players in its nutrient cycle than even
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil web does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm not I'm sure if you go up maybe up
to the Redwoods and you find something
[SPEAKER_00]: it's 10,000 year old old growth that might
be different but we're talking a normal
[SPEAKER_00]: average garden in someone's home or an
normal average commercial system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea of diversity is really the key
and in natural farming that's that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're focusing on taking all these
collections from different times of the
[SPEAKER_01]: year or different places around your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea is that nature is so capable of
finding a balance if they have diversity
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's like who wants to you know be in
a town with no doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know like you need the parts of a
community to work in community and we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't even I was talking with some friends
we have no idea how microbes work in
[SPEAKER_01]: community where we barely even have the
tools to look in the window and we haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: yet and so what we do know is that nature
can balance itself so if those indigenous
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes or the microbes that belong in
that place are introduced they're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: find balance and they're gonna work
together and all you're gonna get is
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit in production and disease
resistance and it's it's a lot of fun and
[SPEAKER_01]: and so yeah maybe we'll have a
biodiversity competition between the
[SPEAKER_01]: aquatic food web and the I guess your
study already did that though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this we'll play with this cool yeah
yeah it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the University of Hawaii actually did
over seven years of testing in aquaponic
[SPEAKER_00]: system sometimes intentionally introducing
pathogens some you know and then other
[SPEAKER_00]: doing all different kinds of experiments
with pathogens and they found that things
[SPEAKER_00]: like pythium and other pathogens in a
healthy aquaponic system are simply out
[SPEAKER_00]: competed by by other microbes either
consumed or there's not enough metabolite
[SPEAKER_00]: that they need to feed on to colonize to
the point where they start to threaten
[SPEAKER_00]: other you know other microbes in the
system so if you have a really biodiverse
[SPEAKER_00]: soil or really biodiverse aquaponic system
whichever one it is be the the soil food
[SPEAKER_00]: web or the aquatic food web it's going to
eliminate most of your pathogen issues not
[SPEAKER_00]: all but a vast majority of them will be
eliminated automatically and that's and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where you know the the organic
hydro guys and aquaponic guys and the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: guys really need you know can focus on
banding together and we're not that
[SPEAKER_00]: different we're both against chemical
cannabis we're both against pollution pot
[SPEAKER_00]: you know we can work together and really
push you know organic as a whole be it you
[SPEAKER_00]: know any the soil food web or the aquatic
food web and it's something that's you
[SPEAKER_00]: know great to see everyone kind of getting
together where a lot of people saw each
[SPEAKER_00]: other maybe didn't get along quite so well
and when everyone thought hey well that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not organic because it's not soil well
it's just using a different food web
[SPEAKER_01]: that's all yeah and yeah there's so for me
I feel for the farmers that are using
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical fertilizers that there's many
that would like another way but it's scary
[SPEAKER_01]: there's there it's there's some risk
involved in making a shift and so I just I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that if if it's kind of not like hey
bad on you but kind of an invitation like
[SPEAKER_01]: hey check this out so I like that we're
we're for something you know for learning
[SPEAKER_01]: to farm another way that's both profitable
and productive you know and probiotic yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: my goal in like soil farming the soil is
hopefully to sequester carbon and create
[SPEAKER_03]: enhanced you know the environment maybe
remediate problems you know is that
[SPEAKER_03]: something that you do with aquaponics
while using for many products absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: so and for all aquaponics systems right
now on average for both lettuce and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for every ten thousand square
feet of canopy we average around two one
[SPEAKER_00]: ton or two thousand pounds of soil
production that we get composted through
[SPEAKER_00]: the vermicompost of the fish waste and by
the plant materials so we're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: generating nutrients rich soil that we can
either use for our own projects for other
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of the farm if we're doing a fully
sustainable farm or even providing it for
[SPEAKER_00]: our our neighbors that are doing
regenerative no-till soil or other things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that that's extremely rich and it
gives them something that you know they
[SPEAKER_00]: can come and buy from your farm and it's a
value added for you on your cannabis grow
[SPEAKER_00]: or use it on your own use it for your top
after your door your dual root zone pots
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know you utilize that for your own
for your own systems incredible incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass I developed a whole worm system
because I had to have somewhere to put all
[SPEAKER_01]: these root balls and you know as I cut my
lettuce it's it's amazing how much biomass
[SPEAKER_01]: you can make in roots and and how good
that is for making soil like it's like the
[SPEAKER_01]: best high quality compost and you bring
worms to bear on that and it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: fun you could also use those same cuttings
to feed I'm a big fan of dubia and hissing
[SPEAKER_00]: cockroaches they provide a much more
nutrient balanced waste than even worms do
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people don't like creepy
crawlies but a two-inch band of Vaseline
[SPEAKER_00]: and on the top of any plastic container
will will contain them throw a heat pad in
[SPEAKER_00]: there like a seed heat pad and they will
breathe like crazy they are super easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: raise will consume anything and a great
for feeding chickens or fish or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else on the yeah good and milkshakes but
you know they're looking at things and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to close your loops you know even
with with your nutrient supply with the
[SPEAKER_00]: fish and the fish food can be a great way
even if you're doing sustainable you can
[SPEAKER_00]: just raise a bunch of fish as aqua culture
mineralized or fish waste and use it for
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil you don't even have to have it
be an aquaponic system and still get
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits of that you can also take that
same fish waste and ferment it with
[SPEAKER_00]: lactobacillus or in an FF PJ and and allow
those same microbes to get even more
[SPEAKER_01]: mineralization in an entirely different
way for this where did where was the like
[SPEAKER_01]: ding moment of of soil and water so the
ding moment was so we were trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out how to grow cannabis and
aquaponics and we tried straight media
[SPEAKER_00]: beds we tried DWC and it wasn't working
and I was trying to figure out how can I
[SPEAKER_00]: get like a mineral retention layer on the
top part of the pot or it's somewhere in
[SPEAKER_00]: the root zone so I could have some kind of
supplements we first we tried a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: sea sponges in the top part almost like a
more organic rock wool and put the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and that kind of worked and then
I met a gentleman from Serbia and he had
[SPEAKER_00]: an idea of doing the soil on top he did it
with cucumbers so I did that and tried
[SPEAKER_00]: that with the cannabis and it worked
really well and he was doing just maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: like a 15% soil there in the top and that
didn't seem to be quite some enough so I
[SPEAKER_00]: split it down to 50% and that seemed to
work really well and then by setting the
[SPEAKER_00]: flood and drain timers a little more often
so you get the diaphragm action and how
[SPEAKER_00]: would a dual root zone is is it's a pot
and the top half again is soil separated
[SPEAKER_00]: by a layer of burlap halfway down and the
hydrogen in the bottom with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: holes or a basket bottom pot so it allows
the water to flow in and out and when the
[SPEAKER_00]: water goes up it flushes the air up
through the soil and when it goes down it
[SPEAKER_00]: pulls fresh air back down through the soil
and into that root zone so gives you a
[SPEAKER_00]: rapid gas exchange and rapid microbial
growth and allows you to supplement the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil zone separately from the water zone
and get a lot of control in a very organic
[SPEAKER_01]: way that's right what cool technology and
what else can we come up with in the next
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 years if we stop focusing on
Frankenstein you know chemistry and and
[SPEAKER_01]: start start looking at how to use just
physics and nature to to benefit farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: to reduce labor and and I mean they're
they're making cool robots and whatnot but
[SPEAKER_01]: as we understand the interconnectivity of
microbial life and make use of it I think
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the sky's the limit I think a lot
of it comes back to the work that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and I think taking and isolating
different groups of microbes from KNF or
[SPEAKER_00]: taking groups of microbes from different
parts of the world that have worked
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to KNF and figuring out how they
make certain things bioavailable and then
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the future of products for
the soil industry and everything else both
[SPEAKER_00]: both you know for bottled and and just
methodology because it allows people to
[SPEAKER_00]: take a field they've been fertilizing for
the last 80 years and unlock all that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a ton of there's more nutrients
they need for the next 500 years sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: in that field but if they have the right
microbes that unlocks it especially with
[SPEAKER_00]: all the work that you do and all the
wonderful microbes you teach everyone how
[SPEAKER_00]: to do I mean it teaches everyone how to
unlock the potential of that field that's
[SPEAKER_00]: already sitting there it just isn't in a
bioavailable form yeah totally yeah you
[SPEAKER_01]: take I mean we we actually just did this
so we we farm 700 acres of macadamia nuts
[SPEAKER_01]: we had a neighbor who had just kind of I
guess is a hobby farm he's well off and
[SPEAKER_01]: lost money on it for years but he just
would dump endless amounts of chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer on there and finally he you
know knocked on the door and said hey I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to farm this anymore will you
guys lease it from me and and run the farm
[SPEAKER_01]: and so we went in and the first year
applying microbes everything just yellowed
[SPEAKER_01]: you know it was just and and I told my
family to expect that I was actually not
[SPEAKER_01]: directly involved in beginning that my
team who's running our natural farming now
[SPEAKER_01]: began that project and I said you're gonna
have a drawback in the first year just as
[SPEAKER_01]: the the trees have to learn a new way to
eat their roots all have to change and so
[SPEAKER_01]: the trees in that first year of
introducing microbes had to literally
[SPEAKER_01]: shift their their their root zone and but
now this we're in year two of that and the
[SPEAKER_01]: trees are beautiful my I was asking my
brother I was like hey take me soil
[SPEAKER_01]: samples from this place I want to see
what's changed and he's like no I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: think we need to bother this place is so
pretty and and productive and so it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: been really cool to to watch those changes
but we literally have a mine of mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: there and salts that that these microbes
are all just gonna be pulling on making
[SPEAKER_01]: available and kind of redeeming the the
ground for for I don't know how many years
[SPEAKER_01]: we're gonna benefit from that so yeah
you're right it's I mean it's really what
[SPEAKER_01]: will deal with a hard pan you know it's
it's the microbes that mine that salts in
[SPEAKER_00]: the first place it's really awesome it's
wonderful all the awesome work and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: great videos you have on your YouTube
channel and all the classes and stuff you
[SPEAKER_00]: put out it's really really great you you
you you
