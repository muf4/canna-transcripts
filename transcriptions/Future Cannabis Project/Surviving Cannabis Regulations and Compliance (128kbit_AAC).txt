[SPEAKER_00]: And also talking about pathogens on our
cannabis planters also the pathogens of
[SPEAKER_00]: paperwork That we're all dealing with
within this industry and we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: move right into that because that's just a
really important way to mitigate the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens of paperwork so Holly licensing
and regulations and solutions and and give
[SPEAKER_00]: us some Unbelievable tidbits and because
you weren't here last Night, tell us who
[SPEAKER_00]: you are and and what you're what you're up
to Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am Holly Hall and I'm a soil and water
scientist with training in the adaptive
[SPEAKER_01]: management of watersheds which adaptive
management principles rely on the
[SPEAKER_01]: integration of people that rely on natural
resources to protect those natural
[SPEAKER_01]: resources and develop sustainability
within the watershed system I came back to
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt County about seven years ago
after finishing my PhD to start a
[SPEAKER_01]: consulting firm that focused on watershed
sustainability and at that time the
[SPEAKER_01]: government was here and the government in
Northern California and the government was
[SPEAKER_01]: really calling for people to start
registering their water rights and then it
[SPEAKER_01]: just and so I started helping my community
with their water rights and within that
[SPEAKER_01]: right on the heels of that and We moved
into a tighter crackdown on medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana that was being cultivated and
then we moved in very swiftly to
[SPEAKER_01]: proposition 64 which is the commercial
cannabis regulations in California with
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's a whole suite of water board
regulations that cannabis farmers need to
[SPEAKER_01]: comply with and California Department of
Fish and Wildlife Regulations and so now
[SPEAKER_01]: for about the last six and a half years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked very closely with many
cannabis farmers in our community and not
[SPEAKER_01]: only improving in my environmental
practices, but also in complying with the
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental regulations so what we see
here among the farms that and you know of
[SPEAKER_01]: the farmers that in this room are kind of
a rare practices and so You know improving
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental conditions is a gift that we
have solutions that we can really provide
[SPEAKER_01]: to our globe as a whole I'm guessing that
California is not unique and that the way
[SPEAKER_01]: we produce commercial agriculture is not
regenerative generally and when we talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about solutions and these regulations and
regenerative farming practices,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that really holding up the way
that we are working with our land as a
[SPEAKER_01]: standard for farming in general in the
world is the best thing that can come out
[SPEAKER_01]: of one of the best things that can come
out of the regulated industry the best
[SPEAKER_01]: thing is Decriminalization in my opinion,
but second to that is to change the way we
[SPEAKER_01]: produce agricultural products in the globe
now In the first couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went maybe to like 500 cannabis farms
and I saw A lot of practices that could be
[SPEAKER_01]: improved upon and now I've narrowed it
down I have about 23 core farms that I
[SPEAKER_01]: support and compliance needs and What I'm
seeing now in terms of solutions for
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations like I'm Physically ill
sitting here thinking about regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's It's destroying families making
people sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the solution?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the solution in part is knowing
The rules and we don't need to know every
[SPEAKER_01]: detail but what we have I think the
regulations are a toolkit then if we know
[SPEAKER_01]: the rules then we can protect ourselves
and use them as tools as we move forward
[SPEAKER_01]: to achieve our goals and so Being able to
as a business owner to assess what part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the regulation regulatory process can I
grapple with as a business owner
[SPEAKER_01]: identifying that identifying how much time
and capacity we have as business owners to
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with regulations and Identifying how
much money we have to spend on compliance
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding those really helps us and
will help business owners to be compliant
[SPEAKER_01]: in a way that needs to happen to help y
'all move forward with achieving your
[SPEAKER_01]: goals and if you Choose to work with a
professional make sure it's so much
[SPEAKER_01]: personality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I focus extremely on
environmentalism.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't touch metric I have I don't care
like I'm wherever this amazing cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: goes After it's grown in a way that is
beneficial to the world I don't give a
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck like that's not my thing But if
someone else if it's really important to
[SPEAKER_01]: you to have a tight track and trace system
work with professionals that their
[SPEAKER_01]: expertise serves you or Know professionals
that you trust you and call in like Daniel
[SPEAKER_01]: for example Handles his own compliance,
but when he has the water board out there
[SPEAKER_01]: to verify his non-jurisdictional water
source He calls me and we go out and
[SPEAKER_01]: together we like high five while the man
signs off at his non-jurisdictional water
[SPEAKER_01]: source so knowing how to plug
professionals in where you need them to
[SPEAKER_01]: alleviate your Burden of regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot of thought I'm looking at
open glow and moon made who I work with
[SPEAKER_01]: closely and all of you do a really good
job of strategizing your compliance needs
[SPEAKER_01]: and really Being compliant where you need
to be so that you can operate legally and
[SPEAKER_01]: also showcase your environmental standards
another solution to the bigger cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: production picture is Teaching the
government how it's done right and so by
[SPEAKER_01]: complying by opening your farms up to
regulatory inspections you have the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to teach Sacramento teach the
capital teach the people that are Creating
[SPEAKER_01]: the boxes that need to be checked teach
them show them how we can work with the
[SPEAKER_01]: land to produce medicine to produce food
to produce fiber to store carbon in a way
[SPEAKER_01]: that is very ethical and very kind to the
environment because if you drive down to
[SPEAKER_01]: Sacramento the which is the capital of
California you're driving through
[SPEAKER_01]: monoculture almond orchards that are
dripping with poison they are killing the
[SPEAKER_01]: bees that they're dependent on for
Pollination to produce so we have the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to change that paradigm every
day and Regulations and regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance is that's the suit I often
consider myself a wolf in sheep's clothing
[SPEAKER_01]: when I go to Sacramento and I'm doing my
policy work because we are having to put
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves in their boxes so that they can
identify with us and use Even ingest the
[SPEAKER_01]: information the education that we have to
offer them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's like a broad Scope on
Reggie, you know regulatory compliance,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to sum it up and go back know the
rules enough to allow you to Pass the test
[SPEAKER_01]: to operate legally to allow you to go
about doing your business work with
[SPEAKER_01]: professionals that you trust when you need
them and Be realistic about what part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the regulatory process you want to take on
within your own business and yeah be Be
[SPEAKER_01]: really honest with yourself about time and
money and capacity and desire think of a
[SPEAKER_01]: professional as like a lawyer or a medical
doctor or a tax accountant, it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody that you're gonna hire for a very
unique job and Yeah, be be real about what
[SPEAKER_00]: that job is you talked about seeking
professional advice and Ruby Steinbrecher
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been helping people, you know with
this pathogen of paperwork that we deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with and and now trying to figure out how
we can better jump the hoops and Also how
[SPEAKER_00]: we can work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people in this room and a
lot of us have the same issues that come
[SPEAKER_00]: up in the regulatory system whether it's
with paperwork or if we run against some
[SPEAKER_00]: troubles and And and things are coming up
for us a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's repeated and we talk about shared
counsel as well So last night Ruby you
[SPEAKER_00]: were wearing your hat as madrone But
you're also an attorney and you also help
[SPEAKER_00]: many cannabis families, so I'd love for
you to talk on this yeah, so I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean a lot of what Holly said I
wholeheartedly support and to have an
[SPEAKER_02]: awareness of what You're prepared to deal
with personally what you have the capacity
[SPEAKER_02]: for and what you actually have the
understanding of and when you need to call
[SPEAKER_02]: in the professionals and really and Don't
be intimidated because you are you know
[SPEAKER_02]: have such a wealth of knowledge and are
experts in your area And I know it
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes a lot of times I'll talk to
people and they're very cautious or feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like they sound dumb or something like
that and I think that if people could let
[SPEAKER_02]: their guard down and really own their
power and be confident about who they are
[SPEAKER_02]: and understand that attorneys and CPAs and
Consultants are there to provide you with
[SPEAKER_02]: a service and not to tell you what to do
and if you go in with that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: Attitude it can definitely help the
dynamic in terms of them really serving
[SPEAKER_02]: you And serving your needs and
understanding that you know a lot of times
[SPEAKER_02]: There's folks out there that will say you
know you're gonna need my ongoing help And
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's always the case And
you know just be cautious and take it all
[SPEAKER_02]: with a grain of salt and take what you
need And I also think that there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: reason that people cannot Join together
especially in a local group of farmers or
[SPEAKER_02]: if you have similar issues with just a
group of your friends Who are farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: getting problems with contracts or going
to market?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's completely acceptable for you to go
to an attorney together and pay for that
[SPEAKER_02]: time together and ask a bunch of questions
and and It's also just an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_02]: pitch again this You know joining this
marketing education Consortium as a
[SPEAKER_02]: platform that everybody can get behind
because that power in so many ways can be
[SPEAKER_02]: leveraged obviously but especially with
Seeking professional counsel getting you
[SPEAKER_02]: know time with service professionals or
attorneys that you might not be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: access as individuals, I think it's really
important and awesome and So when you go
[SPEAKER_02]: to seek counsel or seek professional
counsel in terms of an attorney I think
[SPEAKER_02]: that one of the pivotal times is I mean
you all are way far along you've already
[SPEAKER_02]: Got your entities formed and kind of your
business structure, but before Making a
[SPEAKER_02]: decision about anything like that it's
really worth it to go talk to an attorney
[SPEAKER_02]: and talk to an accountant because So many
of those decisions are really driven by
[SPEAKER_02]: your finances where you are as a farm
where you're going and that can really if
[SPEAKER_02]: you go in You know either before or after
but it's really important to do those in
[SPEAKER_02]: tandem because those decisions are really
tied together About what kind of entity
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna form how you're gonna do your
accounting how?
[SPEAKER_02]: Much you really need to put into that and
then it's gonna help you make decisions
[SPEAKER_02]: about how you're structuring your business
What kind of contracts you're entering
[SPEAKER_02]: into and all of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not sure what else I think that
oh make sure that you Attorneys will often
[SPEAKER_02]: especially when you come in as a group be
very cautious about representing multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: people and so You have to waive your right
to independent counsel and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: basically just saying and they'll have you
sign a form that makes sure you Understand
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're getting advice as a whole from
this one attorney and it absolves that
[SPEAKER_02]: counsel of any conflict of interest that
may come up later
[SPEAKER_01]: Consistently having to sign
indemnifications in the compliance
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can they protect themselves?
[SPEAKER_02]: So usually that's you know and with
Manufacturers or distributors or anyone
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're working for everyone wants
indemnification So one thing is that you
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure it's a mutual indemnification
clause so that you're also protected
[SPEAKER_02]: honestly, like the best way to protect
yourself in that kind of situation is To
[SPEAKER_02]: run a good business to be operating in
good faith I can't tell you how much it
[SPEAKER_02]: matters to be able to show that you have
operated in good faith you've done
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that you can to be in
compliance because if you end up it before
[SPEAKER_02]: a you know an arbiter or a judge or
something like that in the situation where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're you know having indemnification is
coming up as a You're needing to be
[SPEAKER_02]: protected in a lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes a long way to show that you're a
good player that you've done everything
[SPEAKER_02]: you can you've been an upstanding
participant in that contract and mutual
[SPEAKER_02]: indemnification and then Insurance is a is
a thing now and if you are a licensed
[SPEAKER_02]: operator you have to have insurance and
sometimes We don't always get the
[SPEAKER_02]: insurance but it there are certain,
you know categories of insurance that are
[SPEAKER_02]: not As expensive as you think they are For
some product liability coverage and things
[SPEAKER_02]: like that And that's really where the
indemnification is coming up right now is
[SPEAKER_02]: really being afraid of these lawsuits and
the vape Crisis and all that kind of thing
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and also I just wanted to say that
The pure collective has several lawyers
[SPEAKER_00]: that that work specifically with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that we have as a
resource Within this group already and can
[SPEAKER_00]: help answer some quick questions And point
you in the right direction and that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: way that we can collectively work together
You You You You You
