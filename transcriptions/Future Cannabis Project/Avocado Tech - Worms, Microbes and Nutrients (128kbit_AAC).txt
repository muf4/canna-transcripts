[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Arthur and tonight I'm here
with the man the myth the legend the tech
[SPEAKER_01]: finally the creator of avocado tech So
please just tell us tell us about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes how it came to fruition everything for
sure Yeah, just as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to look for something that was a
little bit more easy I know myself as a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower and I know that I'm not you know I
like my time to be for observing plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and not for Doing busy work and mixing
things together and so I initially
[SPEAKER_00]: gravitated towards a living soil style
Just because you know I can hook up
[SPEAKER_00]: automatic watering I can keep a moisture
root zone and basically You know cut a few
[SPEAKER_00]: corners by having some things that I don't
need to do You know and so avocado came to
[SPEAKER_00]: me because I use a system of watering
called blue mat and blue mat is a is a
[SPEAKER_00]: gravity fed trip irrigation that Operates
off a tensiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure a lot of people know it but it
was a portion of reading about how to use
[SPEAKER_00]: their stuff where I came across them
talking about a nutrient well and
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially you have a dripper and then
below that dripper you'll you'll make a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient well of whatever your specific
nutrient is for the time and so I had seen
[SPEAKER_01]: a few vermicompost videos Well,
so now you actually creating a divot in
[SPEAKER_01]: your bed dropping what dry amendments
there Yeah, that's the principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over time those will you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: soak down in the rosal sphere and have an
effect and So basically I had seen a few
[SPEAKER_00]: people in vermicompost and went worm bin
post talking about avocados and just how
[SPEAKER_00]: they were a magic for the worms and so I
absolutely love yeah, and so we all love
[SPEAKER_00]: them and Basically, I just my brain
started cooking and I thought hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I how can I use these things in my
setup?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't didn't really have space for a
worm bin at the time and I figured that
[SPEAKER_00]: one way to do it was try to compost
directly in my Containers and so where I
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of diverged from the vermicompost
crew was I decided to Make a chef
[SPEAKER_00]: background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I started making some fly guacamole for
them, you know, I mean mixing in some dry
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments And then I started researching,
you know, what kind of amendments I could
[SPEAKER_00]: get from nature And I started looking into
fruits and so that very first pod that you
[SPEAKER_01]: ever put down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that mixture?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that was A veg pod because you
know, I was um, I was I was had a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: group, you know grow getting ready
Everything was looking prime and I'm like
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I what else can I do to kind of
be hands-off?
[SPEAKER_00]: But set this thing, you know off I had
probably fifth round living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you that that bed was already rock that
bed was rocking It was definitely rocking
[SPEAKER_00]: and I my worm population was a little
lower than I thought it should have been
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I was researching the
vermicompost stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so anyways, I basically took my
cover crop And I pureed it and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: added the avocado meat to that and I
believe I was looking for some calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to kind of carry you through from veg
into early flower and beyond and so I use
[SPEAKER_00]: the dust of some gypsum in the bottom of a
bag Real fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically going like he wasn't
trying to do anything nothing too crazy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I just want to see what would happen
So right now we just have the avocado.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have your cover crop and gas and gypsum
Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then beyond that a little bit of dry
kelp Luckily, we live in Maine and Maine
[SPEAKER_00]: is it's the craziest resource around here
is kelp And so we don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand that, you know, you have to
respect the kelp But basically it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of kelp and a little bit of
malted barley, which is a you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic enzyme Yes, just helps
everything break down and then the last
[SPEAKER_00]: and final thing I decided to put in and
this was the first time and I moved away
[SPEAKER_00]: from this in the future and then went back
to it because I saw how well it worked was
[SPEAKER_00]: some Bokashi and I blended that right in
and what that does is that Kicks off the
[SPEAKER_00]: micro the microbiology breaking down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, what you put in the avocado and then
I just observed and I just observed and
[SPEAKER_00]: observed added nothing else at that point
and Just had a beautiful veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your grow setup at that time?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I mean, how many pies did you put
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure So basically I use one avocado per
plant and I still pretty much stick to
[SPEAKER_00]: that that style if you want to go really
light You could you could just use a half
[SPEAKER_00]: an avocado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely suggest people in their
systems Experiment and see what works for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But um, yeah, and so just it went great
and in the setup I had sort of a four by
[SPEAKER_00]: eight hedge and it just filled the screen
quickly I mean did you have any control to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of go off of the growth once you hit
that bed with that or It was just more
[SPEAKER_01]: explosive than anything in those so I
didn't do all the plants in the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, basically I just tried it on certain
ones and I just saw those those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of take over the bed, so if I Used it
on two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I used it on two and they were
like the the dominant plants within the
[SPEAKER_00]: within the hedge and I was like that and
Then again brain keeps on cooking and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, okay What are we gonna do coming
in, you know, cuz I was doing this by the
[SPEAKER_00]: run It was like a real time run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, okay, let's let's think
about Let's think about going into flower
[SPEAKER_00]: here But I was you know in early veg when
I'm thinking about this and so I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay I'm gonna drop something in the
avocado right around like Two weeks before
[SPEAKER_00]: I flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, because I want whatever is,
you know being broken down in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: takes time in organics and basically I
dropped the pot early and I got the most
[SPEAKER_00]: site bud sites and branching I'd ever seen
and these are cultivars that I had grown
[SPEAKER_00]: Previous know about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how to grow exactly and they just
I mean I can there's definitely something
[SPEAKER_00]: to genetics sort of You know Naturalizing
or becoming more fill it familiar with the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth style that you're applying to them,
especially, you know and in a clone clonal
[SPEAKER_00]: form and so Yeah, I just saw beautiful
branching and saw an improvement and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: literally doing less So and I was
literally spending nothing few,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know a few dollars at the grocery and
Everything came from from an organic
[SPEAKER_00]: grocery was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so we'll get back to that again
So let's just go through the actual step
[SPEAKER_01]: now that you've played with it for a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your from seed to harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you put?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you using your?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right and so I mean part of it becomes
preparation, you know, it's a chicken or
[SPEAKER_00]: egg situation It's part of becomes
prepping for the next round and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: employ that but let's just say you're
going to organics You have to be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit ahead ahead of time everything the
schedule falls ahead for certain and So
[SPEAKER_00]: let's just go like it's your first time
Flipping into this style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would put something down early in veg
You want nice healthy starts, of course
[SPEAKER_00]: always but you're doing that calcium that
nitrogen from your cover crops Those
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones from your kelp and the enzymes
from the barley just to get everything
[SPEAKER_00]: popping in your Bokashi And you can use
other it's a beauty of this whole thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can use whatever you have at your
disposal In your girl style what works for
[SPEAKER_00]: you, but basically for this You put early
in veg because you know two weeks before
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna flip You want the next pod
going through and what I've seen in my you
[SPEAKER_00]: know experience and others experiences is
Five days the pod really starts to get
[SPEAKER_00]: rough Rocking ten days You've got some
worms just invading and attacking and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the you know, fungi and bacteria
are taking over the avocado meat or the
[SPEAKER_00]: guacamole Whatever you want to call it and
the worms just come, you know come calling
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful thing and you know by day
ten, you've got a mass of worms in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're you know, coming I know reading,
you know what a time it is But yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have this this hub and that's that's
the whole thing is that creates this
[SPEAKER_00]: initial hub this little microbiome that
they hang out in and just Go wild and that
[SPEAKER_00]: is all the micro arthropods all the
bacteria all the fungi all the all the
[SPEAKER_00]: worms It's just it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when you say early veg, is that going
down after you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Transplant is it after it's been rocking
for a little while in the best time I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: it's up to you to really time it but I
like to time it basically with As soon as
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel transplant shock is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you know, it's a beautiful thing
Just put the seed in there as well and you
[SPEAKER_00]: may be able to apply the pot a little
earlier if it's just you know You're just
[SPEAKER_01]: popping right so then part number two
comes two weeks before flip time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I like to do it I feel like
we're zoom that is phosphorus phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: you said it and so mainly phosphorus
again, you can put those those those
[SPEAKER_00]: tertiary Ingredients in there as well just
to kind of gives you the goodness keep
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but basically, yeah So one of my main
amendments is I researched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, what's what's a what's a fruit or a
seed or that's high in phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pumpkin seed and it's crazy and it's
abundant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can Grow it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can you know, you can buy it with
children who has the jack-o-lantern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes Yeah, you can find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so make sure to use organic pumpkins,
of course, but Basically, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can buy them store-bought you can
process them yourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can puree them whole seed you can you
know with the hull or you can you can buy
[SPEAKER_00]: them processed already and so you make
sort of like a nut butter and then thin
[SPEAKER_00]: that out with the with the Avocado and
then add all your other side ingredients
[SPEAKER_00]: as well that I would probably slack off on
the kelp Because of just the extra
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones they kind of prevent flowering
sometimes but in a specific dry amendments
[SPEAKER_00]: you will go with I would go one notch
further on the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a product called Dr. C's biofoss.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I personally Dr. C's biofoss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I believe it's inoculated on non-gmo
soybean and it's Beneficial microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: probably analogous to like a mammoth pea
something like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not used mammoth in my garden yet
But yeah, so in a knock, you know more
[SPEAKER_00]: more inoculation in that one if you have
an IMO Definitely, you know keep pumping
[SPEAKER_00]: that up with an IMO I've even experiments
with doing mycorrhizal fungi in there just
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure all the relationships are
there because the roots like to because of
[SPEAKER_00]: that moisture They'll grow up out of the
soil literally into the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's a most layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's all right Yeah, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now in two weeks before the flip we got
part number two now when this part three
[SPEAKER_00]: come down pot Three comes down around day
21, which a lot of people like to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf strip, you know That's very popular
is to strip a lot of your canopy at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point Tom and it makes sense to do things
while you're doing Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I usually lay it down and again There's
a little bit I would say recovery period
[SPEAKER_00]: after that which is similar to the after
the transplant shock So you can wait a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit and then stretch and then yes
And so that's this this is not gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: used right then anyway, you know what
we're looking for and that is potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: and potassium helps with ripening and The
other thing that I wanted to target on was
[SPEAKER_00]: like terpene production, you know That's
when your turps start to evolve and change
[SPEAKER_00]: into a more mature state or whatever you
want to call it and basically You can
[SPEAKER_00]: influence that by what we with what you
use and luckily There's a lot of great
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit sources for potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think banana, you know peel peel and
all you know puree then or think mango is
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful and you can kind of the way I
Look at it is that these all have
[SPEAKER_00]: precursors to terpenes in there as they
break down So when these terpenes are
[SPEAKER_00]: brought down to ground, you know,
your herb isn't sucking up mango flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: from the mango But all the precursor
elements that created those terpenes are
[SPEAKER_00]: there again broken down and then your
plant can express it genetically Whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: way it wants to so you can grow some crazy
mango herb with mangoes for sure I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's that's definitely a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so basically beautiful fruit
Purees I'm really a fan of figs Prunes are
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing and think, you know darker strains
purple strains things like that Like I
[SPEAKER_00]: know it sounds silly, but they have all
the pigment, you know base base layers of
[SPEAKER_00]: pigments and terpenes and it just they
They make your plant like, you know flex
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay, so by day 21 week three of
flower Avocado tech is done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so I would imagine Just from us
talking to me knowing you you're you
[SPEAKER_01]: already amended your soil ridiculously
It's now in its fifth cycle that the 11th
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle now, so Besides the avocado tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything else that you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, so so basically I Operate with the
law return.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if I take anything out of my
garden, I need to replace it some way,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you just yeah, absolutely and so
Basically return all the cannabis leaf all
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will chop various companion plants cover
crops Just to make sure there's health in
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden at all time if I have something
that's doing You know sickly I'll probably
[SPEAKER_00]: just chop it and put it to ground and it
turns over very quickly But that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: other absolute, you know key tenant and
and the other would be the blue mat
[SPEAKER_01]: watering That's the way they all interplay
is is very special.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blue mats are becoming very popular
I'm familiar with it, but please talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: us a little bit about your system how it
works with you Right in the tech because
[SPEAKER_01]: it works together like you actually
position your pods, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They are complementary to each other
definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I have two different You know,
I have my own like personal rec grow where
[SPEAKER_00]: I use just the dripper No blue soak or no
hose or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have my greenhouse which I use
the the soak So I have kind of you know
[SPEAKER_00]: witness both of them in action.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do like I love this Soap,
but I really like the the drip the drip
[SPEAKER_00]: emitter because you position the Avocado,
you know picture a smooth shell and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you have the drip, you know dripping
directly on that shell and cascading down
[SPEAKER_00]: It just creates this this umbrella of
moisture under the it works the same way
[SPEAKER_00]: with the holes too true and true indeed
and and I will position my the pods like
[SPEAKER_00]: along the hose and make sure you mulch
over them if you mulch over all this
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway, you're gonna get a good moisture
content if you're rocking blue mats,
[SPEAKER_00]: but um, I just feel like that nutrient
Well principle it's okay, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's uh, it becomes kind of almost
like an incentive in sync with each other
[SPEAKER_00]: when the when the plant wants moisture You
know the blue mat gives it up and at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point in time It's almost in a way asking
for food because you know You're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: that trickle down beautiful worm castings
down in there that are nutrient rich from
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's broken down So it's a it's a lovely
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I mean to me it just sounds
intuitive It just works very well the
[SPEAKER_01]: fattiness acids inside the avocado
everything but To a person who's totally
[SPEAKER_01]: new to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What what?
[SPEAKER_01]: How would avocado work avocado tech work
to the beginner and why why should the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginner?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can a lot of people are in a
space where they're transitioning from
[SPEAKER_00]: salt-based bottle nutrients to organics
which is a great time to implement this
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done experiments on some of my starts
which are not in any kind of luxurious
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil some of them and put put the
avocado down and the roots literally will
[SPEAKER_00]: grow up into the avocado and You if you do
have any biology present springtails or
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they will flock to that And so
you do it's it works even in a in a fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in a non fungal dominant soil It will
still have a benefit from my experience
[SPEAKER_00]: and and the thing that's dope about it is
that it's above ground and so there's very
[SPEAKER_00]: little possibility of root pathogens and
you know, Aniromic bacteria being a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem and again have you run into any of
those problems at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had pods actually go aniromic for one
reason or another but be absolutely no
[SPEAKER_00]: problem It's just kind of like they broke
down in a different way like think of JDOM
[SPEAKER_00]: versus KNF like one's smellier and I think
that depending on how you inoculate it and
[SPEAKER_00]: what you put in I like to add a little
sugar to I didn't mention that in some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them but um in the form of Like I'll use a
little I mean, I'm from Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use maple syrup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put a little maple syrup in there
just to kick it off and Agave too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably stay away from honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use brown sugar if you wanted to
but you know, I like the idea of using
[SPEAKER_01]: something local now our Relationship
brotherhood started at the regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Place changed my life forever So I'm
always thinking regeneratively sustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's been a dream of mine to even in
this cold climate to Somehow orchestrate
[SPEAKER_01]: some heartiness avocados up here and this
was even before I even knew you but um
[SPEAKER_01]: Staying along the sustainable regenerative
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you say to somebody who says
you're trying to do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Avocado tech in Maine, right how
regenerative and absolutely I've run into
[SPEAKER_00]: it definitely and it's and it was really
good for me actually because you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoil my herbs And so I figured I'll
make it up in other ways, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll Rock LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll you know, I'll change up what I'm
doing to be sustainable as possible to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of give them this treat and then I
started saying nah man, I can do better
[SPEAKER_00]: than that and so one of my first step was
to Hook up with a local grocer who was an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic grocer who was like we're throwing
these all away You know, and then I got
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like yo when you're throwing those
away And so what I started doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know was say these were gonna go in
the trash and And that's not without the
[SPEAKER_00]: realm of possibility for anybody hooking
up with their a grocer like that in town I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean it can work and another thing and now
what I'm working on now as well is is
[SPEAKER_00]: different options pumpkins many worm from
compost people know pumpkins they go crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: for pumpkins as well the worms that is and
So that could absolutely be a dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got it's the principle of it You've
got this humidity dome that is an
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive spot for micro life to go crazy
Feed them while they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna stay and hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically you can now divert the
avocado text or whatever you put your
[SPEAKER_01]: research into that Yeah, and so one of my
other thoughts was Gord tech, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Gord's and you can absolutely refill that
shell over and over again or custom
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve it right and once this becomes a
cycle you can prepare one year in
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable fruit nut crops put them away
for the next For the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been experimenting also with frozen
avocados, you know That's another way to
[SPEAKER_00]: stockpile them as they're coming from a
grocer if there's too many and you we
[SPEAKER_01]: really don't use many That's what I want
to do with my worm bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do the per puree I heard that
just freezing all the material anyway is a
[SPEAKER_00]: precursor for you It can be you're gonna
get a quick breakdown on the debate would
[SPEAKER_00]: be are you losing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something of the you know, the fresh
quality versus the frozen quality because
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the freezing is gonna break down
A lot of bonds and whatever you're
[SPEAKER_00]: freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen good results from it though I
mean I would love this is why I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get this crowd source is because I want
people to go in on this and I want them to
[SPEAKER_00]: Report back and we need to set a parameter
of best practices and I mean I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it I think I have a good idea with
what it is, but excuse me I'd like to see
[SPEAKER_00]: it on scale and I actually am working with
some homies out in Colorado a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: We're implementing it and also Oklahoma,
excuse me We're using it at scale and
[SPEAKER_00]: people have dropped me lines from Chile
and South Africa and Cali and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: they're all they're all experimented with
You can find some of the waste products to
[SPEAKER_01]: add into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use what's local to you I mean you went
over pretty well, but are there any other
[SPEAKER_01]: tips that you would Well, I mean,
I just feel like it's good to highlight
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that um, you know Not only is
this a direct feed method But this can be
[SPEAKER_00]: just a soil conditioning method in general
I mean you can implement this fully like I
[SPEAKER_00]: do and it's that's my only way I feed my
plants period Which I haven't seen in
[SPEAKER_00]: previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you know, it's it's it's
something that's in the works,
[SPEAKER_00]: but um, I think that There's just a
million ways you can go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do okay also so traditionally people
who do no-till living soil beds They'll
[SPEAKER_01]: either re-amend their beds after one cycle
or two cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you still re-amending?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't I was in the past before I'd
fully implemented avocado tech I would get
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of like a mineral pack or rock dusts
and and put them back through but now I
[SPEAKER_00]: add those through the avocado tech because
I literally have African nightcrawlers and
[SPEAKER_00]: I have red wiggler worms and they were
different You know layers of the substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly and they're ones handing it down
to the next and they're dispersing it and
[SPEAKER_00]: so I feel like You know, I can accomplish
everything you do in top dressing with the
[SPEAKER_00]: avocado tech and as long as you stay
consistent On it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been seeing just a beautiful You know
trajectory so it's loving now this is goes
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit off of just the avocado tech
now you said yeah, I love And that's how I
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of want to look at all beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's just like a fine wine It
just gets better over time, but I've also
[SPEAKER_01]: heard the thing where The living soil beds
hit a plateau Especially after like
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's like seven or eight cycles
something like right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any?
[SPEAKER_00]: Insight into that I would say that I I
mean I experienced a little bit of that
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think I think people are quick to
judge that something is going downhill and
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you need a soil test and I think
that would be the that will that will cut
[SPEAKER_00]: that fear out and Again as more people use
the style people are gonna saying wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you better check in on the fifth round See
how it's doing, you know or whatever it
[SPEAKER_00]: might be I'm just saying so I think that
there's different protocols just not in
[SPEAKER_00]: the game right now and people,
you know are Learning, you know through
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and I feel like yeah It can hit a
plateau but then I think there's ways to
[SPEAKER_00]: pull it out and correct it and I think
that that could Be worth it rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: some people just dump it and let's go for
some new things But I think there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: finesse to the older soil that you can't
get in the younger punky soil I think your
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals haven't really fully broken down
at some of your long-term amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use Oyster shell and things like that
that it takes a long time and there's you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, lovely calcium but there's other
principles or your chitin source,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know your crab meal or your I used the
squid Squid quills the bony part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we went squid fishing one day and we
got a lot of them and I dried them out
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were just beautiful and then
I read an article on chitin and they got
[SPEAKER_00]: period and put in the bed Yeah,
so cool shit like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I like to spoil the herb But I
also like to think about it in in in the
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of scale, you know And that's great
segue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just thinking about something you
said earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now what What are the
environments that you you've been testing
[SPEAKER_01]: your situation?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like what's your parameters my
parameter?
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you once you lay that out,
how would avocado tech be scaled?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would it be scaled?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so I rock the VPD, you know humid
Warm we're talking 84 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably 70 even 70 plus and that's
Depends on your genetics that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: running for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they all like it a little bit I
like to run it hot because I liked my mice
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly for my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean The plants can adapt the soil is I
find that it kind of works at that higher
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature In a better way the synergy,
you know, I rock LED lights So I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lot of heat generated through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need other climate You know control
to make sure my heat is on point check
[SPEAKER_00]: your own soil temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not only because I'm pretty confident
through my infrared scoping and such that
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the range that is probably We were
just talking about Hey, I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: that No, I'll get I'll get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's one of those things like a lot
of it is intuition But I'm back and making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure it's all checked in with science
Okay, you know I'm saying so it just feels
[SPEAKER_00]: right to to do it this way and I'm just
making sure that on the back end that the
[SPEAKER_00]: science is straight and You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I'd like to do is get some
more microscopes on the activity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: avocado tech and again It's in development
and we need to get a get a handle on
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's so okay To get back to the
second part of the question on the scaling
[SPEAKER_01]: up side of things The shell is a huge part
of the dome is a huge part of it So would
[SPEAKER_01]: it just be more man hours trying to do
those handcrafted pods, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean what you can do is make a large
batch And again, when you look at all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time you taken in manicuring and other
manual things You only have to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: three times in the whole cycle,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a little bit of hand work
But um, you know, and the other thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that's worth talking about is is avocado
tech indoor You could do that in our
[SPEAKER_01]: industry we can afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I mean because it comes back
Well, the least touches on anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know as possible definitely the you
know, the lean kind of workload is great
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's the Believe me, that's why I
developed this so anything that you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: that will you know give you time to
observe the plants You know definitely do
[SPEAKER_00]: it but three times is a beautiful thing
and I think that it could work on a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: scale And I think you can make large
batches and I think that it could work
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely well and you can end up with
some really unique cannabis because on a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger scale you're gonna You're gonna get
a nice source of each one of your
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients and that's gonna give your end
product of individuality
[SPEAKER_01]: Always ask is there something that you
prepared to talk about that I didn't ask
[SPEAKER_00]: you about No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I'm just trying to think maybe
We've talked about blue mats we've talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about indoor versus outdoor avocado tech,
okay, okay, so um Indoor you have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more control of course And so things some
things are probably possible Inside that
[SPEAKER_00]: may not be as effective outside using a
lot of sugars using You know making an
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely, you know, sweet avocado pod
that you're putting down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably not a good idea outside
You're gonna try and things that you might
[SPEAKER_00]: not want to so but again your your
multilayer is your friend You want to tuck
[SPEAKER_00]: the avocado down below it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you definitely want to charge these
avocados to outpace pests You know
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculating with your fungi with your IMO
and these things will disappear incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: fast If you've got enough worms in your
bed, they will disappear incredibly fast
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you just have to think about that
The other thing we talked about is for
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor cultivation Maybe making it a
little IMO style cage to put over your
[SPEAKER_00]: your section now again on large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may be Not extremely feasible,
but if you again if you charge it and use
[SPEAKER_00]: your multilayer I think you can definitely
get that that that pod gone before there's
[SPEAKER_01]: an issue And and keep it moving So I guess
I will highlight the things you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: want to include in that in the tech You
don't want men a mineral component is
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you want a Microbiological
component is great fungi of some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria of some sort and that could be
anything recharge mammoth, I mean you name
[SPEAKER_00]: it but I Highly suggest IMOs because
indigenous microorganisms are gonna you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, they're just gonna operate better in
your system and and you can get them gone
[SPEAKER_00]: and then again the sugar source to keep it
popping and Whatever your target nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: is for that particular, you know How do
you like I mean they're they're great
[SPEAKER_00]: again, I don't add a lot extra what I do
Is which I should explain is just build a
[SPEAKER_00]: great living soil to start You know
mineral rich just just you know with
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty of aeration and Just let it break
down over time, you know, I when I
[SPEAKER_00]: concocted it I was thinking how's this
gonna how's this gonna be holding up in
[SPEAKER_00]: five years ten years whatever it might be
and I built it for time, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you hear a lot of people Leighton Morrison
is one talking about the horizons within
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil and I wish I had Known that when
I built my bed, but I think I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: intuitively did you know, I put a lot of
you know pumice shell down at the bottom I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't really do a silt layer,
but I think some of the stuff that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: using is kind of Made that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay gypsum and you know rock dust
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So All I can say is everything's rocking
really really well And I will hopefully in
[SPEAKER_00]: Maine, you know, we'll get access good
access to some soil testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's easy You know, we're kind of
far removed and so we don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure And the industry here about
newly being wrecked and you know Getting
[SPEAKER_01]: out of prohibition and you know a lot
about those things we can get into that
[SPEAKER_01]: later What is the avocado tech feeding
right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Strain wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so Um one in my last run was
interesting because I wanted to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivar that was was hot everybody knew
and I wanted to see how it would react And
[SPEAKER_00]: so I got a hold the Mac And shot the homie
hash on that one and Basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried that out and it came out lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean beautiful I actually grew in the
greenhouse and I grew it inside and Just
[SPEAKER_00]: the turf profiling was was was very loud,
which I had heard that it was a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: muted But not in this case it had it had
more at least with the fuel and some I got
[SPEAKER_00]: a purple Fino and I got a beautiful one
that rose out in the end that was in the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse the Mac to Mac 3 in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so we can maybe show an Instagram
photo of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that was that was lovely and So
now I'm still working with my baby is
[SPEAKER_00]: called.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mystery cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call the SPR Not to be confused with
sugar black rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some confusion that it was that
one point but I can tell that it's not and
[SPEAKER_00]: so Working with her and then shout out to
my man weaving genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collabed on some beautiful crosses of
The SPR because I really wanted to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: into seed form because I just love it as a
cut So what is what is what's the acronym
[SPEAKER_01]: for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: We it doesn't have an acronym.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just remains SPR.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just for now Yeah, and so high
turpentine profile high mercy and profile
[SPEAKER_00]: My background is in beverage my family
business and I've been trained in wine
[SPEAKER_00]: since I was 21 And so I gravitated towards
a strain because it checked all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was floral I had a citrus it had fuel
And it was just it was unique,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it was something I didn't smell
every day And you know, I do a lot of wine
[SPEAKER_00]: tasting and sampling and I'm all
constantly getting bombarded with
[SPEAKER_00]: different aromas in this Did you have it
before the avocado tech?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did I had it before the avocado tech and
and just it's just It's it's yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is it's it's transcended what it used
to be You know, I can see additional frost
[SPEAKER_00]: addition just really pungent terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it tested in I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a crazy high but it was 23 or
something like that for for its overall
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids It wasn't nuts, but I got a
question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now okay, so that's definitely what you
have six cycles now, so it could have and
[SPEAKER_01]: Right is the spice of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you sure hundreds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah hundreds of different straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Do you notice any?
[SPEAKER_01]: certain traits that go throughout the
different cultivars or do you It's just
[SPEAKER_01]: overall better growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean I would just say that it and
it tends to amplify whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression is So it's able to express
really loud on the terpium profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean some of that is, you know drying
and harvesting techniques etc,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm just trying to preserve the turps
keep everything cool and and dry slow and
[SPEAKER_00]: not get any kind of danger zone and just
You know, but beyond that I just feel that
[SPEAKER_00]: expresses much much more frosty and much
more loud and It just more vigorous growth
[SPEAKER_00]: in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just an inherent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even get cuz I mean You're feeding
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, it's just enhance whatever
genetically is sure I mean, you know when
[SPEAKER_00]: different people taste it, I'm sure they
can taste the terroir I'm more familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with it, you know, cuz it's in my
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all around It's like barbecuing and
then trying to eat a rib and it just
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't taste like smoke You know what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a scenario where I love to get
it out to other people to sample it and I
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of people saying whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa loud super loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So It's interesting because it's not your
classic fuel or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very for the SPR is a very complex
smell I would say And yeah, we're working
[SPEAKER_00]: on some crosses and seeing what we have
there Running the circus freak right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of a cool strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's bred by grumbles beans
Shout out to him and basically it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting cross because it's to CBT
dominant varietals crossed and they made a
[SPEAKER_00]: high THC progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you basically are rocking with I
believe Pennywise and Harlequin and then
[SPEAKER_00]: on the other side it flipped and it's a
it's incredibly frosty sort of a lighter
[SPEAKER_00]: colored cultivar and I can't wait to get
it tested See what see what it see what it
[SPEAKER_00]: does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah circus freak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those two I'm working on the SPR cross
with sour bubble and I think that's bog
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and Dance world, which is a Juanita
la gramosa Cross with I forget the other
[SPEAKER_00]: one right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But um, yeah, it's it's it's a really
beautiful planet It's maintained some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the attributes from what I've run thus far
of the SPR the frost the bud structure But
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a little deeper colored a little you
know, we're gonna see what we have there I
[SPEAKER_00]: think we have some some pretty special
stuff in the cut And then the other one
[SPEAKER_00]: that I run is called Emerald X and that
was a emerald Jack Fino that was Again
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a mystery cross But I know one
part of the lineage is emerald Jack and we
[SPEAKER_00]: we pulled a super loud super duper the
loudest Herb I've ever smelled out of it
[SPEAKER_00]: and unfortunately, I let that go by the
wayside So I'm in the process now have a
[SPEAKER_00]: bag of the seed and I'm trying to get it
back But we have some beautiful like
[SPEAKER_00]: little little heavy lavender Fino's out of
that almost like silver purpley looking
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of like the Mac but definitely
presents more og classic og look and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have pulled one I call it the stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not quite as loud as that original
one Okay, and again, I got some seedlings
[SPEAKER_00]: going right now that I'm gonna look
through and see what we can find But yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I'm not a breeder by any stretch
Juggling what I think is delicious,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And and have it in seed form so that I can
keep it around for me I mean I grow for
[SPEAKER_00]: me, you know, and so you can even get to
that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to get familiar with a whole
bunch of absolutely and Maine is Maine is
[SPEAKER_00]: a Opening up, you know slowly but surely
on the wreck front.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medical program is robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been around since 99 we've been here
and you know The caregiver model was was
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing and we have a beautiful spice of
life in this in this state because of that
[SPEAKER_01]: and Is there anything that you want to get
your hands on any breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I'm seeing the begins and
now I love deadpan head shout out to him
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah peach skunk version 2 I have yet to
get into the coffee crosses from from from
[SPEAKER_00]: Kaya from the Pacific Northwest roots cats
Shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely love everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does and I've got a Crossing that right
now called dirty Starbucks But I would
[SPEAKER_00]: love to look back at the original So
everything from me and gene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the classics, you know Who are
really tearing it up right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows who they are right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to check some swamp boys gear out
Pug but I haven't I've been sticking to my
[SPEAKER_00]: own stable But I want to see other people
cultivate with this avocado tech so I can
[SPEAKER_00]: see how those fire strains Perform with
with this show us please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, holler at me tag me check me out So
yes, please give us all your information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah blue a green tank is the is the name
Of my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's BLU underscore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh F underscore green tank one word blue
of green tank Check me out Green tank is
[SPEAKER_00]: the crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the studio right now actually
where we make music So check out the link
[SPEAKER_00]: in the bio on the music as well,
you know I think we the medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: influences the music and vice versa So
it's kind of something dope to look at so
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to John Eagle beats in the lab
My fellow aficionados Jim Thorpe,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in stress
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody even Joel of that O'Brien But
yeah, I'm click we're gonna cut it off
[SPEAKER_01]: now, but it's true pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna always get to do this again Yes,
see you at the region.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir You
