[SPEAKER_02]: And now just wanting to touch on ethics of
extraction and sitting right next to me,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have Gil and Brandon and Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he'll be back.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll be back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to pass over the microphone to
you here.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And both of you all grow as well as do
extraction and also are very active in the
[SPEAKER_02]: regenerative community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can you put those together to us why
it's important, one with the other?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we wanted to talk about how
regenerative cannabis and farming ties
[SPEAKER_07]: into what hash is all about.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we can kind of like start it off
maybe with like a little bit of thinking
[SPEAKER_07]: how Mother Nature kind of does it all
without any of us interrupting it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the plant falls right back down to
where it was once grown.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I kind of always thought that that's
really important into sustainability and
[SPEAKER_07]: creating a farm and fertility and all
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we farm the hash, that's what
we're yeah, that's what we're farming.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're not really farming for the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that means that as much as the biomass
gets put back down, I mean, it's it's
[SPEAKER_07]: amazing for next year.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we put 99 percent of it back down.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's a big part of the
sustainability in this small farm that can
[SPEAKER_07]: keep it going type of thing, because it's
definitely cost effective and all those
[SPEAKER_07]: things come into play.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, so tying that into kind of
like the whole thing is like it just keeps
[SPEAKER_07]: the flow going.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think for a small farm, you know,
it's hard to do all these and with the
[SPEAKER_07]: regulations and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't really apply to everyone that
they can really do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's just how we do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we just you know, we have the love for
hash like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we don't really do much.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's a small scale thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm struggling with things to say after,
like, just all the real professional
[SPEAKER_05]: people that talk today, you know,
Dr. Ethan and lawyer guy Dale over there
[SPEAKER_05]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just, I don't know, I'm just a
kind of a simple guy, but I do work with
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis physically, like most days of the
week, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But solventless is really popular right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if people know that,
but or what state you're in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in California and Trinity County,
and I feel like California is kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: often set cannabis trends, whether you
want to talk about legally or socially or
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But people talk about adaptability is
important currently.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what led me to solventless is
just following ganja and seeing where it
[SPEAKER_05]: took me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was just trying to see what I really
enjoyed about it and what I didn't enjoy
[SPEAKER_05]: about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And growing flour, I'm sure you can all
understand like spent all this time
[SPEAKER_05]: growing it and then drying it and
processing it as an art unto itself,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, just literally keeping that
thing so pristine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would lose sleep over it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Making sure my dry room was perfect and
making sure my trimmers weren't just like
[SPEAKER_05]: destroying the weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: And feeling pressures to use trim
machines, all that over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've done I've worked for other
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've farmed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done a lot of different situations on
a small scale, large scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, personally, for me, that was
just stressful dealing with the actual
[SPEAKER_05]: flour, the longevity of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, sometimes you're forced to hold
on to product.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oxidization that it happens sometimes
rapidly and some strains, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: it happens fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Faster than others.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's hard to say whether or
not that's going to happen to,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, before you grow it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think totally all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we preserve it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And kind of like isolate that and almost
kind of think about it as like a wine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we preserve it and age that year.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it could even get better or worse.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it all depends.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's definitely like capsulizing the
year and not letting it get worse.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we appeal to that market and that
market like asked for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we kind of like adjusted, I feel like,
to that thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's we're constantly teaching them,
I feel like, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's a it's a huge like why you
should be enjoying hash over anything
[SPEAKER_07]: else.
[SPEAKER_07]: And man, that's a struggle, I feel like,
because so many people just have,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, they're all they know
everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone knows everything already.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of like, you know,
nobody wants to hear it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some some people don't.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I think that's I think that's a
big part of why what we do, what we do
[SPEAKER_07]: and, you know, really push on to not
ingesting chemicals because we really just
[SPEAKER_07]: like care a lot about everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's like why we do and make what we
make and push out for the next person to
[SPEAKER_07]: find the health in the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so we really grow it healthy and
then make it healthy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it's like the highest purity
product that the plant can make,
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like, without any of the chemicals
and machinery.
[SPEAKER_05]: Concentrates make sense just on a
therapeutic level to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like if you're really like trying to
use cannabis for medicine to me sitting
[SPEAKER_05]: there and just smoking flour and flour,
flour, flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to medicate where someone could
just take a small concentrated dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it will always hold value in a
medical market where I think that will.
[SPEAKER_07]: Inhaling for all the times that we do out
there, I mean, it's not going to be that
[SPEAKER_07]: good for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like we all know that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But vaporizing oils is like tremendously
better.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I think that's a big part of
it, too, which we still like have to all
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of grasp.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we all love smoking joints.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we're going to stop that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: So but then there was I guess the other
half was we want to talk about kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: finding these hash plants because not
every plant of the cannabis plant is a
[SPEAKER_07]: hash plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the word hash plant is kind of vague,
I feel like.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I kind of want to like maybe touch on
the word hash plant and kind of put maybe
[SPEAKER_07]: a no.
[SPEAKER_07]: You think it's I want to hear what you got
to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is as much difference in the
cannabis resin as there is in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole plant adapt to an habitat,
but the whole plant adapt and its
[SPEAKER_00]: defensive system even more so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a tropical plant with a lot
of insect life, super green, it has to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce a resin that is really sticky and
protective.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take that plant and you put it into
the Hindu Kush mountain where there is no
[SPEAKER_00]: insect life because life is only where
there is water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super dusty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That resin head, which is sticky,
is going to be covered in dust and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to work anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant created a membrane seeker to
protect, to have less exudation of resin
[SPEAKER_00]: to protect itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can recognize genetic just by the
resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can even recognize parenthood like
lineage in the breeding just by looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just because your culture is flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: My culture is hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, you don't have the hash culture
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the concentrate culture that is
copying the BHO industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's vastly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, yeah, I do know what you mean
for everyone to join.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it's like what I wanted to say
and touch is so like the texture of the
[SPEAKER_07]: resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you said, you can't take an equator
type of plant and bring it to the
[SPEAKER_07]: mountains.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like are we talking about the mountain
plants?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like should we kind of like fall into
detail of what type of resin are we
[SPEAKER_07]: talking?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I feel like there are resins that
are closer to the equator that fall into,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, you touch them, they're oily,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think they fall into like the
tincture category.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we make tinctures out of the ones
that are more like water soluble terpene,
[SPEAKER_07]: like a resin plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you find that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to take into account that you
are spraying your plant like there is no
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while the plant can be nourished
through the leaf, it's not made to absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: food through the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that you play with the resin head
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I don't know, you grow flower,
you don't grow resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrate, it's a new game for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has blown the market away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrate is the next big thing in the
industry here in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you live in an island, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of the world is smoking hashish,
is smoking solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's your market of tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The market here in America, it's an
extract market.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do, I collect a resin head,
I crush it into a mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a chemical reaction that is
happening to that mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that mass, when it's older,
it's greater than what the plant gave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like a winemaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that process in the whole alcohol
industry, wine, it's unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you take the juice from the
grape, you can make many alcohol through
[SPEAKER_00]: distillation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to make wine, you need everything
crushed together to have that chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction happening and making that
transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something that is unique and
cannot be compared to any other extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, you use the word hash for everything
that is a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So already, when you go in Europe and you
say the word hash and you mean an extract,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna have to say American hash,
like you say for football.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we don't speak the same language.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash for us, it's millennium of culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very, very dear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just cannot appropriate a word and
use it for amazing product, but we have
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing to do with hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's
[SPEAKER_06]: like...
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the world market is coming and if
we need, if you want to have an exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: between country, we're gonna need to speak
the same language.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cannot appropriate word that has
millennium of culture just because you
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can, but the value of it is what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if you really want to be
relevant and have a language that is
[SPEAKER_00]: meaningful in the world trade,
well, you need first to respect tradition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And traditional culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we need to be able to describe
the terpene profile of a flower or the
[SPEAKER_00]: hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I would need a winemaker that
is a smoker to get deep enough into a
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profile to describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I go maybe two, three,
four level, but you can go 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like that...
[SPEAKER_00]: Wine became popular because it's
pleasurable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cannabis even more so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where we can appeal to the
people is through the palette.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, furthermore, the whole extract,
the whole hash people, the whole...
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that come after you grow the
plant, it's an appropriation of your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's different because my
education was going into a producing
[SPEAKER_00]: country, going as far away deep into the
producing place to stay with the local,
[SPEAKER_00]: to make my own hash because I'm smoking
only the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you can do that, there is so much you
can do by yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you create that entity in those
places, it has never been me making hash
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes the hash quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: People wanted to know where I want to
define the quality I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I came here in America,
all those producing country, the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of my hash was the land, the climate,
and the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came here in the Emerald Triangle,
I had the land, the climate, the genetic,
[SPEAKER_00]: but behind the genetics, there is a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there is actually a farmer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In producing country, even when it's
cultivated, it's not farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just cultivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I became like a winemaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with specific cultivar that I like
especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I need a vineyard to provide me with
what I need to show off on IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not only me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's every extractor, everybody that touch
your plant should give you credit because
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I am, I owe it to what was
given to me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same when I was in producing
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is like you sell yourself
cheap while the value of making a product
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Emerald Triangle give you a world
opening because you recognize worldwide
[SPEAKER_00]: for your quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love you to death, but if you didn't
deliver what I can receive here,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure I would go through the whole
shit I'm going, trying to work with big
[SPEAKER_00]: money people and shit like that,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like there is here something that is
so unique that you could become the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bordeaux and the France of the cannabis
because there is nowhere on the planet
[SPEAKER_00]: where there is the generation of people
that have been growing genetic and the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic adapted so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the diversity and you have an
history with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of it, you have a lot of story
to make it palatable to a market where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's nice now to deal with outlaw and
people like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you grow genetic, you give me
purple punch, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I can't get purple punch from
anybody, from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the stuff from Covello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the stuff that you keep in your
cupboard, stuff that I'm the only one to
[SPEAKER_00]: put on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are the only one to grow because
when you compete with the same genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: with the indoor, already you're sun grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an handicap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're working with the same
genetics and those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it doesn't even make any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're following a fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you follow a fashion,
you are behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to bloody create the fashion and
you have a hell of a lot of genetic to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, I don't know, you don't
know your value.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy to see everything you have and
you don't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you should own your genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any extractor touch your stuff,
even if it goes in a vape pen,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you buy a vape pen and I know that
the guy has been hunting his genetic in
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Triangle, well, I may look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I know that the guy is doing shit in
Salinas, I wouldn't be interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't even look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you have that value.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you sell a product, not only it's
underpriced, but on top of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't get the credit for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yo.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we owe you everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter how big I am, I owe it to
my farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that quality that I get,
it's because you gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like it's important to remember
that and to own it, to own your name,
[SPEAKER_00]: to own the genetics that you breed because
that's what makes you so different and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what you have a world reputation
for quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not that many place in the world
that have a world reputation for quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know only another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a remote valley in the mountain of
the Himalaya where I spent seven seasons
[SPEAKER_00]: making charas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't use this as a mean to
create everything, you don't believe in
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you have people believing in you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't ask for shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not gonna receive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not gonna give it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm special because of my education and
how I came into the business and my
[SPEAKER_00]: culture is always the origin of a product
that really counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if there is quality,
it's because it comes from somewhere and
[SPEAKER_00]: that somewhere is very special.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are that very special place and this
is the brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your brand is Emerald Triangle because
you're known worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun grown, you have a lot of sun grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had sun grown in many producing
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the sun grown in Emerald Triangle,
it's not quite the same than anywhere on
[SPEAKER_00]: the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I was just thinking what ties
into that too is talking about extracting
[SPEAKER_02]: resin from a plant and in certain zones
and areas, it's meaningful that that resin
[SPEAKER_02]: is telling a story of the area that it's
grown in or maybe a story of the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment or a story of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that you all are noticing a difference
between indoor resin and- Imagine that
[SPEAKER_00]: resin head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a defensive system of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bibliography of its life and its
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the whole story of the plant is
inside that resin head.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know how to read it, that the
connection between the ash maker and the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer, it's really important because I
can tell you stuff that you don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're a breeder, a farmer,
and an ash maker like Minjin, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you have the knowledge of all those
aspects of the plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I was going to ask you, Brandon,
when you're growing and how are you
[SPEAKER_06]: searching for plants?
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate that knowledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: The last couple years, I've been breeding
for the certain type of resin that is
[SPEAKER_07]: easier to work with with water hash for
simpler reasons because we all use water
[SPEAKER_07]: hash mostly here in America, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's kind of like what is that
easier head and that's kind of what I was
[SPEAKER_07]: going to say before was every plant has a
different texture to it, a different
[SPEAKER_07]: terpene, a different smell, and it carries
a different texture of that resin head,
[SPEAKER_07]: of that life.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what heads, what plants are better to
use than others?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I've had so many people call me
and tell me and cry to me that they're
[SPEAKER_07]: losing yields or hash or plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: They could have just sold it as pounds,
but they chose the fresh frozen and then
[SPEAKER_07]: they get nothing in return, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you use and the whole environment
you use, it's like it's not only the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, for sure, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you get your environment right,
you get everything else right,
[SPEAKER_07]: then it's up to the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got it up on my farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all dialed in up there, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: We do it right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've seen hundreds of different resins
passed by.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been washing hash for eight years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And growing for 15 almost.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's been a long journey, I think,
for my short life.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've just been full blown dedicated.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got the blinders on.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see anything else.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I didn't go legal.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't do this or that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care to even spread myself out
thin too much to try to help out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I focused on this exact purpose and,
you know, what at least what only I could
[SPEAKER_07]: see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't went to the other country and I
haven't seen that type of resin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, I've talked to some people.
[SPEAKER_07]: We went to this, you know, only to that
extent of talking.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the hash that I'm looking for is what
I guess what America now is aiming as what
[SPEAKER_07]: they're calling water hash, ice water
extraction, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And all that side of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I respect the culture and the
tradition, though, so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, like, I mean, I want to go
to India.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to go to all these other places.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to go and give thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like, just do whatever, volunteer,
make a freaking kilos for them,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I feel that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then, you know, here we are
modernized.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're 2019, about to be 2020.
[SPEAKER_07]: Catch up with the times a little bit as
much as I want to go backwards.
[SPEAKER_07]: But here we are.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this ice water extraction,
when you have everything dialed in or ice
[SPEAKER_07]: water separation, what is that head?
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that resin head?
[SPEAKER_07]: What is that texture?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've been down the road.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen the oily ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like to use those for tincture.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're not here to talk about that as
much as we like to talk about the
[SPEAKER_07]: solventless hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, like, I find it to be those fat,
but like granular, sandy heads.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, so we can agree on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is you're looking for something
specific that is easy to do with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is so it's like it's a dry area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, dry sieving as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, for me, you are you were born in
diversity, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had six flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it's every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more like a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant is precious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter how difficult.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to talk about it from easiest.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, though, for a lot of people in here,
like I said, I got you know, messages of
[SPEAKER_07]: people crying, you know, and I don't want
to be that guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was trying to explain.
[SPEAKER_07]: I, you know, here, this is the time I feel
like to talk about the easiest one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about the easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: That might even put it on a whole tier
level where these terpenes and these
[SPEAKER_07]: hashes get sold at a lower price because
they're, you know, super fricking easy to
[SPEAKER_07]: make.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, then there's these harder ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the lower is maybe that right now
there's demand market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking about like how we're
going to you know, be relevant in the
[SPEAKER_02]: market and being relevant in the market is
having diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a huge want for a specific
kind of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also like a really beautiful
niche market for, you know, hand rolled
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional hashish making.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that it's important that we
talk about both both entities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's sort of what we're talking
about here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And respect them both.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really a niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a world market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everybody smoke hash, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you live on the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoke hash and the same as for flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are making quality and I can even make
quality in quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like you have the genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the technology to make the best
hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the world, it's like all the people
that teach me that I lived in their farm
[SPEAKER_00]: for four months, years after year,
they all drooling on my hygiene,
[SPEAKER_00]: asking me to go back to teach them what I
did, which I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like you have that huge edge of if
you decide to produce only quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: you rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you decide to produce only quantity,
you will not be relevant in the next three
[SPEAKER_00]: years when world trade is coming because
the producing country for the moment,
[SPEAKER_00]: they know they can sell anything on the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's illegal, but they know what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really know that the next few,
the future of the market, it's making
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they want to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they want the new tool and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should be that next level that
define quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is country, a whole country that
could decide to produce only quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: France did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Italy is doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you can dedicate yourself only
to quality and have an edge because nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: cares enough to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this behind you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was something that came up at the
science of organic regenerative conference
[SPEAKER_03]: up in BC in January.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it was Marcus, bubble man,
who at scale is doing, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he had a technique, and I forget if it
was him or somebody else or if you all are
[SPEAKER_03]: in the audience, but just wanted to bring
it up because it's relevant.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had like a field test for plants where
it was like, hey, I'm going to put this in
[SPEAKER_03]: a jar with some, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you guys share that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think that's relevant to a lot
of what you're trying to share too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the jar tech is just like a little
thing on the side.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I was saying, I get people kind of
crying.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this is also, though, I want to
kind of like what you were finishing
[SPEAKER_07]: saying, though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just pure level of life with this
hash is really meaningful, I feel like.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have to get that statement across.
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, yeah, the jar tech,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just like you throw some fresh
frozen or nugs in a jar and shake it with
[SPEAKER_07]: ice water.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's pretty much like an ice water,
you know, little mini wash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can kind of see what sits at the
bottom of the jar, which is like great for
[SPEAKER_07]: field tests.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, so you can know whether or not you
should freeze that plant or not,
[SPEAKER_07]: because a lot of people, yeah,
kind of jump the gun and totally shoot
[SPEAKER_07]: themselves in the foot and lose a lot of
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like what you said, it's not the
amount of resin that is at the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when did the farmer harvest the
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you look at the resin head to
judge the flowering cycle of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowering cycle of the plant is the
main metabolism of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resin head are secondary metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant produces to protect itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with the main
metabolism of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of resin formed inside the
resin head is totally dependent on the
[SPEAKER_00]: peak of the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since you cannot look inside the resin
head to see how much resin there is,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not the color and it's not the size
that's going to tell you if your flower is
[SPEAKER_00]: ripe or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grow tomato or any other product,
you don't look at the secondary metabolic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you look at the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me as an ash maker, I really need
to have this resin head bursting like a
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit from a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be really, really full of juice
and sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a three days window for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is not that many people who give
me that three days window.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I work with a greenhouse,
everybody telling me, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: we harvest in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many harvest do you do a year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Five, six?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I work only with people who do four
because I cannot have a premature plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something I need to ask you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can literally tell you to the day how
early or how late you are harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two weeks early, you can have flowers
that taste at 28% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have had the greatest sugar trim
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a shitload of triconate,
tricon gland, but it's so light that you
[SPEAKER_00]: throw it in the air, it doesn't fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that you can have cannabinoid
and there is no resin that is still
[SPEAKER_00]: falling around inside the resin head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the closer you come to that three days
peak window, the more resin is inside that
[SPEAKER_00]: resin head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through washing my plant 12 times,
it's like a resin head is made like a
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an abscission under the gland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that abscission becomes smaller and
smaller and smaller, the riper the head
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it just fall when it's really
ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I learned that, my take is to get the
melt, I need to shake the tree just a tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, I have the ripest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I shake a tiny bit more,
I have a second dimension of ripeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I shake my tree 12 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my first shake, when I put it on the
resin head, there is no melt whatsoever,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are two weeks minimum, too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can, if I put that, if I use it to
press and my first sample ball is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it all together, there is no real crack,
but like the resin is not oozing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're seven, eight days too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on and so on until there is that
three days window where the 12 balls are
[SPEAKER_00]: just like bursting of resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They literally ooze resin, like the
shining that you see on my IG,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not me polishing the temple ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's resin literally oozing from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you pass that window,
my first or second temple ball,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna press, they're gonna make a
temple ball kind of shiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you open it, it doesn't have that
elasticity, that stretchy texture,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has kind of a moistiness to it,
I know that the plant has been harvested
[SPEAKER_00]: too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more temple ball I have that has
that texture, the later it has been
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question is, how can you have
cannabinoid formed inside a gland without
[SPEAKER_00]: having the resin that hold it in its body?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's a fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not been wrong in the past five
years on how early or how late the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: has been harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm quite sure that this is happening
in the resin gland, but I can't comprehend
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a hard time explaining to
people that it's happening in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with what you've described,
it's just cannabichromine seems to be
[SPEAKER_04]: different.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the life cycle of the plant where there
is CBC, it seems to have greater
[SPEAKER_04]: production earlier on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for ecological reasons that I can't
explain, it will shift to prefer other
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids, specifically CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if we've got a grad student out there
that needs a project, this is another one
[SPEAKER_04]: of those things that ought to be
investigated.
[SPEAKER_08]: For me,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I really want to have an impact,
I need to work with somebody that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: from my tribe, literally, a green rusher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm ready to work with people like
that, but as long as they go, they play my
[SPEAKER_00]: game.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the relation I have with you,
it's precious at the personal level,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at the business level, I'm 101%
dependent on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the trust I have, from you,
the quality you're giving me because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: me, it's something that is more precious
than money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for me to work with an entity
that is not gonna support that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if they don't, I'm fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very difficult on top of that to
be able to support you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to help you put your flowers on the
market, and I need to help you brand more
[SPEAKER_00]: than your brand, that people understand
where it come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first it's a region, first it's an
emerald triangle, and then there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: county, and then there is a farm into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't have extractor with a
brand name that use their brand to promote
[SPEAKER_00]: your farm and the genetic where it come
from, it's not good enough, literally,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we owe you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not happening in America because
it's not part of your culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's something that you should ask for
because it makes extract give more value
[SPEAKER_00]: to the end product, and co-promotion is
always better than single promotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because there is very few of you that
have a license on top of it, you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty strong edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the fire, and there is not so
many of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest is swag.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not that many people I can work
with to make decent ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any extractor that is in my position,
extractor or ash maker, is in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: position.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are very dependent on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We owe you credit, and that credit should
be shown on our fucking packaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be on the packaging on the
front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically speaking, my name shouldn't
fucking be on that box because there is no
[SPEAKER_00]: winemaker that put his name on the wine
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't fucking care.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: The value of their product, it's where it
come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not who made the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy who made the stuff as a preview
village to be the one that fucking blow
[SPEAKER_00]: you away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all we technically need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to give that pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The emphasis that we put on brand,
it's like you need to be able to work it
[SPEAKER_00]: on your outside using the people that are
buying from you and that need your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you want my stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I want my name on your box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you don't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you all say the same thing,
well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to put your name on the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you own that right big time.
In the conversation,
[SPEAKER_10]: and ownership, and we're talking about
heritage, and we're talking about source.
[SPEAKER_10]: And where does the heritage and the source
fit in with all of these genetics that
[SPEAKER_10]: none of which are from this country?
[SPEAKER_10]: And so when we're talking about heritage,
we're talking about source.
[SPEAKER_10]: What are we talking about?
[SPEAKER_10]: When we're talking about ownership of
this, what are we talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now you have heirloom.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to go into appropriation for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so are we appropriating?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because that genetic has been so long
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the same than where it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an heirloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you keep it longer, it will become
a land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that plant becomes a land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes the place where it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes a terroir.
[SPEAKER_10]: So are two generations or three
generations?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a couple hundred.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe 1,000.
[SPEAKER_06]: To make a land race?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, to make a land race.
I'll just throw in a number of times.
Absolutely.
So you would know.
It's easy to push the bug to see.
Does that qualify?
[SPEAKER_08]: My dad just told me how they actually made
it the first up from like Columbia,
[SPEAKER_08]: Mexico, when they got it here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was really quick, actually,
because they took the first pollen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they put it on the first indicator
pair.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that made some earlier sativa the next
year.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they did the first pollen on the
first.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then a couple generations,
they had seeds that were climatized and
[SPEAKER_08]: grown in the mountains of Minasino County.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess my question is, how do we
acknowledge the source?
[SPEAKER_10]: How do we acknowledge the history?
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you start asking the question,
what is the source?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how far back do we go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we go back 5,000 years just because
that was when it was written?
[SPEAKER_02]: But because before that, 5,000 years,
nobody wrote.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do we go back a couple billion years?
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd be here now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think we'd be here now and
appreciate what we have and what we've
[SPEAKER_02]: been given.
[SPEAKER_00]: Giving credit to the origin of the line 8
is super important because it gives
[SPEAKER_00]: awareness of land rest and the value of
this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for the moment, we go in Columbia
to grow shit, light debt, and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When nobody's trying to find the phenotype
and the beauty that there is in Columbia
[SPEAKER_00]: or every country, we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're squatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we do the same shit everywhere
we go, and there is no respect for the
[SPEAKER_00]: land rest and the genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least here, if we can show that we
created something and it became local,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there is a respect for the origin of
the plant, it would be a very good start
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's something we really need in
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beyond being ethical.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the basic acknowledgement of what
you made with what you received from this
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't change that you have created
beyond a dream, but if you give the
[SPEAKER_00]: awareness to the people that everything
you created, the source is coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: those people, then there is a more
cultural and world understanding on
[SPEAKER_00]: actually how it all interlocks and how it
has all developed and created what we have
[SPEAKER_00]: to offer now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a legal regime for what you're
talking about, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something called the Nagoya
Protocol for biodiversity, and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: remember the whole name for it,
but the goal was to preserve biodiversity
[SPEAKER_01]: and also to give credit and even
compensation to what could otherwise be
[SPEAKER_01]: seen as kind of a misappropriation of
indigenous plants, indigenous medicines,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it should come as no surprise
that the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: has not signed on to the Nagoya Protocol,
but in Europe, it's a really big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a new drug that came from the
Amazon rainforest or if you have some folk
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine that you've adapted and
commercialized, you have to demonstrate
[SPEAKER_01]: basically that it's not a violation of the
Nagoya Protocol.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know quite a bit about the Nagoya
Protocol.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are proudly the only genetics company
that abides by the Nagoya Protocol,
[SPEAKER_09]: and this includes everything from our
Ginkgo test.
[SPEAKER_09]: When we do a test to ID Ginkgo,
we have to give money back from the
[SPEAKER_09]: profits of that test to China,
because China is where Ginkgo comes from.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you have a more cosmopolitan plant
like cannabis, there is no one country
[SPEAKER_09]: that brings ownership, and this happens
with a lot of our really important
[SPEAKER_09]: medicinals, because what do you take with
you when you move?
[SPEAKER_09]: Your food and your medicine, and this has
happened forever.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, read Ethan Rousseau's paper on
some of the evolutionary history of
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis that we can extract from
archaeological things, and you see this is
[SPEAKER_09]: a plant that's moved rapidly with us and
has changed dramatically to its
[SPEAKER_09]: environment.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sitting in the lens of genetics,
so many of our plants that we use are so
[SPEAKER_09]: evolutionary admixt that it would be hard
to really place them in any one region,
[SPEAKER_09]: because we don't keep our Mexican land
race breeding in one little pocket,
[SPEAKER_09]: and our plants are in Northern India in
another pocket.
[SPEAKER_09]: We introduce those plants to each other,
so it becomes very different in this
[SPEAKER_09]: environment, but there is history there,
and the truth is we don't have enough data
[SPEAKER_09]: to even understand that, because we don't
have global populations that we can pull
[SPEAKER_09]: from, and you need those original global,
and you can still do that work,
[SPEAKER_09]: but it's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a legal framework, and these are
the kind of questions we get out of.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is like our PhD, and where does this
stuff come from?
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have the resources to really even
answer those questions with the plants
[SPEAKER_09]: that we hear in this culture interact
with, because we have to reference to
[SPEAKER_09]: something pure.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to go to the source, and look at a
lot of plants in those places to
[SPEAKER_09]: understand, okay, these are the alleles,
these are the virgins of these genes that
[SPEAKER_09]: come from this place relative to this
other place.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a lot of, let's figure it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know a lot of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we can go in really further,
and I don't want to brush off basically
[SPEAKER_02]: what Tina is saying, because I think that
it's a really important point in a
[SPEAKER_02]: decision on where we want to go as far as
ethics of breeding, and whether we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be public domain, or whether
we're going to keep it to our own domain,
[SPEAKER_02]: or what we're going to do on that level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a really important point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a really important point.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
