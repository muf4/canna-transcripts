[SPEAKER_07]: other stuff that's much more artistic.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that was kind of the beginning for a
lot of people I knew, especially the guys
[SPEAKER_07]: that came out of Sawgrass Shop back in,
you know, 93, 94.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I wish I could say I had such an
artistic beginning, but far from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more, how do I disrupt the whole
world with a gravity bomb?
[SPEAKER_03]: Turns out not everybody wants to smoke out
of a gravity bomb, but it still does
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still sell a lot of Gravitrons.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does well, surprisingly well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's still like a good four or
five percent of the catalog, five percent
[SPEAKER_03]: of sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's an outlier, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The gravity bomb or the Gravitron and the
spoon are the major outliers for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's been a long journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's 420 Science, Sarah?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_07]: So guys, in just a minute, I don't know if
you know Future Canvas Project,
[SPEAKER_07]: but Peter Severi is going to try to come
in.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's going to live audio this thing into
Future Canvas Project for YouTube Live.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Dave, I think we're probably expecting
one or two others that might pop in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, if you and Sarah see folks in the
industry that you guys want to pull up on
[SPEAKER_07]: stage as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, as you know, I try to do a
Sunday night show.
[SPEAKER_07]: I try to find a different topic every
week, and I try to dig into it with people
[SPEAKER_07]: that understand that part of the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've covered everything from policy
and legislation to horticultural lighting
[SPEAKER_07]: to Canvas investing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So every week we just dig into a different
part.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes it gets super nerdy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like last week we did, you know,
IP and trademarks.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this week we figured we'd make it a
little bit more light and bring in some
[SPEAKER_07]: people that have been working in the glass
industry for a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, for me, it's part of,
you know, part of how I got my start in
[SPEAKER_07]: the industry back in like 1993,
I guess, when I really started carrying
[SPEAKER_07]: around gun cases on Dead Tour with a bunch
of glass and starting to work with guys
[SPEAKER_07]: like Jason Harrison, with Bob Snodgrass
and Bob Batram and Cameron and a whole
[SPEAKER_07]: bunch of other early kind of guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: That, you know, really for me was a really
fun way to go around and make some money
[SPEAKER_07]: in the lot and at the same time,
you know, be able to collect pieces along
[SPEAKER_07]: the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: So over the last couple of years,
you and I have gotten to know each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you've got one of the coolest glass
companies out there with Grav.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sarah, you and I unfortunately have not
met.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard a lot about you and heard great
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm really excited to have you on this
panel tonight.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as I said, as other people,
you know, come in, we're certainly going
[SPEAKER_07]: to invite some people up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Dave, you know, how did you get
started in glass?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, can I give me some roots,
especially as you come out of Texas,
[SPEAKER_07]: which isn't exactly what people think of
as, you know, kind of like a hotbed of
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I know that's changing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, how did you get your start
in the industry and how did you get
[SPEAKER_07]: involved in the glass industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first of all, thanks for having us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've really enjoyed this Ask Me
Anything session that you do on Sundays.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I highly encourage everyone to spread
the word.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fantastic every week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I came up as I just I really just wanted
to make a gravity bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was it was just kind of an
experiment of, you know, can I make
[SPEAKER_03]: something that is, you know, that,
you know, that is market viable in market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the time, the only gravity bong
that was out there was the G bub.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know who ended up like
producing those.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they were coming out of Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't remember who what shop was
doing it, but the original designer was
[SPEAKER_03]: Ham, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And but it was a three hundred dollar bong
sized gravity bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really cleverly designed,
but it was just too expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I set out to make a commercially
viable, accessible, all glass gravity
[SPEAKER_03]: bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a really long story.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, flash flashing forward,
it took me a few months to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: to figure out that the best way to do it
was to get a vase from Michael's and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, cut the bottom off of a wine
bottle and then put a grommet and a 12
[SPEAKER_03]: millimeter downstem with a nine millimeter
bowl into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then flash forward to, you know,
now making these and selling them in
[SPEAKER_03]: Austin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to figure out how to make those
bowls cheaper.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the downstem in the bowl ended up being
the biggest cause cost of my assembly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and so I met Freddie, which is home
blown glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah, what's Fred's last name?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Fred Schorsch, I believe this is his last
name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's Freddie from home blown.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Freddie.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just Freddie.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Freddie's been around since,
you know, the snag rise days for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Freddie's been making he was just he
was kind of at the time just a a bowl
[SPEAKER_03]: shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was making just gorgeous glass slides.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like nine millimeter, 12 millimeter
slides that out of a shop in Arizona,
[SPEAKER_03]: Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and so I would just take all of his
rejects.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would sell me all his rejects for 50
cents.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and so I would, you know, I would
marching around Austin, selling them kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of it, you know, in shops around town and
then also at like ACL Fest, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and then Freddie said, hey,
you really you really should come to the
[SPEAKER_03]: champs trade show, which is, you know,
the apparently the biggest trade show for
[SPEAKER_03]: bongs that there was in 2005.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and so I show up with a 12 with 12
gravitrons and a banner and the and that
[SPEAKER_03]: was it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I literally had had a notebook,
like a little like spiral notebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I sat down at a table, put my banner,
duct tape my banner to the front of the
[SPEAKER_03]: table off in the corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: The table cost me five hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and I put my bongs out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure enough, people start coming up
and saying, OK, I like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll place an order.
[SPEAKER_03]: At which case I go, OK, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they say, OK, do you want to write it
down?
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, I just I had no idea what
to expect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it turns out the champ show
and Freddie really kind of like open the
[SPEAKER_03]: door to at that trade show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I on boarded like 300 head shops and came
home that summer realizing, oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: shit, I'm going to have to figure this
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so, yeah, I had I had a product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flash forward a few more years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like I had eight hundred stores
that I was servicing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I should say that I met Matt and Gary,
also afford for 20 Science at that first
[SPEAKER_03]: trade show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we became fast friends and worked
together really ever since.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, flashing forward a few more
years, you know, I realized that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the world I wasn't going to
disrupt the entire cannabis industry with
[SPEAKER_03]: a gravity bomb, even though I still stand
by my word that it's the most efficient
[SPEAKER_03]: way to consume flour, smokable flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: But despite that, people want variety of
consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I set out to make a whole bunch of
different skews.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we sell about 300 different top
line pipes, mostly glass pipes,
[SPEAKER_03]: only a couple of vape vape skews.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Super cool to hear kind of the progression
of just how a route started and just,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, how progression is allowed you
just to build a massive company that's got
[SPEAKER_07]: now 300 skews.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sarah, how about you?
[SPEAKER_07]: How did you get started and where are you
right now in the process?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to hear more about your story.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I started working at 420 Science in
2007 because I needed a job.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was an interior designer in Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the housing market was crashing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I knew Matt and Gary.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really good friends with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And their founding story is very similar
to Dave and involves Freddie telling them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, actually, Gary worked at this place
that did like printing and was,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, used to print these pint glasses
for Freddie's home brew that he always
[SPEAKER_04]: brought to the champs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Gary was like, oh, you should put this
logo on these little stash jars and sell
[SPEAKER_04]: them, you know, as stash jars for your
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Freddie was like, no, but you could do
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's what they did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it took off and flash forward a couple
of years to when I needed a job,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like the second person they hired.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I started out just doing like data
entry, you know, bookkeeping.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I started answering the phones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was like pretty good at sales.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of how I came up in the
company all the way up to MR Visionary
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been with them a really long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gone through lots of different
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: We went from selling stash jars to what
was our first thing we added?
[SPEAKER_04]: The 420 scope.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then ResBlock, which is a resin
preventer for water pipes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And back in 2013, we were like,
OK, it kind of feels safe enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll put some pipes up and see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been growing really fast since
then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Jason.
[SPEAKER_09]: Aloha.
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a horrible connection.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in Utah in the mountains right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason, I've got the same problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually in South Lake Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're sounding OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can actually hear you all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And believe it or not, it's probably the
first time you and I have spoken over 20
[SPEAKER_07]: years.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was one of your first accounts,
I think, back in 1997 or 98 from Utah when
[SPEAKER_07]: I lived in Salt Lake City, Utah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when Dave and I were trying to put this
room together, I said, I'd love to get
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason Harrison here.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't think I've spoken to you
probably since, you know, right around
[SPEAKER_07]: 2000.
[SPEAKER_07]: So nice to see you again or hear you
again.
[SPEAKER_07]: And thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I appreciate the invite so much,
bro, for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm down in Eagle Point, Utah right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, it's really, really powder
steep and deep all day long.
[SPEAKER_09]: So much fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, hey, Dave and Sarah is going through
and giving us their other background.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I'd love to hear yours,
because obviously you go back a bit
[SPEAKER_07]: deeper.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're one of the first guys I
knew that had a lathe and the first person
[SPEAKER_07]: I was putting out production tubes back,
I want to say, starting in like 1996,
[SPEAKER_07]: 97.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I'd love to hear,
you know, kind of where you started and
[SPEAKER_07]: what's happened since.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, you know, you know where I
started, you know, it's kind of a grateful
[SPEAKER_09]: deadlock.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's been a wild ride, bro,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm into the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how I do my artwork.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's, you know, it's grown
exponentially over the years.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, you know, in our heyday between
99 and 2003, we were doing four million a
[SPEAKER_09]: year in sales and 70 employees.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was pretty big and sturdy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then now, you know, I'm in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in the arts district.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a really cool studio and,
you know, it's a small family operation
[SPEAKER_09]: now.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not some megalith, you know,
corporate thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, it's where I've come from
and where I'm at now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hope that anybody coming to Vegas
stops by the studio and I'll give you a
[SPEAKER_09]: personal tour.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it's it's a really cool zone and
it's a real creative zone and happy to be
[SPEAKER_09]: kind of pumping artwork into the general
public.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's that's the game here is
making people happy.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you first started, who taught you?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know back then it was like,
you know, Snodgrass Shop was pretty much
[SPEAKER_07]: the only game in town in the early years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was just saying before you jumped on
that, like, for me, when I had,
[SPEAKER_07]: like, you know, Cameron and Bob Atram and
like Don Paul, Dave, Dave Willis,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, like, teaching me, like,
you know, giving me a lot of pieces to
[SPEAKER_07]: bring out on tour.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are the guys I looked as kind of
like the grandfathers or godfathers of the
[SPEAKER_07]: industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know you came out right around that
same time, like from the same kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: crew.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, what gave you that start and,
you know, who first taught you how to blow
[SPEAKER_07]: before you even got your first laid?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, you know, just some of the
names that you mentioned are some some
[SPEAKER_09]: people that I definitely are very good,
you know, my peers and people that I've
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been, you know, in their circles
since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, it was when I remember Bob
Atram before he was blowing glass,
[SPEAKER_09]: neighbor Bob, you know, I remember Dave
Willis before he started blowing glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then he, you know, he started learning
with Bob.
[SPEAKER_09]: For me, and Dave went on now, he's one of
the on the board of the Glass Art Society.
[SPEAKER_07]: So incredible, incredible, amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Incredible talents come out of all this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where I started, I was an art major at the
U of O.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I met Bob on Grateful Dead Tour
earlier and ended up going over to his
[SPEAKER_09]: house in maybe 91.
[SPEAKER_09]: And just watching what was going on,
the whole family scene over there,
[SPEAKER_09]: Bob himself.
[SPEAKER_09]: Was a guru of an individual, you know,
really enlightening, inspirational.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was he's what a wizard would be,
you know, in the old days.
[SPEAKER_09]: He is that now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm blessed enough to have,
you know, experienced his greatness and
[SPEAKER_09]: been in his, you know, in his circle.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm number seven in Bob's lineage of
teaching people.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was just happened to be there on the
right day, right time and got inspired
[SPEAKER_09]: from him.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was more about it was more about
creating something that seemed to change
[SPEAKER_09]: color.
[SPEAKER_09]: The more you used it, it was something
that that enlightened people.
[SPEAKER_09]: They would smoke this thing and they would
get high and make cool decisions and,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, make make positive change in the
world.
[SPEAKER_09]: And being part of that is what I wanted to
be.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I mean, this is the coolest shit
I ever seen.
[SPEAKER_09]: These dreadlock guys with these fat Bob
Snodgrass pipes that, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: respected this guy so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that's that that was what I
wanted, you know, for a lack of a family
[SPEAKER_09]: or a tribalism or or, you know,
religious or something like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: My life, that's what that's what filled
that vacuum for me being part of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I remember for me, like one of the
happiest days of my life is when Marie
[SPEAKER_07]: looked me over and decided she's going to
give me an account.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was the time I was like,
sweet, like, all right, I'm in Snodgrass
[SPEAKER_07]: shops, you know, allow me to take their
glass out on tour and allow me to to start
[SPEAKER_07]: selling pieces.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then obviously, I was very good
friends with Jen Bestola and Jen was
[SPEAKER_07]: dating Cameron at the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Cameron took a liking as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was just a really lucky,
you know, sort of happenstance for me
[SPEAKER_07]: around like 1994.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, Cameron, Cameron,
Cameron taught me my first how to make my
[SPEAKER_09]: first bong.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that changed my world.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, my my my history and being
part of this pipe thing is so,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, fulfilled and so, you know,
just cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm so blessed to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so now the now in this whole pipe,
we call it a piper movement, or at least
[SPEAKER_09]: that's what I call it, you know,
similar to an abstraction art or or or
[SPEAKER_09]: realist or something like this.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a this is an actual art movement
that's going on that we've been part of.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now what we're doing is we are
bringing light to the fact that this is
[SPEAKER_09]: this stuff that we make is art and it
holds a value.
[SPEAKER_09]: The problem with what we make is that when
we make it, it sells so quickly and it
[SPEAKER_09]: goes into the stoner circle.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sometimes it breaks these invaluable
pieces don't get to be seen and shared
[SPEAKER_09]: like like like we need them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so right now, it's about bringing eyes
on the art movement and creating a value
[SPEAKER_09]: that that is is is well deserved.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so to do that, you know, we have to
document the pieces, whether it's be a
[SPEAKER_09]: picture or whether it be in video.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so to do that now, we have made a TV
show.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's about to come out to the world in
the next couple of months.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's called Operation Pipe Dreamers.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a six episode series, 12 pipe
makers, the best in the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: We brought him out to Vegas and we've had
a show down and we did three on three on
[SPEAKER_09]: three.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we and the winner of each of those
four heats went on to a finals.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the winner of the finals took home ten
thousand dollars in cash and a custom
[SPEAKER_09]: Operation Pipe Dreamers leather jacket.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can follow our exploits at the
moment on Operation Pipe Dreamers on
[SPEAKER_09]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Dave, you made reference to champs
earlier, you know, get all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dave, when you when you made reference to
champs earlier, for me, that was the first
[SPEAKER_07]: time that someone like came up with a
trade show that that was truly just about
[SPEAKER_07]: the glass industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the first time you attended
champs and kind of like what was your
[SPEAKER_07]: first thoughts when you when you went were
you there for one of the earliest ones and
[SPEAKER_07]: have you watched it progress?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first of all, I want to say that
Jason has been an absolute inspiration to
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of people in the industry and myself
included.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, at even early on, I read and I
recognize the importance of branding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that, you know, underrated JVD
is like really the first brand in pipes.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people don't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you you made you made a lot of art
and it's beautiful stuff, but you built a
[SPEAKER_03]: brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like there was just like we don't
know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I know it's like it's very cliche
these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like everybody's building a brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, this is something I talk a
lot a lot about in cannabis period is that
[SPEAKER_03]: like we are the there are lots of people
with lots of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're coming in and building a cannabis
brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, there were cannabis brands
before cannabis became legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is, you know, and you were
really like, I think that's the most
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing flag you can put in the ground to
say I was the first real cannabis brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, that's my my my biggest pitch
is that is that I spent a lot of time in
[SPEAKER_09]: Holland in the very beginning of all this
in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_09]: I blew glass on the on the, you know,
varmint over there for a while.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I came back and and in ninety five is
when I actually incorporated the business.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, at those times I was getting
flown around by the guys back in the East
[SPEAKER_09]: Coast holding the diesel, that whole
diesel crew, the chem dog guys,
[SPEAKER_09]: all them, they would fly me back and pay
me per gram, ten dollars a gram for my
[SPEAKER_09]: glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that right there was it's my street
cred.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's saying, you know, look, that's an
example of any of the biggest guys in the
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was dealing with them all throughout.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now they're all owners of fucking
grows and dispensaries and licensed up and
[SPEAKER_09]: driving the Lambos.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really cool to see.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so for me, I'm network.
[SPEAKER_09]: My networks go so deep and so vast through
this whole path that I've taken that I'm
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm exploiting that by going up to Humble,
getting the boys to fill up the jars with
[SPEAKER_09]: fire resin.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm selling it in California.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Jerome Baker's Cannabis Collection.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll be in Sacramento this weekend at let
me see where I'm going to be.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to be at a dispensary blowing
glass and I'm going to be doing that all
[SPEAKER_09]: summer long.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to you know, I have on my
Instagram, my tour schedule as I go.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's again, it's I'm doing koalas on
Bloomfield Street in Sacramento this
[SPEAKER_09]: weekend on Saturday.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do on April 20th.
[SPEAKER_09]: Grass grass city.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the 24th in Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_09]: And just after that, I'm going to do ready
or the 27th this month.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do ready.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going on the road, showing off the
brand, blowing glass in front of the
[SPEAKER_09]: dispensaries and giving away tons of glass
to the to the people that make a
[SPEAKER_09]: difference.
[SPEAKER_09]: The fans, the connoisseurs, the bud
tenders, the shot colors.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I'm trying I'm trying to,
you know, show that, hey, look,
[SPEAKER_09]: this is like a Jack Daniels of the space.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a name that, you know, I got
arrested for, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: I've done I've done my time and I feel
like I try to try to make a positive
[SPEAKER_09]: impact with whatever we're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, it's just about karma,
bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just trying to keep things straight.
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of people, like when they first deal
with me, they're like, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, and I'm like, you know,
dude, you can call anybody in the fucking
[SPEAKER_09]: whole bit in space and see if I've ripped
them off or if I've fucked them or
[SPEAKER_09]: whatever, you know.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I couldn't have gotten here for 30
years right now by by by doing those kind
[SPEAKER_09]: of things in this in the space.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I feel like I've done the time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've stayed the course.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now it's time that we all kind of
unite.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we have such power amongst us.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's so many of us, you know,
from 420 science to the different,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, people growing to the different
laboratories.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have such an industry here that we
need to kind of unite and have some some
[SPEAKER_09]: heads and and get get get business done
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, hey, you just I mean, you open the
door a little bit on this, Jason.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, obviously, I don't think a lot of
people out there in the audience were live
[SPEAKER_07]: streaming as well tonight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Onto onto YouTube live with Future Canvas
Project.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there'll be thousands of people that,
you know, are kind of listening to the
[SPEAKER_07]: next cool days.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's a lot of people that have no
idea what happened with Operation Pipe
[SPEAKER_07]: Dreams and and just like how detrimental
that was to the early days of the glass
[SPEAKER_07]: industry and just kind of how many people
got caught up in it, whether it was you or
[SPEAKER_07]: whether it was Shay from Seedless or
whether it was Tommy Chong.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, can you give just a quick
description if you don't if you don't want
[SPEAKER_07]: to talk about it till they understand.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're really going through what
happened and what kind of a bullshit deal
[SPEAKER_07]: the other side's put down on people in the
glass industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you know, I love talking about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's it's it's my voice to what's what's
giving me a voice in the modern cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: flow right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, you know, when I was like I told
you, I was doing four million a year in
[SPEAKER_09]: 99.
[SPEAKER_09]: And by 2003, you know, we were cranking.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in 2003, it was February 23rd.
[SPEAKER_09]: The we got arrested.
[SPEAKER_09]: They came to my house.
[SPEAKER_09]: They, you know, tied me up.
[SPEAKER_09]: They they, you know, they it was the DEA,
the Postal Service, the Secret Service.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, all kinds of weird, you know,
investigational people were on this thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the end, you know, I went to jail
there in Eugene, Oregon, and I was looking
[SPEAKER_09]: at the jail.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was looking at the TV through the
chicken wire in the jail cell.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I seen John Ashcroft on TV talking
about that he got, you know, the biggest
[SPEAKER_09]: paraphernalia dealers in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that was my, you know, sign that
this is something much bigger than just
[SPEAKER_09]: them arresting me for manufacturing drug
paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was called Operation Pike Dreams.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a two year investigation on 55 of
us.
[SPEAKER_09]: We all got arrested.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Tommy Chong was one of the 55.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's the only one that did the whole year
in prison.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was because, you know,
he has a voice in, you know, today's
[SPEAKER_09]: modern ET or, you know, E Entertainment
Society.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they didn't really want to make to make
an example of us.
[SPEAKER_09]: They use the justice system to make a
political statement.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now, you know, they took my Jerome
Baker dot com website away from me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now years later, I've bought it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Back in an auction.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have my my my domain that was seized
by the feds.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have that back.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have, you know, they told me I'm
never allowed to make bongs again.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I made the largest bong in the world
last year in 2018.
[SPEAKER_09]: Twenty four feet tall glass bong with an
elevator to the top of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, and this is my big fuck you to
the whole scene of the whole telling me I
[SPEAKER_09]: can't make art the way I want to make art.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it comes down to is are the pieces
that we're making our our devices and
[SPEAKER_09]: these devices are actually changing the
fundamental thought and character of
[SPEAKER_09]: society right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, just think if we legalize this in
Russia, where are we all at?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: And so so my plight, my my my vision is
that we are part of this legalization
[SPEAKER_09]: movement.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something that we all dreamed about
in high school.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we are the changers.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are the makers right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we can fucking do this,
we're going to change the whole world in a
[SPEAKER_09]: really positive way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, stop the stop the wars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who else was there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Who else went down in my dreams?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know it was, you know,
Chang was the Chang gongs and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, fifty five north.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who else was there?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was Shea from Seedless.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shea from Seedless is a main, you know,
main player there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you had one north.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shea was caught up, too, wasn't he?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, Chris, Chris slid through that one.
[SPEAKER_09]: My partner at the time was Saeed Matadi.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was the only non owner of all the
businesses that got arrested.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he was one of the fifty five.
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's a lot of them there.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can look up Operation Pipe Dreamers on
Wikipedia.
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, we're coming out with a TV show
that's going to tell you this story.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to drop it on you all.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to drop it on,
you know, everyday society that,
[SPEAKER_09]: hey, we're making pipes.
[SPEAKER_09]: These fucking things take a long time to
make.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's more to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there's a back story.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our TV show is different than all the
others in that it builds the character.
[SPEAKER_09]: All these 12 people that we brought to the
space were very carefully picked.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had, you know, a very we wanted to
represent our Piper movement the right
[SPEAKER_09]: way.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we're really proud to, you know,
to show this thing off.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is going to answer a lot of the
general public's questions about,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, what's going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do want to tell you all that not
only is it still illegal, the same exact
[SPEAKER_09]: fucking laws are in place right now where
they can come arrest me for doing the same
[SPEAKER_09]: shit that also cannabis is illegal on a
federal level.
[SPEAKER_09]: They can be arrest anybody they want if
they wanted to, including us for over here
[SPEAKER_09]: consciously, you know, you know,
making plans and figuring out how to do
[SPEAKER_09]: illegal shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the quicker we can all realize that
we're just still operating as gangsters,
[SPEAKER_09]: the quicker we can bring this thing to
light and get this thing in the banks.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we can all kind of, you know,
get the reward of this whole life that
[SPEAKER_09]: we've done and worked so hard for.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's time.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's really interesting that
you talked about kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: who got caught up in this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking back to that Chinese
proverb of, you know, you never know what
[SPEAKER_07]: good news or bad news is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Bill Murray talks about in the Bill
Murray stories that, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: someone like gets hurt and all of a
sudden, you know, it's terrible.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it turns out then because they are
hurt, they didn't go somewhere where they
[SPEAKER_07]: would have gotten caught in a fire or
whatever the other story is.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, from the perspective of
Tommy Chong, you know, I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: people forget that he ended up spending
the whole year.
[SPEAKER_07]: But he also got Jordan Belfort as a
cellmate, which ended up being the
[SPEAKER_07]: catalyst to bring us the Wolf of Wall
Street and all the other things that
[SPEAKER_07]: followed from that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, it's somewhat hilarious that
Tommy ended up being the catalyst for,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, another just terrific story
coming out of this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: A thousand percent, a thousand percent.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really on board with you on that
making lemonade from lemons.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this story of mine and bringing that
positivity out of the negativity is told
[SPEAKER_09]: in a movie that we did with Leafley.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Leafley, the, you know, the weed app,
they do a Leafley.tv and we did a movie on
[SPEAKER_09]: there called Redemption Bong.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it tells the story of the arrests and
the hardships.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it tells also the story of what
positive can come out of it and how to be
[SPEAKER_09]: positive.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think everybody, especially in this
time, needs to make sure that they,
[SPEAKER_09]: if they're not good at thinking positive,
you know, try to and try to help your
[SPEAKER_09]: friends and try to help others just be,
you know, be positive in this time.
[SPEAKER_09]: This time that we're in, we're going to
get through it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what I'm pitching in this
Operation Pipe Dreamers is everybody,
[SPEAKER_09]: if you don't know how to, you can blow
glass at home and make marbles and beads
[SPEAKER_09]: and be successful and make money and feel
good about yourself.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, we are able to bring that
light and use our voice same as any other
[SPEAKER_09]: celebrity or rock star or whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can choose to use your status and
create positive change.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, if those around you that
you surround yourself with are doing that,
[SPEAKER_09]: it makes it easier for you too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Jason, I really appreciate the
work you've done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, definitely Trailblazer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've talked about this a lot in,
you know, throughout my career,
[SPEAKER_03]: whenever I get the chance to talk to the
art, the more artistic side of this
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the frustrating part for me
as someone who has collected pipe over the
[SPEAKER_03]: years is that we can't, we're not going to
build a real art, you know, a real art
[SPEAKER_03]: category until someone builds a legitimate
secondary market for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, yeah, it's easy for me to
just, you know, sit on the sidelines and
[SPEAKER_03]: say someone should do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as much as I would love to go build
the secondary market, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're not, we're just not going to build
value in the category without that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I just think it's an
interesting topic that has been missing
[SPEAKER_03]: from functional, you know, pipe art the
entire time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there is a secondary market being,
you know, throttling right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that there's just a lot of
momentum in it right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that we're going to be all
good, clear.
[SPEAKER_09]: The pieces, you know, we're selling pieces
for 50 and 100,000 and they're pipes and
[SPEAKER_09]: bongs and people are interested in them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm working with Tommy right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're doing a piece that he wants to sell
for over a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're loading it with stones and
crystals.
[SPEAKER_09]: And gold and, you know, we're going to put
some holy water in and hopefully talk Elon
[SPEAKER_09]: into buying it and send it to fucking
space and even put some more light on this
[SPEAKER_09]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I, when I was talking about the
secondary market, really what I mean is
[SPEAKER_03]: that, is that people need to be like
collectors need a platform to sell their
[SPEAKER_03]: pipes and there needs to be a third party.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you need the same similar
platforms typically will appraise these
[SPEAKER_03]: pieces, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of like the robust secondary
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was hoping that Lucan Salt would be
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, he had another,
he had, he couldn't make it, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is something that he's invested in
glass grab, you know, needs some work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a decent app, but you know,
it kind of fulfills some of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I just wanted to be clear
about what, what would actually like allow
[SPEAKER_03]: these pipes to actually appreciate and
value.
[SPEAKER_09]: Truly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, one of the things that helps us
right now is, you know, some of the big
[SPEAKER_09]: players in the, in the artistic scene have
to embrace what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so to do that, we're, you know,
this TV stuff that's going on.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys also all saw the show blown away
that just came out.
[SPEAKER_09]: That brings light on the glass itself.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now with our show coming out,
we are involving the Pilschuk Glass
[SPEAKER_09]: School, which is an incredible resource
for all glass artists.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're also involving the Corning Museum of
Glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: They've taken in their first pipe about a
year and a half ago into the museum
[SPEAKER_09]: collection.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that brings legitimacy.
[SPEAKER_09]: To what we're doing by involving them in a
TV show now that we're doing, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: and we're going to give a residency to one
of the artists and just, just bringing
[SPEAKER_09]: light from those giant collectors and the
bigger eyes on, on just, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: that, that kind of a thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that we need to morph it and there
needs to be people that, that bring these
[SPEAKER_09]: two worlds together.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is part of what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's all about creating value in the
space.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, that one bong that I make
that goes to one dude and he breaks it in
[SPEAKER_09]: the fire or whatever, then it never gets
seen.
[SPEAKER_09]: So some of these pieces need to,
need to be, you know, legacy and
[SPEAKER_09]: documented and things like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how we're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why we're doing so much video and
photo and stuff like that of all the
[SPEAKER_09]: pieces coming out, because it documents
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It brings historical value to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're just too early for that
idea, Dave.
[SPEAKER_04]: Story of my life.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, Dave, coming into glass,
like right after a operational pipe
[SPEAKER_07]: dreams, you weren't too far behind that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got to ask, were you either a
masochist or did you just basically look
[SPEAKER_07]: at saying, there's no way they're holding
this thing down.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no way we're going to stop the
other progression that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And artists should never be punished.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I know you've come out from a
little bit different perspective as far
[SPEAKER_07]: as, you know, creating grab as a brand and
creating something that isn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_07]: hand blown, but you know, bringing glass
to the masses.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, what was your catalyst to say,
okay, like I've heard the stories.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still getting involved in this and no
one can tell me what to do with
[SPEAKER_07]: paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, it's, it was oh four.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get into this actually until
April of oh four.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I was just, it was 24th
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't really know any better.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more of a, Hey, you know,
I'm nobody.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you're the size that Jason
was at the time, then, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're, you're going to get noticed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew I could fly under the radar long
enough to not matter to anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but of course I called the,
you know, the, you know, the, the lawyers
[SPEAKER_03]: that were prosecuted or defending
paraphernalia cases across the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the advice was,
you know, find another job.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, it's, it was illegal,
you know, technically today, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: just, you know, for everyone's
edification, you know, the federal
[SPEAKER_03]: paraphernalia act has a, has an exemption
for state states that have, that have
[SPEAKER_03]: legalized the substance associated with
paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So technically in California and Colorado
and Washington and all, all of the legal
[SPEAKER_03]: markets, including the medical markets,
a bong is legal, federally legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, they, in fact, they're with
you on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to argue with you on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in this, in this scenario right now,
I haven't seen anything came from any,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, federal laws that, that,
that are any different than the ones that
[SPEAKER_09]: were incorporated in 1991 by federal judge
William Rehnquist designating that,
[SPEAKER_09]: that what we make is a bong and that it's
only to be used for cannabis consumption.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even though it is legal in these states,
it's not on a federal level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I would, in section, in section E
of, in section E of that law, it
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically says that there is an
exemption for states that legalize the
[SPEAKER_03]: substance associated with a paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we challenged that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I mean, I'm more than interested
in understanding it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and also, I mean, just FYI,
I have a license to create cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_09]: They actually call it drug paraphernalia
in the city of Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have a license to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what I'm being told at the moment is
the feds trump everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I haven't seen, you know, any kind of
federal, anything that's that,
[SPEAKER_09]: that, that allows cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it does, that means that we can go
to the bank with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Currently, I just got shut off of PayPal
the other day before, about a week before
[SPEAKER_09]: that they shut me off of Shopify for the
17th time for selling glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: CBD is allowed to be sold, but glass is
not.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I mean, I'm pretty up on the
laws right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd love to talk in another scenario where
you can kind of get me updated on what you
[SPEAKER_09]: know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know there's a couple of specialty
lawyers out there that deal in the
[SPEAKER_09]: paraphernalia scenario.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, just be aware, you know,
I got arrested on a federal rap and it's
[SPEAKER_09]: nothing of that law that I know has
changed yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd love to understand if there has
been change.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be clear, there's no in the clear here,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm not like, let's all go make
bongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the, but the fact is that there,
you know, there is a little bit of light
[SPEAKER_03]: in the tunnel, but it doesn't change the
fact that like these, these laws,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the fact that there is a
paraphernalia law in the books is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be a long, like there, there, there will
be federally, you know, de-scheduled or
[SPEAKER_03]: decriminalized cannabis before that
paraphernalia law, you know, gets,
[SPEAKER_03]: gets, you know, falls off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and so I mean, yeah, that's,
that's kind of a fight that I've been
[SPEAKER_03]: fighting since 2010 when NCIA was created.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we started drafting the
amendment 64 in Colorado, because it was
[SPEAKER_03]: really important to get the, the language
into the law that explicitly says that
[SPEAKER_03]: paraphernalia in this state is legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if it didn't say that,
then federally the, you know, they'd be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to continue to, to go after
paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and since then,
you know, most states, 90% of them that
[SPEAKER_03]: have published laws have, have followed
suit and added a paraphernalia,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, piece of paraphernalia language
in there because of that work that NCIA
[SPEAKER_03]: did back in 2010.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, believe me, I, I always think,
think of myself as that frog that,
[SPEAKER_09]: that, you know, I'm standing on the frying
pan and, you know, just wondering when
[SPEAKER_09]: it's going to burn me basically.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I mean, even to this day,
like I said, I'm still getting shut down
[SPEAKER_09]: left and right.
[SPEAKER_09]: For selling bongs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, you know, it's just about right
now about navigating the space and staying
[SPEAKER_09]: positive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's the absurdity of some of
these laws are still in the books is
[SPEAKER_07]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, as someone that came out of the
hydro industry for quite a few years,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, I deal with the same things you
guys deal with where for years it was
[SPEAKER_07]: like, you know, it's on a bond.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a water pipe.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, anyone that came into my stores
for a long time, the mantra was,
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no, we're here for tomatoes and
peppers.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we're not here for canvas
growing, which obviously is just,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, completely fictitious.
[SPEAKER_09]: The word bong, you know, we think now,
Oh, we're all good, you know, and we can
[SPEAKER_09]: say it now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've thought that for the past 12
years, I've been full throttle,
[SPEAKER_09]: hashtagging the word bong, cannabis,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now what I've realized is that,
what I've realized is that I had to go
[SPEAKER_09]: back recently and scrub every single post
I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_09]: Scrub every single invoice I'm writing on
my QuickBooks programs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Scrub it all.
[SPEAKER_09]: And change my word around the tube,
not put the word pipe in everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then Dave, I'm sure you're pretty
versed in all this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your business, I mean, swamps mine.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure your volume of sales are much
higher than mine on a yearly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I know that you, you know,
you have, you know, knowledge of this
[SPEAKER_09]: space, but my, you know, I thought I did
too.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just recently just realized why I was
getting hemmed up so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's, you know, just being
connected to these hashtags and these
[SPEAKER_09]: algorithms that, that blocked me out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so recently I'm just kind of going
back, scrubbing everything and just trying
[SPEAKER_09]: to paper it up nicely.
[SPEAKER_09]: As I go forward, soft Disney style,
sell some t-shirts, bring light to the
[SPEAKER_09]: brand.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then hopefully I can sell the glass on
the back end.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Sarah, 420sciences, what are you guys
doing these days to, to make sure you're
[SPEAKER_07]: staying compliant, to make sure that,
you know, you're putting out really cool
[SPEAKER_07]: art that the people are seeing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what is the, like when you guys
internally sit around and try to figure
[SPEAKER_07]: out how to grow the business, you know,
what do you think about as far as all
[SPEAKER_07]: these different concerns?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what do you think about as far as
how to generate new interest in just glass
[SPEAKER_07]: in general?
[SPEAKER_04]: Geez, that's a big question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we still keep it super clean,
very safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like as Jason was talking about,
it's, I try to learn from all of those
[SPEAKER_04]: that came before me and understand what,
what we're doing still does skirt a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: laws, even though it might feel safe most
of the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're, you know, we're always looking over
our shoulder, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are we doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we got kicked off Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: We, yeah, right now we're totally
de-platformed almost.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got deleted from YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got kicked off Instagram over and over
and over.
[SPEAKER_09]: Screw up your hashtags.
[SPEAKER_09]: Screw up your hashtags.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember what I'm telling you right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something that I've just learned.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, we love partnering with artists
on branded merchandise, paying them a
[SPEAKER_04]: royalty and bringing them into like this,
into a new market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like doing collaborations with the
rolling trays and stash jars and grinders
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's been one of my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of Gary's favorite things is,
you know, making friends with these guys
[SPEAKER_04]: and making money together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if that answers your
question, but yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really helpful.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, let's talk about,
you know, between all this stuff about the
[SPEAKER_07]: art these days, and obviously,
you know, the industry is still massive.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I say the industry, I mean the glass
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember the one year that the
hydroponics industry and Champs actually
[SPEAKER_07]: had a show at the same time in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_07]: We ended up just dropping the curtain and
sort of sharing the sharing the space.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was in 2009.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was such a fun weekend where it was
like two different parts of the industry
[SPEAKER_07]: that were facing some of the same
challenges.
[SPEAKER_07]: It all came together.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, from the artistic side,
like I don't get to see nearly as much as
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, previously.
[SPEAKER_07]: But who out there is just crushing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like who's putting out like the best head
pieces?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like who's putting out stuff when you guys
see it and you go to shows or you're
[SPEAKER_07]: subjecting to friends that are blowers?
[SPEAKER_07]: Who are you looking at right now?
[SPEAKER_07]: And just going like that guy's just
burning.
[SPEAKER_07]: That guy was putting out just straight
fire.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking at Tammy Baller.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking at Haki Saki.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking at Lace Face.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking at Usheen.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking at Puntington.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the Gs in the industry that are
pushing the artwork to a next level.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of young kids out there for
sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, these guys have spent their
life now putting this thing together.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, they're creating some
really interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got Earl Jr. down in Texas.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got Salt.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, some of the bigger, you know,
bigger names that are the game changers.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, Dina, Winstar Glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, this chick is awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, these guys are creating
really, you know, monumental masterpieces
[SPEAKER_09]: out of play.
[SPEAKER_04]: Northern Waters, I love their stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like in my collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like a husband and wife duo up in
Portland.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Portland, like, is the Oregon area
still kind of driving the glass industry
[SPEAKER_07]: or is that largely just, you know,
dropped off and gone all over the country
[SPEAKER_07]: at this point?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, for the early days, it's pretty
much all about, you know, from Portland
[SPEAKER_07]: down to Eugene, just south of there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all the people I saw that were coming
up in the early days, it was either from
[SPEAKER_07]: Northern California to maybe like Portland
in general.
[SPEAKER_07]: But where are the hotspots now?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd say Philly and Denver.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, the Dream Labs and
Evergreen and, you know, and the Philly
[SPEAKER_03]: contingent are just, I mean, these guys,
I just... Crushed more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just, yeah, these guys are
just unreal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Elbow, Joe P., Nate Myers, those guys,
you know, Snick, Jop, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're just still on top of their game,
you know, and kind of like reinventing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like, I just appreciate these guys
that are having to, like, just learn how
[SPEAKER_03]: to promote.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for the first time, like,
glassblowers like Jason are learning how
[SPEAKER_03]: to do a lot more self-promotion in a world
that's changed from, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: just peddling over to the head shop,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think there's some guys in Japan,
too, that are really kind of game
[SPEAKER_09]: changers.
[SPEAKER_09]: They put a lot of different eyes on what
we're doing and kind of created a whole
[SPEAKER_09]: new little world out of, you know,
this pointillism stuff that they do.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it just takes weeks to make a little
pendant or something, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: and they put all this time in.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's kind of that whisker and,
you know, painting with the whisker in the
[SPEAKER_09]: glass jar kind of a thing, you know,
where they have to think it out and take
[SPEAKER_09]: this meticulous process-oriented steps.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they really did some cool stuff with
the flameworking movement.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also always go back to Bob.
[SPEAKER_09]: Bob's still, you know, one of the most
imaginative people in the space.
[SPEAKER_09]: And anybody, whether it's Elbow or,
you know, Slinger or anybody that's around
[SPEAKER_09]: him, picks that up and kind of energizes
off that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, you have to always watch
what Bob and Bob's team's doing,
[SPEAKER_09]: the Camerons, the Steve Stott's and the
different guys in that whole crew.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's just some really, really
imaginative stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the end, for me, it's changing
color the more you smoke it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, a lot of these guys that
are going now, you know, have a little bit
[SPEAKER_09]: different view and different sight on it
so that everybody's, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: unique take on it, you know, combined make
this whole movement happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really, really cool to watch.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's the hot thing now?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like, I remember there have been
different periods where, like,
[SPEAKER_07]: underwaters are really hot for a while
and, like, all sorts of, like,
[SPEAKER_07]: different, like, you know, like,
people were adding in, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: different metals for a long time that
other people weren't using.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, right now,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm about to tell you something,
Dave.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to give it up right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the hottest, newest, most fucking epic
shit going on is out of Germany.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a guy named Hans Idig, Glasshouse
Fairtime.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm watching him on Torch Talk.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can see he's created something in
this porous silicate that's never,
[SPEAKER_09]: ever been done before.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's selling it to us.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a technique.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a groundbreaking thing where we can
put full photos inside of the glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's in the porous silicate glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been able to do it with soft glass
in the past, but not with porous silicate.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he's created a powder technique that
he's put the powders on the papers,
[SPEAKER_09]: and we can apply it onto the glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the technique that I'm using
now for the whole new, I'm doing all the
[SPEAKER_09]: new Tommy Chong bongs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we have a whole program coming out
with this photo realism stuff on the
[SPEAKER_09]: glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's super cool, super fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, it's Hans Idig, I-T-T-I-G.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's Glasshouse Fairtime,
W-E-R-T-H-E-I-M.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's all over Torch Talk showing off
this new tech.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm even hearing people are calling
him like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you doing this?
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's just one of those cool new news
things that is going on, and it's fun to
[SPEAKER_09]: watch.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Dave, are you still collecting other
people's pieces?
[SPEAKER_07]: I know this past summer, you and I were
talking about the gold snodgrass stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I sent you a picture of a little
hammer that I had.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually just tracked down where my
old shirt was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is a Cameron Sherlock with Bob
Badger marbles on it, which is still one
[SPEAKER_07]: of the sickest pieces I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_07]: But are you still collecting yourself?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, do you still look at other
people's stuff and go, hey, I definitely
[SPEAKER_07]: need to get my hands on that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Sarah, are you collecting other
people's stuff?
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you guys think about the industry?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, for me, I definitely think to your
aftermarket discussion earlier,
[SPEAKER_07]: there's definitely going to be pieces of
art that 20 years, 30 years from now,
[SPEAKER_07]: people are going to look back on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those things are absolutely priceless,
especially because, as Jason alluded to
[SPEAKER_07]: earlier, so many of the best pieces out
there in this world have gotten broken in
[SPEAKER_07]: the last 30 years that it's tragic that
some of the best ones out there just are
[SPEAKER_07]: gone forever.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what are you guys thinking about as far
as collecting?
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of good bonds go to heaven.
[SPEAKER_07]: No doubt, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_07]: But how do you guys think about the
collecting game?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is that something that you don't even
think about and you just think the next
[SPEAKER_07]: amazing piece will be created next month?
[SPEAKER_07]: So what do I worry about?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or are you actually out there actively
collecting pieces?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I always actively collect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one hitter is changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I changed my whole business back in 2007.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was underwater with the Gravitrons,
about to shut the whole thing down,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then started making tasters and turned
everything around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so my mantra for the last 10 years has
been to try to get a oney from everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: that I can possibly, from every artist
that I have ever admired.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Jason, passing this to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my mission.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, right now, being in Vegas,
what you want to do is you want to have a
[SPEAKER_09]: $20,000 dab rig that matches your shoes
and your sunglasses that day.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you want to have a nice fat Louis
Vuitton bag for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what's going on with the whole
collector world right now is they go out
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's an expression of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: If they roll in with their ducky,
I mean, you look at this guy like,
[SPEAKER_09]: oh, look, he's got the rubber ducky and
the good concentrates.
[SPEAKER_09]: It shows kind of them who they are.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the collector base.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have the cool shoes that match it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have, you know, it's like a whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's kind of what I see as the
collector thing right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what's hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: My personal collection, I just have pieces
that I love when I see them, I buy them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the only real, like, heady pieces
I have are maybe not even really that
[SPEAKER_04]: heady.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I have a Jag, that UFO spaceship
thing we bought back in, like,
[SPEAKER_04]: 2012.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have an early, like, J-Mass piece that I
really loved when I saw a couple down neck
[SPEAKER_04]: pieces.
[SPEAKER_04]: But nothing like, I wouldn't consider
myself a collector.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would consider, like, I buy beautiful
pieces when I see them and I can afford
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Sarah's collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually want to hear Rob answer this,
his own question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and I have that Carmen Loeser bonk.
[SPEAKER_04]: What did that piece that has a Carmen
Loeser, like, head in it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then she clabbed with that other guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my favorite piece that I keep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gary is, oh, Jeff Heath.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a Bob Snodgrass dragon steamroller
that's signed from 98 and Bob.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel it's one of the coup d'etat of the
whole fucking glass, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: collectible stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I recommend anybody, when you see the
Bob stuff out, if it's Bob stuff,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, his pieces, you definitely buy
them for your collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: We definitely have a Bob Snodgrass
bubbler, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I keep, I keep one Bob sitting
around.
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have a Dave Willis with the
original dog paw stamp on it, because Dave
[SPEAKER_07]: was, like, the first guy that used to let
me stay at his place in a Petrullia back
[SPEAKER_07]: in the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason, I'm sure you remember that house up
on the bluff overlooking the Matoll River
[SPEAKER_07]: by the mouth of Matoll.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, you know, the first place I
used to go up there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I always keep one of his pieces around.
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep a Bob.
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep, as I said, a Cameron piece that
the bathroom did the marbles on.
[SPEAKER_07]: And believe it or not, for years,
and now I've lost it, but I'm sure I can
[SPEAKER_07]: find who has it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But one of your, one of your original
tubes, Jason, from like 1997, I had for
[SPEAKER_07]: over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's still, it's still around.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it's been broken.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's sitting right now in the
south shore of Boston at a buddy of mine's
[SPEAKER_07]: place.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that was a piece that, you know,
I carried with me absolutely everywhere
[SPEAKER_07]: for 20 plus years and loved it,
still love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will also say.
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like it worked, it inspired you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, super fired up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had that piece and I had another tube
that I used to be able to stick.
[SPEAKER_07]: He stuck into a wood block and turned it
90 degrees and it locked.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that piece was amazing to carry around
as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I used to, whenever I had friends
over, I would always make sure I had two
[SPEAKER_07]: tubes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wouldn't be the person that was
packing bowls and not passing and make
[SPEAKER_07]: sure someone else, you know, to just,
you know, make sure that's cordial,
[SPEAKER_07]: making sure that the other person would
have a pack ripper waiting for them as
[SPEAKER_07]: well at all times.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I usually, I usually would keep your
tube as the one that was mine and pass the
[SPEAKER_07]: other wood block once.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was more of a novelty to the others.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I wish I still had a glass collection.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish that, you know, I wish I had a lot
of the stuff that was offered to me back,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, in the late nineties where a lot
of it wasn't even pipes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a lot of the people coming out of
the snot grass shop that were making
[SPEAKER_07]: really creative things that were,
you know, non pipes that were just great
[SPEAKER_07]: artwork that, you know, starting off with
marbles and starting off with jars and
[SPEAKER_07]: then progressing from there just to
really, really unique stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's part of the magic of the whole
collectability is like the Bitcoin thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you don't want to miss out,
you know, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as I said, you know, I've lost largely
kind of migrated away from being involved
[SPEAKER_07]: in that part of the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that was kind of where I got my
start in the early nineties, as far as,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, bringing stuff out on tour that
you guys are producing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, hey, real quick, I just wanted to let
everyone in the audience know and people
[SPEAKER_07]: are listening on YouTube as well on Future
Canvas Project that our subject tonight
[SPEAKER_07]: is, you know, glass blowing and the glass
just the glass industry in general.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got Dave Daley from Grav and we've
got Jason Harris from Jerome Baker Designs
[SPEAKER_07]: and Sarah Todd from 20 Science.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to open up the room a little
bit to some questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Eric, who is a Massachusetts person,
is up here on stage and has been involved
[SPEAKER_07]: in Massachusetts Canvas for years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Derek, do you have any questions for
anyone on the panel or you just want to
[SPEAKER_07]: say hello?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have a general question for glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if this is the right room for
it, but in Massachusetts, the testing to
[SPEAKER_06]: delays are between like 45 and 50 days and
it's resulting in like a deterioration in
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the quality of the cannabis that
by the time it gets sold on the stores.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I don't think the Mylar
bags are great for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the Chinese glasses like
porous and American glass seems to be too
[SPEAKER_06]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: But do you have any suggestions or
recommendations or anything that we can do
[SPEAKER_06]: to kind of help it besides putting like
nitro in there or something?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done a decent amount of testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why besides putting nitro in there?
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do you not want to put nitro in there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that was just one suggestion that
one person threw out there and I didn't
[SPEAKER_06]: know if that's the only option.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't have anything against it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just wondering if there's any any
recommendations or what people think about
[SPEAKER_06]: this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I would seal it in a porosilicate,
some sort of porosilicate canisters with
[SPEAKER_09]: ground joint lids on them.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, put your nitro in there so it
sits and holds for your time.
[SPEAKER_09]: But maybe maybe putting nitro in might
might be bad for it when you pop it back
[SPEAKER_09]: open for testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do know if you figure it out,
you give me specs on it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me quote your job because I make
everything in glass, including all the
[SPEAKER_09]: biggest rigs in Vegas for oil and all the
you know, they bring all the shit to fix.
[SPEAKER_09]: They want fix for their big oil rigs and I
could do it all.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you just make sure that if you do come
up with some, let me know and let me let
[SPEAKER_09]: me make your sample for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ross, how you doing today?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm good, man.
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_10]: Jason, what's up, man?
[SPEAKER_10]: Ross, what's going on, brother?
[SPEAKER_10]: Good, bro.
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you down in Florida?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm still down here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Still down here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just going to touch Ross is a big
collector, by the way, and Ross had a way
[SPEAKER_09]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_09]: He had some bongs get stolen.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when they got stolen, he was one of
the first guys that I know that got the
[SPEAKER_09]: insurance claim off the thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And since then, we've came up with the
American Glass, you know, Certification
[SPEAKER_09]: Guild.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's online.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's connected to my website.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can now certify your glass and
document it so that if it does get stolen,
[SPEAKER_09]: you can get your insurance claim
processed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's been a very important part of
creating this collectible art glass as an
[SPEAKER_09]: asset in your, you know, whatever
financial portfolio you have as an
[SPEAKER_09]: artistic work.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Jason was instrumental.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I've been a huge collector since
the early days.
[SPEAKER_10]: And back about 13 years ago, most of my
collection was stolen, all, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: original Jerome Baker's Chong bongs.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I reached out to Jason and said,
hey, man, you know, let's let's see if we
[SPEAKER_10]: can do this, you know, file actual police
report and not call it drug paraphernalia,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, or anything they're trying to
label it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's call it art, which it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: And successful in Miami of getting them to
actually accept the police report and then
[SPEAKER_10]: file an insurance claim crazy enough with
USAA.
[SPEAKER_10]: And with Jason's help, we actually got
them to pay out on some stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I've also been what they called
an expert witness in paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've been called in the court a couple
of times now and have to sit up there on
[SPEAKER_09]: the stage and, you know, tell everybody in
the courtroom about, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: paraphernalia and what it is and the value
and what it holds.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's been very, you know, very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing it climb through the ranks as it
has.
[SPEAKER_09]: And like I said, Ross was one of the first
that we got that claim with and really
[SPEAKER_09]: cool, cool fact.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, I wanted to touch base,
you know, kind of on that secondary market
[SPEAKER_10]: you guys are talking about, you know,
there is a big underground collector's
[SPEAKER_10]: market, you know, and, you know,
we don't really have a platform other
[SPEAKER_10]: than, you know, these Facebook groups,
you know, which there's several of,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, Jason created his Jerome Baker
one.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people are coming in and popping,
you know, old pieces in.
[SPEAKER_10]: We see even broken stuff pop off,
which, you know, are salvageable.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there's people out there who are
doing repairs on stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, Jonathan Kilman, you know,
one of the original Chong artists is doing
[SPEAKER_10]: a lot of great repairs on stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've sent him stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's done a great job.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there's the Chong groups,
you know, there's Mac and of course,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, for coins and Millie.
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, we've talked about it a lot
over the years, some me and the other
[SPEAKER_10]: collectors.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where can we actually go and find all
these pieces that people bought,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, in the nineties, the early,
early two thousands, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: before, you know, operation pipe dreams.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where are they now?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, every couple of weeks,
some will pop up in these groups.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, I found this in a closet,
but this isn't a basement, but you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: having a place where we can actually trade
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: All we have right now are these Facebook
groups and yeah, stuff pops up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want you all to definitely check out
agcguild.org.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's agcguild.org.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that has a place that you can document
your pieces and get some sort of,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, like I said, just a fulfillment
of being, you know, the piece that it is
[SPEAKER_09]: because it is breakable and things do
happen and it should be protected in a
[SPEAKER_09]: certain way.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to invite Stefan to speak
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's in this picture right now,
which I'm guessing is probably circa,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, mid to late nineties and another
old dead fan.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Stefan, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, hey Rob, thanks for inviting me up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks all you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: This has been, this has been really great.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's touched on so many cool memories from
the old days.
[SPEAKER_12]: My best friend used to live in Bob and
Marie's backyard there in Glendale,
[SPEAKER_12]: Glenwood.
[SPEAKER_12]: What's it called there?
[SPEAKER_12]: In Oregon, fixing some old bus that we
lived in on tour for a while.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he got me to commission the piece
that's in my picture, which Bob made me in
[SPEAKER_12]: the winter of 89, 90.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think he brought it to me actually at
the start of spring tour in like Atlanta
[SPEAKER_12]: or someplace in 90.
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, this thing was all over tour,
got broken at some point.
[SPEAKER_12]: Bob fixed it even better than it was.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, so many of the things you guys are
talking about and then it was lost for
[SPEAKER_12]: more than 20 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it just recently came back.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember, I remember bringing a piece to
Bob.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was like Jason was referring to.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a steamroller at the time was the
biggest steamroller Bob had ever produced.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was about almost two feet long.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was an absolute monstrosity.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember smuggling it into shows in
Seattle in 1994 and how we got it through
[SPEAKER_07]: security.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got no idea of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we pulled that thing out on the
floor, like literally every single person
[SPEAKER_07]: in like 50 yards is like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I remember when that thing got cracked
and bringing it back and we're like,
[SPEAKER_07]: is there anything that can be done with
this thing?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the fact that you've got one that
actually made it and survived.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking about like how many pipes
got broken in people's laps, getting out
[SPEAKER_07]: of the cars.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just like that being like,
this is like the number one way of like
[SPEAKER_07]: pipes getting destroyed.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's rad that you've got one that's
like survived and battle tested like that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I was so bummed when some random,
I mean, I smoked this thing with hundreds
[SPEAKER_12]: of people on tour and it was just some
random guy.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think he was drunk and broke a leg
off.
[SPEAKER_12]: And man, I was, I was slipping out.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then I talked to Bob and Bob was like,
oh man, all, all, all I need is cash,
[SPEAKER_12]: glass and the gas and I'll fix it right up
for you.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he actually made it better.
[SPEAKER_12]: So wicked cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, to both you and Ross, you know,
the, this, this secondary market concept
[SPEAKER_03]: is, I can't stress the importance of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, the collectors are going
to be the ones that drive the demand and
[SPEAKER_03]: the artists are going to be the ones that
bless it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, if you have, it's those that
have the ear of the artists.
[SPEAKER_03]: That are going to be able to drive that
opportunity the most, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If the artists are willing to put credence
to their work, to, you know, to verify
[SPEAKER_03]: their work and then, you know,
which, which would inevitably give way to
[SPEAKER_03]: a platform that would, you know,
that would support, you know, appraisals
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, and truly secondary sales,
then then you have an immediate platform,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you have to centralize it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you only to centralize it is to get
all the artists to agree, Hey,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is the place where I'm going to sell
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where I'm going to send people.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where I'm going to be verifying my
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the people come out of the
woodwork.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how do you go about getting
certification on things that are probably
[SPEAKER_07]: like 15, 20, 25 years old Dave,
you know, is there an authentication
[SPEAKER_07]: process?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, a lot of the artists like,
like Jason, I got to ask you, like,
[SPEAKER_07]: do you remember every piece you were made?
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to have the artist wasn't too
stoned.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I can tell I've had this
conversation with, with salt multiple
[SPEAKER_03]: times and he promises he remembers every
single product he ever made.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe that, yeah, I know,
I know every piece I've ever made.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know every piece I've ever made,
every piece my team's ever made,
[SPEAKER_09]: every piece with my name on it ever made.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and, and like I said, there's,
there's, I think, I think most of these
[SPEAKER_09]: guys do, especially from the old times,
you're going to be able to tell,
[SPEAKER_09]: especially if you can get the direct,
you know, sign off from the artist,
[SPEAKER_09]: if it's real or not.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, again, you know,
check out what I told you.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a website that we have a website,
a G C dot, G C guild.org.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that, that has that direct connection
to the artists.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also Facebook does as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you get documentation and you connect
with the artists, I mean, I mean nowadays
[SPEAKER_09]: it's kind of like so different because of
the social media.
[SPEAKER_09]: When we started, there was no internet,
you know, and so, so now you can go
[SPEAKER_09]: directly to the artists and avoid the
gallery.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that kind of is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, some artists deal direct
with the public.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some artists, send everything through
stores and galleries and shows.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can connect directly with the
artist.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get a certification from an
artist.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as long as you have documentation like
that, that's the first step.
[SPEAKER_09]: Signatures are great on the pieces.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you see that your favorite glass
maker is coming to town or has a show
[SPEAKER_09]: somewhere, you can go bring your pieces to
them and have them sign it, document that
[SPEAKER_09]: with a picture, and understand that you're
creating legacy with the pieces that you
[SPEAKER_09]: have.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like famous guitars or anything else.
[SPEAKER_09]: It needs to be somehow documented so when
it goes into the pawn shop, you have all
[SPEAKER_09]: this certification, blah, blah,
blah, wrapped around it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's pretty logical.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that should be taken care of.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll say about the memory thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Bob sure as heck remembered this piece
when it reappeared after 20-some years.
[SPEAKER_12]: And he was telling me stuff I didn't even
remember about how he made it and when and
[SPEAKER_12]: everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a snotty?
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, something Bob made for me in the
winter of 89, 90.
[SPEAKER_09]: And everybody who has the Bob pieces must
know.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to know that Bob is getting
channeled.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is from Bob's mouth is that the
pieces that he's making are being
[SPEAKER_09]: channeled through something and this
portal pops them out of his hands.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's your key to the spaceship.
[SPEAKER_09]: When this thing comes down and lands,
you're going to be able to get in with
[SPEAKER_09]: that into the door.
[SPEAKER_09]: So make sure you have your Bob piece on
you at all times.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my favorite part of Bob's story is the
connection to the culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: As someone that was raised by deadheads
that grew up listening to the music and
[SPEAKER_05]: saw the surviving members as much as I
could up until the recent project.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've always connected cannabis and the
Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to learn the backstory of Bob pulling
up to a lot, blowing glass, bringing
[SPEAKER_05]: pieces to sell, it being really the first
resounding artist in the scene and
[SPEAKER_05]: especially in terms of using fume and
really killing it in that regard.
[SPEAKER_05]: And being someone that loves fume artists
myself, people like Macha B and even what
[SPEAKER_05]: Banjo does and all these different dudes
that are just killing it right now,
[SPEAKER_05]: they're all inspired by Bob.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really cool to still have
basically the godfather of the scene
[SPEAKER_05]: that's connected to my favorite band and
the whole world still around creating.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just feel lucky to be around at this
time, basically.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, we are blessed, especially
to know it and acknowledge it and be part
[SPEAKER_09]: of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's changed the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's changed the glass medium.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's such a cool, important part
of legalization of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Bob is the pinnacle of the wizardry of
this whole thing, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I remember going to Barter Fair in
1995 with Bob and getting to spend two
[SPEAKER_07]: days at Barter Fair where Harvest is just
coming down in southern Oregon and
[SPEAKER_07]: northern California and literally just
watching him get absolutely mobbed by
[SPEAKER_07]: everyone that's willing to trade whatever
they just brought down for any pieces that
[SPEAKER_07]: Bob had on hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: And between him and the rest of the shop,
there was probably three or four hundred
[SPEAKER_07]: pieces they brought to Barter Fair.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that used to be such a cool festival.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't call it a festival.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was such a cool gathering of artisans
that would show up there and all the glass
[SPEAKER_07]: blowers getting together right when
Harvest was sitting at the same time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like between that and Country Fair,
I always thought were like the two most
[SPEAKER_07]: fun things in Oregon, specifically because
of all the artisans that would be there
[SPEAKER_07]: and presenting stuff and just kind of the
vibe that was going along with that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So a little magic there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Rose Barter Fair was the best,
bro.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I just want to thank you guys for
having me in the clubhouse tonight.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciate the momentum that
everybody's going at right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I appreciate and honor you guys for
being, you know, doing this, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: especially guys like Dave that have pushed
the envelope to the maximum thing right
[SPEAKER_09]: now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I appreciate being a part of
your guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to have to sign off to cook
dinner for the kids.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all starting to scream right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Jason, one final question before we
let you go, though.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's next for JVD?
[SPEAKER_07]: What should we expect to see?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'll let you sign off with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: So right now, like I said, I'm doing the
new Tommy Chong bong and we're working
[SPEAKER_09]: hand in hand with Tommy and his family on
like daily right now in a design stage.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's about to drop.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to do a soft launch on on
April 20th and then we're going to kind of
[SPEAKER_09]: build it out from there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And just in terms of Jerome Baker,
I'm just kind of slow and steady.
[SPEAKER_09]: I only have my small family crew in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm making my product in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody's welcome to stop by.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can hit me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: Message me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I run the Insta so you can say,
hey, I'm coming on this day.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, the Jerome Baker thing is
where it's at, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jerome, I know I named it after Jerry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jerome is Jerry Garcia and Baker is
getting baked.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I have, you know, a really big play
that I'm working on to try to try to shine
[SPEAKER_09]: for some grateful dead people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, we're all there,
man.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're all just we're all there because
we're not all there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And and, you know, I welcome all you guys
to stop by and visit me.
[SPEAKER_09]: And kind of get eyes on the prize right
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_09]: You can follow me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jerome underscore Baker.
[SPEAKER_09]: Kind of put my daily life on there and
just show what's going on in the glass and
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen, man, so much respect.
[SPEAKER_07]: So much thanks for having you come up
tonight and taking part of your Sunday
[SPEAKER_07]: with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: But amazing work for the last 20,
almost 30 years now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so thank you so much for everything
you've done for all of us.
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything I could do for you in the future,
just keep me tuned in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Sarah, for inviting me in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate you guys reaching out to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Jason.
[SPEAKER_09]: Big respect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Dave, what's going on next for Grav?
[SPEAKER_07]: Aloha.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's next for what's next for Grav,
man, which we expect to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you've got a lot of cool stuff
kicking around.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, what can you share?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking about throwing the whole
catalog in the garbage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Classic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grav is my entire singular focus,
as Rob and I have discussed recently,
[SPEAKER_03]: is on single use cannabis consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're really focused on our glass joint
project in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start rolling that out to
the rest of the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really exciting work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a perfect product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not the first to admit that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm really bullish on single use
cannabis consumption, specifically in
[SPEAKER_03]: glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that, you know, Grav has the
right to win in that category.
[SPEAKER_03]: So laser focused there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Second is, you know, just literally
throwing half the catalog in trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's, you know, old.
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs a lot of refreshing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we are in the trenches of working
out what makes sense and what doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I think it's going to make
that difference in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis is moving fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there's a lot of,
you know, it's going to continue to move
[SPEAKER_03]: faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and I think that there's
going to be massive movement on a federal
[SPEAKER_03]: level in the next year, if not several
years, which is just going to push.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to push hedge hops into a weird
place, potentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, I just, I think about
that a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think about where the glass game is
gonna go, all of these artists that are
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of in the middle tier that are not,
you know, Jason Harris, Jerome Baker,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not salt, you know, that's gonna
be really tough.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be tough to survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, what's nice for Grav,
I think that we just, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: look, I'm gonna do the same thing I've
been doing for the last 17 years and keep
[SPEAKER_03]: my head down and keep, you know,
every turn, I think that there's not
[SPEAKER_03]: something, you know, I'm gonna get bored
and I just don't.
[SPEAKER_07]: So before I invite Megan or Adam to speak
here in just a second, you want to plug
[SPEAKER_07]: what you're doing with your glass joints
as well, because it's such a novel concept
[SPEAKER_07]: and there's very few people out there that
are really doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've done a really nice launch of
the California market.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to talk about what you're doing
with glass joints and single serving
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for those of you that don't know what a
glass joint is, it's because we made up
[SPEAKER_03]: the term, it doesn't actually exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a iteration of the glass blunt,
which is a slider, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: effectively a tube that is loaded with
flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then another tube that slides into the
interior of that tube that has this
[SPEAKER_03]: restriction in it that prevents the flour
from sucking into your mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you smoke it, not dissimilar to a
real joint, but as you light it and you
[SPEAKER_03]: burn it down, you push the ash out with
the tube that's on the inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a push pop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly like a push pop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, if you smoke it the right
way, you get a really even cherry that
[SPEAKER_03]: stays lit the whole time.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you're pushing out the ash,
you can try to suck it all down.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you end up losing the cherry and
it's a less than ideal experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it takes a little bit of tweaking and
it's more of a middle tier smoker from an
[SPEAKER_03]: experience level to really get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, and that's what we're
seeing in market in California is that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's getting adopted and
sticking with about 20% of the people to
[SPEAKER_03]: try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we're losing a lot of people
that just want to refill it because the
[SPEAKER_03]: biggest heavy lifting that we have to do
is convince people to throw away their
[SPEAKER_03]: glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I'm the kind of the Jerome
Baker, Jason's antithesis of what he's
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wants to make art that lives forever
and I'm trying to make sure that people
[SPEAKER_03]: throw away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't, and I think that there's
always going to be a place for the,
[SPEAKER_03]: for the high end.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that, you know, that the
artistic side of it is as important or
[SPEAKER_03]: more than, you know, the throw away shit
that I'm trying to pull off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, to be clear for everybody in
the room, you know, this is in support of
[SPEAKER_03]: not in, you know, not in combat of the art
market.
[SPEAKER_07]: Megan, how you doing tonight?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Rob, this is Megan speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me up as a speaker.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything you want to ask Dave or Sarah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't have any questions at this
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to say hi to Jason before he
hopped off because we've connected at a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of events in Hawaii, but I'm here
to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love glass and I love art, so I'm
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for hosting.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know he was trying to duck out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw you raising your hand right as he
said he was going to leave.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I saw your hand and Adam pop up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm guessing Adam might have the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to say hi to Jason before he
bounced.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, anything you want to contribute,
please jump back in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Adam, how you doing tonight?
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Rob.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm in California and there's a bit of
snow.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if the satellite's not making it all
the way through, apologies.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not sure if you touched on this,
but just the idea of autographing or a way
[SPEAKER_11]: to sign the pieces.
[SPEAKER_11]: Someone I heard about infrared scanning
and attaching or minting a token
[SPEAKER_11]: associated with that in a way that the art
piece is both authenticated, but if there
[SPEAKER_11]: is an increase in value of the token or
the piece or any transfers, there's a way
[SPEAKER_11]: to pay royalties to both the artist and
possibly the initial investor.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just wanted to offer that as an idea
and just pay love and respect for all the
[SPEAKER_11]: builders of these sacred pipes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sarah, are you hearing anything about
that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you hearing about the digital
authentication or any sort of infrared
[SPEAKER_07]: authentication?
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you seeing right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't, but that is a great idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like NFTs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking the same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds perfect for NFT.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's crazy that the people are
thinking about that, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm surprised it hasn't been done already
to create some sort of authentication.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, there are certain artists that
obviously had their own very unique mark
[SPEAKER_07]: that you could always tell whose piece it
was based on just a certain thing they
[SPEAKER_07]: did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone that looked at it, they'd say,
oh, that's so-and-so.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just by just kind of knowing what
their style was.
[SPEAKER_07]: But actually truly authenticating it,
I think, would be really interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they could find a way to
do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: To Dave and Sarah, a question for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: On the side of the nexus between the
industry, especially the artisans on the
[SPEAKER_07]: extract side, obviously the whole game
with dab rigs changed so completely once
[SPEAKER_07]: dabbing came out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there people that you guys work with
or that help you think about what you want
[SPEAKER_07]: to do next simply because of what they're
coming out with back when for shatter and
[SPEAKER_07]: butter and wax and diamonds first hit the
market?
[SPEAKER_07]: It completely changed the game about how
people were thinking about what they
[SPEAKER_07]: needed, whether it was, at the time,
titanium nails or crystal and other
[SPEAKER_07]: mediums to start consuming.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think there's a real closeness
between the real artisans on the
[SPEAKER_07]: extraction side and the glass people
themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you guys look at that game?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah, do you want to take that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have to say hi, Adam.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just realized who you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I met you back at the Emerald Cup a couple
of years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so happy to see you here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so distracted.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought some stuff from him.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just realizing who you were and that
was so awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: Was it Gary?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: We were having a little snack.
[SPEAKER_11]: We shared a little bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember that very well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was very cool meeting you both.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Nice to meet you again here in this
digital space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ditto.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to totally sidetrack that
conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just looked at his profile and I was
like, oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that guy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been learning so much from these
younger artists who are minting coin and
[SPEAKER_11]: building things in three-dimensional
space, which the art is almost a
[SPEAKER_11]: representation of the value that someone's
trying to put on or transfer or pay
[SPEAKER_11]: respect to the artist.
[SPEAKER_11]: The art is almost secondary, but I like
how it applies to physical art,
[SPEAKER_11]: one of one creations.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just what I've picked up is you can mint a
token or two tokens, one for the artist,
[SPEAKER_11]: one for the buyer.
[SPEAKER_11]: Even just the tokens themselves can
increase in value with no transfer of the
[SPEAKER_11]: physical tool.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think it's so neat and you guys are
very cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's apps that trigger the iPhone to do
infrared three-dimensional scans.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's radars in the name, but anyway,
I think these things are becoming
[SPEAKER_11]: accessible.
[SPEAKER_11]: The artists can maintain their earn more.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know what it is, but it seems cool
and I'm done.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was so cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for the support at the Cup and that
was very fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sarah, Dave and Jason before they left,
what's next for 4.20 science?
[SPEAKER_07]: What should we expect to see and what do
you have on deck?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really just the last thing that Dave said.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to be boring, but we're just going
to keep building what we have and double
[SPEAKER_04]: down on what is working and be thankful
for everything that we have and that we
[SPEAKER_04]: continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah is being very modest for the
audience that 4.20 science has become by
[SPEAKER_03]: far the biggest head shop that's ever
existed by my calculations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a bold statement to say that 4.20
science is now literally the biggest head
[SPEAKER_03]: shop that's ever been in the history of
the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have been able to overcome a lot of
challenges that others were not able to by
[SPEAKER_04]: very, very thin hair.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I have amazing partners and we have
an incredible team.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you deserve it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Spencer, first of all, let me compliment
you on having a great picture in your
[SPEAKER_07]: profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love seeing bright, white, furry roots
like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So whatever you're doing, keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what's going on tonight?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if Spencer can hear us,
but if you can, Spencer, you're on.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have any questions for Dave or for
Sarah before we wrap this one up.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if Spencer can hear us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter, you've been in the audience from
Future Canvas Project here for a little
[SPEAKER_07]: bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything that you want to say?
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that you cover all sorts of
different parts of the industry,
[SPEAKER_07]: so I don't know if you have any questions
on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just quickly, let's talk China and
disruption.
[SPEAKER_02]: I view the market as your generic pieces
that used to be made in America are
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously moving to China.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff's moving abroad and the market
for American-made glass is more in the
[SPEAKER_02]: bespoke artist side of the equation.
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I understand, there were glass
artists who went and trained people in
[SPEAKER_02]: China on how to do certain things and
techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you guys just talk about the China
part of the equation?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we could talk for several hours
about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first of all, let's talk about the
last thing you said and dispel the first
[SPEAKER_03]: myth that we go to China and teach them
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is more, how do I say this,
ingenuity in glassblowing in China than
[SPEAKER_03]: any glassblower I've ever seen here,
primarily because what China has done over
[SPEAKER_03]: the past 50 years as Bomex left America.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Chinese glass market got built when
big borosilicate, namely Bomex,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was also ... I'm drawing a blank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Corning as well took a lot of their
manufacturing over to Asia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Built an immense glassblowing industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: The glassblowing industry in China is ...
There's cities the size of Texas that are
[SPEAKER_03]: just glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unreal.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just more access to material and
skilled labor in Asia than there ever will
[SPEAKER_03]: be in the US from a borosilicate
glassblower.
[SPEAKER_03]: From a glassblowing standpoint.
[SPEAKER_03]: The artists that built the pipe industry
are absolutely the pioneers in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the big story here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The talent pool is certainly not here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: The victim of their own making in a way
that everybody wants to be an artist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody wants to be Yuxin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody wants to be Banjo.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no industry in the US,
whether it's even if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: build it in Southern California with an
immigrant workforce, that's impossible
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's failed as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to get to scale as we have,
I didn't go to China to get my products
[SPEAKER_03]: cheaper.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to China because I couldn't make it
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just absolutely could not do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was impossible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to China and made it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have an immense amount of
innovation that happens in the US and
[SPEAKER_03]: 6,000 square feet of glassblowing facility
that is state of the art and incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's just absolutely zero chance
that we could service this industry the
[SPEAKER_03]: way that we do domestically.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will also say we still have very strong
sales with our American glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is absolutely an appetite and
production to fill it here in the US.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the customer preference price.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are so many factors that go into
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I was going to ask you about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sarah, from running a huge head shop,
how much of what you guys have is just
[SPEAKER_07]: production and how much of it is truly
artisan?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you guys look at saying, okay,
50 percent of what we're going to sell is
[SPEAKER_07]: just going to be your standard,
just production pieces, or is it about 75
[SPEAKER_07]: percent?
[SPEAKER_07]: When you go into just trying to think
about what you're going to move every
[SPEAKER_07]: month, what's the ratio and how much of it
do you like to keep as far as the really
[SPEAKER_07]: high-end artisan side of the industry?
[SPEAKER_04]: Up until now, we've had a hard time ever
selling headies.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've tried over and over and our customer
base just doesn't support it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will still try again because we fucking
love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we're buying, what we're looking for
is consistency.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wherever your product is produced,
as long as you can sell me hundreds of
[SPEAKER_04]: those consistently over a year,
that's what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are American shops that can do that
and they kick ass with us and there are
[SPEAKER_04]: people producing overseas that do that and
they kick ass with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're always looking to add American
glass blowers or whoever they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really at the end of the day is up to
what me and Gary like and what we think
[SPEAKER_04]: will sell and what will continue to be
supported by our customers.
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Danish, how are you doing tonight?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Rob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run a distribution company called Medusa
and we actually distribute a lot of Grab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just jumped in on the China topic
because I think ultimately brands matter
[SPEAKER_01]: more than anything else in this space,
just like anything else, just like any
[SPEAKER_01]: other space, I guess I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what Sarah said is exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that Grab has done and we
distribute a fair amount of Grab,
[SPEAKER_01]: that seems really basic, but a lot of the
Americans still haven't caught up to is
[SPEAKER_01]: putting things in a box and putting a
barcode on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't run an operation at our scale
without boxes and barcodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of American glass companies
that try to get distributed through us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing we always ask is where are
you on the time line of putting things in
[SPEAKER_01]: a box and putting a barcode on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be surprised at how many
conversations stop right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of the American glass
people, they don't have scale in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they want to be that big,
which is okay, which is cool, but you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to be a Grab-sized company
unless you think about things like
[SPEAKER_01]: barcodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you think about companies like
Empire that are, I think, blowing a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff in America still, they just can't do
the volume that the market requires.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's more than just the price
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of it is just super basic
stuff that the American companies just
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't gotten around to yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Danish, first of all, thank you so
much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't drill into your profile yet,
but yeah, Medusa is well-known around Grab
[SPEAKER_03]: and we love you guys, so thanks for the
support.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can take it a step further on the box
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: First, you have to be able to make a
simple, repeatable product.
[SPEAKER_03]: To Sarah's point, you have to make it the
same size every time so it fits in the
[SPEAKER_03]: same box every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The conversation stops even before you get
to a box because it's so hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single glass pipe everywhere for
everyone's edification, again,
[SPEAKER_03]: is hand blown, whether it's made by
someone in Austin, Texas or in Tibet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought for some reason maybe my phone
wasn't working, but please go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since the moment that I actually started
making more than just the Gravitron,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh, there's a big problem in
glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to this Champs trade show that
Rob brought up earlier, you go booth by
[SPEAKER_03]: booth by booth and they have 4,000 SKUs
per booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a bong with a tree perc that has
eight arms in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a bong with a tree perc that has 10
arms in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a cost difference and there's a
logo difference and there's a color
[SPEAKER_03]: difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, all of a sudden, in two SKUs,
you have 12 patients and it makes a
[SPEAKER_03]: catalog impossible to build.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm giving away the big secret right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, if you want to build a glass company,
make it simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We say it to people all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to take Grav's business,
but I'm just like, look at Grav.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why aren't you guys doing more of what
they're doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes we'll bring in American glass
brands and we'll have to bring in 100
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces, take professional pictures of them
from every angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a huge onboarding thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they'll just decide to never make the
piece again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, okay, well, how many times are
we going to do this before we just can't
[SPEAKER_01]: take you guys seriously?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the stores that we distribute to,
the shops and the dispensaries that we
[SPEAKER_01]: distribute to, they're like, hey,
are you guys going to always be out of
[SPEAKER_01]: stock of that one piece that sold really
well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have to go up the chain and be
like, hey, are you guys ever going to make
[SPEAKER_01]: the most popular thing you guys ever made
again?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, I'm not sure if we're ever
going to do that one again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just maddening.
[SPEAKER_01]: To a certain extent, what Dave said is
exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have consistency if you want
stores to carry your stuff because they
[SPEAKER_01]: want to reorder the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing of the picture that I'm showing
to everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to take more of those
pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, listen, guys, I want to say thank
you so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, the club that we're on has asked me
anything about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every Sunday night, we try to cover a
different topic.
[SPEAKER_07]: We try to get in depth with people that
really have the best stories to share on
[SPEAKER_07]: that specific topic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next week, it might be soil science.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or it might be back to a nerdy legal
question again on D8 and work in progress
[SPEAKER_07]: hemp oil and what the D8 is trying to do
with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't decided, depending on which
guests I can get for next week,
[SPEAKER_07]: but we'll cover one of those two.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do definitely want to say thank you so
much to Dave Daly from Grav and to Sarah
[SPEAKER_07]: Todd from 420 Sciences and absolutely to
Jason Harris as well who had to jump a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit earlier from Jerome Baker
Designs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say thank you to Peter Cerveri
who, as always, is hosting these as a
[SPEAKER_07]: simulcast on his channel on YouTube called
the Future Cannabis Project.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please check Peter out.
[SPEAKER_07]: What he does, he's got some amazing
content on his YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you to everyone else that
contributed, Stefan and Adam and all the
[SPEAKER_07]: others that came up to speak.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll keep doing this on Sunday nights.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really fun for me to do them.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always great when I've got guests
that really understand what it is that
[SPEAKER_07]: we're talking about far more than I ever
could.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Dave.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Sarah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing having you guys on tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Rob.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone have a great Sunday night and
we'll catch you next Sunday night for
[SPEAKER_07]: asking anything about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a great night.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, y'all.
Bye-bye.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye-bye.
