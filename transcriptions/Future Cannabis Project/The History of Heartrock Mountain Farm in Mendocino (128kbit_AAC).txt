[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm Daniel Morford and this is my
father, Clifford Morford, and we are
[SPEAKER_02]: co-founders of what is now Heart Rock
Mountain Farm, but I guess that was 2016,
[SPEAKER_02]: 2017 when that became official.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're gonna go back, we're gonna go
way back before Heart Rock Mountain Farm,
[SPEAKER_02]: before Dad Homesteaded up there,
and we're gonna be talking about seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're gonna hear my dad's story there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Dad, when did you first encounter
dried flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend had a baggie and he rummaged
through the shake that filled most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bag and pulled a flower out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, oh, okay, that was a good old
Mexican, I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the first time I actually saw a
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was before Brickweed?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Brickweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Brickweed, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that was before Nixon and the
Paraquat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And... 60s.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the 60s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when did you start saving seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the 60s.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first seeds that I found, I saved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when was your first grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: When and where?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about your first grow,
Dan.
[SPEAKER_01]: First grow, that was... Well, it's Castle
Rock State Park in the Santa Cruz
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountains now, but at the time it was a
100 plus year old homestead, a family from
[SPEAKER_01]: Georgia or Mississippi, and the brothers
and sisters
[SPEAKER_01]: planted an orchard and built their homes
and lived there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was hired by the owner as a
caretaker of sorts and put up a small
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse and grew six plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: How old were you?
[SPEAKER_02]: 26.
26.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you didn't really know, it was just
bag seed that you were growing then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how'd you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking to grow my own stash and I
grew an extra pound, half a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a friend of a friend took that to
Missouri, said it was Hawaiian and sold
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: The marketing value.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's traditional market branding right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now that's where we have to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to work on making what we do as
market friendly as Maui Waui and Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was 1976 then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bicentennial year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 200th year anniversary of the
revolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what then brought you to
Mendocino County?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that was like the following year,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cabin code, the United Stand,
United Stand again was really a grassroots
[SPEAKER_01]: organization aimed at legalizing
non-conditioning and informing building
[SPEAKER_01]: methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: The law said you had to have outlets,
specified how many outlets, how far off
[SPEAKER_01]: the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't matter or it didn't matter
if you were gonna have kerosene lights and
[SPEAKER_01]: no electricity in your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still had to wire it like you were
going to have electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for people who are low income people
trying to build shelter and raise a
[SPEAKER_01]: family, that was an unnecessary expense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we fought it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Back to the Landers got people elected
to the Board of Supervisors in Mendocino
[SPEAKER_02]: County to pass the class gay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anon Barish.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was one of the spearheads in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a founder of United Stand again,
or United Stand and United Stand again.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was on a board or commission in
Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, the reason the county got
involved was they needed to prove to the
[SPEAKER_01]: state that there were 5,000 low income
houses in the hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could prove that there was already
low income housing, then the developers
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't have to provide as much low
income housing to go with their upper
[SPEAKER_01]: income housing developments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's get back to the- Yeah,
back to the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's get back to the settling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you came up to Mendocino County to look
for land.
[SPEAKER_02]: Walk us through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was uneventful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The realtors knew what we were up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember one, I think it was in
Boonville, and he pointed to a soils map
[SPEAKER_01]: that he had on the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he pointed out, this land is good for
grass and this land isn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because this was before camp.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was before the campaign against
marijuana propagation.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is when it was not as illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it was still illegal, but it wasn't
enforced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the problem hadn't gotten out of
hand yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you settled in Potter Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what time of year did you get the
deed?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was January.
[SPEAKER_02]: January.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so you had plenty of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, plenty of time for what?
[SPEAKER_01]: To start some seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in timing for the growth season,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at this point in time, you were still-
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Walk us through your first crop and then
the next generations and how you
[SPEAKER_02]: climatized the sativas to the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the bulk of the seeds we got came
from Mexico, shipment of what was called
[SPEAKER_01]: consomia.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were attempting sensomia,
but they had a few problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my friend that was selling this
consomia out of a bag, it was the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: brickweed, let me take a few handfuls to
shake out of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got hundreds or thousands of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the bulk of what I grew was
the Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my mentors had said to water the drip
line, compost on the drip line and water
[SPEAKER_01]: the drip line and you'll grow good plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, take your first male and
pollinate the primary pistols on your
[SPEAKER_01]: females as they come out to signal to the
plant that there are plenty of males
[SPEAKER_01]: around and they can go ahead and be
females.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we took those seeds, which had
the genetics for early and we planted
[SPEAKER_01]: those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that ran contrary to the wisdom of the
day, which said that breed for the traits
[SPEAKER_01]: that you want because early is easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you never get a cultivar that makes
it through then you don't know what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't believe that now looking back,
I think that it was wise to get the early
[SPEAKER_01]: and then pick among all those,
the traits that we wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did that until the early eighties
when we were gifted Colorado number two,
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk one and skunk two and a jet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a program called a 11,
which was a sativa hybrid and the same
[SPEAKER_01]: buyer that took that first half pound from
me took samples of the Colorado number two
[SPEAKER_01]: and the a 11 that we grew, took those back
to the Midwest, came back and told us if
[SPEAKER_01]: this is killer Colorado, then the a 11 is
killer elite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had, I agree, you know, it was three
to five pound plants, skinny leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: small flowers and sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the, uh, the killer Colorado was,
um, was second generation from
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, I don't know if it was
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was from the Hindu Kush region and they
grew the first state side crop in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we got seeds from the second
hence the, and that was the, the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the neighbor who was doing the freelance,
uh, high times photography that brought
[SPEAKER_02]: him back from Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that, that's yeah, that's the one he's
so paranoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't mention his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, please don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that then that's the early
eighties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I come into the scene also early
eighties, 1984, where I'm born.
[SPEAKER_02]: Born at home, uh, up on the mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you, did you come across the
pictures yet with like a mom trim in with
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the kids on her, on, on her lap?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you know, and that's pre digital.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you know, I remember seeing that
photograph, but yeah, it must have been
[SPEAKER_01]: taken by someone else because I was just a
poor dirt farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't afford film the very few
photographs of the day because it was an
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive hobby.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, walk us, walk us through
the, the, the, I guess then when did camp
[SPEAKER_02]: start?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was 82, 83, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's when, when the, uh, the price of
cannabis went up like four or five,
[SPEAKER_02]: six times when the, when they started
eradicating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The price is always, uh, uh, a fluid
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there was always somebody
that was going to get four or $5,000 for a
[SPEAKER_01]: pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there were people who were
getting a thousand for something just as
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just who, you know, and you know,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When did you see your first clone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that not tell it was that tell agent,
my older brother, you know, probably then,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause I just didn't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw some seed starts in Coke cans and
things like that, that people were doing
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors under lights, but it had this odd
taste to it that it just didn't appeal to
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause when, even when I first came into
the garden, which was the early two
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands, we were growing all from seeds
and there was like, you know, my older
[SPEAKER_02]: brother had a handful of clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there was like a Maui,
wowie clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a, you know, I think,
uh, Jack Carrere, a Bubba Kush,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then the blueberry Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so we didn't grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd have never grown a lot of clones,
but it was definitely became a,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, a breeding tool, at least for my older
brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, my dad kind of did his own
breeding projects and agent did his own
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I came into the garden,
um, I started, you know, it was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: just the thing to do was like monkey,
see monkey do like, okay, this is how we
[SPEAKER_02]: say fallen.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we make seeds, you know,
and.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's still kind of that way where we
grow mostly from seeds and, but,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we'll bring in a few clones for
breeding purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember like maybe 2008 and one of my
friends is like, Oh, I can't sell my seed
[SPEAKER_02]: stock anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to grow clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember like, what a mistake that
sounded like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then from the, in the early eighties
to, I guess the late nineties was when
[SPEAKER_02]: agent started helping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you say so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he was, you know, he did start helping
before you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: You took over in 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dad wanted me to go to school to be
more than just an outlaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I wanted you to get a, a degree in
business or jurisprudence and then come
[SPEAKER_01]: back and work for the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is working out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then agent, he, he, he collected seeds
from the neighbors and shared seeds with
[SPEAKER_02]: the, you know, like the ex with,
um, a woman on Greenfield ranch where
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendocino generations was started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then something happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the seeds came back.
[SPEAKER_02]: They came back a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, you know, that's what we
called the Jade, which w which was her
[SPEAKER_02]: name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we, you know, most of our
genetics have that in the, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the lineage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now as I'm starting to get more into
like, uh, line breeding and breeding them
[SPEAKER_02]: into sex of generation, I'm starting to
see like, Oh my gosh, this smells just
[SPEAKER_02]: like what my dad and brother were growing,
uh, 20 years ago.
Um,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then there's stuff that doesn't smell
like, like the blue thunder, which was the
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry Northern lights with the Jade
that has, you know, that's one of our
[SPEAKER_02]: favorites still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the blue thunder, I don't know if
it's, uh, because I know it's roots that
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes it special.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think every time I smoke it,
I think it's special, but it might not be
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be next year, you know,
something else is going to replace it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, just like this blue thunder that
I'm smoking this year replaces,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even remember what was my favorite
last year or the year before, because I
[SPEAKER_01]: have this year's favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I've always done is,
you know, that I didn't worry too much
[SPEAKER_01]: about what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just crossing different things and
looking for something good in the,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't really know any more about
breeding than I knew about growing when I
[SPEAKER_01]: started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a great way to do breeding,
grow what you can smoke and make seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: a branch of seeds on each one,
and then keep the seeds from your,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, your, that's just how a lot of
breeding has been done for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't go wrong there with,
with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what year was it that the sheriff came
on the radio and said, we won't bust
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody who's growing less than 50 plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the early eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I went out and counted and I had 55
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I pulled six of them, which is
different than what's traditional.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were those those six of the early
finisher, the August finishers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have that was a different time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, uh, those hadn't, uh,
popped out because that wasn't something
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, those two foot tall plants weren't
something I was breeding for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I was more looking at the 15 to 20
foot plants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, and then, uh, what medical passed
in California in 96.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when, that's when a lot of
people came out of the shade and into the
[SPEAKER_02]: full sun, but Minnesotan County,
like, you know, that story was from the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the eighties when the sheriff
came on the radio.
[SPEAKER_02]: And said, we're not busting anybody with
less than 50 plants, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there, uh, Minnesotan County has always
been, you know, a safer place to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, until now, we have a different,
uh, power structure, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the shenanigans with electing a sheriff
and having him resign and appointing his
[SPEAKER_01]: choice to replace him, you know,
it just smacks of cronyism and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, interests that are far beyond the pot
patch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so it's definitely been
nice to have the, you know, I remember
[SPEAKER_02]: when I first came into the garden,
I graduated from high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and my older brother told me to go get
my medical card and then ask, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: dad, if I could help grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had migraines, of course,
and went and got my medical card and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, dad, I got my medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I help you in Asia now?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, I got a job to your brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew I was in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, yeah, we were, you know,
back then you could have, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, your medical plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had, you know, my brother and I had our
own little plots and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we, it was, I think that was the first
time my dad and I actually smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: When together, I was, I remember he packed
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was G 13, which Adrian had sourced,
which was like the strongest pot back
[SPEAKER_02]: then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my dad packs up a bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: He passed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's G 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit more potent than a three and
a half percent Mexican stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd gotten up to maybe four or 5% THC
with the, uh, uh, the Hindu Kush genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I guess we'll just, we fast
forward to 2016 when California passed,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw, um, what you could do with a
nursery license.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I called my dad up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, dad, we should go legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we should get a nursery license cause
they're going to let us flower out 5,000
[SPEAKER_02]: square foot of canopy for seed production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been a silver lining.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's been a total, uh, shit show of
rollout of, you know, you'd think
[SPEAKER_02]: California would learn from the mistakes
of the other States.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I see this more as an exit
strategy on the war on drugs and actual
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization, you know, as where you're
seeing like the corporate taker over of
[SPEAKER_02]: another industry, but that hasn't taken
the joy out of making seeds and the,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the passion of, of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And end up growing the plant, you know,
like we're not going to be like the
[SPEAKER_02]: vineyard and the great people when the
payers aren't making money to rip them out
[SPEAKER_02]: and put the vineyards when Chardonnay is
not producing them, rip them out and put
[SPEAKER_02]: Pino, but we might be growing a lot more
food, but we're going to keep making seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: and keep growing craft cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm no, no, I'm, uh, that was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm speechless here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think that was a good sesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got, I got a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so this Jade, I want to, I want to
hear more of like the background of you
[SPEAKER_00]: had the Mexican and then where did it,
where did it go from there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Adrian went to each of the
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right, right now we're the only farm
left.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the only legal farm left.
[SPEAKER_01]: The illegal farms are dropping out,
but at one time, every parcel on that
[SPEAKER_01]: mountain had an illegal patch growing and
Adrian knew a lot of them and he gathered
[SPEAKER_01]: their genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that Mexican, I grew it, my partner
grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The neighbors grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody got some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus everybody, you know, I had some Thai
and Colombian, some of the exotic stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: a few seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That that those were long-term projects in
the day because they weren't acclimated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Colombian stuff was expecting an 11
month growing season and we didn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody worked with their own
programs and Adrian went around and
[SPEAKER_01]: collected seeds from everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He took seeds over to Greenfield and
traded seeds with Jade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he brought some of her seeds home.
[SPEAKER_01]: He left her seeds and he brought some of
the work that she did with our genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: and her genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he got a sample of that and he brought
that back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we just kept hybrid vigorizing our
line and adding new genetics and that
[SPEAKER_01]: vigorizes it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we're, we're still doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I remember when Dan got his
own plot in the garden, it wasn't just
[SPEAKER_01]: helping me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adrian had his own little plot or he had a
row.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that five or six Jacareras.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dan got the plot in front of the
greenhouse and he dug it out, double dug
[SPEAKER_01]: it, dug all the dirt out and he filled it
up with good shit, put the dirt back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one day we, I wasn't there a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's running the show and we walked out of
the greenhouse and we're looking in front
[SPEAKER_01]: and we see this huge red, sweet,
beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's big red thunder.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big red part of what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the heirloom line that created
Blue Thunder.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it all came out of the same breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, but that particular plant was
early and it was special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like 14 feet, like 30 feet around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it had a lot of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember one of the neighbors came up
and saw my little patch and said,
[SPEAKER_02]: beginner's luck, but it wasn't luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, I was under the wing of people
like my dad and older brother that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I just followed directions and
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, by the time the boys were
working in the garden, I pretty much knew
[SPEAKER_01]: what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, you know, it didn't in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll admit that, you know, there were a
lot of people trying to grow weed that
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know, you know, before I moved up
here, a friend of mine called and he said,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've got senesemia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you come over and check it out?
[SPEAKER_01]: He had one marijuana plant in his garden
and it was a beautiful little female.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did have senesemia, but he didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know, you know, at that point
we're, we're 10 years from 1966.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people ask, well, how old were
you when you first smoked marijuana?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, it's not how old were you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was when it was 1966.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when it became available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by 72, they were spraying paraquat on
it in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: They forced us to grow it because no,
you know, I remember waiting for a friend
[SPEAKER_01]: to get his shipment and, uh, it came
packed in dog shit so they could get it
[SPEAKER_01]: across the border.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're spraying paraquat on it in the
fields and packing it in dog shit and they
[SPEAKER_01]: want us to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paraquat is like a odorless pesticide,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's odorless,
but from the United States air force was
[SPEAKER_02]: spraying pesticides on.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the air force.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was the government,
our government was sponsoring it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't happen without Nixon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that, is that John prime, the free
Mexican air force that's flying tonight?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, uh, I know who that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that isn't prime.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, oh, the aging memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peter Rowan, Peter Rowan, Panama,
red, uh, free Mexican air force.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the, yeah, that's like,
that's, that's the history of,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the kind of little backstory and
genetics of, I can do, I can do a little,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, step backwards before that bag came
across the border.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same guy that let me pick the seeds
out of his bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along with his brother were running loads
of Mexican, uh, up to Santa Cruz for,
[SPEAKER_01]: for some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before the war on drugs started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when the war on drugs started,
they started spraying the fields and they,
[SPEAKER_01]: the federalities had go over hill and Dale
with machetes arm lengths apart or within
[SPEAKER_01]: sight, hacking the marijuana down as they
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: They ran out of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these guys, these gathered up seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I had seeds, but I didn't know them
then, but they, everybody collect,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a lot of people collected seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they gathered up all these seeds,
the Mexican Panamanian, holy weed from big
[SPEAKER_01]: sir, wherever the seeds came from,
they took them all down to Mexico so they
[SPEAKER_01]: could plant their crop and they were
teaching them about sense of Mia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how they ended up with the cons
of Mia.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what, what year do you think that
was that the seeds from went back to
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexico?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they had eradicated so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, mid seventies, seventies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Early to mid seventies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure that, you know, my dad and
his friends weren't the only people that
[SPEAKER_02]: were for sending seeds to Mexico then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the seeds that we got, out of that bag
were already upgraded a bit from,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, generally just from all the,
the non Mexican influences in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it had already been back and forth
once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I'm Danny Morford.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my father, Clifford Morford.
